A BMW and an Audi parked on the driveway as well as a van inside the garage were also damaged. Three people were asleep inside the house at the time but were miraculously unharmed despite the severity of the crash. Richardson was taken to James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he was admitted in a critical condition. The University of East Anglia graduate was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, where he stayed for several weeks before being allowed home.

Despite allegations that he murdered someone, the National Football League's Player Association - the union that represents NFL players - is attempting to recover bonus money the New England Patriots owes the former tight end, as he sits in jail awaiting trial. Hernandez was released by the Patriots in June after he was arrested for the alleged murder of semi-pro football player Odin Loyd. The NFLPA says the Patriots owe the former University of Florida star the $82,000 bonus he was promised for showing up to off-season workouts. The union makes it fairly clear that the grievance it filed is procedural, and they would do it for any player - regardless of whether they've been charged with murder. Charged: Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez is currently in jail awaiting trial on charges that he murdered a semi-pro football player . Odin Lloyd, 27, was shot five times less than a mile from Hernandez's home . 'On behalf of all players, it is our responsibility to protect the rights in the collective bargaining agreement,' the NFLPA said in a written statement. 'We are not tone-deaf to what the allegations are in this case, but for the benefit of all players, there are important precedents here we must protect.' Deadspin reports that the case will go before an independent arbiter in coming weeks. Police currently are investigating whether Hernandez killed Lloyd . because he knew about a double murder the disgraced New England Patriots . player is suspected of committing. Hernandez . is currently awaiting trial, charged with killing Lloyd in an . industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, . on June 18. Numerous . reports indicate that police now suspect Hernandez could also be . responsible for the deaths of two immigrants from Cape Verde in Boston . in July 2012. He has not been charged in that case. The Boston Globe reported earlier this month that a police source said Lloyd could have been killed because he had knowledge of the double-slaying. Prosecutors have not commented publicly on the motive behind the murder of Lloyd, a 27-year-old player for the semi-professional Boston Bandits. Previous reports from Boston TV stations have quoted law enforcement sources as saying that Lloyd was killed for 'talking to the wrong people' while he was out with Hernandez at a club the night prior to his death. Hernandez, 23, has pleaded not guilty and professed his innocence from his jail cell. He has hired a high-powered defense lawyer to fight the charges. Last year, the New England Patriots signed the tight end to a four-year, $40million contract. When he was charged, the team dropped him. Within a week of Hernandez's arrest in Odin's shooting, reports began to emerge that police were also investigating his involvement in the 2012 double-murder. Court records revealed that an SUV registered to Hernandez, which police believe was seen fleeing the scene of the shooting, was recovered at Hernandez's uncle's house in Bristol, Connecticut. According to Boston police, Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, were shot outside a Boston club when a passing SUV fired several shots into their car. The club shooting case is now in front of a grand jury, which will determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges. An SUV registered to to Hernandez was seized by police investigating a 2012 double murder. It was found at the football player's uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut . The Globe report provides a detailed view of Hernandez's ties to his hometown of Bristol and other allegations leading up to his arrest for murder. The newspaper suggests that Hernandez was largely on the straight and narrow - finished high school at age 17 and an honor student before moving on to the University of Florida - before the death of his father. Dennis Hernandez loomed huge in the life of his son Aaron and ensured his nose stayed in the books and his feet stayed on the field and off the street. When Mr Hernandez died during routine surgery in 2006, Hernandez went into free fall. The Globe claims that it was then that Hernandez began using drugs and surrounding himself with rough characters from Bristol, including ex-cons.","Aaron Hernandez, 23, charged with murdering Odin Lloyd on June 18 .

"By . Jill Foster . PUBLISHED: . 05:11 EST, 29 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:33 EST, 29 August 2013 . Kelly McManus is describing the 'hell' she endured before she had her controversial £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS when her mobile phone rings. No regrets: Kelly says her NHS tummy tuck, which took her down a dress size, has made her confident . It’s a radio station wanting to interview the 27-year-old single mum-of-three about the operation. Would she be free for a chat on air tonight? 'You’ll have to speak to my agent,' says the part-time beauty consultant, reeling off the contact details before hanging up and rolling her eyes in mock indignation. 'It’s all gone a bit mad,' she giggles. The thousands on waiting lists for life-saving NHS treatment will certainly agree. The taxpayer, too, may wonder who in their right mind would sanction a wannabe actress having a state-funded operation because a saggy stomach was affecting her chances of stardom. Kelly, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, is unrepentant. The slim brunette, who wants to be the next Julia Roberts, says she needed the operation because it was affecting her confidence. What’s more, she believes it saved the NHS money because she will not now need treatment for depression. Yes, you heard that right. 'As a long-term patient because I was so depressed, the NHS would have probably ended up spending more money on my medication,' she says. Perhaps the truly depressing aspect of this tale is its familiarity. Kelly’s story closely resembles that of Josie Cunningham, a 23-year-old wannabe model, who had breast enlargement surgery that cost the NHS £4,800. Five months later, she decided she didn’t like her new breasts and wanted them reducing — also at the taxpayers’ expense. With an astonishing lack of self-awareness, Josie has hit out at Kelly for wasting taxpayers’ money, while insisting her own operation was justified. 'I’m not going to apologise,' Kelly says at the three-bedroom home she shares with her children, Shania, six, Teyha, four, and two-year-old Rio. She separated from their father, who she will only name as Ryan, 12 months ago after seven years together. He is helping to look after the children today. 'I don’t make the decisions about who does and does not get surgery — that’s up to the doctors and surgeons. It’s not my fault if people with other conditions aren’t treated properly,' she says. ‘It has been really hard for me. I felt so self-conscious. Friends would ask me to go out and I’d say no because I couldn’t find clothes to fit. I could only get into a size ten [she’s now a size eight]. 'I had no confidence. I didn’t feel comfortable getting undressed in front of Ryan, and I felt too self-conscious to have sex with him. Uncomfortable: Kelly (right) was left embarrassed and unhappy by her size 10 post-baby figure . Controversial: Kelly's decision caused a media furore but she remains unrepentant . 'Other people said my stomach didn’t look too bad, but I thought it looked awful. People asked me how far on I was with my pregnancy when I wasn’t even pregnant. It was embarrassing.' Feeling embarrassed by a post-pregnancy muffin top is something thousands of mothers will relate to, but few will resort to anything as drastic as a tummy tuck. Even then, most would expect to pay for it privately. Kelly says this was never an option. On her £7,000 salary plus child benefits and working tax credits, it would, she says, have 'taken years' to save up. Instead, the NHS stepped in. 'I didn’t even know an op would help me until the doctor referred me to a surgeon,' she says. Kelly’s mother passed away at the age of 52. She claims her council worker father and three brothers and two sisters support her decision to have surgery. 'My family know how badly it affected my confidence,' she says. Kelly left school at 16 with ten GCSEs, but dropped out of college and became a waitress. She gave that up when she got pregnant with her daughter, aged 21. Now, like so many of The X Factor generation who think a large cleavage and flat stomach are the route to success regardless of talent, Kelly has big plans. 'My ambition is to write and perform my own songs,' she says. 'I’d like to be the next Alicia Keys. I did drama and singing at school and won competitions. I auditioned for The X Factor in 2008, but I didn’t get through. 'After I had my children I gave up my dream. Now? I’d like to take acting and singing lessons — I really may be the next Julia Roberts!' Kelly first noticed the changes in  her body after the birth of her first child. 'I knew when I had Shania my body would change, but I didn’t realise how much. 'I remember lying in the bath after I’d had her and my tummy looked lumpy. I thought it would get better with time, but it didn’t. I tried to get rid of it by going to the gym three times a week, but it made no difference.' She says: 'It was only after I’d had Rio that my midwife said my stomach muscles had separated and I might need to see the GP. I had backache because my stomach muscles weren’t supporting me. I visited my GP several times and told him I felt very low. It was affecting my social life, too.' Outrage: Aspiring model Josie Cunningham caused controversy when she had a boob job on the NHS . Looking at pictures of Kelly’s stomach before surgery, it is difficult to see what she is complaining about. Having given birth to twins a year ago, I would be very happy to swap figures. Kelly’s GP referred her to a physiotherapist, who gave her exercises to improve her posture. 'For a while they helped my backache, but when I asked her if they would help pull my muscles back into shape, she said no. I would need surgery for that. 'When I looked in the mirror I just saw a fat belly and loose skin. I wore looser clothing to cover it, but underneath I felt ugly. The doctors referred me to a surgeon, but I didn’t think I’d get it free.' Kelly was sent to the Bradford Royal Infirmary, where it was agreed she would have a tummy tuck on the NHS. A spokesperson for NHS Greater Huddersfield Clinical Commissioning Group said they would not comment on individual cases, adding: 'Decisions to fund treatments are made after extensive inquiries with the patient’s GP and through careful and sympathetic discussion of all the available facts.' 'I was terrified in the weeks leading up to the operation,' says Kelly. 'I wondered what would happen if I didn’t wake up. I didn’t want to leave my children without their mum. 'But then I thought that in the long term the children would benefit because they’d have a much happier mum.' The three-hour operation to remove excess skin from Kelly’s stomach went ahead on July 23, and she says the boost to her confidence was immediate. 'As soon as I got undressed for the first time, I felt so much better about my body,' she says. 'The surgeon, who had made a vertical cut around four inches long up to my belly button, said the operation had gone well. People might wonder why I’m not self-conscious about having a big scar since I was self-conscious about a big tummy, but at least underwear can cover a scar.' Kelly says the operation has 'transformed' her life, and believes nothing stands between her and her new career. She has already made her TV debut. 'I was on the Jeremy Kyle show a few years ago, but I don’t really want to talk about why,' she says. 'I’m going on Daybreak, too — I’d like to do more TV. I’ve not been offered any modelling and I’ve got quite a few tattoos, so I don’t know if that would be possible. But if the chance came along to do something classy — not topless — I’d think about it. 'Celebrities have such glamorous lives. They can buy whatever they want. It can’t be all it’s cracked up to be, though. I’ve only been famous for five minutes and am already getting loads of calls. It’s been a bit of a nightmare.' And the radio interview? 'Don’t know if I can be bothered,' she says. 'I’ve got a party to go to.' And a flat tummy to show off — paid for, dear reader, by you.","Kelly McManus, 27, from Huddersfield, had an NHS tummy tuck .

This crazy komodo dragon does not show a hint of camera shyness as it shows off its dance skills for a lucky photographer. The Rumbaing reptile was spotted in a park near amateur photographer Woe Hendrick Husin's home in Surabaya, Indonesia, while he was out searching for local wildlife. Although the lizard was busy hunting insects, it still had time to stop and perform a quick dance before dashing off into the bushes in search of its next meal. Flexible: This young komodo dragon pulled some unusual poses for a photographer walking past in Indonesia . Woe was not in any danger when the picture was taken as the komodo is only young. It is unlikely that it would ever have come so close had it been an adult. As adults they can reach 10 feet in length and weigh more than 300 pounds, making them the heaviest lizards on Earth. They can eat a remarkable 80 per cent of their body weight in a single feeding. Woe said 'I spotted some movement in the bushes while out looking for wildlife and as I got closer I could see the lizard jumping around trying to catch insects. 'I couldn’t believe the picture when I got home and checked my camera, the picture is hilarious. Limber: The obliging lizard struck a pose before scuttling off to catch insects . 'There was nobody else around when I saw the lizard so I think the performance was especially for me.

Japanese camera maker Fujifilm has unveiled a new camera that prints card-sized photos instantly. Each time a photo is taken, the printout appears from the top of the camera and, like the infamous Polaroid version, will develop and dry as it hits the air. Japanese camera maker Fujifilm has unveiled its Instax mini 90 Neo Classic, pictured, that prints card-sized photos instantly. Official pricing information for the UK hasn't been released but it is expected to cost around £135 with a 10-shot film roll priced at around £4.50 . The Instax mini 90 Neo Classic can shoot multiple exposures and has shutter speeds up to 1/400 of a second meaning it can be used in a range of lighting conditions. Fujifilm announced the camera during an event in Tokyo and it will go on sale in Japan on 23 August before being released globally on September 20. It will cost ¥20,000 in Japan, which converts to around £134, yet official UK prices have not yet been released. A 10-shot roll of film will cost around ¥700, which would be around £4.55. Fujifilm was the first company to . produce film in 1934 and began selling instant cameras during the 1980s . with its F series, including the F-10 and F-50S. The technology was first sold commercially by American Scientist Edwin Land, who co-founded the Polaroid corporation. Speaking . at the event in Tokyo, general manager Fujifilm's photo imaging . products division, Masato Yamamoto told the Wall Street Journal: 'People crave something real, a physical object that is unique and that you can hold in your hand. The camera, pictured being held by users at an event in Tokyo, can shoot multiple exposures and has shutter speeds up to 1/400 of a second meaning it can be used in a range of lighting conditions . 'Film yields an authenticity that is often missing in a digital world.' Photographer . Mikiya Takimoto added that the technology makes people think more about . the photos they're taking and ultimately makes them better . photographers. Fujifilm is hoping the release will restore sales of its instant camera range, which had fallen by 90 per cent in 2002. Instant camera film has the developing process arranged in . chemical layers onto each sheet of film. A chemical reagent made sits in a layer just above the light-sensitive . layers of the film, but below the image layer. Before the picture is taken, the . reagent is collected at the border of the sheet of film. When the pictures is taken, the film is rolled out of the camera and the reagent is spread into the middle of the sheet and pushed between the layers of the film. It then moves downward through the laye­rs, changing the . exposed particles in each layer into metallic silver. The chemicals dissolve the developer dye so it begins to move up towards the image . layer. The metallic silver areas at each layer stick to the dyes and stops them from moving further. This means only the dyes and colours needed to make the picture move through the layers to where they are needed. The colours then mix to create a . translucent green film on the surface of the image. Light reflects off the . white pigment in the reagent and shines through the colour layers. The timing layer slows the reagent down on . its path to the acid layer, to give the film time to develop before it . is exposed to light. The stage where the image develops is the final chemical reaction in which an acid layer clears up the . opacifiers in the reagent so the image is visible.

Her visit resulted in a BBC documentary named Love For Sale which shed light on the lives of the women working in Nevada's brothels, the oldest of which has been in operation since 1902. 'It was very challenging,' says Jane of making the documentary, 'and I joke that I am sure I will end up having some serious therapy sessions about it one day. 'I think [visiting the brothels] makes me realise how lucky I am and that I was dealt a good set of cards at the beginning of my life, which sadly is not the case for everyone. 'It has also made me realise how amazing some of the women I have met inside the brothels are, who were dealt a bad set of cards at the beginning, and turned things around against all the odds.

'I wanted to make them like the muses of Renaissance paintings,' she explains. 'To get the iconic feeling across by using . similar lighting to the Renaissance masters, which I hope will get that point across.'

Friendly shop: At the direction of their manager, she and her fellow employees stuck to a confidence-boosting philosophy with customers, which made her feel better about herself, too . Ms Kirby writes that before working at Lane Bryant, she lacked body confidence and believed she 'hated [her]self too much to sell clothes'.

'The message as soon as you walked through the door was that fat women could also be stylish and sexy, dammit' During the time she was working there in the late Nineties, plus-sized clothing for every occasion was not . readily available, a fact that no doubt contributed to her customers' initial lack of confidence.

After a career spent bringing other people’s stories to life, it is his own story  that is perhaps the most touching of all. Film director Richard Attenborough is as much in love  with his wife Sheila Sim as he was seven decades ago, according to those close to the pair. And the besotted couple, who have neighbouring rooms in a care home, still hold hands every day. Devoted: Lord Richard Attenborough and Lady Sheila Sim pictured in 2008, have been together for 72 years . Lord Attenborough, who celebrates his 90th birthday today,  lives with Lady Attenborough,  91, in a specialist charity care home for elderly or sick entertainers in west London. The director, who won eight Oscars for his 1982 epic Gandhi, has been in a wheelchair since  suffering a stroke five years ago. At a screening of Lord Attenborough’s 1993 movie Shadowlands to commemorate the filmmaker’s landmark birthday, his close friend and former colleague Terence Clegg said: ‘I saw him just on Friday, he’s frail, he’s very quiet now but he’s lovely and he’s in good hands. ‘He’s being well looked after and he just holds Sheila’s hand and they’re as much in love today as they were 72 years ago. I’m happy to say he’s really in good form.’ Back in the days: Young and in love, the couple are pictured in 1952 . Lord Attenborough met his actress wife when they were  students at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in  London and co-starred in a play. They went on to have three children together. Michael, 63, is a  theatre director and Charlotte, 54, became an actress. Their elder daughter, Jane, and her daughter Lucy died in the 2004 South Asian Boxing Day tsunami. During the screening, which took place at the BAFTA headquarters in London, Michael said: ‘My parents met 72 years ago and they’re actually in a home now because they need a lot of nursing care, but they’re in rooms next door to each other. ‘Dad’s on her right hand side and Gerald [Lady Attenborough’s brother] is in a room on her left. So she’s in the middle of her brother and her husband. I think it’s a minor miracle to hold a marriage together for that length of time. ‘They met at RADA, and to hold a marriage together, in our business of all businesses.’ Together forever: Richard and Sheila live in neighboring rooms at a care home for entertainers . Michael, who hosted a party at the weekend to celebrate both  his father’s 90th and his mother’s 91st birthdays, added: ‘It’s horrid to see someone whose life was so much based around activity and around articulacy having lost the capacity to do both. ‘But it was still clear to me yesterday that he knew exactly what was happening and I told him that I was coming here and he was very touched that BAFTA was honouring his 90th birthday in such a way.’ Also at the screening on Tuesday was William Nicholson, who wrote the screenplay for Shadowlands and was behind the film adaptation of Les Miserables. He said: ‘We do live in a world now where a lot of directors seem to think the way to create good film is through fear, through creating an atmosphere of great tension and I have experienced this myself. ‘And I just love it that [Lord Attenborough] made his great films through the opposite method. This is not the Lord Sugar school of filmmaking, and thank God  for that, because what a miserable world it would be if we had  to endure that.’","Lord and Lady Attenborough still in love, seven decades on .

The FBI arrested 37-year-old David Navarro on suspicion of child pornography charges Friday in North Mason County, Washington. The feds learned about the video from authorities in Australia and Denmark who found a video depicting an 8-year-old girl engaging in sexual acts. Arrested: David Navarro, a former PTA president at Belfair Elementary School, was arrested Friday on suspicion of filming child pornography at the school . Because the video was shot on an iPhone they were able to track the video's origin to Belfair Elementary School. The video was made in May and was in wide-circulation by June. The FBI were able to confirm that the videos were uploaded to the internet from Navarro's email. At the time the video was taken, Navarro was PTA president and therefore had a set of the school's keys. Authorities believe the girl in the video may be his step-daughter. Navarro did have a prior record. He was arrested in San Diego in 2009 on allegations that he exposed himself and sexually assaulted three children, but those charges are dropped. All volunteers at Belfair must undergo a background check, but they're not asked about arrests - only crimes 'for which you may have been convicted.' The North Mason School District superintendent released a statement Wednesday, following Navarro's arrest. He said he found it 'alarming and disgusting' that the someone would film something like that in the school. He confirmed that Navarro used to be the president of the school PTA and was a volunteer. 'While we cannot share a great deal of detail, nothing in the investigation indicates that the school should have been aware of or taken action in this case,' superintendent David Peterson said. 'The FBI informed us today that this is not something the school could reasonably have prevented.' The arrest came as quite a surprise to fellow PTA member Gene Johnson. He said he was shocked, and would never have suspected of Navarro engaging in such activities. 'He's a very exuberant guy, always wants to be involved, everything was about the kids,' Johnson told Q13 Fox. Since his arrest, the FBI have confiscated 10 computers from his home, the iPhone they suspect he used to film the video and two pairs of undergarments. Investigation: Federal agents seized 10 computers from Navarro's home in addition to two undergarments and the iPhone they suspect he used to film the video . They also discovered that Navarro's email was tied to an online service where it seems he posted at least 14 photos of two girls, including the 8-year-old in the initial video. Federal agents are also looking into Navarro's social networking websites. His Twitter is still up and shows two pictures of women which he describes as 'creepshots' - taken when they aren't looking. 'Creepshots': On Navarro's Twitter page he posted two pictures of women while they weren't looking. The image on the left seems to originate in the school's library . One of the pictures taken last October seems to be taken in the school library. It shows a female's underwear with the caption: 'School library is great.' Navarro is currently being held at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac, pending a hearing today.","David Navarro, 37, was arrested Friday for allegedly filming child pornography at Belfair Elementary school .

The youngster was co-valedictorian of his senior class and scored a 1770 on his SAT, speaks Mandarin Chinese and played the piano in the Admissions Center, according to the campus newspaper. Though impressive, Huey-You is not the youngest-ever college student. Huey-You is so young that he could not apply online, the software would not accept an applicant born in 2002, TCU360 reported. Genius: Carson Huey-You, 11, who is studying quantum physics at TCU . Enrolled in four classes, the whiz kid commutes to campus with his mother carrying his books as he shuttles from class to class, according to WFAA. ‘It's not like I'm leaving him here to stay in dorms and join a fraternity,’ mother Claretta Huey-You told WFAA. Huey-You is expected to graduate when he’s 16, a full year younger than the previous youngest-ever student at TCU, according to TCU 360.  He enrolled in four classes during his first semester at TCU. ‘‘I’m taking calculus, physics, history and religion. Those are my four classes,’ Huey-You told CBS DFW. The young genius could read by age 1, and was doing pre-algebra by age 5 – he relaxes by doing algebra, according to CBS DFW. Professors are already singing his praises.

Still adjusting to college, Carson Huey-You told TCU 360 that his first week ‘was overwhelming but exciting and fun.’ Perhaps motivated by her son taking on college, Claretta Huey-You plans to return to school to study nursing, she told TCU 360. The 11-year-old’s brother is also gifted and expected to graduate high school when he is 13. If all goes as planned, Carson Huey-You will have his college degree before he has his driver’s license.

A significant number of America’s highest-paid chief executives have found themselves in hot water over the past 20 years, according to a new study. Roughly 40 per cent of CEOs among the 25 highest-paid in the US have been fired, fined or bailed out, according to the report released Wednesday by the Institute for Policy Studies. This finding comes despite their astronomical pay – about 354 times the average – coming with an expectation for sky-high performance. Companies paying a premium for elite . talent often do not realize the return they expect, the report says. In . at least one instance, a CEO ended up with a conviction that would have . led to jail time had he not died before sentencing. Defiant to the end: Former Lehman Brothers Chairman and CEO Richard 'Dick' Fuld testifies to Congress about the firm's collapse . The non-profit analyzed the 25 highest-paid CEOs for the each of the past 20 years and found that almost half of them had paid some sort of price for their poor performance. Of the CEOs on the list, eight per cent were fired, but received ‘golden parachutes’ averaging $48million each upon their exit, according to the report. Of the fined, eight per cent ended up costing their firm’s over $100million in fines each, with one CEO paying fines out of pocket, for stock option back-dating, according to the report. Most scandalously on the list are financial executives, all of whom ‘were forced to receive bailouts for running their companies into the ground,’ according to the report. In fairness, financial industry CEOs didn’t have much of a choice when it came to bailouts received though the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). All large banks received TARP bailouts whether they wanted/need them or not. The most publicized of those was Lehman . CEO Dick Fuld. While Fuld pocketed over $466million in compensation . between 2001 and 2007, according to Reuters, he reportedly contributed to the once prestigious . firm’s spectacular 2008 collapse. Busted: Former Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay was convicted of 10 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, but died of a heart attack before sentencing . Even more notorious is Kenneth Lay. As Enron CEO, Lay saw the firm rise to prominence on the back of predatory energy trading and book cooking the likes of which was unprecedented in American history. While handsomely reaping the benefits of a top 25 CEO, Lay oversaw the greatest corporate bankruptcy in American history, prior to Lehman. Enron’s collapse put thousands out of work, wiped out the pensions of many life-long employees and resulted in a Houston federal jury finding the chief executive guilty in 10 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy. Facing the rest of his life in prison, according to the New York Times, Lay died of a heart attack before his sentencing. The report suggests that reigning in CEO pay is the only answer to this problem. Reforms surrounding the disclosure of CEO to worker pay ratio and pay restrictions on financial firm CEOs specified in Dodd-Frank legislation still not yet implemented three years after President Barack Obama signed the bill into law are suggested. Another suggestion is closing the IRS  loophole that allows companies to deduct executive compensation from payroll taxes, which the report calls a ‘outrageous.’","About 40 percent of American CEOs found themselves in hot water over the past 20 years due to poor performance .

The Palazzo hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip is trying to evict a 10-month-old nightclub for shows it says are so raunchy that they violate obscenity laws. It says actors — some nearly naked — toss condoms into the crowd and simulate sex acts and bestiality on stage. The club is seeking a restraining order to halt the closure, arguing that simulated sex acts don't constitute obscenity. Scroll down for video . Sex Fueled: In this image provided by The Act nightclub, patrons enjoy a perfromance at the club located at the Palazzo hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The Palazzo is trying to terminate their 10-year agreement with the nightclub . Casino officials 'were well aware of our brand,' said Sean Dunn, special events director at The Act, in an email statement, adding that representatives of the hotel-casino have frequently attended shows and did not complain. Las Vegas Sands, which owns the casino, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Act remains open for business while a district judge considers its fate, but the fight over its future has exposed an underlying reality in Vegas: While the city sells itself as a racy, no-holds-barred destination, there are limits. 'I think there's the perception that anything goes in Vegas — there's no boundaries, no lines,' said Lynn Comella, a professor of sexuality and women's studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 'In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.' Unhappy: The Palazzo Resort Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA wants its resident nightclub The Act to close . Raunchy: The Palazzo hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip is trying to evict a 10-month-old nightclub for shows it says are so raunchy that they violate obscenity laws . Hanging in the Balance: The Act remains open for business while a district judge considers its fate . That perception, in part, is fueled by what tourists see. Trucks roll down Las Vegas Boulevard advertising 'hot babes' delivered directly to hotel rooms, the phone book is full of come-ons for escorts and private dancers, and taxis and billboards feature scantily clad women who leave little to the imagination. While Las Vegas is also rife with strip clubs, tourists won't find them along the Strip or in the city's hotel-casinos. They can take in a topless stage show or lounge at a European-style topless pool, but they have to catch a ride to a side street to see strippers. 'The goal for Las Vegas was to be naughty enough to attract you but not naughty enough to repel you,' said Michael Green, a history professor at the College of Southern Nevada. Too Sexy? While Las Vegas is also rife with strip clubs, tourists won't find them along the Strip or in the city's hotel-casinos . The city — which rises and falls on the pocketbooks of its 40 million annual visitors — must balance the sexiness with the sensibilities of foreign tourists and large, multinational casinos. 'It's highly sexualized and gets a lot of mileage out of that, but it's a very particular version of that,' Comella said. In The Act's case, Sands executives notified club officials on April 26 that they'd crossed a line with the show and were no longer welcome in the $15 million space. The casino giant wants to evict it, ending a 10-year lease. The casino notified club officials after undercover security officers went into the venue in March. The details of the show were laid bare this week in court, when an investigator apologized for getting graphic and looked pained while describing some kinky scenes. The club contends Sands 'manufactured this 'breach' in an attempt to improperly evict' it. 'We believe we are on the leading edge of the next evolution of nightlife in Las Vegas and that The Act fills a niche for patrons looking for an alternative to the typical Las Vegas big-box club scene,' Dunn said. The casino notified club officials after undercover security officers went into the venue in March . Those who stray outside the limits of what is considered acceptable in the city risk invoking the wrath of the state's powerful Gaming Control Board and losing their lucrative gambling permits. The board smacked the Planet Hollywood casino with a $750,000 fine in 2009 amid accusations that employees at the independently owned Prive nightclub allowed toplessness, turned a blind eye to prostitution and physically and sexually assaulted patrons. The board isn't investigating The Act and is waiting for the lawsuit to play out, according to chairman A.G. Burnett. Entertainment: The Las Vegas Strip at twilight - most of the largest attractions and hotels are located on the Strip . There's no doubt that Las Vegas markets itself as an adult playground, said Oscar Goodman, the larger-than-life former Las Vegas mayor who's often flanked by scantily clad showgirls, martini in hand.

'Unless the sex goes out of the line, we embrace it.'","The Act nightclub in Las Vegas faces closure for its burlesque nights - which their proprietor claims are too obscene .

America's only black senator was not invited to participate in the historic 50th anniversary of the March on Washington event, it has emerged. Tim Scott, a Republican Representative appointed by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley earlier this year, was noticeably absent from the Let Freedom Ring line-up. Scott was chosen to fill former Senator Jim DeMint's seat in the U.S. Senate after he retired. African-American leaders who did speak at the day commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.'s resounding 'I Have a Dream' included Georgia Democratic Representative John Lewis, who participated in the original March, Martin Luther King III, MSNBC host Al Sharpton and movie stars Jamie Foxx, Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker. Missing: Tim Scott, pictured, a Republican Representative appointed by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley earlier this year, was noticeably absent from the Let Freedom Ring line-up . A spokesman for Scott said: 'The senator believes today is a day to remember the extraordinary accomplishments and sacrifices of Dr King, Congressman John Lewis and an entire generation of black leaders. Today's anniversary should simply serve as an opportunity to reflect upon how their actions moved our country forward in a remarkable way.' Scott was among a parade of current and former elected officials who issued remarks calling for greater racial equality and praising King Jr's., saying he was 'living my mother's American Dream.' USA Today columnist DeWayne Wickham said there was no real reason for Scott to be there in the first place. Speaking on CNN's The Lead he said: 'And he should have been invited why? He should have been invited to speak for what reason? He's one of 50 Senators. And he's appointed not elected.' Others suggested it was a partisan move by the administration. President Barack Obama used the important day to urge America to continue fighting for the equal nation Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned. History: Civil rights leader and Democratic Representative from Georgia John Lewis delivers remarks in front of a freedom bell during the 'Let Freedom Ring' commemoration event on Wednesday . Speaking from beneath the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., the president celebrated how far America has come since Dr King's speech on August 28, 1963, which gave a 'mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions'. But he said there was still much to be done to honor the lives that were lost during the civil rights movement. 'They did not die in vain,' he said to the crowds gathered below. 'Their victory was great. But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.' He added that economic inequality - in which black unemployment is nearly twice that of white unemployment - and a country where many citizens still struggle to afford healthcare 'remains our great unfinished business'. 'When we turn not from each other or on each other but towards one another and we find we do not walk alone - that's where courage comes from,' he said. 'And with that courage we can stand together for good jobs and just wages... for the right to healthcare... for the right of every child to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit and prepares them for the world that awaits them. Family: President Barack Obama, left, greets Martin Luther King III at the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, where the activist son spoke . 'America, I know the road will be long but I know we can get there. We will stumble but I know we'll get back up.' Throughout his speech he mentioned how the nation improved 'because they marched' in 1963, and at the end of his speech he urged people to 'keep marching.' 'No one can match King's brilliance, but the same flame that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains,' he said. 'That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge, she's marching. 'That successful businessman who doesn't have to but pays his workers a fair wage and offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con, who's down on his luck, he's marching. 'The mother who pours her love into her daughter so she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybody's son, she's marching. Taking the stand: Reverend Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, spoke at the Wednesday event but Tim Scott, pictured right on Monday, was noticeably absent . Movie stars: Actors Jamie Foxx, pictured, TV star Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker alsoi spoke to the enormous crowd . 'The father who realizes the most important job he'll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father, especially if he didn't have a father at home, he's marching. 'The battle scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again but to keep serving their country when they come home, they are marching. 'Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day, that change does not come from Washington but to Washington. The change has always been built on our willingness. We, the people, to take on the mantle of citizenship, you are marching.' Obama previously said that half a century after the march was a good time to reflect on how far the country has to go, particularly after the Trayvon Martin shooting trial in Florida. The devastated parents and brother of the slain teen also attended the D.C. event on Wednesday. Although more than 20,000 people are believed to have attended the event, more than 100,000 were expected.

She now needs a life-saving tracheotomy to help her breathe. The procedure will again require general anesthesia. Her . family were told that her heart stopped during the operation and she . was 'effectively' dead when she was transported to hospital. She suffered brain and heart damage during the procedure. Tragic: Linda Perez's son, 3, does not know his mother slipped into a coma after breast implant surgery . 'What they gave me is essentially a vegetable,' her mother Mariela Diaz told NBC 6. Perez was admitted to Mercy Hospital following her procedure and her family's attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, said that finding out what went wrong will require litigation. 'How does an 18-year-old healthy young lady go in to have a simple routine cosmetic procedure and come out in a vegetative state?' he asked as he spoke to NBC 6. Perez paid just $2,800 for the procedure, which is around half of the typical cost of the procedure, according to Eiglarsh.

The attorney added that the Perez family is not looking for a big payoff from the center, but could bring a lawsuit. 'This . is about any person that may see this who may have a procedure tomorrow . and may think, ""I want to pass on this clinic"",' Eiglarsh said. 'Maybe . save up a little bit of money to go with a place that's a little more . reputable.' Perez researched The Coral Gables Cosmetic Center before agreeing to go under the knife.

The government is issuing the regulations needed to allow gay couples married in states that recognize same-sex marriages to file joint federal tax returns. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the new rules would provide 'clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide'. Mr Lew said the regulations also make clear that legally married same-sex couples will be able to move freely throughout the country and their federal tax filing status will not change. Sharing: Same sex couples who marry, like these women in San Francisco, can now file joint returns . Equality: The Treasury has announced measures to allow gay couples to file joint tax returns . The new rules implement the tax aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling in June which invalidated a section of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. The new regulations from the Treasury and IRS implement the court's decision on how legally married same-sex couples should be treated for federal tax purposes. Now, even if a gay couple live in a state that does not recognize gay marriage, they will be recognized under federal law as long as they were married in a state that permits same-sex weddings, according to Business Insider. 'Today’s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,' Mr Lew said. 'This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.' Inequality by those in same-sex relationships has led to some couples taking extreme measures to ensure their loved ones are protected. In June, a Pennsylvania man adopted his partner of 44 years to circumvent high property taxes that would be imposed on either of the men if the other dies. John, 65, and his 75-year-old partner made the decision to become father and son to avoid a 15 per cent tax on any property and assets willed to one if the other should die - a much higher tax than married spouses or family members are required to pay. Pennsylvania only recognizes marriage . as being only between a man and a woman and has no provision for civil . unions at this time. And, in 2011, a Massachusetts city began paying gay employees a stipend to offset an unequal federal tax. The . city of Cambridge made the change when it discovered gay school and . city workers who chose to put their spouses on their employer-provided . health insurance were paying more because of federal government taxes. Movement: A map of the U.S. shows the ruling on same-sex marriages in 2012. Since then, Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island have accepted marriages . As a result, Cambridge began to pay public employees a stipend to defray the cost of the federal tax. The city employees hit by the extra tax paid an additional $1,500 to $3,000 in taxes a year and officials estimated the stipends would cost the city an additional $33,000. 'This is about equality,' Marjorie Decker, a Cambridge city councilor, said at the time.

A former perfume-company advertising director is suing her manager for relentlessly verbally harassing her about her looks and weight - even comparing her to frumpy singer Susan Boyle - which nearly killed her. Laura Ziv claimed her boss at fragrance giant Firmenich, Herve Pierini, constantly berated her and called her a 'fatty' in . front of other employees at the company’s Madison Avenue office. In her $6 million lawsuit against Firmenich and Pierini, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Oxford University graduate said the stressful abuse led her to suffer a near-fatal brain hemorrhage. Furious: Laura Ziv claims her blood pressure skyrocketed after she was bullied at work . Mean: Former perfume-company ad director Laura Ziv is suing her boss her boss Herve Pierini, pictured, for relentlessly harassing her about her looks and weight . The former creative marketing . director claims Pierini targeted her after she refused to build a . competing fragrance brand with him - on company time - in 2010. 'In . January 2010, Pierini taunted Ziv at a party given by an executive of . the [company’s] biggest client at her home by repeatedly referring to . Ziv as ‘Susan Boyle,’ a Scottish singer who is often taunted in the . media as being old, fat and ugly,' the suit stated, according to New York Post. Susan Boyle . became an unlikely international star after performing a beautiful . rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' from 'Les Misérables' on reality TV . show 'Britain's Got Talent' in 2009. Ziv, who joined the company in 2001, said the taunts got worse after the Boyle comparison. 'On one occasion when a fellow employee . did not take the time for lunch, Pierini remarked to Ziv, in the . presence of other employees and for them to hear, ‘Not like you, fatty,’ ' according to legal papers. Despite Pierini’s alleged harassment, Ziv was put in charge of Firmenich’s biggest account - which allegedly only made Pierini more volatile, according to NY Daily News. Laura Ziv was offended when her former manager said she looked like matronly Scottish singer Susan Boyle, pictured, in front of other employees . The married mother of two young children also claimed the constant abuse caused her to suffer a brain hemorrhage in 2011 that doctors attributed to a spike in blood pressure. But when the New Jersey resident returned to work, Pierini allegedly grew more aggressive. 'Pierini intended that his degrading, humiliating and vicious and brutal treatment of Ziv would cause Ziv’s blood pressure to rise to a dangerous level and would thus damage Ziv’s health, perhaps to the degree of causing her death,' the suit contends. Ziv took medical leave in June, after which her lawyer wrote a letter to the CEO of Firmenich, complaining of Pierini’s behavior. Ziv said the company has cut off her salary and medical benefits. According to a profile on the Fashion Institute of Technology website, Pierini joined Firmenich in 1999 as an assistant fragrance development manager in the U.K. before being promoted to senior account manager eight years later. He is a graduate of the Master of Professional Studies program in Cosmetics and Fragrance Marketing and Management and holds a master’s degree in chemistry from the University of Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, France.","Firmenich advertising director Laura Ziv has filed $6 million lawsuit against manager Herve Pierini .

The National Football League has reached a tentative $765 million settlement over concussion-related brain injuries with thousands of retired players, agreeing to compensate victims, pay for medical exams and underwrite research. More than 4,500 former athletes - some suffering from dementia, depression or Alzheimer's that they blamed on blows to the head - had sued the league, accusing it of concealing the dangers of concussions and rushing injured players back onto the field while glorifying and profiting from the kind of bone-jarring hits that make for spectacular highlight-reel footage. The plaintiffs included Hall of Famer . Tony Dorsett, Super Bowl-winning quarterback Jim McMahon and the family . of Pro Bowler Junior Seau, who committed suicide last year. Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett, left, and Super-Bowl winning quarterback Jim McMahon are among the plaintiffs . A federal judge announced the agreement . today after months of court-ordered mediation, just days before the . start of the 2013 season. The NFL has long denied any wrongdoing and insisted that safety has always been a top priority. But the NFL said that Commissioner Roger Goodell told pro football's lawyers to 'do the right thing for the game and the men who played it.' Under the settlement, individual awards would be capped at $5 million for men with Alzheimer's disease; $4 million for those diagnosed after their deaths with a brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy; and $3 million for players with dementia, said lead plaintiffs' lawyer Christopher Seeger. Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody . in Philadelphia announced the proposed agreement and will consider . approving it at a later date. The . settlement most likely means the NFL won't have to disclose internal . files about what it knew, and when, about concussion-linked brain . problems. Lawyers had been eager to learn, for instance, about the . workings of the league's Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee, which . was led for more than a decade by a rheumatologist. Tragic: New England Patriots Junior Seau committed suicide last year, suffering from debilitating brain disease believed to be from 20 years of hits to the head . In court arguments in April, NFL lawyer Paul Clement asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuits and send them to arbitration under terms of the players' contract. He said that individual teams bear the chief responsibility for health and safety under the collective bargaining agreement, along with the players' union and the players themselves. Players lawyer David Frederick accused the league of concealing studies linking concussions to neurological problems for decades. In recent years, a string of former NFL players and other concussed athletes have been diagnosed after their deaths with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. Those ex-players included Seau and lead plaintiff Ray Easterling, who filed the first lawsuit in Philadelphia in August 2011 but later committed suicide. About one-third of the league's 12,000 former players eventually joined the litigation. They include a few hundred 'gap' players, who played during years when there was no labor contract in place, and were therefore considered likely to win the right to sue.","The NFL and 4,500 former players reached tentative $765 million settlement over concussion-related brain injuries .

An elderly couple who have been married for 66 years have both undergone the same life-saving surgery after learning they suffered from exactly the same heart defect. Marie Nigro, 90, and her husband Joseph, 92, from Long Island, New York, both learned they were suffering from critical aortic stenosis after they struggled to catch their breath. But after undergoing the same straight-forward operation, they are on the mend and are looking forward to celebrating their 67th wedding anniversary in November. At a press conference on Wednesday, doctors explained their condition meant their aortic valves failed to open and close properly, which increased pressure on their hearts and caused chest pains. Sharing everything: Marie Nigro, 90, and husband Joseph, 92, discovered they had the same heart defect . Due to their ages, the couple were not deemed suitable candidates for open heart surgery and underwent a much less invasive procedure, a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, ABC7 reported. The procedure involves using a catheter to guides a replacement valve . through the bloodstream to the heart, where it is expanded to enlarge the size of the opening of the old valve. Joseph underwent the operation at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in June, and a month later, his wife checked in for the same procedure. They both remained at the hospital for a couple of weeks. 'I feel great,' Joseph Nigro said. '(It) gave me new life.' Before the operation, 'when I bent over, couldn't come up, have a sigh and I just breathe heavy', he explained. His wife added: 'We're doing OK. So far, so good.'

Dr. Jacob Scheinerman explained that the condition usually affects people over 70 and symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue. While more than 50 per cent of people in this age group do not live a year after developing the symptoms, he said the less invasive procedure was helping many, ABC 7 reported. 'Many of these elderly patients would . have been too sick to have open heart surgery,' he said.

Ronald Reagan's family has hit out at the producers of a new Hollywood film for allegedly portraying the former President as a racist. The Republican icon is played by British actor Alan Rickman in The Butler, which tells the story of a black man who served in the White House for 34 years. However, his son claims that the portrayal implies that Reagan was prejudiced against black people, when in fact he helped the cause of African-Americans and showed friendship to the real White House butler. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Jane Fonda and Alan Rickman playing Nancy and Ronald Reagan in The Butler, which allegedly portrays the former President as a racist . Real life: The President was in fact friendly towards White House butler Eugene Allen and many other African-Americans, according to his son Michael . The film, which was released in the U.S. two weeks ago, follows Cecil Gaines, played by Forest Whitaker, as he experiences decades of American history at the side of multiple Presidents. It is based on the real-life story of Eugene Allen, who died in 2010 and served every President from Eisenhower to Reagan. Mr Rickman, known for his roles in Die Hard and the Harry Potter series, plays Reagan, while anti-war activist Jane Fonda was controversially cast as his wife Nancy. In the film - as in real life - Reagan invites the butler to attend a state dinner as a guest instead of an employee. But Gaines is uncomfortable with the experience, and turns against the President over Reagan's move to lift sanctions against South Africa over the apartheid regime. Blockbuster: The Butler, starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, covers decades of American history . The President's son Michael has launched a blistering attack on his father's portrayal, writing in Newsmax that the film should be called 'The Butler from Another Planet' because it is so historically inaccurate. 'Portraying Ronald Reagan as a racist because he was in favor of lifting economic sanctions against South Africa is simplistic and dishonest,' he wrote. 'If you knew my father, you'd know he was the last person on Earth you would call a racist.' He pointed out that the leader had a record of friendship towards black people, having been close to a number of African-Americans during his college days. When Reagan was governor of California, his son wrote, he more than doubled the number of black officials who had ever been appointed in the state's history. Attack: Michael Reagan, pictured speaking at his father's funeral, is furious about the President's portrayal . Michael Reagan claimed that his parents 'treated Mr Allen with the utmost respect' - unlike in the film, where Cecil Gaines's invitation to the state dinner is implied to have been an act of tokenism. When Allen was interviewed about his experiences in 2008, his only reminiscence of the evening was to smile as his wife recalled, 'Had champagne that night.' The film culminated with the butler's resignation as a protest over Reagan's opposition to South African sanctions, though there is no evidence that this was the reason for Allen's retirement at the age of 67. 'The real story of the White House butler doesn’t imply racism at all,' Michael Reagan wrote. 'It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there.' He added: 'My father's position on lifting the South African sanctions in the 80s had nothing to do with the narrow issue of race. It had to do with the geopolitics of the Cold War.' Allen told his interviewer in 2008 that he was 'especially fond of the Reagans', and resolutely refused to criticise any of the Presidents he worked for. The Butler, directed by Lee Daniels, takes a number of liberties in adapting Allen's life story, most notably in inventing an episode in which his mother is raped and father killed by a plantation boss.","Ronald Reagan is played by Alan Rickman in new film The Butler .

But now Roona's parents are heralding the miracle transformation by their baby into a 'happy, playful little girl' after a crowd funding website, set up by two complete strangers, paid for a series of operations. Roona Begum's head swelled to three times the normal size (left). But thanks to five operations to drain some of the excess fluid in her brain (right) her parents are hoping for a brighter future for her . The swelling was caused by ten litres of excess fluid inside her brain. Her mother is now able to comfortably lift her daughter to comfort her . Abdul and Fatima Begum describe a 'beautiful, happy baby' after a crowd funding site paid for a series of operations . Fifteen-month-old Roona suffers from a rare condition called hydrocephalus - known as water on the brain. Soon after she was born in a remote village in northeastern India, her head began to swell, and she was diagnosed with a severe form of the condition. It grew to 94 centimetres - three times the size of an average baby - and the skin was pulled so tight across her face she could barely close her eyes. Her parents were soon unable to carry her anywhere and even found it difficult to lift up their little girl and comfort her, CNN reports. But now Abdul and Fatima Begum describe 'beautiful, happy baby'. Her head, still significantly larger than it should be, has decreased to such an extent that she is able to move it, and open her eyes. Although it is still painful for the little girl to lift her head up, she is described as 'playful' by her young parents and has become the 'centre of attention' of her village. Unable to pay for their child's treatment, pictures were circulated by various news organisations, and a charity came forward to offer help. Norwegian . students, Jonas Borchgrevink and Nathalie Krantz, started an online . campaign that raised $52,000 to help fund any further care needed. The Fortis Foundation flew the poverty-stricken family from their rural village to the hospital in Gurgaon - where a cerebral shunt was carried out. Fifteen-month-old Roona (pictured before surgery) suffers from a rare condition called hydrocephalus - known as water on the brain . After five operations Roona's head has shrunk to a circumference of 58 centimetres - down from 94 centimetres . Doctors had already said that the youngster is lucky to be alive, with most sufferers of the condition not surviving beyond a year old. After five operations Roona's head has shrunk to a circumference of 58 centimeters. Speaking before the procedure was carried out, Dr Sandeep Vaishya, Director of Neurosurgery at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, who is treating Roona, said: 'I was surprised when I saw the baby for the first time. Even though I had seen her pictures, I wasn't expecting the head to be so big. 'Her head measures 94 cm, in similar cases the average measurement is around 50-60 cm. 'It is swollen to an extent that she is not able to close her eyes completely. We have an opthamologist looking at her eyes, so that there are no complications there. 'We are hopeful that she will make a complete recovery. The challenge is to drain her brain fluid in a gradual manner, so as the brain gets used to it.' Fatima said: 'When she was born, I wondered why do children of poor people like us suffer this fate? 'Why is fate cruel to us? Why do rich people who can afford to cure their kids never get diseases like this? Roona pictured before the operation.

But, pictured here before the operation, they once found it difficult to lift up their little girl and comfort her . 'Before she was born, I went to a doctor twice. Once when I was one month pregnant and than when I was six months pregnant. We did not have money to go more often. 'She was born through a Caesarian operation and the doctor told us we had to take her out of Agartala to get her treated. But we did not have any money at all.' At the time of learning of the generous charity effort, Abdul, who earns the equivalent of just £1.82 a day as a labourer thanked those who had helped Roona. He said: 'I cannot find work every day. It's hard enough to earn for food, so her treatment would have been impossible had it not been for the press and hospital people who have helped us.'","Doctors gave baby Roona Begum just months to live when she was born .

In 2006, he grew the first Alaska pumpkin to pass the 1,000-pound mark and then set the current record in 2011 with an enormous 1,287 pounder. Mr Megchelsen was disqualified once before when a crack was discovered in one of his giants. He believes the hole that occurred this time around may have happened because it was growing ‘too fast’.

It took less than three months for the fruit to grow to its present size and started off about the size of a cherry tomato at the start of June. It’s not clear what will become of the fruit. The seeds may go at auction for a few hundred dollars. There could be anywhere from zero to 900 inside . In the end it was Anchorage's Dale Marshall who hauled in a pale orange 1,182-pound monster for the top prize. He had sympathy for Mr Megchelsen position.

Italian stallion: Mars wasn't quite as shy about the size of his manhood judging by this restored Italian statue - but an increasing number of Italian men are opting to undergo penis enlargement surgery, according to a doctor . They are known for their Lothario ways, with the mere thought of being swept of their feet by an Italian stallion making many British women go weak at the knees. But it seems that Italian men are not quite as confident as you might think. A top Italian plastic surgeon has claimed that 'changing room syndrome' is causing a surge in the number of men opting to undergo penis enlargement surgery. Dr Alessandro Littara, director of the Centre for Sexual Medicine in Milan, has revealed that the number of surgical procedures to boost men's manhood is on the rise by as much as 25 per cent every year in the Mediterranean country. Despite the operation costing between £2,500 and £6,000, the centre, which specialises in penis enlargement, carried out 300 procedures in the past year. The high cost of the operation - formally known as penoplasty - means that it is mainly men aged between 30 and 50 who are opting to go under the knife, as they are most likely to be able to afford it. According to Dr Littara, patients usually request that their penis is made thicker, with some wanting it longer and others wanting both. Dr Littara told The Independent that most men don't want surgery to satisfy their partners - many are married - but instead puts the surge down to what he calls 'changing room syndrome'. He says that many men are merely trying to keep up with their peers. He said: 'With everyone seeing images of the body the whole time these days, men are more aware and worried about their bodies - all the parts are important and the genitals are no exception. 'We're living in the age of images, with sexual ones very often on the front page,' he told Adnkronos news agency. 'So sex gets more attention and people feel the need to be more competitive.' But the surgeon added that many men have no need to stress over the size of their manhood and he often has to turn people away. He said that some have unrealistic expectations while others show signs of psychological damage. Risky: The procedure does have its risks however - a 2011 study found an 'unacceptably high' rate of complications in penoplasty operations . The idea that Italian men might not be so confident in the trouser department will come as a surprise given that even former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has something of a reputation as a lothario, with his sexual exploits previously landing him in hot water. But the decision of many to opt for surgery is not only a drastic one in terms of finances, the procedure is certainly not without its risks - a study by the University of Turin in 2011 found that the operation had an 'unacceptably high' rate of complications. Compared to their counterparts from other European countries however, it seems that Italian men have little to worry about. According to a 2012 survey by Richard Lynn, emeritus professor of psychology at Ulster University, of international penis size Italian men are better endowed than chaps from Germany, the UK, France and Spain. The research claimed that the Italian average was 6.2 inches when erect compared to a British average of 5.5. The only European country to top Italy in the table was Iceland with an average of 6.5 inches. Men from the Republic of Congo had the biggest penises, with an average of 7.1 inches.","Dr Alessandro Littara blames 'changing room syndrome' for the increase .

Giant lumps of lard and baby wipes have been discovered clogging Denver sewers. The 'fatbergs', described as clumps of festering food mixed with wet wipes and cooking oil, have been found blocking more than a thousand miles of pipe under the streets of Denver, Colorado. Sewage workers have been forced to crawl 50 feet into the main pumping station's narrow tunnels to pull out the baby wipes by hand. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Blocked: The man responsible for this grease-clogged pipe under Warren Ave, Denver, regularly poured lard down his kitchen sink . Rivers of filth: This screen grab shows how grease and refuse builds up underground when oil is poured down the sink . Denver Wastewater Management’s Lupe Martinez told Fox 31 grease from cooking, poured down about 150,000 kitchen drains, is the biggest problem they face in keeping the sewer lines flowing smoothly. But the fastest growing environmental concern is disposable wet wipes which don't dissolve and clog the pumping station. At least once a month, workers have to climb 30 to 50 feet down a narrow tunnel to reach the pumps and clean out the wet wipes. 'New mothers are dumping more into our system. The elderly senior homes are using them more and they’re just flushing them down the toilet and that’s causing a lot of problems,' he said. 'Those wipes they get into our wells and . they clog together, and it’s too much for our pump system.   We have to physically go down there and collect all the wipes and bring . them up and get rid of them through the trash system.' Martinez told Fox 31  sewage workers found a giant grease bubble in pipes underneath the home of one resident who complained his drains were backing up. Workers discovered the Warren Ave, Denver, resident had been regularly pouring grease down his sink, causing it to harden in a lump in the sewer and block the line. So much grease had oozed into the main, workers had to clean it several times. Denver's festering fat chunks are reminiscent of 'The Fatberg', a disgusting 15 tonne blockage  discovered in pipes under Kingston in south London earlier this month. The . blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage . through manhole covers onto the streets of one of the leafiest London . boroughs. Engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it. Gordon Hailwood, waste contracts . supervisor for Thames Water said: 'We've never seen a single, congealed . lump of lard this big clogging our sewers before.

'If we hadn't discovered it in time, raw sewage could have started spurting out of manholes across the whole of Kingston.' The blockage was discovered after residents in nearby flats complained they couldn't flush their toilets and repairs could take six weeks to complete. Workmen used a high-pressure jet of water to blast away the massive blockage over 10 nights. Mr Hailwood said homes and businesses need to change their ways, and when it comes to fat and wipes people need to 'bin it, not block it'.","Repugnant mass of congealed lard and baby wipes discovered .

From wasps buzzing around your jam sandwiches to an unscheduled interaction with a crab, a day at the beach comes with more hazards than most of us would like. But at least you no longer have to put up with a gritty, sandy picnic blanket thanks to a company that uses military technology to keep the annoying grains at bay. The sand-free rug, £34.99, was created by American company, CGear Sand-Free, and uses special technology to keep pesky grit and other spillages away. Is this the end of sandy sarnies? Out-Right Gear claims their rug will repel sand thanks to its special weave . Multiple uses: The technology has been used by CGear for everything from mats to beach bags . Despite the impressive name, CGear technology is based on something very simple. A unique type of woven mesh, the technology makes it impossible for sand or other grit to accumulate on top of the mat or rug. Instead, grains of sand fall through specially designed holes, where they are rendered unable to come back up. Although CGear originated in the Australian military, it is now used by armed forces across the world - including the UK's. Originally developed for use by the Australian military, the key to the rug's success is in the multi-weave which means sand 'sifts' through and back to the ground. The technology behind the rug was originally used by helicopter crews who used it to make moveable heli-mats. Mats made using CGear Sand-Free were intended to prevent dust and dirt thrown up by whirring blades - better known as 'brownout' - from ending up inside the helicopter where it can cause damage to equipment. Brownout can also temporarily blind helicopter pilots by obscuring their view. As a result, during the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and North Africa, brownout was blamed for three in four accidental helicopter crashes. Now the technology has found a more down-to-earth application in the shape of camping carpets, ground sheets and even a beach bag. According to Out-Right Gear, which sells the CGear rugs in the UK, traditional camping equipment leaves you 'vulnerable to dirt, sand and dust kicked into and accumulating in your camping space.' It suggests laying out your sand-free rug with a blanket placed over the top to make it more comfortable, although it does warn that a gap between the edge of the sand-free mat and the traditional one is needed to make it work. The rug itself, belying its cheerful green and blue tartan design, is made from specially woven water-resistant PVC, which, says the company, also means spillages and mess are also kept at bay. While the resulting combination will be a bit heavier than other picnic blankets, many will think it well worth it for sand-free sarnies.","The rug includes CGear technology developed by the Australian military .

Panamanian officials have identified the skeletal remains of a California woman who disappeared in 2011 in Panama after arriving in the country with her boyfriend. DNA testing confirmed that the remains found last week on the island province of Bocas del Toro came from Yvonne Lee Baldelli, who was last seen there in November 2011. A man who was cutting bushes found a bag containing Baldelli's remains on August 20 and contacted police. Identified: Human remains found in a bag on an island off of Panama have been identified as those of Yvonne Baldelli, a California woman who went missing in November 2011 . The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Nigel, California, arrived in Panama with boyfriend Brian Brimager in September 2011. Her family reported her missing the following January. Baldelli's family has said Baldelli, a clothing designer, was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong. Panama police say Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States about 10 days after last being seen with Baldelli. A local on Isla Carenero discovered a 'green military style' backpack containing a human skull, some bones and women's clothing, according to law enforcement. A photo released by Baldelli's sister was taken in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Panamanian and US authorities have worked together to first find the 42-year-old's body and then try to find her killer . Grim discovery: A man cutting back bushes on August 20 on Panama's Isla Carenero found a 'green military style' backpack containing a human skull, some bones and women's clothing . Charged: Brimager was arrested by the FBI at his California home and charged in connection with the 2011 murder of his girlfriend Yvonne Baldelli, though he was not charged specifically with her murder . Her sister, Michelle Faust, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Brimager, an ex-Marine, is being held in California on obstruction of justice charges. 'The whole family has been very sad and desperate...we didn't know where Yvonne was,' Faust said. 'The good thing about today is that once the evidence (from the remains) is studied we will be able to bring her home.' Panamanian investigators and FBI agents are working together on the case. Last year, FBI agents and Panamanian forensic specialists found traces of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, which is the popular tourist spot where Baldelli was last seen. Scene of the crime? Baldelli and Brimager lived in this house while in Panama and the FBI has said it will search the water for more remains . Brimager, left, was arrested in June in connection with the murder of Baldelli, right. Later, at Brimager's arraignment, prosecutors referred to him as the killer but did not formally press homicide charges . Baldelli, a fashion designer, had been in a relationship with Brimager for about two years, according to prosecutors . Baldelli was last seen at a steakhouse in the town of Bocas del Toro with Brimager on November 26, 2011, according to the U.S. Attorney's office, which also said he physically abused her before she went missing. He has not been charged with murder but faces ten counts of obstruction of justice and one count of false statement to a federal officer. Brimager is accused of dumping a bloody mattress in the ocean to cover up his girlfriend's death after searching online for how to get the stains out. He is said to have packed her belongings into garbage bags and left them outside the hostel for disposal. The indictment claims that on November 29 Brimager began sending fake emails to a hotel manager, friends and family from Ms Baldelli's account. Justice?

This was to back up the retired Marine's story that had Ms Baldelli had 'broken up with Brimager and was headed to Costa Rica with a man named Tony Gonzales.' 'Brimager impersonated Baldelli over email in an attempt to trick her friends and family into believing she was still alive, thereby obstructing, influencing and impeding investigation into her disappearance and suspected death,' the indictment says. The indictment adds that when Brimager landed in San Diego on December 12, 2011, another woman, known as K.W., met him at the airport.

A mother who lost her young son in a tragic accident is now running a single-handed campaign to get statutory bereavement leave extended for parents who lose a child from the current three days to at least four weeks. Lucy Herd's 23-month-old son Jack drowned in their garden pond in August 2010 when Lucy took her eyes off him for just a short moment. On top of the unimaginable grief, Lucy discovered that as a bereaved parent her then-partner could take just three days paid leave off work - one of which had to be for the funeral. Lucy with Jack at the seaside: Jack drowned in a tragic accident and Lucy's partner, Jack's father, was given just three days off work . Any additional time was to be taken as either sick leave or holiday. This compounded the pain of the grieving process and left both parents without the support of the other at a time when both were incredibly fragile. 'As a mum my world died the day Jack died,' Lucy said. 'It was every mother's worst nightmare: I took my eyes off Jack for those split moments and he wandered away from my protection.' Jack with his older sister Elle: There is currently no specific law granting time off for bereavement . 'I don't really remember the days straight after Jack's death, I remember feeling a pain like no other, I can honestly say my heart physically hurt and that hurt is still there but trying to make a positive heals me slightly. 'When my family all left as they had to go back to work as their bereavement leave had ended I felt alone, lost and abandoned, how on earth was I going to continue to live without their support and love around me 24/7? 'But I did live and I have survived, and I'm now campaigning for other parents not to have to worry about losing their jobs after a death of a child. It is a great healing process as is setting up Jack's Rainbow.' The pressures of bereavement eventually led to Lucy separating from Jack's dad, and she has since left Cumbria, where they lived, and moved with her two older children to Owlsmoor, in Berkshire, to be closer to her family. Lucy said: 'My world died the day Jack died' Although granting only three days off after the death of a child may seem unthinkable, a parent whose child has died is not entitled to any statutory leave under the law. There is in fact very little legislation on such issues, leaving companies to grant 'compassionate leave' at their discretion. At . present, parents may be entitled to 'time off for dependents'. This is a . legal right to unpaid leave to cope with family emergencies. Although . there is no upper limit to the amount of time specified, it should be 'reasonable' and should only be the amount that is 'sufficient' to deal . with the situation. Directgov . guidance said: 'There's no set amount of time allowed to deal with an . unexpected event involving a dependant - it will vary depending on what . the event is but for most cases one or two days should be sufficient to . deal with the problem.' Lucy said: 'When . a child dies, particularly if that death is sudden and unexpected, . there should be provision for the parents to take paid time off work. 'While . many good employers offer compassionate leave, there is no statutory . right to leave and this campaign aims to introduce four weeks of paid ""bereavement leave"" for parents. 'In . the immediate aftermath of the death parents have to cope with their . own loss, the grief of their wider family, including other children, as . well as a vast amount of administrative and other arrangements.' Three days is not enough: Lucy is hoping that she can persuade parliament to vote to grant all grieving parents at least four weeks off work . She continued: 'A sudden or accidental death may require a post mortem or inquest; there is a funeral to arrange; and many other organisations to contact from schools to benefit offices.' Lucy is in the process of setting up a charity in Jack's memory called Jack's Rainbow. It will provide other families with round-the-clock support and funding for holidays in order to try and create new memories for the family. She is also planning a campaign in the summer to highlight the danger of garden ponds. Lucy's aim is to get the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to change the statutory leave entitlement for an employee who has lost a child from three days to four weeks. Lucy is hoping she can persuade parliament to vote to grant all grieving parents at least four weeks off work. An online petition has been started by Lucy which needs 100,000 signatures to force the Government to have a debate on the issue.  The petition can be found here.","Lucy Herd's toddler son Jack drowned in their garden pond in August 2010 .

An airman who survived four plane crashes during World War II is celebrating 70 years of marriage today. RAF bomber navigator Jim Stafford, 96, . said it was the thought of returning home to his wife Betty, 95, that kept him going during the dangerous missions. Mrs Stafford said: 'Love got us through.' Jim and Betty Stafford celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary and said 'love got them through' the war . Mr Stafford, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, said: 'Not many people can say they've done that in their lives.' The airman joined up as a warrant officer in 1940, just months after war erupted in September 1939. He survived four plane crashes throughout the Middle East and South Africa during the six-year conflict as well as another one shortly before he left the air force in 1946. A hydraulic fault caused one crash while another three were the result of the wheels failing to deploy, causing crash landings. Neither Mr Stafford or his crew were seriously injured in any of the crashes. Of the fifth crash, that happened shortly after the war ended, Mr Stafford said: 'We were in Cumberland and were told to fly to Omagh in Northern Ireland and back again as part of a training exercise.

"By . Peter Campbell . PUBLISHED: . 11:57 EST, 12 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:11 EST, 13 November 2012 . The 'immoral' tricks used by corporate giants to avoid UK tax were laid bare yesterday.Executives from Google, Starbucks and Amazon revealed how they base operations offshore and route profits to tax havens. They had been summoned by MPs to explain why they contribute little or nothing to the Treasury's coffers. In a three-hour inquisition: . Troy Alstead, global chief financial officer at Starbucks, was told . his defence that the coffee chain continually made a loss in Britain . 'just doesn't ring true' The legal ruses deployed by the three . US firms have caused outrage because ordinary taxpayers are left to . make up the difference. Protest group UK Uncut yesterday . vowed to take direct action on December 8 to try to shut down some of . the nation's 700 Starbucks outlets. Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman . of the public accounts committee that held yesterday's session, told the . executives before her: 'We're not accusing you of being illegal, we're . accusing you of being immoral.' The MPs are probing the tax that HM Revenue and Customs takes from global corporations. Google, which was accused of avoiding . more than £200millon in tax last year by basing its operations in . Ireland, admitted structuring its affairs to minimise its liability. But Matt Brittin, Google's UK chief . executive, said the search giant was right to pay the bulk of its taxes . in the US because its crucial operations and technology teams were . largely based there. Asked to explain the Bermuda . connection, he replied that the island housed the company's intellectual . property outside of America. Andrew Cecil, Director Public Policy at Amazon, also received a grilling by MPs yesterday over basing their EU operation in Luxembourg . Tax matters: Starbucks has not paid UK corporation tax in the past three years, while Amazon paid no UK corporation tax . last year despite being Britain's largest online retailer . Google reports the lion's share of . its non-US income through Ireland because of the low corporation tax . rate there. Even then some money is sent to Bermuda where rates are even . lower. Google paid only £6million to the Treasury last year on UK sales of £2.6billion. Starbucks was strongly criticised for . paying just £8.6million in tax in 14 years of trading in Britain. It . paid none in 2011 on revenues of £398million. Troy Alstead, its chief finance . officer, said the UK arm had not yet turned a profit and the parent . company was 'not at all pleased about our financial performance'. The . ritual humiliation of top brass from Starbucks, Google and Amazon is . good theatre. But it would have been more respectful of the Commons had . the real bosses, including Howard Schultz (right) of Starbucks, turned up rather . than their surrogates. These corporate giants would not . treat a hearing by Congress so lightly. For Starbucks, which has the . most direct contact with UK consumers, the stakes are highest. Arguably . Google and Amazon are more remote and there are no great British . choices. Starbucks has home-roasted Costa coffee to think about. The whole of Britain’s corporate . tax system is under scrutiny. George Osborne and the Treasury have been . banking on lower headline rates of corporation tax to make the UK an . attractive destination. That is a worthy objective but that . is not going to capture the income of the tax-avoiders whether they are . smart private equity owners such as Macquarie at Thames Water, Cadbury . under Kraft ownership, or Starbucks. Britain’s corporate tax code offers . too many breaks. Most obvious is the prejudice in favour of debt over . equity. Interest payments are tax-deductible and many private . equity-owned businesses are largely a tax-free zone. Osborne wanted to tackle this . distortion in opposition. But in office it has been less appealing, . possibly because of lobbying by private equity barons, some of whom . might well be Tory Party donors. If corporation tax receipts were . more buoyant the Chancellor  would not have to spend his time grubbing . around for little fixes such as the granny and pasty taxes. The trade-off would be a much lower . headline rate of company taxes. The best way of bringing Starbucks and . the tech giants under the revenue umbrella would be some kind of unitary . taxation or imputation tax system. Tax would be paid on turnover or sales attributed to the UK marketplace, taking account of numbers . of people and assets deployed here.  It would end the dubious practice . used by both UK and overseas firms of moving brands, patents and . business services into tax havens so as to escape the intrusion of HMRC. If that happened, there might even be room for some personal tax cuts to fuel spending power and growth. But MPs expressed surprise that a loss-making firm would be able to afford to keep opening stores. 'You're either running the business badly or there is a fiddle going on,' said Labour's Austin Mitchell. MPs were also angry that Starbucks in . the UK pays a 4.7 per cent fee to the coffee giant's Dutch arm for the . right to use its branding and coffee recipe. The fee, which has been as high as 6 . per cent, reduces its UK tax bill. 'You go for what you think you can . get away with and you charge that,' said Mrs Hodge. 'You just look at . the going rate in a jurisdiction and you charge that.' Matt Brittin, Chief Executive Officer of Google UK, who also faced questioning yesterday . There are over 17,009 Starbucks coffee shops across the world. The company began in 1971 and started as a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground coffee, tea and spices with a single store in Seattle's Pike Place Market. Now the company has millions of customers through its doors every day in more than 50 countries. Starbucks has more than 30 blends and single-origin premium arabica coffees. Starbucks went public in 1992, at a price of  $17 per share and closed trading that first day at $21.50 per share. Google was founded in California in 1998 by Stanford University PhD students and friends Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It now employs more than 53,000 people around the globe. Google receives more than seven billion daily page views. In 2011 it made $11.6bn profit and generated almost $38bn revenue. The company, whose unofficial slogan is 'Don't be evil', is now valued at $217.87bn. Its . shares were up today on the New York stock exchange, hovering around . the $666 mark - despite the negative publicity the company was getting . in the UK over its tax. Mr Alstead said his firm had a deal with the Dutch government that gives Starbucks a special tax rate in Amsterdam. The terms of the bargain, he said, . were 'iron bound in confidentiality', and he couldn't reveal them in the . open hearing. Mrs Hodge countered that it was a 'sweetheart deal'. Mr Alstead also revealed that the . coffee, which is bought through Switzerland, never goes to the country . despite having a 20 per cent mark-up slapped on it when being sold to . other countries, such as the UK. Amazon said it used Luxembourg as a . base for its European operations because of the favourable tax rate . there. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge, pictured, said to the Starbucks boss: 'It seems to us that you are exporting your profits to minimise your tax' Andrew Cecil, the online retailer's public policy director, said . the Luxembourg business's turnover in 2011 was £7.3billion yet it paid . taxes of just £6.4million. Amazon employs nearly 70,000 people world-wide. Last year, it turned over more than $48bn revenue. The company was founded in 1994. But since then has grown into the biggest online retailed in the world. It is estimated to be worth $102.51bn . Some 65million customers log on to its U.S. website each month. It paid no UK tax in 2010 on revenues of . £3.3billion. MPs were furious that he refused to reveal how much the company made from its British arm. 'It's quite insulting to our . intelligence that you claim you don't know what sales you make in the . UK,' said Liberal Democrat MP Ian Swales, a member of the influential . Commons committee. Mr Cecil claimed that Luxembourg, . which employs around 500 people, was the real 'engine' of the business, . rather than the UK, where it employs 15,000. Its profits are booked in Luxembourg, . with the UK figuring only as a 'service arm'. MPs said his answers were . 'evasive' and 'annoying' and Margaret Hodge said the committee would . call 'a serious person' for further questioning. She said Mr Cecil's ignorance was 'outrageous' and that he had 'been put up' to it by the company.","'It seems to us that you are exporting your profits to minimise your tax', says committee chairman Margaret Hodge when questioning Starbucks chief .

A married California district attorney has been accused of burning down the home of a former prostitute who was allegedly his mistress after he discovered she was seeing other men. Sutter County prosecutor Carl Adams, a father-of-three, is being questioned in the arson investigation after racy messages he sent to Sarah Garibay suggested jealously was a possible motive, detectives said. In court documents, Garibay, 32, admits she was having an affair with three men at once, including Adams. Police said when Adams found out about his love rivals, he was not happy and made this clear to the mother-of-three. Scroll down for video . Affair: Sutter County prosecutor Carl Adams, right, is being questioned in the arson investigation after racy messages he sent to Sarah Garibay, left, suggested jealously was a possible motive . 'Adams has told her how he is jealous. She showed us text messages where he stated he was jealous,' detectives wrote in the police report. The report, obtained by CBS13, also states Adams showed up at the crime scene on July 21, just hours after the fire and spoke with neighbors. Police interviewed Adams, and the other two men, about the fire and his relationship with Garibay after determining the men each 'had reason to be upset with her.' 'I asked Adams if he was in a sexual relationship with Sarah Garibay and he said no,' an officer wrote in the affidavit. 'When confronted with Garibay's statement and phone records, Adams admitted he was having an affair with Garibay.' Adams told Foxnews.com in an email: 'The . personal part of this is just that - personal, and will be resolved with . my wife, my pastor and God.' But he denies any involvement in the fire. 'I . had nothing to do with the arson. I am now allowing the Yuba City . Police Department's investigation to run its course,' he told CBS. Fire: Garibay's Yuba City rental home, pictured, went up in flames on July 21 . Before: Garibay rented the property in California, pictured before the blaze . Police said one of the three men originally named in the affidavit - Amerjit Bhatti, who has a 14-month-old daughter with Garibay - has been cleared as a suspect but Adams and a third man, identified as Ronnie Johnson, have not. However, neither has been charged with any crime at this stage. Adams knew the cause and origin of the blaze though it wasn't clear how, police said, raising suspicions. Garibay wasn't home at the time of the fire. Her attorney, Roberto Marquez, told FoxNews.com his client was shocked and upset that Adams has been connected to the arson. 'Never . once did she list him as a potential suspect,' Marquez said on Tuesday. 'She's upset and saddened that he is being dragged through the mud and . seeing his reputation being sullied.' She told the Appeal-Democrat newspaper earlier this week: 'Someone is trying to smear him and they're using my name to do it.' DA: Adams, left, a married father-of-three, has admitted the affair with Garibay, right . Debbie Myers, who lives next door to the fire said she spoke to Adams after it happened. 'I never met him before until the morning of the fire,' she told CBS News. 'I didn't know it was him. I didn't know who he was. He just said he was a friend of the family and he'd helped them out with a lot of stuff.' Adams told police he went to Garibay's home after the fire because 'the victim called and asked for my help,' according to KCRA. Adams has been the county's district attorney since 1982 and is the president of the California District Attorney's Association. Garibay was arrested last week on charges of extortion, according to Fox News. In 2010, she was charged as an accessory in the death of her then-boyfriend, Dr. Hyo Deoung Shin, after another man she was having an affair with, Jeffrey Wayne Clay, caught the couple in bed. Garibary received immunity from Adams' office in exchange for her testimony and cooperation with authorities but she insists he pair had no relationship back then.","California prosecutor Carl Adams is a suspect in the arson investigation after racy messages he sent to Sarah Garibay suggested he may have lit the fire in a jealous rage .

Hoping to help: The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, would be granted the right to make Sarah Hershberger's medical decisions if the appeal is granted . An appeals court in Ohio has sided . with a hospital that's seeking to force a 10-year-old Amish girl to . resume chemotherapy after her parents decided to stop the treatments. The . decision issued Tuesday sends the case back to a county judge and says . he must give more consideration to the request by Akron Children's . Hospital. The judge had . ruled in July that parents Andy and Anna Hershberger had the right to . make medical decisions for their daughter Sarah, who has leukemia. The hospital wants registered nurse . Maria Schimer, who is also an attorney, to take over limited . guardianship and make medical decisions for the girl. The hospital says the girl will die without chemotherapy. The . girl's parents say that the chemotherapy's effects were terrible and . that they're now using 'natural' medicines, such as herbs and vitamins, . and consulting with another doctor. Sarah's . parents brought her to Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio to treat the . tumors on her kidney, neck and chest - a number of which were visible to . the naked eye. Her parents . initially said that she could be treated with the necessary . chemotherapy and she underwent some rounds of the procedure but not . enough to completely eradicate the cancer. But they soon changed their minds, saying that they want to use natural medicine like vitamins and herbs to solve the problem. Akron Children's Hospital has already petitioned once to be granted guardianship of the girl but that initial request was rejected, and now they are re-applying to a different judge . The Medina Gazette reported early . in August that the hospital already applied to take over legal . guardianship of Sarah but were rejected by one Ohio judge who has since . retired. 'The court cannot deprive these parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter because there is not a scintilla of evidence showing the parents are unfit,' Judge John Lohn wrote in his decision before retiring earlier this month. He added that the girl's parents were 'caring, attentive, protective and concerned'. It is unclear how long Sarah underwent chemotherapy, but apparently long enough for the visible tumors on her neck and chest to disappear, as court records say that they went away but she did not go into remission. 'Sarah begged her parents to stop the treatments. Anna said she and Andy could not stand to watch what was happening to their daughter,' Judge Lohn wrote. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (who is not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . Sarah apparently complained about feeling sick and she didn't want to become infertile. Nausea, . organ damage and infertility are all common side effects of . chemotherapy, but in this case, doctors say that 'the question of . Sarah's treatment is life and death'. Mrs Hershberger 'prayed for wisdom to discern God's plan for Sarah' and believed that the therapy was killing her. Nurse and attorney Maria Schimer is appealing the decision and hopes to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for Sarah. 'The plan presented by Sarah’s parents is almost certain to lead to Sarah’s death,' she wrote in a letter to the court. 'Every day that goes by without treatment, Sarah’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished.' With chemotherapy, her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent.","Sarah Hershberger, 10, has leukemia and doctors say she will die unless she receives chemotherapy .

One of the two teens charged for the brutal bludgeoning to death of a WWII veteran in Spokane, Washington, has made the astonishing claim that he was buying crack cocaine from the 88-year-old and that the deal turned violent. The bizarre allegation that war hero Delbert 'Shorty' Belton was a drug dealer emerged during 16-year-old Kenan Adams-Kinard's first court appearance yesterday where he was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. Relatives of Belton derided Adams-Kinard's claims, calling them desperate and saying that Belton was senile, eccentric in his old age, but certainly not a crack cocaine user or pusher. Accused of Being a Drug Dealer: This World War II-era photo provided by Heritage Funeral Home of Spokane shows veteran Delbert Belton. The 88-year old Belton (right) was beaten to death last week in Spokane, Washington . 'That's a bunch of crock,' Belton's daughter-in-law Barbara Belton said to NBC News. 'Of course these kids are going to make excuses.' Dark past: Adams-Kinard was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June . Adams-Kinard and Demetrius Glenn, who are both 16, have been charged with battering 88-year-old Battle of Okinawa veteran Belton to death with flashlights in his car outside his Eagles lodge on Wednesday after a botched robbery. Both were charged as adults and both have previous convictions for assault and were caught on security cameras in the area at the time of the killing. Glenn gave himself up immediately to the police, but Adams-Kinard went on the run for four-days and allegedly told friends during his time in hiding that the beating occurred because of a drug deal gone wrong. Police have said that they have a letter in their possession, written by Adams-Kinard to his mother, in which he claims that Belton was selling them crack cocaine. The letter said that after purchasing a 'zip of crack cocaine from Shorty,' the teens 'proceeded to sock him.' 'I took his wallet and another ounce . of crack from his pockets,' the letter said, according to the court . document. 'He was unconscious so I made sure he was still breathing, and . then I took off.' Police . have said that they seriously doubt Adams-Kinard's story and . spokeswoman, Monique Cotton said in a statement: 'We have no evidence to . support that.' Even . Glenn's lawyer, Christian Phelps, told NBC News that he was skeptical . and said, 'It doesn't seem plausible to me. I wouldn't put any stock in . it at this point.' Detained: Demetrius Glenn, left, confers with attorney Christian Phelps. He is charged with first degree murder and first degree robbery. He is being held on $2M bail and will be tried as an adult . High price: District Judge Richard Leland, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper. Glenn's, right, was set at $2 million . However, Phelps also pointed out that, 'there are no eyewitnesses and no forensic evidence that links either of the kids to the crime.' Yesterday, upon the apprehension of Adams-Kinard, police revealed the sickening brutality inflicted on the helpless 88-year-old victim. Attacked in his car on Wednesday in the parking lot of Eagles lodge, Delbert Belton was found wedged between the two front seats of his car on Wednesday and was battered so badly he sustained brain damage and had lost too much blood to survive the violent attack. Kenan Adams-Kinard and Demetrius Glenn, both 16, are accused of battering the war hero to death with flashlights after he fought back during a robbery and according to Belton's daughter-in-law 'They just kept hitting and hitting him.' 'He was an 88-year-old man,' said Barabara Belton to NBC News. 'Even if they wanted his money and he didn't want to give it to them, they didn't need to do that. 'They did a horrendous thing and they need to pay the consequences.' And speaking one day after the dawn arrest on Monday of 16-year-old Kenan Adams-Kinard following a four-day manhunt for the killing of 88-tear-old, Delbert Belton, his uncle said that living in a small town narrowed his ability to make friends. Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested by Spokane Police on Monday morning after a four day man-hunt . 'He hung around with the wrong people and made the wrong choices,' Odell Kinard said of his nephew, Kenan Adams-Kinard. 'It's the summer and ain't nothing to do here.' Charged with first-degree murder for the killing of Delbert 'Shorty' Belton, Adams-Kinard is due to appear in a Spokane court today, one day after another 16-year-old, Demetrius Glenn was charged as an adult and held on $2 million bail. Glenn's lawyer says he plans to plead not guilty for the murder of Delbert - who took a bullet in the Battle of Okinawa - who was clubbed to death with flashlights as he tried to stop an apparent robbery in a crime which has captured the attention of the nation. Police in Spokane said that Belton, was in his car in the parking lot outside his Eagles Lodge when the attack occurred on Wednesday night. 'The motive for this attack was robbery,' said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub to NBC News. 'Race was not a factor. Additionally, there was no gang activity that was associated with his incident,' he added, noting that many commentators had pointed to the fact that the teens were black and the victim was white. 'These are two young men who just spun out of control.' Glenn made an initial court appearance Monday afternoon. He is charged in Spokane County District Court with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. The charges carry a potential life sentence. District Judge Richard Leland, presiding over a packed courtroom, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper. Glenn had turned himself in Thursday . night, the same day Delbert Belton died of his injuries. The slightly . built youth gave yes and no answers to questions from the judge but . otherwise said . nothing. Defense . attorney Chris Phelps noted after the hearing that the case has gone . viral on the Internet, with many people expressing strong opinions. Watch Video Here: . Surrender: Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his lawyer . 'The evidence doesn't indicate what happened,' Phelps said, adding that witnesses only reported 'two kids running away.' Straub said it appeared that Belton fought back against his attackers, which may have increased the severity of his beating. Wanted: Police released images of two possible suspects between the ages of 16 and 19. One juvenile was arrested this morning . Suspect Number Two: Police say two teens assaulted 88-year-old Delbert Belton outside the Eagles Lodge in North Spokane Wednesday night. One teen has been arrested in connection to the crime . ‘Our information is that the . individual fought back and that may have made this, you know, a worse . situation,’ said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub in a Monday press . conference. Straub was quick to maintain Belton’s innocence in the matter. ‘I'm not being critical of Mr. Belton,’ he clarified. ‘We certainly encourage individuals to fight back, and he should have. But it shouldn't have happened to begin with.’ While Glenn turned himself almost immediately, Adams-Kinard remained in hiding for four days as police worked with churches and the teens family to get him to surrender. 'The family was helpful. The family encouraged him to surrender. The family got the gravity of this,' said Straub to NBC News. Devastated: Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton, pictured, told of her grief at the brutal killing . Tribute: Lill Duncan takes a photo of a memorial for Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran who was beaten to death, in Spokane . However, Odell Kinard expressed his shock at learning his nephew has been accused of killing a man. 'It really hurt to hear that,' he said to NBC News. 'He has to take responsibility,' he added. 'But the family is praying he gets 10 years or less.' Unusually, Straub spoke of the lives of the suspects in this brutal case and the impact this crime could have on them. 'It bothers me that a distinguished World War II veteran lost his life,' Straub said. 'But the lives of the young suspects are also likely ruined,' he said. 'He came close to losing his life in service to this country in Okinawa and then he gets killed needlessly in the parking lot while he’s waiting for a friend. That’s the tragedy of this thing,' Straub said of the victim. Tribute: Friends raised a drink to Delbert Benton in the bar he was murdered outside today . 'The second piece is two young men whose lives and the lives of their families are ruined by criminal activity.' Belton was born and raised in Spokane. He survived being shot in the leg in 1945 at Okinawa, one of the fiercest battles of the war, and went on to spend 33 years working for Kaiser Aluminum before retiring in 1982. Belton was called Shorty by his friends because he was little more than 5 feet tall, his niece Pam Hansen said.","Murder suspect Kenan Adams-Kinard made the bizarre claim that he was buying drugs from 88-year-old Delbert Belton .

Residents in a Detroit neighborhood have been living in fear of a large cat that has been wandering around hissing at children. Today, that cat was found shot to death and thrown in a dumpster. The cat - a 25-pound, 3-year-old Savannah cat named Chum - was found in a dumpster on the east side of the city on Monday night. Authorities suspect a neighbor near Joann and Bringard streets shot the cat several days ago - as a feral-cat rescue group was searching for the animal that had residents in fear for the last month. Chum: the cat terrifying neighbors turned out to be a domesticated Savannah cat named Chum . Savannah cats are domestic cats bred with an African Serval cats. Depending on how far down the breeding chain they are, they can . be fairly wild. 'I think people can’t just go around shooting things . they don’t understand,' Laura Wilhelm-Bruzek, the founder of the cat rescue group Paws for the Cause, told the Detroit Free Press. 'I think we need to . be a little bit more respectful of the animals and human beings around . us. I’d love to see someone look into it and investigate it. But I’m not . holding out a lot of hope. This whole thing from the beginning has just . been a mess.' Wilhelm-Bruzek's group started searching for the cat on Saturday. In the wild: Serval adult, in tall grass where it hunts for rodents, birds, small reptiles . Not your average cat: Locals killed the cat thinking it was wild . Leopard: Chum has a fur pattern that's similar to that of a leopard, which terrified residents . Savannah cats are a cross between a regular house cat and a long-eared African Serval cat. The cats became popular amongst breeders in the late 1990s and by 2001, the International Cat Association accepted it as a registered breed. Savannah cats are more social than an average cat and are often compared to dogs - they can be taught to walk on a leash and can even play fetch. The Serval cat is native to southeast Africa, where it hunts fish, birds and rabbits. It also can take down animals as big a deer or gazelle. Serval cats numbers have dwindled in recent years, as people often hunt them for their pelts. They also are prey for leopards and other large cats. Residents in the neighborhood first started seeing the large cat last month. They described it as being four feet tall and being gray with black spots. 'He . walked like he ain't scared of nothing,' said resident Antwaun Ansberry. 'This thing is out here, bro.' Residents in the neighborhood said they called the Michigan Humane Society and the Detroit Police Department but that both agencies declined to investigate. Last week, the cats' owners called Paws for a Cause to help them find Chum. The group heard that the cat had been shot, but couldn't recover the body until yesterday, when someone showed them where it was. 'I simply asked them for the cat’s body and they said . it was across the street in a garbage can,” Wilhelm-Bruzek said. She was walked . to the garbage can, 'and the cat — whose name is Chum — was there.' Chum's owners, who raised the cat since it was four months old, were heartbroken when they found out the cat had been shot. 'They were hysterical,” Wilhelm-Bruzek said. She added that the family planned to have the cat cremated today. RIP: a scared resident shot the cat over the weekend and threw its body in a dumpster .","The cat, Chum, was actually just a Savannah cat - not a leopard .

A heavily pregnant woman who was twice sent home from hospital and told to take painkillers died just weeks after giving birth to her baby girl. Barbara Makovecz, 44, from Manchester, went to North Manchester General Hospital complaining of back pain and difficulty breathing when she was 37 weeks pregnant. Her husband, Carl, 49, insists he told doctors she had already survived breast cancer, and begged them to carry out blood tests and scans, he says his wife was sent home and told to take painkillers. Barbara Makovecz, 44, died eight weeks after giving birth to Bethany. She visited North Manchester General Hospital when she was heavily pregnant and started suffering back pain but was sent away with painkillers . Nine days later, she suffered a severe brain seizure and was rushed to Saint Mary’s Hospital in Manchester city centre. Her baby, Bethany Grace, was delivered by emergency Caesarean - and it was only then doctors discovered she had cancer. Mrs Makovecz, also mother to Liam, 19, Jack, eight, and Samuel, three, went on to have further seizures, causing her to lose her memory and be unable to care for new daughter. Doctors discovered tumours in her brain and major organs and when radiation therapy was unsuccessful, told devastated husband that there was nothing they could do. Mrs Makovecz, a Post Office worker, died just eight weeks after giving birth in September last year. Mrs Makovecz was given radiotherapy but it was not successful and she died in a hospice. Mr Makovecz has had to give up his job to care for the couple's children. He is pictured with Bethany, Jack (left) and Sam (right) Her family have made a formal . complaint to North Manchester General Hospital - but say a year on they . are still waiting for answers. Mr Makovecz is also taking legal advice. Mrs Makovecz first went to North Manchester General on July 3 last year and returned again the following day. But both times medics sent her home with painkillers, believing the back pain was due to a strain caused by coughing. Her husband, who has given up his job in manufacturing to care for the couple’s young children, said: ‘During the pregnancy Barbara had been looking radiant and beautiful. But then around 35 weeks she started getting back pain. After Bethany was delivered, Mrs Makovecz was diagnosed with tumours in her brain and other major organs . ‘I took her to North Manchester General . and both times explained she had had cancer before. The pain had got so . bad she was in agony, but doctors just told us to go home and take . painkillers. Then she had a brain seizure at home and the doctors at St Mary’s said the only way to save the baby was with an emergency caesarean. ‘Straight after the birth both seemed fine but then Barbara had two more seizures and after an MRI scan they discovered the tumours. ‘I was heartbroken, but begged doctors not to give up on her because I hadn’t. ‘After . radiation therapy at The Christie she came home and I looked after her . and the children, but doctors told us she didn’t have long to live. So . we had Bethany Grace christened at the chapel in The Christie and . Barbara died 11 days later in a hospice. ‘I had been taking the baby to visit her but she wasn’t strong enough to do things like change her, and she didn’t know who I was before she died. ‘It was the hardest thing ever. It’s been nearly a year now and it’s been a battle with North Manchester General to get answers. ‘If she had been diagnosed earlier she might not have had the seizures and lost her memory. I just want the hospital to learn from what happened so another family don’t go through what we have.’ It is understood bosses from Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs North Manchester General, have met Barbara’s family this week to discuss the complaint. Dr Jimmy Stuart, clinical director . for A&E at The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'This is a . sad and indeed tragic case and our sympathies go out to Mr Makovecz and . his family. 'Mrs . Makovecz presented to A&E at North Manchester General Hospital on . two occasions in July 2012 with back pain coming on after coughing . whilst 37 weeks pregnant. Mr Makovecz said: 'I was heartbroken when the doctors told us the cancer had returned, but I begged them not to give up on her because I hadn't' 'Mrs Makovecz was seen by two doctors who both inquired about the patient’s past medical history and there was no note of a past history of breast cancer made by either doctor. 'The patient was given appropriate pain relieving medication and discharged. There is no note of Mr or Mrs Makovecz requesting blood tests or scans. 'Mrs Makovecz unfortunately presented nine days later having had a seizure which was initially thought to be due to a complication of her pregnancy but turned out to be due to metastases on her brain. She died some weeks later. 'Mr Makovecz first complained to the trust in February 2013 and the Trust has met with him on three occasions. 'Our clinical director for A&E met with him within five days of the Trust receiving his complaint and there have been two further meetings with Mr Makovecz. We have been very open in our dealings with Mr Makovecz and a thorough investigation has been carried out.'","Barbara Makovecz, 44, went to North Manchester General Hospital suffering from back pain and breathing difficulties when she was 37 weeks pregnant .

Abuse of trust: Self-taught hypnotist Timothy Porter, 40, performed a vile act on a woman while she was in a trance . A man who hypnotised a married mother and made her perform sex acts is facing a prison sentence. Self-taught . hypnotist Timothy Porter exposed himself and made his patient fondle . her breasts during what was  supposed to be a weight-loss session in her . home. The startled victim woke from a trance after something touched her neck and saw the 40-year-old with his trousers down. Fitness . fanatic Porter, a former serviceman who was based at RAF Leeming in . North Yorkshire, had half a dozen treatment sessions with the mother of . three last year. Prosecutors . said Porter’s conduct and conversations became ‘sexualised’ at an early . stage of their meetings. In December, during a visit to the woman’s . home in North Yorkshire – while her children slept upstairs – he put her . into a hypnotic trance. She contacted police after ‘waking’ to find him with his trousers down and ordering her to touch herself. Porter, . now living in Blackburn, admitted causing a person to engage in sexual . activity when he appeared at Teesside Crown Court. He will be sentenced next month after background reports have been prepared by probation workers, and was given bail until then. It is thought Porter is married with a child, and he was accompanied at court yesterday by a woman. He honed his skills 'purely as a hobby' while reaching the rank of corporal in the RAF. Court papers reveal that he was due to leave the RAF around the time of the offence. On . one occasion, he asked his victim if she would like to experience . ‘heightened orgasms’. Porter had claimed that nothing sexual happened . during the visits to his victim’s home in the year leading up to the . offence. After he admitted . the charge, an interim order was made for him to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register. The length of the registration will depend on his sentence. A . source said: ‘It was when she was hypnotised that he started to become a . bit more lewd. 'He says there was nothing sexual in the lead-up to the . one incident, but her account is there was some untoward behaviour. ‘It’s simply not known if there are other clients, but he did bill himself as an amateur hypnotist.’ Advances: Teesside Crown Court that the woman had sought help with weight problems - but Porter also asked her if she wanted to experience 'heightened orgasms' Detective Constable Graeme Bevington that Porter had no formal qualifications as a hypnotherapist and appeared to be entirely self-taught. 'He told us he had performed hypnosis on other people,' the detective said. 'I don't think he has any qualifications, if there are formal qualifications. 'He said he had been practising and teaching himself for a number of years. It is never something he has done as a profession. It was purely a hobby.' Speaking about the victim, Det Con Bevington said: 'She is ok. She is pleased it is over and done with and is now looking forward to moving on. 'She is pleased he has been taken to court and brought to justice for what he has done, because she feels he has abused her trust. 'She was quite nervous about the court process and having to face him in court and give evidence, if he had not pleaded guilty and if it had been a trial.'","Woman had sought help from Timothy Porter, 40, for weight loss problems .

Deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year –  to one every week. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010. Drugs such as 'meow meow', 'Black Mamba' and 'Benzo Fury' were all legal when they were first produced, but have since been outlawed. Danger: 'Legal highs' such as mephedrone killed 52 people in England and Wales last year . However, banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused, which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics. Among legal highs, deaths involving a substance called cathinone tripled from six in 2011 to 18 in 2012. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs advises the Government on whether a drug should be banned or reclassified. This process led to new synthetic cannabinoids - such as those sold under the name Black Mamba - and methoxetamine, sold as 'Mexxy', being made Class B drugs last year. Deaths: Alex Herriot, left, died at a festival in Scotland last year while Adam Hunt, right, collapsed and died this month; both had taken synthetic party drugs . And in June this year, NBOMe and Benzo Fury, two groups of legal highs, were banned for 12 months using a temporary class drug order after advice from the ACMD. The best-known 'legal high' is mephedrone, known as 'MCAT' or 'meow meow', which was banned in 2010 but is still widely used as a party drug. Casualty: 20-year-old Aimee . Costello died after taking mephedrone on a . night out last year . Among those who died last year after taking synthetic drugs was Alex Herriot, a 19-year-old who collapsed at a music festival in Scotland in June soon after taking Benzo Fury. Another was 20-year-old Aimee Costello, who died following a night out during which she snorted MCAT given to her by friends . A 15-year-old boy, Ben O'Neill, raped a pensioner in August after consuming a cocktail of vodka and mephedrone. The fatalities continued this year, as just this month football-loving teenager Adam Hunt died after he took a legal high called AMT which was imported from the Netherlands. In its bulletin on deaths related to drug poisoning in England and Wales in 2012, the ONS also revealed the number of deaths involving painkiller tramadol has more than doubled since 2008 to 175 in 2012. There were 1,706 male drug poisoning deaths - involving both legal and illegal drugs - registered in 2012, a four per cent decrease since 2011. Female drug poisoning deaths have increased every year since 2009, reaching 891 in 2012, the ONS said. The number of male drug misuse deaths involving illegal drugs decreased by nine per cent from 1,192 in 2011 to 1,086 in 2012, while female deaths decreased by one per cent from 413 in 2011 to 410 in 2012. The highest mortality rate from drug misuse was in 30- to 39-year-olds, at 97.8 and 28.9 deaths per million population for males and females respectively in 2012. The number of deaths involving heroin or morphine fell slightly in 2012 to 579 deaths, but these remain the substances most commonly involved in drug poisoning deaths, the ONS said. Regionally, mortality rates from drug misuse were significantly higher in Wales than in England in 2012, at 45.8 and 25.4 deaths per million population respectively. In England, the North West had the highest mortality rate from drug misuse in 2012 at 41.0 deaths per million population. Popular: Legal highs have become a massive industry feeding Britain's hunger for psychoactive substances . Legal highs have always been available in some form or another, with partygoers long using freely available substances like amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide to get a fix. However, the recent explosion in legal high use came with the rise in popularity of a class of drugs known as cathinones, particularly mephedrone, from 2007 onwards. The drug, which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets. The effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of MDMA, amphetamine and cocaine. It is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy, but with the short-lived hit of a line of coke. Mephedrone's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet and when the substance was finally banned in 2010 a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place. Many of them were produced by laboratories in China and bought and imported by entrepreneurs using popular wholesale websites like Alibaba.com. However their purity was difficult to ascertain. One legal drug which followed mephedrone in rising to popularity was 6-APB, known commonly as Benzo Fury.  A molecule of the same phenethylamine class as MDMA, it marked a fresh attempt by enterprising chemists to circumvent drugs laws by slightly changing the chemical makeup of popular drugs. Those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators, with chemists synthesising new substances faster them Parliament can ban them, spawning a whole industry to feed Britain's hunger for mind-altering substances. However, unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known, the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery.","52 people died from 'legal highs' last year, up from just 29 in 2011 .

One in six families are ‘workless’, the fewest since records began in 1996, the Office for National Statistics has said. The ONS said 17.1 per cent of households have no adults aged 16 to 64 with a job, compared with 19.2 per cent when the Coalition came to power. Typically, those in workless houses are either looking for a job but unable to find one, or ‘inactive’, which covers anything from being a housewife to being too ill to work. The facts: The number of workless households has dropped to a new low since records began in 1996 . Bad news: There are still 500,000 people in Britain who have never worked for a variety of reasons . Households which do not have any working age adults are excluded from the figures. The . fall is an endorsement of Work and Pensions Minister Iain Duncan . Smith’s welfare reforms, designed to make finding work more attractive. Mark Hoban, the Employment Minister, said helping people off benefits is ‘one of this Government’s top priorities’. He . said: ‘By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are better . off in work than on benefits, and through schemes such as the Work . Programme and Youth Contract, we are giving people the support they need . to get a job.’ Since 2010, the number of workless households has dropped by around 427,000 to 3.5million. One in seven children, around 1.6million, live in a workless home The majority – 65 per cent – have a single parent.

The graph shows the percentage of workless households by region in the three months to June 2013 . The graph shows people in workless households by age group in the three months to June 2013 .

The ONS figures also show the number of households where no one has ever had a job is falling.There are 297,000 households ‘in which no adult has ever worked’, down 43,000 in a year. The ONS said the sharp fall in workless households over the last year, down by 182,000, was partly due to our ageing society. One-person . workless households with adults aged 50 to 64 saw the ‘greatest fall’, . but the number of such households with adults aged 65 and over grew. The report said this ‘is partly due to some workless households moving from the 16 to 64 age group to the 65 and over group’. So-called workless households stood at . 17.1 per cent in the three months to June, down from 17.9 per cent a . year ago and 19.2 cent in the same period in 2010.

Mobile network Three has kicked off a price war over the new 4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at no extra cost. The firm’s 1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet from £15 a month. Experts said the move will put pressure on rivals EE, Vodafone and O2, which have been counting on charging more for 4G. Mobile network Three announced it will offer the new 4G service at no extra cost . The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than at present. Users can download a song in four seconds or post a photograph to a social networking site in six seconds. They can stream – watch straight from the internet – movies, videos and television as easily and quickly as with a home computer. The Three deal will start in mid December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales. EE was first to launch 4G in the UK last October. It added a premium of £5 a month,  or £60 a year. The company made a series of price cuts this summer ahead of 4G launches by Vodafone, O2 and Three. It also said it would dramatically increase 4G speeds. Ernest Doku, a telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Three has really put the cat amongst the pigeons by simply offering 4G for no extra cost. The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than at present (file picture) ‘With all the big players now ready and raring to offer superfast mobile internet – and Three soon to change the game by giving it away – it won’t be long before competition heats up on all fronts.’ However, he pointed out that Three’s 4G will only be available in a few cities at first, while EE’s service covers 100. All 4G customers also need a compatible handset, which can cost up to £450. A Three spokesman said: ‘All customers with a 4G-ready device will be able to benefit from 4G at no extra cost with a simple software upgrade, so no need to go into a store.’ Three’s 4G service will start in London, Birmingham and Manchester in December. While mobile networks have spent billions on 4G licences, masts and technology, the operating costs for 4G are actually lower than for 3G. More data can be squeezed into a smaller slice of airwaves, making it cheaper to transmit vast amounts of information.","Three's customers will get 4G at same price they pay for current 3G network .

Although told his attentions were unwanted, he bombarded her with gifts, phone calls, invitations and notes declaring his love – eventually forcing Mrs Stanley to go to police, who handed the retired engineer a caution. But even that was not enough to stop Hodgson, 75, taking his campaign of harassment to more disturbing lengths. Colin Hodgson, 75, became England's oldest stalker after pleading guilty to stalking Bertha Stanley, 64 . When Mrs Stanley, 64, went to her late . husband’s grave on the anniversary of his death, she found her stalker . had beaten her to it – leaving behind a handwritten love letter in . anticipation of her arrival. Yesterday . the sailor’s obsession earned him a criminal record as he narrowly . escaped jail and was served with a restraining order barring him from . contacting Mrs Stanley. But . he remained apparently unrepentant, saying after the court case: ‘I . have been led down the garden path and stabbed in the back.' Hodgson . lives in a £400,000 cottage in the village of Copster Green in . Lancashire’s Ribble Valley, but spends much of his time staying on a . motor cruiser moored in Skippool Creek, near Poulton-le-Fylde, where he . also has a collection of yachts. He met the church warden in November . 2009 when she saw him sitting alone at St Anne’s Church in the village . of Singleton, close to his yacht club, a court heard. ‘They . started to chat,’ Don Green, prosecuting, told Blackpool Magistrates’ Court. ‘Later he discovered she was a florist and found out her work . phone number. He invited her to an event at his yacht club but she told . him she was a widow and not interested in a relationship. She said she . was flattered but did not want to go on a date.’ However, . the court heard that Hodgson started to make frequent calls to Mrs . Stanley and her staff, despite her making it clear that she did not want . a romance. Mr Hodgson met florist Mrs Stanley at St Anne's Church, in Singleton (pictured), where she was a church warden, before bombarding her with unwanted gifts, love letters and invitations for holidays . He invited . her on skiing holidays and even sent ski boots and clothing to her home. He would park his car opposite her shop, Fylde Flowers, and one note he . left declared: ‘I am in love with you and would go to the ends of the .

He began by finding out her telephone number and where she worked but after she refused a date he started to bombard her with calls. He invited her onto his yacht and on a ski holiday and sent her ski boots and clothing. Mr Hodgson waited outside her house and floristry business and referred to her as his 'lady friend'. He also sent her bizarre gifts including vitamins and a road sign. The 75-year-old was arrested after Mrs Stanley found a love letter he had left on her late husband's grave on the anniversary of his death. He had tracked down the date of his death and where his grave was positioned. He also . began to send bizarre gifts such as vitamins, a road sign and pottery, . as well as love poems, and referred to her as his ‘lady friend’. ‘This is a lengthy case involving this man’s unrequited love which turned obsessive,’ Mr Green said.

Guessing . she would be there, Hodgson had traced the grave and left another love . letter there. ‘She was shocked and personally violated,’ Mr Green said. Hodgson was arrested, telling police that he did not think what he had done was harassment.John . McLaren, defending, said: ‘My client thought he was helping someone but . she did not want help.

Last month it was revealed that her funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral cost £1.2million - just two pence for every person in Britain - far less than the figure of £10million originally suggested by critics. More than 2,300 mourners were at the ceremony. The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition to attend the funeral of a former prime minister for the first time since Winston Churchill. She was honoured with a sombre but spectacular funeral ceremony that paid tribute to the 'courage and perseverance' of Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister.

Then, at Christmas, she went to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder. When she came out she was very uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out of the question. So she moved quietly into a suite at the Ritz - one of her favourite places - and she was invited by its owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future.

Foul play: Emma Hickson describes the abuse she received from parents while refereeing as 'frightening' Shock: Emma's father has revealed his anger at the treatment his daughter was subjected to . 'I don't think I said there was swearing as such, but he did definitely call me a disgrace,' Hickson told Sportsmail. There were a few parents saying things like 'silly little b****', 't***' and things like that. 'At the end of the day, it is a kids football match. They just want to play football, I just want to ref and it shouldn't be taken that seriously. Hopefully, this will raise awareness of how much referee needs respect because people under-estimate how hard it is to be a referee until they actually take it up.' 'I've had the best support possible from Lancashire FA. We are currently working on it and have sent reports off. The people at the LFA are all behind me. They can concentrate a lot on protecting referees as well.' 'I think there was a Manchester/Liverpool rivalry at the play. I had walked off by that stage, when the parents were having a snap at each other. There was an element of that rivalry there. Platt . Lane will now be the subject of an investigation by Manchester FA and, if it finds against the club, . the punishment is expected to be severe as Hickson's young age makes . this incident a breach of the safeguarding children code. It’s sad but inevitable to hear her Dad speak of the advice he had given Emma, telling her to ‘expect a little bit of criticism, after all she is a referee’.The point is that the criticism and abuse of match officials is now so commonplace that it has become the accepted norm and all too often it goes unreported as local park refs take their lead from senior colleagues and ignore the abuse. ‘It comes with the territory’ seems the oft trodden path. I manage an Under 14 team and two seasons ago had to step in when an opposition parent harangued a young lady referee so much he made her cry – his team were allowed to play on and were merely warned as to their future conduct.In this case both teams were expelled from the tournament but all too often, no action is taken due to referees - understandably when alone and unprotected - decide that discretion is the better part of valour.Premier League referees have no such excuses; they just choose to ignore the excesses of the modern footballer and that sets the template for the game. The game took place at Whiteholme Playing Fields in Blackpool, during a tournament involving over 250 sides. Both clubs were sides were immediately expelled from the competition. Litherland Tigers Chairman John Ellinson told the Manchester Evening News: 'We will be writing to the girl who was refereeing and her mother to apologise for what happened. Apparently it was something and nothing that turned into a Liverpool/Manchester thing with the two sets of parents. We will be carrying out our own internal review.' However, Barry Macklin, the coach of Platt Lane City, has denied that the incident revolved around a Manchester/Liverpool rivalry. He told the M.E.N.: 'There was no animosity between our parents and theirs and this was not a Manchester/Liverpool thing as they claimed. 'I noticed before the match that the parents of the kids on the other team were stood on the touchline when they should have been behind a white taped line as ours were. 'I asked the referee for clarification and she said it was OK. As I walked off I got a few comments and one of their parents called me ""petty"".' He added: 'There were a few comments from the other side and it got a bit heated but there was no aggression from either set of parents and we certainly did not swear at the referee. 'She said the game was over and there was going to be penalties. I told her that she should have stopped it (the game, after a foul earlier in the match) but I wasn’t having a go at her. 'You could see she was upset and she ended up walking away.' Emma's father added: 'When she decided to go down this route, you expect a little bit of criticism - she's a referee - so obviously we had talks about that. But on this scale, I'd never imagined it, and certainly not in an Under 9 competition. 'Not only should you pay respect to the referee but you have little children in football, coming up through the age groups. It is no example to set. The FA spend a fortune on respect for referees and it has got to start at grassroots.' Manchester County FA pledged to investigate the incident, in a statement. Target: Hickson believes the Liverpool-Manchester rivalry played its part in the incident . It read: 'Manchester County FA has been made aware of the alleged incident from this weekend’s game and is currently investigating the matter. 'It would therefore be inappropriate for us to make any further comment regarding that specific case at this time. 'The vast majority of football matches in Manchester occur without incident. When discipline does occur, however, it is dealt with as per FA Rules and Regulations. 'Abuse of referees is always wholly unacceptable and where necessary Manchester County FA will continue to address poor behaviour with the use of sanctions, educational workshops and the Respect campaign.' MailOnline have contacted Manchester City but are yet to receive a comment at the time of publishing.","Litherland Tigers JFC pledge to write to Emma Hickson and apologise .

Prosecution: Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital after staff failed to give her insulin. The Health and Safety Executive will now prosecute Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust . The hospital trust at the centre of one of the worst care scandals in living memory is to be prosecuted over the death of a patient from neglect. Mid Staffordshire is to be taken to court by the Health and Safety Executive after a 66-year-old woman died when nurses failed to realise she suffered from diabetes. The NHS trust will be prosecuted as an organisation, meaning that individual nurses, doctors and managers will not face jail for their failings. Hundreds of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire between 2005 and 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned that many others had suffered inhumane abuse. Gillian Astbury, who suffered from diabetes, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in April 2007  following a fall at home. She was put under the care of a team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed to realise she was diabetic and needed regular doses of insulin. She fell into a coma and died ten days after first being admitted on to the ward. Her friend and carer, Ron Street, said that when he went to visit her she was often in soiled bed linen and her meals would be left out of reach. The HSE began investigating the death in April, having postponed its probe until after the publication in February of a major report following a public inquiry into the scandal. Deaths: Up to 1,200 people died needlessly at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital . It has now concluded that there is . enough evidence to charge the trust under the Health and Safety at Work . Act, for failing to protect others against risks to health and safety. The . first hearing will be in October at Stafford Magistrates Court, but the . case could go on for several months before reaching a verdict. Peter . Galsworthy, head of operations of the HSE in the West Midlands, said: . ‘We have concluded our investigation into the death of Gillian Astbury . at Stafford Hospital and have decided there is sufficient evidence and . it is in the public interest to bring criminal proceedings in this case. ‘HSE will be charging Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust under Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act. ‘Gillian Astbury died on April 11 2007, of diabetic ketoacidosis, when she was an inpatient at the hospital. The prosecution follows an investigation launched earlier this year by the HSE into Mrs Astbury¿s death . ‘The . immediate cause of death was the failure to administer insulin  to a . known diabetic patient. Our case alleges that the trust failed to . devise, implement or properly manage structured and effective systems of . communication for sharing patient information, including in relation to . shift handovers and record-keeping.’ Families of the Stafford Hospital victims and union chiefs called for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign . If . the trust is found guilty of the charge of a gross failure to provide . basic care, it could be fined tens of thousands of pounds. The . HSE said it was not the first time a hospital trust had been prosecuted . under the law but there have been only a handful of cases. Although . the proceedings are not being brought against individuals, two of the . nurses involved face being struck off following professional hearings. Last . month the Nursing and Midwifery Council ruled that Jeanette Coulson and . Ann King had failed to keep Mrs Astbury’s records up to date or carry . out blood tests.

Exposed: Some doctors have been encouraged to refer most of their patients to private firms for treatments and scans . Hospital consultants and GPs are being bribed by private healthcare firms to send patients for expensive treatment, according to a report. Doctors have been offered bonuses of up to £50,000 if they promise to refer most of their patients for scans and treatment at private clinics. Officials have also uncovered evidence that doctors are encouraging patients to pay for procedures they do not need to pocket the cash. Firms are also offering doctors . incentives including free receptionists and consulting rooms – saving . them thousands of pounds – in return for referring patients to their . hospital. A report by the . Competition Commission watchdog has called for such schemes to be . banned, warning that they are leading to patients paying millions in . excess charges. It says patients routinely pay twice as much as they . should for private scans and tests because the industry is monopolised . by a handful of firms that set prices too high. These . include BMI, which has 65 private hospitals in the UK; Spire, which has . 38; and HCA, which has six hospitals and four medical centres. The report points out that this in turn raises patients’ premiums for private health insurance. Good service: Doctors have been offered up to £50,000 bonuses and incentives such as free receptionists to encourage them to refer their patients to private clinics . Health insurers have no choice but to pay the high costs for private scans, operations and consultants for their customers and as a result raise their premiums. The watchdog calculates patients have collectively been paying out up to £193million over the odds every year in health insurance premiums and direct payments for treatment. Its chairman, Roger Witcomb, said: ‘The lack of competition in the healthcare market at a local level means that most private patients are paying more than they should either for private medical insurance or for self-funded treatment. ‘We’ve also seen the existence of a range of incentives which encourage medical professionals to choose facilities on grounds other than price and quality. We struggle to believe these can be in the interests of patients.’ Private: Spire, which runs 38 hospitals including this one in Bristol, is one of the firms reported to have been offering the incentives . While the watchdog opposes such incentives, they are not illegal. It did not state how many consultants were involved in such schemes nor how much they had been paid. But the Mail is aware of one orthopaedic consultant who was offered £50,000 by BMI in exchange for referring three quarters of his patients for treatment at their private Bath Clinic hospital, which he refused. The watchdog also uncovered a scheme in which GPs were being paid an unknown amount by BMI to refer patients to its Bath Clinic. Previous reports suggest that 15 per cent of the 40,000 consultants in England have been offered incentives by private firms. Many consultants work both for the NHS and privately. Stephen Collier, chief executive of BMI Healthcare, said he ‘rejected absolutely’ that the firm made profits at the expense of patients and insisted all money made was ploughed back into better care. Rob Roger, chief executive of Spire Healthcare, said he ‘strongly disagreed’ with the report, adding: ‘We believe these findings are based on an unrealistic assessment of the markets in which we operate and the level of investment necessary to operate a high-quality hospital.’ HCA said it ‘welcomed transparency’ in consultant incentives but added that it was disappointed that the report had ignored the benefits of the firm’s healthcare.","Private firms offering doctors incentives such as bonuses and free receptionists in return for referrals .

Most people who stumble upon ancient mummies run for the hills and call the police, but one Chinese farmed saw an opportunity for treasure.

Days later, villagers in Jiazhuang, Shandong . province, discovered the mutilated remains floating in the local pond . with their broken caskets. Return of the mummy: Horrified villagers discovered the mutilated remains floating in the local pond after a farmer dug up the graves . ‘It was like something from a horror film. It was like they were coming back to haunt their tormentor,’ said one. Mr Miao admitted to dumping the bodies in the water after digging up an ancient burial site to make way for a new building. ‘He also thought that being ancient, the tombs might contain some treasure,’ said a police spokesman. ‘Jewellery found on the bodies was split between Mr Miao and his friends, who had helped him,’ they added.

Chinese burial traditions see many cemeteries or tombs located on hillsides. A high resting place is seen as a good omen. One of the reasons for China's tough laws on the desecration of graves and tombs derives from the closing of the casket. At the funeral, the coffin is nailed shut with mourners turned away from the casket as it is thought to be a bad omen to watch. After this 'holy paper' is pasted onto the coffin to protect it from holy spirits, which would be broken if it was ever opened.","Farmer found looted mummified bodies after digging up graves .

A survey by the Good Pub Guide showed drinkers in Staffordshire enjoy the cheapest ale at an average of just £2.95 a pint while those in London are forced to fork out £3.60. Drinkers in Derbyshire, Shropshire, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and Country Durham can all raise a toast to enjoying prices of little over £3 a pint. Hard to swallow: Beer drinkers are forking out 65p more for a pint in London than they do in Staffordshire . But boozers in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Sussex must drown their sorrows with the knowledge they are being forced to fork out far above the national average of £3.20. Beer brewed by pubs themselves, on the premises, typically cost 40p a pint less than the local average, the guide found. Good Pub Guide spokesman Fiona Stapley told the Daily Mirror: 'People in Staffs have an eye for value and some licencees go to great lengths looking for bargains for customers. Staffordshire, known for its beautiful canals and potteries, sells some of the cheapest beer in Britain with pints costing an average of £2.95 . 'In the South East, big brewers used to own most pubs, which tended to limit the competition. 'But I think people in the South East are simply less careful with their money.' The Guide predicts that  around 4,000 . pubs will close in the next year because they are 'stuck in the 1980s', . offering indifferent drink and food, according to a new guide. More than 1,000 new pubs are expected to open, often in former hostelries which have been shuttered for years. Between 2,500 and 4,000 will go out of business, but the guide quotes a successful landlord saying there are too many pubs in the wrong place, chasing the wrong market. Watering hole: The Olive Branch pub in Clipsham, Rutland, was named Pub of the Year . 'The bad pubs are still being culled, just like lions pick off the slowest of the herd. It makes the pub industry more robust and far better placed for the future,' he said. The guide said standards are improving in pubs, amid increasing vocational training among staff, but it called for pubs to name their chefs on menus as part of moves to close the ""absurd status gap"" between TV chefs and those working in pubs. When the guide was launched in 1983 there were a handful of national beer brands, but now more than 7,000 beers are on offer, produced by hundreds of brewers. The Pub of The Year was named as the Olive Branch in Clipsham, Rutland, with other awards including the best landlord (Tim Gray of the Yew Tree in Lower Wield, Hampshire), brewery (Fuller, Smith & Turner), new pub (Bulls Head, Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire), dining pub (Stagg, Titley, Herefordshire) and whisky pub (Bon Accord, Glasgow). More than 4,700 pubs are featured in the guide.","Drinkers in Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and Country Durham enjoy the cheapest ale .

Angela Merkel has admitted that Greece should never have been allowed to join the euro back in 2001, stating that is when the financial troubles began leading to the eurozone's current economic strife. The German chancellor blamed her predecessor Gerhard Schroder for the 'wrong decision'. She made the speech during an election rally in front of 1,000 supporters yesterday in the northern German town of Rendsburg. Blame: Angela Merkel has admitted that Greece should never have been allowed to join the euro back in 2001, stating that is when the financial woes began that led to the eurozone's current economic strife . She said the debt crisis that emerged in Greece in late 2009 and dominated her second term had been 'brewing for many years,' reported Bloomberg. 'For example, Greece shouldn’t have been allowed into the euro' she said referring to the 2001 admission. 'Chancellor Schroeder accepted Greece in and weakened the Stability Pact and both decisions were fundamentally wrong, and one of the starting points for our current troubles.' The current issue of pouring more money into . stricken Greece comes at a difficult time for . Merkel, who faces an election next month in which she is tipped to win a . third term in power. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder (L) waves to the audience as he supports Social Democratic top candidate Peer Steinbrueck (SPD) (second left) during an election campaign in Hanover. Steinbrueck will challenge Merkel at Germany's general elections . A survey is warning that some 40,000 small businesses in Greece are likely to close in the second half of 2013 at a cost of up to 90,000 jobs despite a major bank rescue program implemented before the summer. However, the small business survey conducted between July 10 and 16 and published Tuesday found that the 50 billion euro ($66.7 billion) bank recapitalization was likely to result in a modest decline in the rate of closures, from an estimated 55,000 in the first half of the year. Needs bail: Finance minister Yannis Stournaras wants another £8.6bn for Greece . Greece's conservative-led coalition government has promised to lead the cash-strapped country out of recession and return to bond markets next year. The bank rescue program was part of the country's second international bailout and considered central to returning Greece to financial health. Earlier this week Greece said it wants another £8.6billion bailout to stay afloat – but said  it will not accept any more  austerity measures. Finance minister Yannis Stournaras said the country requires more help on top of the  £206billion it has already received in two rescue packages. There are now widespread fears that even this vast sum is not enough to plug the hole in its finances and that a third tranche of financial help is a virtual certainty, though it is expected to be on a much smaller scale. ‘If there is need for further support for Greece it will be around 10 billion euros (£8.6bn), or much smaller than the previous programmes,’ Stournaras said. ‘We are not talking about a new bailout but an economic support package without new (austerity) terms.’ A number of other high ranking European figures have already made it plain they believe a third bailout for Athens is unavoidable. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the powerful Eurogroup of finance ministers, said last week it was ‘inevitable’ a further financial lifeline would have to be extended to save Greece from collapse. Closures: Small business groups warned Tuesday that the rate of store closures in Grreece expected to remain high in the second half of 2013 . Protests: Striking employees of the Greek Agriculture Ministry hold a discussion as they block the entrance of the main building of the ministry protesting against a mobility scheme of the public servants decided by the Greek government . Anger: Workers at the large state-run mining and metallurgical company LARKO hold a banner reading 'No to layoffs' in central Athens during a rally against the privatisation of the company . Germany’s commissioner to the European . Commission, Guenther Oettinger, also said over the weekend that he . expects a fresh lifeboat of around 10 billion euros. ‘It . will be a manageable sum. I personally expect the figure to be a little . over 10 billion euros. The programme should cover the years 2014-2016, . he told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. Opposition parties accuse Merkel of hiding the risks of more Greek aid before the polls. As . the eurozone’s largest economy, Germany has the biggest exposure to . Greece. Many German voters are resistant to funnelling yet more cash to . prop up heavily indebted southern Eurozone members. The . German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, last week started the . debate about Greece by saying it would need fresh emergency aid to stay . afloat. Talk of a new . bailout for the troubled country prompted renewed fears for the . Eurozone, which recently clawed its way out of the longest recession in . its history. Greece remains mired in its sixth year of slump with record unemployment. The . International Monetary Fund  estimated last month that Greece would . face a funding gap of nearly  11 billion euros (£9,5bn) for 2014-2015. Angela Merkel has repeatedly warned about writing off Greek debt or ‘taking a haircut’. She . said: ‘I am expressly warning against a haircut. It could trigger a . domino effect of uncertainty with the result that the readiness of . private investors to invest in the Eurozone again falls to nothing.’ The . Eurozone as a whole grew by 0.3pc in the second quarter of 2013, edging . out of an 18 month-long recession, the longest downturn since the . single currency was founded. But . analysts from Capital Economics said: ‘The return to modest rates of . economic growth in the eurozone as a whole won’t address the deep-seated . economic and fiscal problems of the peripheral countries.’","The German chancellor blamed her predecessor Gerhard Schroder .

Perhaps one of the most defining features of humanity is people's capacity for empathy – the ability to put ourselves in others' shoes. A new study has added to a growing body of scientific evidence that the human brain is not only hardwired to empathise with others, but does this so strongly that individuals cannot differentiate between what happens to a close friend or family member and themselves. Scientists found humans are hardwired to empathise as we associate with people emotionally close to us, but are largely incapable of empathising so strongly with strangers. A new study has added to a growing body of scientific evidence that the human brain is not only hardwired to empathise with others, but does this so strongly that individuals cannot differentiate between what happens to a close friend or family member and themselves . James Coan, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, said: 'With familiarity, other people become part of ourselves.' 'Our self comes to include the people we . feel close to,' he said to conclude that humans' self-identity is largely . based on whom we know and empathise with. To come up with this conclusion, he used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to examine the brains of 22 young adults who were made to feel 'under threat' of receiving mild electrical shocks to themselves as well as to a friend and stranger. Scientists scanned the brains of 22 adults 'under threat' of electric shocks to themselves, a friend and a stranger. A coloured MRI is pictured . The researchers found, as they expected, . that regions of the brain responsible for threat response – the anterior . insula, putamen and supramarginal gyrus – became active under threat of . shock to the self. In the case of threat of shock to a stranger, the brain in those regions displayed little activity. However, when the threat of shock was to a friend, . the brain activity of the participant became essentially identical to . the activity displayed under threat to the self. Dr Coan said: 'The correlation between self and friend was remarkably similar.' 'The finding shows the brain's remarkable . capacity to model self to others; that people close to us become a part . of ourselves and that is not just metaphor or poetry, it's very real. 'Literally we are under threat when a friend is under threat. But not so . when a stranger is under threat,' he said. Dr Coan believes the reason for this response is because humans need to have friends and allies who they can side with and see as being the same as themselves and as people spend more time together, they become more similar. He said: 'It's essentially a breakdown of self and other; our self comes to include the people we become close to...If a friend is under threat, it becomes the same as if we ourselves are under threat. 'We can understand the pain or difficulty they may be going through in the same way we understand our own pain.' The study found the correlation between self and friend was remarkably similar. Dr Coen said: 'People close to us become a part of ourselves...literally we are under threat when a friend is under threat. But not so when a stranger is under threat' Dr Coan said in the study, which was published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, this is probably the source of empathy and part of the evolutionary process. He explained a threat to ourselves is also a threat to our resources needed to survive. 'Threats can take things away from us. But when we develop friendships, people we can trust and rely on who in essence become we, then our resources are expanded, we gain. 'Your goal becomes my goal. It's a part of our survivability,' he added.","U.S. scientists have discovered a person's self comes to include people that they feel close to .

Memory 'sports' are the latest trend for intellectuals across the world to show off their mental prowess. The annual UK Open Memory Champions took place at London's Science Museum on Thursday and the intense event involved ten contestants lining up in front of chief arbiter of the World Memory Sports Council, Phil Chambers, as he put them through two days of rigorous memory tests. Tests include memorising as many decks of playing cards as possible, or recalling lists of thousands of binary digits. Chambers has now revealed some of the memory tips and insider secrets revealing exactly how memory masters are able to remember thousands and thousands of binary digits, in order. One method memory masters use to remember sequences of playing cards, or rows of numbers, is to assign them with particular celebrities, actions or objects. For example, the Queen of Hearts, left, could be assigned to Princess Diana, right. Stories are then made up using these people, actions or objects . Most playing cards memorised - 1,456 (28 decks), held by Ben Pridmore . Number of binary digits remembered in 30 minutes - 4,140, held by Ben Pridmore . Number of binary digits memorised in five minutes - 1,016, held by Ola Kara Rise . The first step, Chambers said, is to stop looking at the digits as numbers and start seeing them as everyday objects, because this makes them easier to recall. Chambers told The Times that the most effective way to do this is to use playing cards in place of numbers, and then assign certain attributes to these cards. For example, the ace card is one, the rest of the cards go in sequence and then a picture card can be 10. In the case of having to remember binary digits, another picture card could be used as 11. One method is to convert the names of the cards into the initials of a famous person - the Ace of Hearts converts to 'AH', which could be Adolf Hitler. The Six of Clubs would become SC, or Simon Cowell, and so on. It's also possible to take this method a step further and assign playing cards with celebrities, actions and objects. This makes it possible to pair cards together to form longer digits, and helps create stories that make it possible to remember the order of the digits. Memory expert Phil Chambers assigns the Four of Diamonds, left, with Neil Diamond, right, singing a song at a piano. He then creates stories such as Princess Diana met Neil Diamond, which becomes Queen of Hearts followed by Four of Diamonds, or the number 10 followed by the number four in a sequence . For example, Chambers said he assigns Princess Diana as the Queen of Hearts. The action is 'waving' and the object is a rose. Neil Diamond singing a song at a piano is what Chambers uses for the Four of Diamonds, while the the Ace of Clubs is Tiger Woods and a golf tee. A simpler method could be to use a person's initials, such as Adolf Hitler (AH) for the Ace of Hearts, for example . Chambers then creates a story using these, for example, Princess Diana saw Neil Diamond when they went to see Tiger Woods play golf. This technique has the double benefit of being able to remember sequences of playing cards, but the numbers on the cards can also be used to remember strings of random digits. This would be 10, for the picture card of the Queen of Hearts, four for the Four of Diamonds and one for the Ace of Clubs. This sentence helps Chambers remember the sequence of numbers 1041, or alternatively, in the case of binary digits, 1011111 - where the number four is converted into four individual umber ones. To reduce the amount of names, for example, this could also become Tiger Woods played a piano to a woman holding a rose. This would be the Ace of Clubs and the Queen of Hearts followed by the Four of Diamonds, also known as 1104 or 1101111. This method provides enough variables to remember thousands of digits and the current world record is 4,140 held by Ben Pridmore.","Method involves assigning people, actions and objects to playing cards .

'Catastophic' collapse: Sam Harper Brighouse, 23, who died after collapsing during the Brighton Marathon . A fit and healthy young man died following a 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' collapse as he ran a marathon, an inquest has heard. Sam Harper Brighouse, 23, from south-east London died, fell ill around 16 miles into the race as he competed in the Brighton Marathon in East Sussex on April 14 this year. The biology graduate had embarked on the 26-mile running challenge to raise money for the Arms Around The Child charity which supports Aids orphans. Although he had asthma, he was . considered fit and his respiratory problems had not contributed to his . sudden collapse, an inquest at Brighton County Court heard. Instead, . Mr Harper Brighouse, of Forrest Hill, died after suffering from . ischemic bowel disease, which can cause up to 75 per cent of blood flow . to be removed from the bowel. Dr . Mark Taylor, consultant pathologist at Brighton's Royal Sussex County . Hospital, said the condition is initially reversible but can progress, . leading to fatal circumstances. Dr . Taylor told the hearing: 'We know that up to half of people who run . marathons develop symptoms relating to their gastro-intestines. 'They . can be minor stomach cramps, diahorrea, but on the other end of the . scale, ischemic bowel can be exhibited in endurance exercise.' He . added: 'When it gets to that critical stage, depending on how much of . the bowel has died, depends on whether the person can survive. 'Unfortunately in Sam, it was catastrophic and unsurvivable.' It . was initially thought that Mr Harper Brighouse had suffered a heart . attack, and attempts were made at CPR as he laid in the road. But . Mr Harper Brighouse went into cardiac arrest and his death from . ischemic bowel, described by Brighton and Hove coroner Veronica . Hamilton-Deeley as 'extraordinarily rare and unusual', was confirmed at . 2.30pm. Event: Runners compete during this year's Brighton Marathon. Mr Harper Brighouse, 23, fell ill around 16 miles into the race . Dr . Taylor said: 'I think when someone collapses in a marathon, the most . common thing to think is that they have had a heart attack. 'The . initial reaction would have been to do CPR and that was started . rapidly. If he had been taken to hospital immediately, might it have . made a difference? I don't think so. 'I . believe all his bowel was dead at that stage and even if (medical . staff) thought of ischemic bowel, it wouldn't have been any help at all . at that stage.' Mr . Harper Brighouse probably did not notice he had ischemic bowel as its . 'non-specific' symptoms, such as pain and discomfort, may have led him . to believe they were linked to his running. Gastro-intestinal . problems suffered by people associated with endurance sport were being . increasingly examined in studies, Dr Taylor added. Attempting . to reach Mr Harper Brighouse amid the crowds of marathon runners and . spectators was difficult, a senior South East Coast Ambulance Service . (Secamb) staff member said. Although Mr Harper Brighouse had asthma, he was considered fit and his respiratory problems had not contributed to his sudden collapse . The . marathon had its own medical team but Andrew Parker, Secamb's medicines . management lead and paramedic practitioner, said clearer identification . would have helped to distinguish who was who on site. He . also told the inquest of a 'communication confusion', with marshals . unable to tell him where Mr Harper Brighouse was as he ran for about 500 . yards through the large crowds carrying equipment. 'When I asked a couple of the marshals 'Where's the incident?', they said 'I don't know'.' As Mr Parker went on to the race track, he could see people waving at him, alerting him to Mr Harper Brighouse's position. Mr . Parker said: 'In reality, it only took me minutes, as I did run as fast . as I could, but obviously minutes in any cardiac incident is crucial.' He . said the problems could have been helped by having more markers along . the race route, rather than ones that marked every mile. Ms . Hamilton-Deeley suggested a possible solution: equipping runners with a . gas canister-activated buoy which would rise above the crowds in an . emergency. She said: 'This could mean that you are looking up rather through a sea of people.' Despite the difficulties, Mr Parker praised the level of care Mr Harper Brighouse received from the medical team, saying it was to a 'high standard'. And he did not think the access problems he encountered ultimately affected the patient. Speaking about Mr Harper Brighouse, he said: 'He had no heartbeat, no pulse and no breathing. 'From the small amount of history at the event, it was a sudden collapse. I don't think he would have known anything about it.' The inquest is due to last until Friday.","Sam Harper Brighouse fell ill around 16 miles into  the Brighton Marathon .

If you thought this glorious late summer sunshine was a perfect occasion for picnics, think again. A plague of wasps has struck Britain - and they're heading for a hamper near you. Experts today warned that the late spring and long winter have allowed the stinging insects a long and undisturbed hibernation. Scroll down for video . Attack: Billions of wasps are hitting Britian as the late summer brings them abundant food supplies . Experts said that after a few bad years for wasps caused by a run of dreary, wet summers, this year's conditions had given the creatures a boost - contributing to a population explosion that is only starting to unleash its full effect. Billions of the airborne menaces are . emerging from their nests and taking to the skies for their annual . feeding frenzy around three weeks later than in previous years. A . bumper crop of fruit this year is likely to keep the creatures going . until they either die or go into hibernation after the Autumn. And . with plenty of insects to feed on and a dry end to the summer - not to . mention all those sugary drinks lying around by people making the most . of a sunny end to the summer holidays - the wasps are more than making . up for their late arrival. Victim: Susan Bruce with her seven-year-old Cocker Spaniel Betty, who were both attacked by a swarm of wasps . A swarm nearly claimed the life of one cocker spaniel in Tentsmuir Forest near Fife Scotland. The seven-year-old dog, named Betty, went into anaphylactic shock when she was stung more than 130 times. Owner Susan Bruce, 35, who is a vet . with the PDSA animal charity in Dundee, said: 'It was terrifying. They really went for . Betty. There were so many that she was completely covered. 'We tried to outrun them, but they got hold of Betty. There were so many wasps in her coat. Danger zones: the UKWaspWatch site shows London as the area of the UK worst hit by wasps this year . 'We tried to fight them off but they stung us too. It was particularly bad for Betty and she collapsed at the side of the path.' Betty survived after being rushed to the vet, where she was treated with strong steroids and spent the night under observation. When . the vets later posted details of the incident on their Facebook page, . several people replied, saying they had also been attacked by wasps. The hotspot for wasps appears to . be in London, according to pest controller Rentokil, which has set up . an interactive website to allow users to log wasp sightings and rate . them by severity. Swarm: The insects are amassing in greater numbers and later than in previous years . The capital is followed by Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and the South West of England, according to the UKWaspWatch site. Stuart Roberts, chairman of the Bee, Wasps and Ants Recording Society, said: 'Only four weeks ago I was being asked where all the wasps had gone. 'Firstly, we had a really cold winter which meant that hibernation was more successful than usual. 'The . worst thing the wasp queen can have is a warm winter because they . fidget and use up the food reserves. I suspect this has had an effect on . mortality. Sticking around: The wasps are likely to remain on the scene until the end of the Autumn, when they die or go into hibernation . 'And of course, we have had some quite reasonable weather this year. 'This . year I would say the wasps - like everything else in the insect world - . are about three weeks late because of the lateness of Spring. 'The . late Spring, I suspect, has meant they have just stayed in hibernation . for longer, and have been delayed by the cold weather. 'And . simply, a warmer drier summer is good for wasps because for a start if . you have got a really dreary winter, the queen can’t get hold of the . food and you get massive mortality.","Wasp population increased on last few years .

An 'exceptionally rare' pocket-sized calculator from the 17th Century is expected to attract £100,000 at auction. The Arithmetical machine is one of the first mechanical calculating devices known to exist and is the first portable device. The antique 'pocket calculator' will go under the hammer at Christie's in October and is one of three examples of the design to have survived. The Arithmetical machine (pictured) is one of the first mechanical calculating devices known to exist and is the first portable device. It was crafted by René Grillet de Roven, the French instrument by Parisian mechanician and watchmaker to His Royal Highness King Louis XIV . The wooden machine measures around 15cm in width and 32cm in length and dates from 1673. It was crafted by René Grillet de Roven, who was a Parisian mechanician and watchmaker to His Royal Highness King Louis XIV. The calculator will be offered in Christie's biannual sale of travel, science and natural history objects on 10 October 2013 and is expected to realise between £70,000 and £100,000. James Hyslop, head of Travel, Science and Natural History at the auction house, said: 'This pocket-sized calculator is one of the earliest surviving pieces in the history of the computer.' 'Mechanical calculators date from the 1640s, but were big clunky brass machines. This small lightweight machine, based on Napier’s logarithm was one of the earliest portable designs.' Blaise Pascal's calculating machine - another 17th Century mechanical marvel - is pictured. Made of metal, it is not as light-weight as Mr Grillet's wooden machine but together the calculators are some of the earliest inventions in the history of the computer . The 17th century marked the beginning of the history of mechanical calculators . Blaise Pascal is credited with inventing the very first calculator in 1642 . His machine that could perform computations that where previously thought to be only humanly possible . The 17th century also saw the invention of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like Napier's bones, logarithmic tables and the slide rule which, popularly used  by scientists of the day  in multiplying and dividing . The calculating device, contained in a walnut wooden box, comprises 24 rotating dials arranged in three rows of eight located on the interior lid. Each wheel consists of several concentric circles, while the bottom of the box contains a set of rolling cylinders carrying logarithmic tables. The Arithmetical machine performs all the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division through the use of these rolling rotating Napier's 'bones'. Mr Grillet exhibited his pocket-sized machine during the 1670s and 1680's at markets and fairs throughout Paris and the Netherlands. There are only three other known examples of this design, two of which are in the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris and the other in the collections of IBM in New York.","Arithmetical machine one of the first mechanical calculating devices .

When Judge Mrs Justice Eleanor King ruled that a disabled man could be sterilised last week, her controversial decision became a national talking point. But for Alison Thorpe, 51, the landmark ruling came as a welcome surprise. Like the parents of the 37-year-old man, Alison has fought long and hard to get a hysterectomy for her severely disabled daughter Katie. And although it might sound cold-hearted, Alison, from Billericay in Essex, insists that removing her daughter's womb is the best thing for her - and will spare her pain. Tragedy: Alison Thorpe with her severely disabled daughter Katie, 21, who has the mental age of a baby . Difficult: Alison says Katie goes through excruciating pain each month when her period begins . In an interview with Closer magazine, Alison explained that she has wanted a medical intervention for Katie, 21, who has the mental age of a six-month-old, since she began her periods. Katie has severe cerebral palsy and cannot walk, talk or feed herself. But despite her condition, NHS medical experts insist that a hysterectomy wouldn't be in Katie's best interests. 'Every month when Katie has her period, she screams and writhes in agony,' explains her mother. It's heartbreaking. Katie can't make choices in life, so why - as her mother who has cared for her for over 20 years - should that choice not be placed with me?' Katie's condition was caused by being starved at oxygen at birth and was diagnosed when she was just four months old. Devastated, it took Alison months to recover although a local support group came to her aid. Now in her 20s, Katie still has the mental age of a six-month-old baby but has come to enjoy the presence of horses and the sight of sensory lights. Suffering: Katie, who has severe cerebral palsy, cannot walk or talk and has the mental age of a six-month-old . Cause: Katie's condition was caused by being starved of oxygen at birth and was diagnosed at four months . Landmark: The ruling made by Mrs Justice Eleanor King has inspired Alison, whose story appears in Closer . In 2005, as puberty began, Alison got in touch with her GP to raise the possibility of sterilisation and was referred to a gynaecologist. But instead of a hysterectomy, the gynaecologist suggested the Pill or contraceptive injections instead - neither of which, Alison says, were suitable for Katie. Rejecting the gynaecologist's advice, she battled on, taking her case to a succession of NHS boards, before the move was finally denied by a panel of doctors in 2008. 'Losing the case was heartbreaking,' Alison told Closer. 'I couldn't fathom why they couldn't see how much Katie needed it. When they said it was against her human rights, I could have cried.' And then, her worst fears were realised. When Katie eventually began her periods at the age of 19 in 2011, the effect was traumatic. According to her mother, she screamed and screamed and beyond giving Katie paracetamol, there was nothing Alison could do. Now she hopes to take her daughter's case to the High Court in the wake of the latest ruling - and hopes a similar verdict will result. 'This ruling has given me hope that one day Katie will be able to have the operation,' she says. 'Her condition is incurable, but if I could take away this pain once a month, I could finally feel like I was doing something to make her physically better.'

A father threatened to kill his neighbour and spewed a string of foul-mouthed abuse at councillors after having a planning application refused. Brett Palin, 49, launched the tirade after he was informed that councillors had turned down a retrospective planning application for changes to an extension at his Heywood home. Bury Magistrates were told the ‘red mist’ descended on father of three Palin and he threw a table across the room before running to councillors before showering them with expletives. He is said to have threatened neighbour Adel Dawe, telling her 'You are f****** dead. I’ll f****** kill you.' Brett Palin (pictured with partner Angela Keith) threatened to kill his neighbour and launched a foul-mouthed tirade at councillors after having a planning application refused . Mrs Dawe said: 'The speech was peppered with swearing. Every other word was effing and jeffing. You couldn’t put a pin between swearwords.' Allen Brett, who was sitting on the committee, said: 'It was a bit surreal. In 20 years of sitting on the council this is the first time I’ve had an incident like this. I was completely appalled by his behaviour.' However, Palin, who has lived at the house for 10 years, denied threatening anyone and said it was ‘ridiculous’ so much had been made of the incident. Palin and his partner Angela Keith, 39, have been involved in a dispute with his neighbours and the council planning department since 2009 after a two-storey extension was built at his home. In 2010, he decided to change the layout of the extension and alter a window - which required retrospective planning permission. But when the application went before the licensing and regulatory committee, the court heard that councillors also asked Palin to reduce the size of an existing balcony. When he refused they moved to reject planning permission - and that’s when Palin is said to have flown into a rage. Magistrates heard a 'red mist' descended on Palin when retrospective planning permission for changes to an extension at his Heywood home were denied at a town hall meeting in February . Palin, who runs a taxi business, admitted swearing out of frustration at the request. But he said: 'All this over a window, it’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s a shame it’s gone this far because we used to be good friends with our neighbours. 'For the whole of the meeting we were calm and made our points. I may have sworn a couple of times at the end out of frustration, but I didn’t threaten anyone. 'We just feel victimised.

Reality TV mom Kate Gosselin has filed a lawsuit accusing her ex-husband and former co-star, Jon Gosselin, of stealing her hard drive and hacking into her phone and computer to get material for a tell-all book. A federal lawsuit filed in Philadelphia on Monday by the mother-of-eight, who starred in 'Jon & Kate Plus 8' between 2007 and 2011, claims that he stole the material for a book called 'Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled the World' without her permission. The suit says that the book was written by her ex-husband's friend, tabloid writer Robert Hoffman, but has since been pulled from Amazon because the material was obtained illegally. The couple starred in the TV show 'Jon & Kate Plus 8', which detailed life with their twins and sextuplets. After they separated in 2009 and went through a famously bitter divorce, only Kate continued on the show with the children.

Apart: Kate accused Jon and a reporter friend of using the information to create a defamatory book about her . The suit claims that Hoffman even boasted about having 5000 family photos, personal documents, tax and business records and contracts in his possession. Claims: The book, billed as Kate's private journal, has since been pulled from Amazon . When she confronted him, Kate, 38, said Hoffman claimed to have found the documents when he was digging through her trash on the street - which she said was impossible. 'This demonstrates his knowledge that the materials were obtained illegally, as it is a sign of an attempt to cover up his unlawful activities,' the suit alleges. The book was billed as Kate's private journal and included passages where she talked about spanking her children with a wooden spoon and expressing her fears she would hurt them. The twin girls are now 12-years-old and the sextuplets are nine. The alleged plot was first exposed through a series of text messages published on BullyVille.

Her money-making schemes include releasing a cookbook, appearing on Celebrity Wife Swap with Kendra Wilkinson and launching a discount shopping site couponsbykate.com. Kate confessed that 'to not have a reliable income is scary', but there is one thing she draws the line at - and that is appearing on TV with her ex Jon.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 10:12 EST, 28 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:36 EST, 28 August 2013 . George Zimmerman's wife, Shellie, has risked rekindling the flames of controversy surrounding her and her husband as she walked free from court today in Florida after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge as part of a plea deal. Zimmerman, 26, who avoided a maximum five year jail sentence for perjury with the plea deal quoted from the Bible in a letter of apology to Judge Kenneth Lester, invoking the Gospel of John 8:32 to say she will never forget that 'The truth will set you free'. Appearing in the Seminole County Courthouse without her husband George, Zimmerman had originally been charged with felony perjury after she lied about the couple's assets during a bail hearing following her husband's arrest for the fatal 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Relief: Shellie Zimmerman, wife of George Zimmerman, smiles with her attorney Kelly Sims while reviewing paperwork at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida, today . Sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service, Shellie Zimmerman wrote a letter of apology to Judge Kenneth Lester, who presided over last year's bail hearing. 'By lying under oath, I let my God down, I let your Honor and the court down, I let my family and friends down, and, most of all, I let myself down,' Shellie Zimmerman wrote in the letter. 'In the future, no matter what the consequences, I will tell the truth because in the end all you have is your integrity. I promise, your Honor, to work hard to restore mine before the eyes of my God and the world.' George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted last month of second-degree murder. Shellie Zimmerman had been charged with a felony and, if convicted, had faced up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Free: Shellie Zimmerman, wife of George Zimmerman, leaves the courtroom at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida, on Wednesday, August 28th, 2013 . Plea Deal: Shellie Zimmerman, wife of George Zimmerman, and her attorney Kelly Sims exit the courtroom at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Fla. on Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013 . Sybrina Fulton (L), mother of slain teenager Trayvon Martin, arrives with Trayvon's father Tracy Martin (R) and their son Jahvaris (C) at a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech today in Washington D.C. She had given her bail-hearing testimony by telephone last year because of safety concerns for Zimmerman's family. In a move which will no doubt enrage the family of Trayvon Martin, Shellie Zimmerman referenced the trial of her husband and his highly controversial acquittal. 'Over the last sixteen months, I have become intimately aware of the justice system, and the absolute importance of all parties being truthful,' wrote Zimmerman. Shellie Zimmerman misled the court because she had been told by others to say ""maybe that's not my money,"" her attorney, Kelly Sims, said after the hearing. 'But in her heart, you know, if it walks like a duck and looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck,' Sims said. 'She was calling from a phone. She was scared. Her husband was locked up. She didn't know what was going on. So, she stood by her man, like Tammy Wynette says. She's accepting responsibility.' George Zimmerman's wife, Shellie, watches her husband leave the courtroom during a recess on the 24th day of his trial at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center, in Sanford, Florida, USA, 12 July 2013 . Prosecutor John Guy said he agreed to the deal because Shellie Zimmerman didn't have a prior criminal record and the misdemeanor plea would allow her to pursue her nursing career. 'The important thing is that she apologized to Judge Lester for what she did,' said Guy, who helped prosecute Zimmerman unsuccessfully. 'The proof is not in question in this case. It was only a matter of what should be done as far as the disposition.' Court records show that in the days before the bond hearing in June 2012, Shellie Zimmerman transferred $74,000 — broken into eight smaller transfers ranging from $7,500 to $9,990 — from her husband's credit union account to hers. Celebrations: George Zimmerman's wife, Shellie (R), is hugged by Jen O'Mara after her husband was found not guilty in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center in Sanford, Florida . It also shows that $47,000 was transferred from George Zimmerman's account to his sister's in the days before the bond hearing. Amounts of over $10,000 would have been reported to the Internal Revenue Service. George Zimmerman started a website to raise funds for his legal defence under the URL www.therealgeorgezimmerman.com in April, 2012‘I have created a Paypal account solely linked on this website as I would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defence,’ he posted on the websiteAccording to prosecutors, he allegedly raised $135,000 but the website was shut down on April 24 so his attorney could regain control of the fundraising drive.The 28-year-old's bond hearing was on April 20, 2012, where the amount of money the website had raised was not disclosed.Zimmerman was released from jail on April 23 on a $150,000 bond after paying 10 per cent upfront.Later that week, his lawyer told CNN that the website had raised more than $200,000 in donations.His bail was revoked . Four days after he was released on bond, Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $85,500 from her account into her husband's account, records show. They also show that the jail recorded George Zimmerman instructing her on a call to 'pay off all the bills,' including an American Express and Sam's Club card. Most of the money had come from donations to a website that had been set up to pay for George Zimmerman's defense. At the bail hearing, Shellie Zimmerman testified that the couple, who married in 2007, had limited funds for bail because she was a full-time student and her husband wasn't working. Prosecutors say they actually had then already raised $135,000 in donations from the website. Shellie Zimmerman was asked about the website at the hearing, but she said she didn't know how much money had been raised. A judge set George Zimmerman's bail at $150,000 bail, and he was freed a few days later after posting $15,000 in cash — which is typical. After Shellie Zimmerman's false statements were discovered, the judge revoked her husband's bail. He was later released on $1 million bond. Shellie Zimmerman's plea deal was one of the last loose ends left from her husband's murder trial. A judge still has to consider defense attorneys' request for sanctions against prosecutors for what they claim was their withholding of evidence.

Parents all over Britain are preparing to send their children back to school next week, and many of them will be breathing a sigh of relief after what has probably been an expensive summer. Children of primary school age cost their parents an average of £1,109 each over the lengthiest holiday of the year, expenses that are spread over sunny luxuries such as holidays abroad, days out, entertainment, as well as extra food and petrol. Taking into account the approximate 4.1 million primary and nursery school pupils in the UK, this has equated to around a £4.56 billion spend on British youngsters, according to research from a money saving website. They may be small, but each primary school age child in the UK cost their parents £1,109 over the summer . Factoring in holidays abroad, days out, extra food and extra petrol, summer holidays add up . And that's before they've factored in the inevitable September spend of  new uniforms, stationery and all that accompanies the beginning of a new school term, according to researchers at Vouchercodespro.uk. The website polled 2,898 parents of primary school pupils aged between 3-11 on how much they have spent this summer on such school holiday treats as a holiday, days out and entertainment. The poll did not take into account such necessary costs as child care and normal grocery costs in order to gain a better insight into the added expense of summer months on families. When asked if they would agree with the statement that the summer holidays this year have proven more of a financial strain than previous years, 68 per cent of parents responded yes. The website polled 2,898 parents of primary school pupils aged between 3-11 on how much they have spent this summer on such school holiday treats as a holiday, days out and entertainment . Of the 32 per cent of parents who didn't agree with the statement, 73 per cent had chosen not to have a summer holiday this year, perhaps explaining why costs were not as high for them this year. Average spending per child aged 3-11 in UK over summer holidays: . TOTAL: £1,109 . Factoring cost for each child, parents said they spent £562 on summer holidays, £114 on days out within the UK, £128 on extra food, £163 on entertainment such as cinema trips and books, and £142 on extra petrol.

The massive enclosed malls epitomized by 1980s teen movies Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Valley Girls were built by the Baby Boom generation as part of post-World War II suburbia. Many of their children came of age inside the shopping centers, and had their first dates over a piece of Sbarro pizza followed by movie or video game. But since the early 00s, as young workers leave the suburbs for urban centers, old-school malls have been in decline. The giant structures seem out of place in the pedestrianized areas, because the blank walls and limited doors make them awkward to access. The Internet has also hit malls hard.

With the new school term about to start, thousands of parents will be frantically racing around the supermarket trying to find inspiration for their children's lunchboxes. Opting for a balanced, hot school meal could help ease the pressure and give them the energy they need to get through the second half of the day. But if you're going to choose a packed lunch, my rule of thumb is that is needs to be healthy and taste good. Getting that balance can be a real challenge. One of the problems is that children get lunchbox envy - especially when their friends have tasty treats that they don't have .

Thrashing around in the water clutching a large fish between his teeth, this striking image of a brown bear catching its lunch stunningly captures both the beauty and ferocious power of the natural world. The sockeye salmon tries to put up a fight but is no match for the bear with a splash of the fish's blood standing out from the water as the giant sinks its teeth in. Italian photographer Valter Bernardeschi's beautiful shot taken in the waters of Lake Kuril Kamchactka in Russia is one of 100 pictures set to go on display as part of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2013 award at the Natural History Museum in London. Incredible: A brown bear emerges from the waters of Lake Kuril Kamchactka - Russia after having caught a large salmon. This stunning image was taken by Italian photographer Valter Bernardeschi . Stunning: Taken by American Douglas Seifert, this image shows a dugong mingling with snorkelers in a shallow Egyptian bay where he feeds upon seagrass . Back to nature: Alejandro Prieto from Mexico has called this shot of a predatory crocodile preying on a green turtle in Costa Rica . An exhibition of the finalists from this year's prestigious competition is to go on display next month, with judges releasing just a handful of the magnificent images that were entered this year as a sneak preview. Now in its 49th year, the competition, ran by the museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine has this year attracted a staggering 43,000 entries from both amateur and professional photographers from 96 countries around the world. As well as Mr Bernardeschi's effort, the exhibition will also feature American photographer Douglas Seifert's snapshot of a Dugong mingling with snorkelers in an Egyptian bay as he feeds on seagrass. Just seven of the creatures remain on a 62 mile stretch of coastline and Douglas watched with fascination as the Dugong was harassed by snorklers until it eventually fled into the depths of the sea. Alejandro Prieto saw his shot of a crocodile preying on a green turtle in Costa Rica commended by judges. Commended: Etienne Francey noticed this tiny mouse snacking in the fields near his village in Switzerland . Up close: This stunning shot of lions getting a soaking in the rain at the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, was taken by American Michael Nichols . Co-existing: Primates and humans live alongside one another in this village in northern India in this image taken by Portuguese photographer Marcos Sobral . He had set out looking for bull sharks who he heard were circling near the beach. But instead he came across the predatory reptile and managed just one shot before it dragged the turtle off towards the sea. Serene: Diana Webman took this picture of a gorilla and her twins in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park . He said: 'With a fast movement, the crocodile held the turtle by its flipper and then, with a flick of its jaws, grabbed the still-living reptile by its head. 'I willed the crocodile to be still for a moment, while I struggled to keep the camera steady.' A more serene picture of nature was captured by Diana Webman in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park when she took a beautiful image of a gorilla feeding her two young twins. The silverback leader of the group had just chased the mother and her babies from a nettle patch, and while the mother protested she eventually moved on. ‘In this picture, she is still tense from the encounter’, says Diana, ‘and continues to glance across at him while she eats. Her twins, in the comfort of their mother’s strong arms, appear blissfully ignorant.’ The twins’ future, though, remains uncertain. The mountain gorilla is officially listed as critically endangered. Entries to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition are submitted in a variety of categories each year, with three categories aimed at photographers aged under 18. Thousands of pictures are then judged by industry experts and the overall winner is announced at a ceremony at the Kensington museum in October. A book of the commended entries is then released and the exhibition tours the world. The competition has gone from strength to strength since it was introduced back in 1964 - then it attracted just 600 entries in three categories. The last winner of the contest to hail from the UK was Ben Osborne who took the crown in 2007 with his image Elephant Creation. Canadian photographer Paul Nicklen's image of bubble-jetting emperors won last year. Tickets from the exhibition go on sale tomorrow with the pictures on show from October 18 until March 23.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a new mission – to capture an asteroid, send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip. In an effort to attain a better understanding of asteroids, meteors and other near-space objects, the space exploration arm of the US government plans to capture an asteroid, fly a crew to it in a next-generation spacecraft, take samples and return home to a splashdown in the ocean. Funding for the project is included in the space agency’s upcoming budget. The latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation made public Thursday on YouTube that has a soundtrack that sounds like it came from the ‘Dark Knight.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . We have liftoff: Crews will ride the next-generation Orion spacecraft to the captured asteroid . Details on how exactly NASA plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not known, but the rendering shows it captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag attached to solar panels that flare out to the side like wings. Called an ‘asteroid redirect mission,’ it resembles more of a capture, and involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which will also be used for trips to the Moon and Mars, according to NASA. In-flight: Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid . Almost there!: Once arrived, the Orion will dock with the captured asteroid . Though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier Apollo Spacecraft, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced, says NASA. Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilizes both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. Ready to go: Once the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object . Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft . The precious: The crew will then take pictures and samples of the captive space rock before returning to the Orion for the 10 day sojourn home . Once the mission is complete, Orion returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. Announced in the aftermath of the asteroid that exploded over Russia last year, injuring well over a thousand people, NASA plans to dedicate $100 million to this project in the coming year, the agency said. It is not clear where the leftover asteroid would be jettisoned to, if anywhere, nor is there word on what effect changing the orbit of one near-Earth object would have, let alone several. Near-Earth objects are defined as those within 28 million miles of our home planet. Roundabout: The Orion makes its roundabout journey to use gravity and conserve fuel . Home sweet home: The trip ends with a gentle splashdown in the ocean . Explaining the government supports NASA’s ‘efforts to study Near Earth Objects,’ Space subcommittee chairman Steven Palazzo (R-MS) said during a recent hearing that the ‘this proposal lacks in details, a justification or support from the NASA own advisory bodies’ and ‘appears to be a costly and complex distraction.’ Undeterred, NASA is moving forward, the agency expects to capture its first asteroid by 2025.","The plan was revealed this week in an animation released by the agency .

Disgraced NFL star Aaron Hernandez was a heavy user of the drug angel dust - PCP - and was so paranoid he carried a gun with him at all times before his arrest in June, a new report claims. The former New England Patriots player also surrounded himself with 'gangsters' and came to prefer those friends to his family or his teammates, whom he became increasingly detached from in the months before he was dragged from his home in handcuffs, Rolling Stone magazine reports. The Rolling Stone story, published on Wednesday, traces Hernandez's path from star tight end to murder suspect. He is charged with shooting dead semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd in June at an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. The magazine also accuses Hernandez's coach at the University of Florida, Urban Meyer, - and others at the football program - for effectively covering up an alleged attack on a bartender in Gainsville, as well as at least one positive drug test. Another incident in which Hernandez allegedly fired into a car after a bar fight while he was playing for the Florida Gators may have been swept under the rug, as well. A new report claims that Aaron Hernandez abused PCP, or angel dust, before he was arrested for murder . Prosecutors say this surveillance photo shows Aaron Hernandez carrying the .45-caliber pistol he used to kill Odin Lloyd. Rolling Stone claims he carried a gun with him everywhere . This picture of a young Hernandez dressed all in red - the color of the Bloods street gang - and flashing gang signs has been cited as evidence of his troubled past . The 23-year-old is also suspected in the 2012 murder of two immigrants from Cape Verde, who were shot and killed outside a nightclub in Boston. The case is being heard by a grand jury to determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges. The magazine claims that Hernandez killed Odin, who was a friend and was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance, after Odin talked to some of his cousins when he was at a bar with Hernandez. The cousins who didn't like Hernandez and told Odin that the NFL player was a 'punk.' But Rolling Stone claims that the murder came as a result of Hernandez's paranoia from abusing angel dust. 'Don’t matter what it’s about: Aaron’s out of his mind,' Rolling Stone quotes a family friend as saying. 'He’s been twisted on dust now for more than a year, which is when all of this crazy shit started.' Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the charges and hired top criminal defense attorneys to fight the case in court. The magazine also claims that Hernandez carried a rifle in his gym bag wherever he went as a result of his paranoid. Odin Lloyd, 27, was found murdered near Hernandez's home in June . His lawyer, Michael Fee, did not return a call from MailOnline seeking comment on the Rolling Stone allegations. The magazine accuses Hernandez of being involved in a 'thug life' that was apparent even to New England head coach Bill Belichick. When he was arrested he was only 'one step' from being cut from the team over the issues, it was claimed. New England dropped Hernandez the day prosecutors announced they were filing murder charges against him and are attempting to claw back much of the money they owe him from a four-year, $40million contact he signed last year. Hernandez's legal and disciplinary . trouble didn't begin in the NFL. While playing for the Florida Gators in . college, he was arrested for punching a bartender in the head. He was also suspended after he tested positive for marijuana. Rolling . Stone claims that his drug violations may have been even more . pronounced and that he failed drug tests than the one that was released publicly. The magazine alleges that Florida coach Meyer and others in the football program worked to keep at least one other positive drug test - and the bartender attack - under wraps and out of the news media. Meyer has not responded to the allegations. The . magazine also reports that Hernandez's problems began with a troubled . home life - claiming that both his mother and father had criminal . records. The story alleges that his mother Terri had a relationship with an alleged drug dealer with a history of violence. When his father died, Terri moved her boyfriend into the house to live with Hernandez and his brother.

It is a devastating disease that can kill in hours and leaves victims with severe disabilities or brain damage. Yet while the repercussions last a lifetime, meningitis can strike suddenly and without warning – as mother-of three Alison Coneybeare learnt to her terror. When her gorgeous daughter Eleanor fell ill, she could only watch helplessly  as doctors fought to save her. Tragically, Eleanor, now two, lost a leg and fingers and the family is still discovering the lasting impact of her illness. But last month NHS advisers refused  to introduce a vaccine that could protect children such as Eleanor from meningitis B, the deadliest and most common form. Each year it infects about 1,870 people – one in ten of whom will die. Those who survive suffer side effects ranging from deafness and blindness to amputations. Yet the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the jab – licensed for use in infants by the European Commission in January – was not cost-effective and should not be provided  on the NHS. Alison, 43, is sharing her story to highlight just how important the vaccine is. ‘I wouldn’t wish on anyone the harrowing days and weeks we spent with Eleanor fighting the disease,’ says the accountant, who lives in Reading with husband Duncan, 44, and their children. ‘We were told to prepare for the worst several times and thought we’d lose her – so although the side effects were devastating, we’re just so grateful she is still with us. Meningitis is an awful disease and I hate to think of other children suffering.’ Eleanor was just eight months old when she suddenly became ill. She had cold-like symptoms – a high temperature that paracetamol didn’t bring down and she was vomiting and refusing milk and food. Alison was staying with her parents in Cheshire with Eleanor and her sons Ben, now ten, and Nathan, five. When Eleanor didn’t improve, she took her to a GP. ‘He suggested it was nothing more sinister than a viral throat infection,’ Alison says. ‘I questioned him about the vomiting, which didn’t seem to tally with his diagnosis, but was told that was probably just because of the high temperature.’ But the next evening Eleanor’s breathing became laboured, her skin turned grey and her eyes became ‘spacey’. If only: Eleanor, pictured at home with her mother Alison, 43, and father Duncan, 44, could have been saved had the vaccine been provided for her . ‘My mum phoned her on-call doctor and held the phone by Eleanor’s mouth so he could hear her breathing. Then we were told to call 999 right away,’ says Alison. Paramedics rushed Eleanor to Macclesfield hospital, with Alison following behind the ambulance. ‘At one point the ambulance screeched to a halt and the driver ran round and into the back. I thought it was all over then – I still don’t know what that paramedic did, but they got her into A&E alive.’ Alison waited in the parents’ room with a nurse, ‘utterly terrified and shaking uncontrollably’, then was taken to see Eleanor, finding her with countless lines going into her tiny body, half her head shaved and surrounded by an array of medical staff. Alison was told  she had a severe bacterial infection, to get Duncan to the hospital straight away – and prepare for the worst. ‘Duncan didn’t know if he’d see his daughter alive. I asked if she was going to die, and all they would say was that she was very, very poorly.  I went into shock and started vomiting.’ The decision of the vaccine committee to reject the meningitis B jab is truly disappointing. We are lucky enough in the UK to vaccinate our children  against other forms of the disease, including meningitis C and pneumococcal meningitis, but meningitis B is still the UK’s leading cause of bacterial meningitis and the one doctors  fear most: it can kill within 24 hours. Of course the committee must weigh up the safety and the financial implications of the vaccination before allowing it to become part of the national immunisation schedule. But the safety has been verified as the vaccination now has a licence for use from the European Medicines Agency. And I question how the cost-effectiveness has been  evaluated – it is difficult to put a price on saving a child’s life or protecting them from lifelong disability. After the introduction of the meningitis C vaccination in 1999, it is estimated that 9,000 cases of meningitis were prevented, as well as 1,000 deaths. How can these benefits be evaluated in terms of money? The UK has one of the highest rates of meningitis B, affecting 1,870 people a year. One in ten of those who become ill will die, and one in three of them will be left with a life-changing injury such as brain damage or limb loss. The impact of the disease is immense. So it is extremely frustrating to know there is a safe vaccine that we cannot give our children. If it is made available, I will be first in the queue with my children. Hours later, at 3am, the tell-tale meningitis rash finally appeared, as Eleanor was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool . . She had meningitis B, which accounts for about 90 per cent of cases. The meningococcus B microbe usually lives harmlessly at the back of noses and throats of one in ten people, mainly older children and adolescents. But for reasons not fully understood, it can invade the blood and brain, affect the lining of blood vessels, inflame the membranes round the brain and spinal cord, and overcome the immune system. Eleanor was severely affected; on arrival at Alder Hey a consultant said she was as ill as it was possible to be. ‘We went into intensive care and could hardly recognise her,’ Alison says. ‘She was very swollen from all the fluids being pumped into her and had a ventilator mask on. My main memory is how noisy it was, all the machines beeping and whirring and so many staff coming and going. 'I wanted to pick up my precious little girl and hold her tight, but I was too frightened to go near her.’ The next day the family was told that, while Eleanor wasn’t deteriorating, a pulse could not be felt beneath her elbows or knees so she might lose all four limbs. ‘It was devastating, but we just wanted her to survive as we’d thought we were going to lose her,’ Alison says. ‘We were offered a blood-thinning drug that might reduce the chances of her losing her limbs but could result in a fatal bleed. We chose not to go for it. It’s the kind of decision I never imagined taking as a parent.’ Over the next few days Eleanor’s condition slowly improved, but she had to lose her right leg from the knee down. The family assumed it would then be a gradual process of steady recovery, but learnt that that doesn’t happen with meningitis. Days later an infection in Eleanor’s back needed emergency surgery, and four weeks on some of the fingers of her left hand had to be removed. Finally, after seven harrowing weeks, Duncan and Alison took Eleanor home. Alison says: ‘We were as open and honest with the children as we could be. Duncan and I have had counselling, as has Ben, and it will be available for all of us, including Eleanor, as she grows up.’ A team of plastic surgeons, physios and other medics are ready to help in future. They found out this year that Eleanor has profound hearing problems in one ear. ‘Hearing her laugh and watching her take her first steps with her prosthetic leg, I just feel so incredibly lucky to have her with us,’ says Alison. ‘And to know there’s little in life she won’t be able to do is beyond my wildest dreams. We just hope more parents know the warning signs of meningitis – and that the vaccine will one day be introduced for all children.’ For more information on the warning signs of meningitis, or to donate to research, go to meningitisuk.org.","Eleanor Coneybeare, two, lost a leg and several fingers to meningitis B .

Looking for a change: Chris Henry had a 3D body scan that showed him what the results of liposuction would look like - and booked one . When buying a car, you take it for a test drive. When purchasing a suit, it’s usual to try it  on. I even taste grapes in Waitrose before buying a bunch. But when  it comes to a far more life-changing decision – cosmetic surgery – the same can’t be applied. Nose or boob-jobs, liposuction, tummy tucks – most patients undergo these operations without knowing the exact outcome. Yes,  the surgeon will talk through the options, and show you before and after pictures of other patients. But it’s a leap in the dark. No one can predict how the body will react or how a patient will look afterwards. So a new state-of-the-art 3D imaging programme is being heralded  as a solution since it shows patients what they’ll look like post-op. The equipment consists of eight cameras mounted on four outstretching arms. It takes a set of high-resolution images when you stand, naked, in front of it. The software then merges the images into a 3D template to be viewed on a computer monitor. You can view up to six simulations at one time and compare them side by side, or rotate them and view them at any angle. It makes sense – choosing the wrong nose is rather more devastating than picking up a shirt that doesn’t fit. I should point out I’m not actually interested in surgery myself – or at least, I wasn’t. Despite being 40 this year and no Adonis, I’ve always been pretty happy with the way I look. But in the name of journalism, I agree to have the 3D imaging process with Nottingham cosmetic surgeon Dinesh Maini. His clinic is one of a handful in the UK with the equipment. ‘This is an ideal way to give patients a realistic grasp of what they can expect from any procedure,’ he says. ‘Women, for example, come to me asking for breast implants and want big, F-size cups. ;When they see the 3D image of themselves with this size, they usually realise it’s not really what they are looking for. We can then adjust the breast size on the image to a size they can see looks correct on them. ‘The 3D image also helps me plan the procedure. I can obtain measurements and details from the software and then create a really accurate plan of how to operate.’ Dr Maini offers to show me how I can look thanks to the Axis Three software. I strip to my underwear and stand in front of the giant clam-like device. When I see my unaltered 3D image on the monitor, my jaw drops; I look hideous. Is that what people see when they look at me? I cringe as Dr Maini rotates my bulging belly 360 degrees. We also look at my face, which displays the signs of late nights, early mornings, alcohol abuse and sunbathing. I ask to ‘try on’ some facial procedures. With the click of a mouse, Dr Maini shows how I’d look with a Botoxed ‘brow-lift’, a reduction in my deep-set nasal labial lines with dermal filler and frown lines on  my forehead erased. I feel strange looking at this ‘airbrushed’ version of myself. I suspect I look feminised. I’m keen to banish my pot belly; can the computer erase it? The doctor examines my midriff in the flesh, noting that ‘it looks an unusual shape’. I can certainly ‘pinch an inch’ and he also comments that my stomach muscles are stretched and elongated rather than solid and tight. He says if I could only shift that inch, I’d have that Holy Grail of male beauty – a six-pack. What to expect: The 3D scans can show you what you will look like after surgery - minimizing risk of unpleasant surprises . We talk about Pilates to pump up my core strength as well as the method Dr Maini uses to suck fat out from around the abs to give them definition. It is a form of liposuction called BodyTite HD. The fat is sucked out with a tiny cannula through a small incision, then the skin is tightened with a laser. Gym-lovers starve and dehydrate themselves to achieve this look, whereas I’m presented with the chance to have it after just three weeks of Pilates and a two-hour operation. Dr Maini shows in 3D what would happen. I’m gobsmacked. It’s the flat stomach I used to have in my 20s. Of course, this is merely a computer-generated picture. As Stephen Handisides, from the surgery advice website MyFaceMyBody, explains: ‘This isn’t an exact science; it’s an artistic interpretation, similar to a flattering portrait. 'Surgery is unpredictable, with potential complications. For example, high-frequency ultrasound liposuction has a risk of burns to the skin and contour irregularities – lumpy skin, to you and me. However, 3D imaging is a useful tool for giving the patient a realistic idea of what can be achieved.’ My digitally flattened stomach is definitely appealing. I would never want to be 20 again, but the prospect of getting back my abs is tempting. I’m hooked. Although no one would say I’m fat, I’m aware I’m breathing in more on the beach and that there’s no room for manoeuvre in my jeans. What’s more amazing is that the computer also tells Dr Maini that when it flattened my stomach, it removed 300ml of fat. My mind races: 300ml is about a can of Coke’s worth – it’s nothing! ‘How difficult an operation can that be?’ I think. Suddenly my brain makes a leap from ‘a flat stomach is a nice idea’ to ‘300ml is NOTHING – that’ll be easy – GET IT DONE! Ask for it NOW!’ Is this what Michael Jackson felt like every time he visited a cosmetic clinic? I’m ready to take the next step in a heartbeat. I book a BodyTite treatment there and then. It’s only on the train home that  I wonder: ‘Have I just let a piece  of technology sell me an £8,000 cosmetic operation?’ Probably. But seeing really is believing. www.zenithcosmeticclinics.co.uk .","3D imaging programmes show patients what they will look like post-op .

Enjoying a sandwich while hanging precariously from the branches of one of the world's tallest trees wouldn't be most people's idea of the perfect picnic. But for these daredevil ecologists grabbing some lunch at the top of a 350ft Redwood or Sequoia is just a normal day at the office. For climbing great heights is a challenge botanist Steve Sillett, 45, and his wife Marie Antoine face almost every day as they study some of the oldest and definitely tallest forests on earth.

Don't look down: Ecologists Steve Steve Sillett and his wife, Marie Antoine, enjoy a bite to eat while hanging from the branches of a giant Redwood Tree in California's Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park . Bed time: The couple sleep among the canopies of these ancient trees, which are often 30 storeys high, and eating and camping in the branches is a necessity . Magnificent: A researcher is dwarfed by a Redwood tree at Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California (left) and a biologist studies a large fern mat from a giant Redwood tree in the California park . The couple are tasked with measuring nature's giants and because the trees are often over 30 storeys high, eating and sleeping in the canopies is more a necessity than a choice. The incredible pictures were taken at Prairie Creek, Redwood National Park, California by photographer Michael 'Nick' Nichols. Steve and Marie worked with Nick and a team of experts to help him create a seamless photo of a Redwood tree from top to bottom, something which due to the sheer size of the tree, had never been done before. Nick spent two years on the project, living in California for a year while he explored the large Redwood forests with Steve, Marie and a team of scientists in a bid to capture the tricky shot. He said: 'All over the world California is known for these giant trees the Redwood and Sequoia. The Redwood is used for timber and around 95 per cent of these great trees have been cut down.

Living the high life: Scientists in Prairie Creek State Park dangle hundreds of feet above ground as they measure a fire cave in a redwood damaged by wildlife . 'My colleague decided he'd walk the length of the forest to decide what the scientific condition of these trees was. I was brought in to document it. 'These trees [are so large] you can't see all of them, when you stand on the ground in front of them you just see a little bit of the bottom.' The photographer said he wanted the project to be a 'celebration of these great trees'. He said: 'I knew I had the task of creating the star photo, I had to make a photo that led and drew everyone in. 'I had to find the tree, I had to get permission from the parks to do all this rope work in the trees and I had to get the scientists to agree to help me. Nick chose the tree he wanted to photograph but scientist Steve Sillett said he could not climb it because it had been 'retired'.

An Ohio mother of three who was found guilty of poisoning her fiancee with antifreeze was sentenced Wednesday sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years. Holly McFeeture, 35, added antifreeze to Matthew Podolak’s raspberry iced tea, which he drank every day, prosecutors said. Podolak, 31, died in 2006 one day after going to the doctor for lower back pain and getting treated for kidney stones. On trial: Holly McFeeture (left) was found guilty of murdering her fiance, Matthew Podolak (right) by poisoning him . The couple had two young children as well as an 8-year-old from one of McFeeture's former relationships. McFeeture wasn't arrested until 2012, after police were tipped off to her possible involvement in Podolak's death by one of her ex-boyfriends. Jamison Kennedy, an ex-con, dated McFeeture after her fiancé's death, and testified during the trial that she admitted poisoning Podolak. Kennedy told police in 2008 that McFeeture 'put something in [Podolak's] drinks and she wanted to stop but his kidneys were already failing.' It would be two years before then-County Coroner Frank Miller changed his ruling on the manner of Podolak's death from undetermined to homicide, and a further two years before McFeeture was indicted for aggravated murder and contaminating a substance for human consumption or use in 2012. Matthew Podolak, a Navy veteran, and Holly McFeeture lived together in a two-story home on Archmere Ave in Old Brooklyn, Cleveland. Unassuming: The family home in the Old Brooklyn area of Cleveland where McFeeture and Podolak lived with their three children . Sportsman: Podolak was part of a local ice hockey team before his death . The prosecution claims that McFeeture spiked a raspberry iced tea drink that Podolak consumed daily with antifreeze over the course of several days or even weeks. The defense claims that Podolak was depressed and that he committed suicide by poisoning himself. Each case relies on the testimony of expert witnesses. For the prosecution, the pathologist who . made the determination that Podolak died of chronic ingestion of . ethylene glycol will testify that his diagnosis of 'chronic' ingestion, . which indicates that the poison was ingested over a period of time, is . consistent with damage to Podolak's body. According to Cleveland.com, Dr Dan Galita . testified that damage to Podolak's heart indicated intoxication over . several weeks. Furthermore, doctor's records show Podolak was suffering . severe back pain up to three months before he died, a symptom likely . related to the poison. The defense argued that Podolak killed himself with antifreeze depends upon discounting Galita's initial autopsy results. Emotional: Courtroom footage from July shows McFeeture looking distraught and wiping away tears . Loving father: Podolak was the father of two of McFeeture's three children . If . Podolak wanted to commit suicide, he would be unlikely to slowly poison . himself, but rather take one large dose of the poison. Ethylene . glycol, found in antifreeze, is toxic to humans. It creates symptoms . that can easily be mistake for other illnesses. The poison accumulates . in the body and causes damage to the brain, heart, lungs and kidneys. Death by kidney failure occurs if proper medical attention is not . sought. Its sweet taste and the difficulty of detecting it in the body makes antifreeze the poisoner's weapon of choice. The . jury heard from prosecution witnesses saying Podolak was a fun-loving . person who rarely drank and loved his kids and fiancée. Deadly: Antifreeze is an engine coolant that has a sweet taste that would make it difficult to detect if it was added to a sweet drink such as raspberry iced tea . ABC reports that friends and family were so concerned about Podolak's volatile relationship with McFeeture that they urged him to change the beneficiary of his life insurance policy from his fiancée to his father. Podolak refused, and upon his death McFeeture collected his life insurance policy and his 401K - but didn't contribute to any of the costs of her fiancé's funeral. Podolak's brother, Mark Podolak, told Cleveland.com after McFeeture's 2012 arrest that the family had long suspected she had something to do with Matthew Podolak's death. 'She just wasn't acting like somebody who was losing or about to lose a loved one,' he said.","Holly McFeeture, 35, was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years .

Civil War photographer Mathew Brady largely taught himself the finer points of the two pursuits that have linked his name to history: taking pictures and self-promotion. The son of Irish immigrant farmers had a talent for cajoling presidents, generals and business leaders to sit before his camera. Other than his birth around 1823 in Warren County, N.Y., little is recorded about Brady's early life, a challenge for biographer Robert Wilson. Yet readers of 'Mathew Brady: Portraits of a Nation' probably benefit from this dearth of personal information. Wilson moves quickly to what matters most - Brady's role in how we see America in the mid- to late 19th century. War photographer Matthew Brady, the son of Irish immigrant farmers had a talent for cajoling presidents, generals and business leaders to sit before his camera . Time warp: A portrait of Captain A.B. Weeden, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery, and his servant Tommy Hickey in camp at Miner's Hill, Virginia, in the winter of 1861-1862 . Timing was on Brady's side when, as a . teenager, he left the countryside for the big city around 1840. The . early photographic process called daguerreotype, invented in Paris, . arrived in New York just ahead of him. He may have taken lessons in the . technique while supporting himself as a clerk at a fabric store. In 1844, Brady opened a photographic studio that produced portraits, and after five years of success, he started a studio in Washington. Wilson makes a compelling case that Brady eventually rose above a sea of artistic entrepreneurs offering photographic portraits because he learned, and often advanced, the latest techniques. As important, he had a pleasing manner that put subjects at ease during the time-consuming process of getting a picture taken. Heroic: Mathew Brady studio portrait of Colonel Oliver O. Howard, a Federal officer who won the Medal of Honor for his bravery during the Battle of Seven Pines in 1862 . Vengeful: portrait of Sergeant Francis Edwin Brownell, an enlisted man in Elmer Ellsworth's New York Fire Zouaves - who witnessed Ellsworth's death and immediately killed the assailant . Future president: James A. Garfield, who would be the 20th president of the United States, and was assassinated after only six months in office in 1881, as a Union Army general, ca. 1855-1865 . Brady also understood how publicity . worked back then. The Hall of Fame in his Broadway studio featured a . gallery of celebrities - a subtle pitch for others to pay a few dollars . for portraits of their own. Few would not want to sit for the . studio that photographed war heroes like Gen. Winfield Scott, naturalist . and painter John James Audubon and the elderly former first lady Dolley . Madison.

In 1849, President James K. Polk . allowed Brady to take his photograph in the White House, as did his . successor, Zachary Taylor, a sign of Brady's growing reputation. A decade later, when the nation . seemed destined to fracture over slavery, Brady was, as Wilson puts it, . at the 'height of his fame as a photographer of celebrities'.

Abraham Lincoln - Brady pulled up the collars on Lincoln's shirt and . coat, probably to hide his long neck - helped to make the presidential . aspirant known around the country. The Civil War created a strong demand for photographs of soldiers in studio settings and in encampments. The custom of the time was for the studio's owner to take the credit, not those working in the studio or in the field. While Brady shared credit with his photographers some of the time and traveled to battlefields such as Gettysburg, his name is associated with many photographs he didn't take.

Walter Taylor (right), taken in Richmond, Virginia, on April 16, 1865 . Brady's experience at Bull Run - he lost his equipment in the chaotic retreat that marked the North's first major battle - may have cooled his eagerness to ask those working for him to photograph close to actual fighting. As the war continued, photographic images of dead soldiers, slain horses and other post-battle carnage brought to the public a face of war most had never seen.

The snapper: War Photographer Mathew Brady became a successful and sought after photographer for the country's presidents and colonels . Wilson argues that Brady's role in promoting wartime images through his studios and the print media was crucial to their impact even if he wasn't the man behind the camera.

An 18-year-old has refused a heart and double lung transplant because he wants to enjoy the time he has left with his friends and family. Liam Gawthorpe was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs - at just three-months-old. He was offered the transplant aged just 11 but refused it, telling doctors: ‘Let me get on with it’. Liam Gawthorpe (pictured with his parents Neil and Sharon) has repeatedly refused a heart and lung transplant because he wants to enjoy the time he has left and fears the surgery would not improve his quality of life . But in the last two years doctors discovered the valves in his heart were leaking, meaning he no longer has enough oxygenated blood in his heart. In the last three months alone the saturation levels in his blood have dropped from 85 per cent to 66 per cent. But despite doctors offering Liam a transplant again, the teen has said no, because he’s seen too many friends undergo the operation without any benefits. ‘I want other people to see that no matter what health issues you have, you should make the most of what you have now,’ Liam, from Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire, said. The Gawthorpe family have no idea who long Liam has left - but his father Neil, 41, has told how proud he is of his son, calling him an ‘inspiration’. He said: ‘We wake up every day and one of us has to go into his bedroom and check if he’s still alive. ‘Every night we go to bed not knowing if that’s the last time we’ll see Liam alive. ‘Every day really is a bonus to us because we don’t know how many of them we have left. ‘But . the way Liam is living his life makes me the proudest dad in the world. He’s determined to enjoy what time he has in his own way. Liam was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs - at just three-months-old . ‘His motto seems to be, no matter what is wrong with you, get off your backside and make the best of things. ‘He’s been dealt an awful hand but he’s living proof that you can inspire others with your own determination.’ Mr . Gawthorpe and Liam’s mother Sharon, also 41, first discovered Liam was . poorly when he lost six pounds of his birth weight in the first three . months of his life. Liam's heart valves are now leaking and he does not know how long he has left but he still does not want the transplant . The couple - now also parents to . Sean, 13, and ten-year-old Ethan - were told by doctors at the Leeds . General Infirmary that their baby had a congenital heart defect. Liam only had three chambers in his heart and the organ was back to front. At . the age of nine, doctors told his parents that the pressure in his . heart was reaching high levels and referred him to Great Ormond Street . hospital where they carried out tests, changed his medication, and . agreed to monitor him. Mr Gawthorpe said: ‘Up until that point, . I don’t think we realised how serious things were. It was only when we . had to spend four and a half weeks down in London, when Ethan had just . been born, that it hit us. That really pushed us to the limit.’ Aged 11, Liam and his parents were . offered a heart and double lung transplant by doctors, but they wanted . Liam to make the decision himself. Mr Gawthorpe said: ‘We thought because he was 11, he needed to have an input himself. ‘They asked him and before they could even finish he said “no”. ‘When they asked why he said: “Excuse my language, but to be fair, I’ve had enough rubbish in my life, let me get on with it”. ‘He’d made up his mind then. ‘To have my son say that made me . really proud. He was speaking his mind, he knew what he wanted. We had . to let him do it his way.’ But . six days before his 16th birthday Liam was rushed to hospital with . migraines and vomiting - and doctors discovered a huge abscess on his . brain. ‘They did a CT scan and we could see . that half of his brain just looked like someone had blacked it out with a . black marker pen. It was terrifying,’ Mr Gawthorpe said. Liam was offered a double heart and lung transplant when he was just 11 but he refused it, telling doctors: 'Let me get on with it'. He has been offered the operation again more recently but has turned it down again . ‘We believe it may have come on since some dental work Liam had two weeks earlier. ‘Doctors . operated and removed 25ml of fluid from the abscess, but when they . tried to remove the abscess itself his brain started bleeding. ‘After . six and a half hours of us waiting outside theatre, they came and told . us they’d managed to remove nearly 70 per cent of the abscess and the . rest they made dormant with antibiotics. ‘It was a blow from nowhere - we thought all we had to deal with was the heart and lung problem but then this hit us hard.’ A heart-lung transplant is a major, and rarely performed, surgical procedure. During the operation a patient's diseased heart and lungs are replaced with the heart and lungs of a recently deceased donor. Only five to ten of these operations are carried out each year in the UK. The surgery comes with many risks so it is usually only carried out as a last resort. It is believed that about 70 per cent of heart-lung transplant patients will survive for one year after the surgery, 50 per cent will survive for two years after the operation and 39 per cent will survive for five years. Source: NHS Choices . Liam was up and walking around on his 16th birthday - six days after the abscess was discovered - but has suffered short-term memory loss as a result. Because of this, he found it difficult to get work after he left school, and the only things he could remember from lessons were what he had learnt in his ICT and woodwork lessons. So he put these skills to good use building bird boxes and planters, which he sold on internet auction site eBay. After three successful months, he opened up a stall at Heckmondwike market - and in February the business, Hecky Pets, moved into a store in the town. Liam wants the store to be a legacy for his brothers, saying: ‘If they find it difficult to find work when they leave school, like I did, I want them to have the shop to come to. ‘I want this to be my legacy for them.’ Doctors have offered Liam another transplant within the last two months - but he refused again. Two of the valves in his heart are leaking blood - meaning the oxygen levels in his heart are very low. Mr Gawthorpe said: ‘Liam has had more health problems than most people have in a lifetime. ‘I am passionate and proud and I draw strength from him. ‘Liam doesn’t let his illness stop him.

Gardeningexpress.co.uk . sells the products in a section headed Weeds and Wildlife Plants, but . Chris Bonnet from the website said: ‘Some call them weeds but we don’t . want to hurt their feelings. After all, a weed is only a plant in the . wrong place. ‘For urban . gardeners who want to do their bit for the nation’s wildlife they’re an . absolute must.

The gruesome attack sent blood spurting across the cab as a horrified Jimenez was pinned into his seat by the Honda Pilot's airbag. German was pronounced dead at the scene of the sickening incident. The horrific attack apparently began when Espinal saw German, who is the mother of his two-month-old infant child, leaving the Paradise hotel in the Bronz with Jose Jimenez, 28, who was driving the SUV.

Amazon publishing head Laurence Kirshbaum, 69, is being sued by Teresa McCoy, 55, for unspecified damages after she claims he assaulted her when she came to him about a job. He denies all allegations against him. In papers filed on Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court, McCoy said she'd had a personal relationship with the married Kirshbaum in the early 2000s when he was the head of the Time Warner Book Group. They parted ways in 2005 but reconnected again in 2010. Kirshbaum contacted her about a job he thought would be suited to her, the suit alleges, and the two met in a Manhattan deli to discuss it.

British tourists risk falling foul of the law while on holiday if they are ignorant of local customs, the Foreign Office warned today. More than a quarter of UK citizens seeking consular assistance abroad are looking for help after they have been arrested. And the 'crimes' for which they have been detained are often as seemingly innocuous as wearing camouflaged clothing or eating near a church. Attraction: But visitors to Florence could be fined if they eat near churches or public buildings . The FCO has released a list of bizarre laws around the world in an effort to convince Britons to take greater care in observing local norms while travelling overseas. Some of the most popular European tourist destinations have unusual by-laws which could catch out tourists and land them with hefty fines. In Barcelona, it is illegal to go bare-chested or wear a bikini except at the city's beaches. Visitors to Venice are banned from feeding pigeons, while in Florence it is a crime punishable by a 'large fine' to eat food near a church or public building. Britons visiting the Netherlands are reminded that, despite the country's relatively lax drug laws, they could be arrested if they are found with narcotics outside a few specially designated areas. Popular: But visitors to Barcelona must not wander too far from the beach while topless or wearing bikinis . Another country where tourists must be careful about the substances they carry is Japan, where a number of common nasal sprays are banned because they contain the substance pseudoephedrine. In Nigeria, bizarrely, it is against the law to import mineral water, while those holidaying in Thailand cannot import more than 200 cigarettes. Singapore is famous for its draconian regulations, and the FCO has highlighted the law against chewing gum while travelling on the city's subway. But perhaps the strangest rule of all is found in Barbados, where it is illegal to wear camouflaged clothing - and even children can find themselves in trouble if they wear military-style attire. The FCO also flagged up the risk of causing offence in conservative countries by dressing immodestly or violating religious norms. Stylish: But camouflage-style clothing like this is strictly illegal in Barbados - even for children . Visitors to the Maldives are not allowed to observe any religion other than Islam in public, and tourists in Fiji must not sunbathe topless. In secretive Saudi Arabia, it is illegal to photograph military sites or government buildings, including palaces. 'Every year British nationals find themselves on the wrong side of the law unexpectedly, resulting in fines or in some cases arrests or even jail sentences,' said consular director Charles Hay. 'It is important to remember that laws and customs can vary greatly from country to country and what may be perfectly legal in the UK could be subject to a fine or even a jail sentence in another.' He went on: 'Consular staff often find that travellers are unaware that local laws apply to them and many British nationals think of their British passport as a ""get out of jail free"" card. 'While consular staff will always try to assist British nationals who find themselves in difficulty abroad, we can't interfere in another country's legal processes.'","Foreign Office releases list of unusual laws which trap British visitors .

"By . Janet Tappin Coelho In Rio De Janeiro . PUBLISHED: . 14:20 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:45 EST, 5 August 2013 . The slums of Rio de Janeiro are undergoing . radical transformations as the state . authority continues its hardline strategy of using the military and police to . physically clear the ghettos of the drug dynasties that have controlled them . for decades. So far 140 favelas in Rio . city have been pacified, the term that indicates a community has been freed . from the grip of drug traffickers. There are still, however, over 1,000 . favelas in Rio State that remain unpacified. Dominant: The Alemão favela will soon have a 500-store shopping centre- the first to be built in any of Rio's slums. The area is made up of 13 different communities built on several hills in the north of Rio city . View from the top: The favela's cable car covers 3.5 km and is the second most popular tourist attraction in the city, behind the Christ statue . Nevertheless, for the shanty-towns that are now experiencing peace, the cessation . of violence is having a dramatic and positive effect on hundreds of lives and injecting . opportunities and growth into what was a poverty-striken and neglected economy. Recent research by Brazil’s Institute of . Popular Data found that around 12 million people living in shanty-towns now earn . over £16 billion a year and are fast becoming a new and lucrative consumer . market. Around 65 percent of favela residents are considered middle class, . versus 37 percent in 2002. 'This used to be an invisible market, because . it was right under our noses,'  says Data Popular Director . Renato Meireilles, 'but people only saw favelas through the perspective of . violence and drug trafficking.' Much of the growth is attributed to . Brazil’s emerging economy, low levels of unemployment and government . initiatives that have pulled thousands out of poverty and in the case of the . pacification projects, brought stability and urban renewal to communities. According to the Data Popular . survey, over the last ten years the number of those living in favelas with . washing machines doubled to over 50 percent. Nearly 90 percent have cell . phones, and 40 percent have computers. Around 45 percent are regular internet . users. About 70 percent of favela residents go to the shopping centre every . week, and 50 percent eat out on a weekly basis. Silver screen: The improvements to the favela include a cinema- the first to be brought to a slum. The area has benefitted from the state's strategy to physically remove their drug factions . Now the first favela mall is being planned . for the Alemão slum complex, an . area made up of 15 different communities, based in the north of Rio city. Developers say the shopping centre will have 500 stores and create 6,000 jobs. The opening of the mall in Alemao will be a . huge boost to an area that is already beginning to thrive following . pacification and growing interest from thousands of tourists. Every weekend the number of foreigners and visitors using the local transport going . into Alemao surpasses the numbers of residents taking the same route as passengers. That’s because the favela boasts a surprising major attraction in the shape of a . 152 cable car service that provides one of the most stunning views of the hillside . shanty-town and breathtaking scenic vistas of the Rio cityscape. Covering 3.5 . kilometers from the bottom to the top in just under 20 minutes and stopping at . five stations on the way, the gondola . trip up the Alemao has become so popular with tourists that it is now the . second most visited location in Rio according to Roberta La Rovere, from Rio de . Janeiro’s International communications office. 'The Alemao favela cable cars have pushed the . Sugar Loaf Mountain cable car attraction into third place. Tourism to Alemao now sits behind the Christ . Statue which is still in first place. 'Last year over six million people visited . Alemao using the cable cars and every day it carries more than 12,000 . passengers into the heart of the slum,' she said. It’s a far cry from when the Alemao favela . was a no-go area even for the police. Olympic effort: A sports centre for children sits just outside the favela. It models itself on the training and commitment ethos of an Olympic village . Vast: There are many areas of the densely populated favela that will not benefit from the upgrades . Three years ago the densely packed slum was . the stronghold of the feared Red Command gangsters. The drug traffickers . controlled the comings and goings of the 300,000 residents and dictated their . daily lives which were blighted by drug-fueled shootouts and stray bullets that . often took innocent lives. Now thanks to the pacification strategy that saw . 3,000 armed security agents enter the favela with tanks and machine guns and wrest . control of the territory from drug factions in 2010, the slum dwellers can go . in and out as they please as the security of the area is now provided by a . permanent police presence  - the Police . Pacification Units (UPP). Grocery store holder, Andre de Paiva, 36, . has lived in Alemao all his life and says he has seen a lot of changes for the . better since the drug traffickers were forced out of the slum. 'It is more . peaceful and calmer. We are beginning to have a normal life here that everyone . else who has never lived in a favela takes for granted,' Mr de Paiva says. 'We used to pay taxes to the drug dealers . for a poor service, now we are getting a public service which has more . guarantees,' he adds. Marcelo Ramos, 38, who has lived in Alemao for . 25 years, gave up his job last year as a telecoms technician to take advantage . of the increasing numbers of visitors after pacification. He opened up a Bistro . in the heart of the favela specializing in German beers. 'If we didn’t have the UPP here I . wouldn’t have opened my bistro because people from outside the community . wouldn’t come,' says Mr Ramos. 'My customers are evenly divided between . residents, non residents and tourists. The UPP has improved the frequency and . increased the movement of people in the complex,' he adds. More than £250 million from the government’s growth acceleration programme . (PAC) has been ploughed into the hillside shanty-town bringing new health . clinics, creches and sports areas along with 1500 new homes. Noticeable improvements include better road . systems, waste management services, upgrades in street lighting and a heavily . used complaints hotline phone number that dials direct to Rio authorities on . which residents can voice their grievances, make suggestions and notify . officials of problems in their vicinity. However, the complex is so large that there . are still many areas in the favela that have not benefited from the upgrading . and changes. Alan Brum, director of the Institute for Moving . Roots, a local organization that seeks to promote social and cultural development . says: 'In the poorer areas of the complex there are still homes of wood . and wattle and daub, which accentuates the disparity in relation to the areas . where there has been effective action by the government.' Peace: Grocer Andre de Paive (left) said life has improved since drug traffickers left the area. Gustava Rafael (right) Mario Ferreiva (second right) play football in the favela's sports centre where 19 sports are on offer . Educational: A new technology centre gives precious access to computers and tablets with training for adults and educational playtime for children . He says the plans drawn up by the . authorities, mostly, do not reflect the needs of residents, such as basic . sanitation. 'The government has just been . acting from its own point of view and not from the standpoint of the . community.' One initiative that has been welcomed by . the community which was impossible to implement while the drug lords ruled is . the mapping of Alemao’s streets. For years there has been no road names just a . warren of alleyways that only favela dwellers could make sense of. Now roads . are being given names, houses numbers and people postal addresses. 'Before I got a postal address I used to . collect all my mail from my neighbourhood association. 'They would announcement . the arrival of the post on loud speakers and the community radio. Now we are . starting to get deliveries by postal workers,' says Mr de Paiva. The first favela cinema – CineCarioca – has . been opened in Alemao and a technology centre provides access to computers and . tablets with training for adults and educational playtime for children. Many of . the youngsters use the centre for homework support and they also get the opportunity . to play video games. An athletics and exercise centre for children . that models itself on the training and commitment ethos of an Olympic village . is situated just on the edge of Alemao. The centre offers over 19 different . sports including, swimming, football, basketball, ji jitsu and gymnastics. Thirteen year old Gustava Rafael hasn’t . missed a day of football since Alemao was liberated. 'I come here twice a week . to play and it’s so different now that we have had the changes. 'I don’t like . talking about the times before when things were bad, I like to forget it and when . I play football it helps me to do that,' he said. Luis Lavisch Salamanca, Advisor to the . secretary of sports and leisure for Rio, says: 'All the children who come to . the sports centre have been living in a war zone since they were born. This . centre helps them to reassimilate into normal life and rebuild their . self-esteem. 'We provide therapy and . discipline through sport which strengthens their social values such as respect . for rules and collaborative work and we hope this will positively shape their . future attitude as they grow up.'","Alemão is home to the first favela shopping centre that will create 6,000 jobs .

Families with children who suffer from Cockayne Syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by premature aging, gathered at the weekend in Alexandra, Virginia, to share experiences . Experts say children with Cockayne . syndrome are mostly happy and jovial, despite their conditions. Some may develop bits of gray hair, wrinkled skin or high . blood pressure. Those with severe cases often live only a few years, . while less severe onsets can affect people into their 40s. Scientists are still searching for . answers about the disease, estimated to affect one in 500,000 children . but difficult to diagnose. Jackie . Clark said she knew something wasn't right with her baby, Gigi, shortly . after she was born, even though doctors said everything was fine. Soon . they found Gigi had cataracts. They later found a problem with her nerve . endings that made her itchy all the time. Experts say children with Cockayne syndrome are mostly happy and jovial, despite their conditions . Cockayne syndrome (CS) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies as well as rapid aging (a form of progeria). Persons with this syndrome have smaller . than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, . and they have an 'aged' look. It is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children . but difficult to diagnose. For CS patients who are affected at . birth, life expectancy is 3–7 years. Other patients only start to show symptoms . in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years. However, . some rare CS patients live significantly longer. Individuals . with CS are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so . they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours. CS is often described as a 'progeria-like syndrome'. Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disease wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age. One of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture . occurred in the 1922 short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button by . F. Scott Fitzgerald (and later released as a feature film in 2008 staring Brad Pitt). The . main character, Benjamin Button, is born as a seventy-year-old man and . ages backwards; a scenario inspired by . progeria. ‘Slowly everything started to unravel as we discovered that she couldn't hear and she wasn't developing right,' Clark said. 'It . took us five years before we were able to figure out that she had . Cockayne syndrome. At that point, she was already close to the end of . her lifespan. She died four months later.'’ Now . Clark leads the Share and Care Cockayne Syndrome Network and organizes . the conference each year for families to meet. She said the gatherings . help because the disease can be isolating. A total of 43 CS families from around the country and other parts of the world came together at the weekend for the 14th annual International Family Conference. Because of the sensitivity of those children suffering from CS, a night time outing was arranged on the Cherry Blossom river cruise on the Potomac River for a tour of the Washington, DC monuments lit up at night. Two CS suffers celebrated their birthday’s during the event: Hannah Crego from New York who turned 13 years old and Colt Stillwell from Alabama will celebrated his milestone birthday of 21 years old. For parents it was an opportunity to share tips on caring for their children with a raft of health needs. Other discussions focused on helping the well siblings of CS patients to cope with the day to day issues. While for kids with CS it was a rare opportunity to meet others like themselves. Scientists and researchers joined them to observe their symptoms and to search for ways to provide treatment. Dr. Edward Neilan, a leading researcher . and pediatrician who has treated children with Cockayne at Boston . Children's Hospital, and a handful of other researchers often attend the . conferences to help them search for answers in recognizing and treating . the disease. ‘Once you've seen a condition, it takes on a personal, memorable aspect to you and becomes easier to recognize’ he said. ‘But . if you've never seen it before and you're only relying on textbooks, . it's very hard to recognize something that you've never seen before.’ The event was an opportunity for CS suffers and their siblings to play together with other kids in the same situation . Genetic . testing can detect mutations that cause the disease, but to diagnose . the condition in a child, a doctor would have to suspect Cockayne in . order to test the patient's cells, experts said. Many patients develop a . distinct facial appearance, and some families self-diagnose their . children and seek help. Dr. Philip J. Brooks, an adjunct investigator . and rare disease researcher at the National Institutes of Health, . developed a hypothesis that the brain disease is caused by cells that . aren't making proteins they need to function normally. Then the cells . are prone to dying. Brooks said meeting affected children over the . past eight years sparked his interest in the rare condition. He said it . hasn't received much research focus or public attention. 'I had . learned about it in textbooks and seen pictures, but that's not the same . thing as seeing it,' he said. 'That had a big impact on me and made me . want to study this and to do something to help these people.' Over the years, he said he has observed the progression of the disease and listened to the parents' observations. Scientists are still searching for answers about the disease, estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose . At . this year's conference in Alexandria, Dr. Alan Weiner, a . biochemistry professor at the University of Washington, conducted a . blood draw for research funded by the National Institutes of Health to . try to determine what causes Cockayne syndrome. He is testing whether . the children's' cells have the same protein symptoms as laboratory . cells. 'If they do, it might suggest new remedies that could actually be tried now,' he said. A . small biopharmaceutical company recently tried to develop a treatment . but ran out of money. The treatment was never fully developed, Neilan . said. Parents are anxious to know more about the disease. Haylee . Carroll of Knoxville, Tenn., had three children with the syndrome and . two healthy children. Her first two children were never fully diagnosed . with the condition before they died. Now her 3-month-old baby, Eris, her . fifth child, also shows signs of the disease. 'We still haven't ever . had a piece of paper that says they have this. That would be nice to . have,' she said. 'We know that they have it, but it would be nice just . to have (confirmation).'

Ethan Fisbane had chucked out the fake bomb as he cleared out his flat in Manhattan ahead of moving home - but it was found by the building's caretaker who called the police. A huge number of NYPD police officers descended on the area, including members of the Bomb Squad and Emergency Service Unit, while the Joint Terrorism Task Force was put on notice. Scroll down for video . Scare: Playwright Ethan Fishbane caused a major security scare when he threw out an old prop bomb from his play about suicide bombers . The 23-year-old from New Jersey told the New York Post that he 'didn't think' when he threw the bomb away. He added: 'I didn't think twice about it, because, literally, it's two blocks of clay, a calculator that's cut in half and some wires from a Gameboy.' As detectives carried out door-to-door enquiries along the street, he realised what had happened. 'They came to knock on my door. At first, I didn’t know what . they were talking about. But then I was like, ""Oh, my God! I think . that’s my prop. I think that’s mine"",' he told the newspaper. The playwright, who has decided not to produce any more plays about terrorists, said he felt reassured by how the police reacted. 'I felt the response was wholly appropriate. Even if it’s just a prop for a theater piece, they were on top of it,' he said. Chaos: Hundreds of police descended on Bedford Street, in Manhattan, (pictured) after the prop bomb was found in a bin near Mr Fishbane's flat . Mr Fishbane's play titled 'American Suicide Bomber Association' was performed as if it were a conference, with actors discussing the best way to do suicide bombings. It featured a twist ending where an actor seated in the audience would stand up to announce they had a bomb, thus 'bombing' the suicide bombing conference. The experimental piece made its début at Dixon Place theatre in New York before touring to Indonesia and South Africa. The playwright is a recent graduate from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he specialised in experimental theatre.

For many new parents, the sight of their newborn peacefully asleep is one to behold - a moment to savour and a short respite from constant rounds of feeds and nappy changing. Dispelling the myth that sleep is an alien concept to newborns, New Jersey photographer Alicia Gould has captured these heartwarming moments in a series of pictures of babies in the earliest stages of their lives. Alicia, 32, captures the babies, some as young as three days old, in a variety of poses and mostly asleep. Sleeping beauty: Photographer Alicia Gould has taken a series of adorable pictures of newborn babies when they are just a few days old . Cute: Most of the pictures, including this one, show the children while they are fast asleep . Child's play: Alicia, who says she loves the 'simplicity' of photographing newborns spends around three hours on each shoot . Angelic: Alicia captures the children in a range of poses and with differing expressions on their faces . She said: 'I like the simplicity of photographing newborns. 'My goal is really just to freeze that moment in time, the physical and the emotional. 'I want mum to look at those images ten years from now and see that overwhelming love she had for her new baby, the way they smelled, how tiny their fingers and toes were. She added: 'I remember five years ago doing my first free newborn session to add to my portfolio and loving it.' 'Scary': Alicia admits that photographing newborns is 'one of the scariest things' Fast asleep: Alicia says that even if she wants to, it's impossible to wake some of the children up . Snug: Alicia explains that half the challenge is getting the children's parents to relax during an undoubtedly nervy first few weeks of parenthood . Moment to savour: She says that her aim is to capture a special moment in time that parents can remember in years to come . Alicia spends around three hours on each shoot, photographing tots as young as three days old. She explained: 'Photographing newborns has to be one of the scariest things though. 'I go to my client's home and I never know what to expect, each and every baby I've met is different. 'Some are very feisty and some you can't wake up even if you try.

Defence bosses have rapped a group of elite Israeli troops for joining in a wedding party in Hebron while on patrol in the city of Hebron. The troops from the Givati Brigade stumbled across the celebration in the Palestinian city in the southern West Bank and were recorded on a mobile phone joining in with a dance, Gangnam style. At one point a soldier, in full uniform and carrying his weapon, is lifted up onto the shoulders of a reveler as the crowd enthusiastically dances to the music. The footage was aired Wednesday on  Israeli Channel 2 TV, according to The Jerusalem Post. Joining hands: Israeli soldiers are under investigation for partying with Palestinians celebrating a wedding in Hebron . After the friendly interaction, the troops left peacefully, according to local media, but the soldiers are now under investigation for 'exposing themselves to unnecessary danger'. A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), quoted in The Times of Israel, said: 'This is an incident of utmost severity... The soldiers have been called in for questioning, and the commanders of the brigade and the battalion are investigating. The soldiers [in question] will be dealt with appropriately.' A former Israeli soldier, Seth Freedman, writing in The Guardian, condemned the IDF for castigating the soldiers and praised the human judgement of those involved, to show some compassion and friendliness. Source YouTube TodyTalk . The jovial crowd enthusiastically danced with the soldiers, who were wearing uniform and carrying their weapons . Ultimately, proof that the soldiers' actions were not putting them at risk is that they walked into and out of the situation without any animosity or violence. Mr freedman wrote: 'Leaving the military rulebook aside, the footage of the wedding dancing does a great deal to humanise both sides of the interminable conflict, showing that – at ground level – not every meeting between Israelis and Palestinians is doomed to end in bitterness, bloodshed and recrimination.' He concluded: 'Outraged IDF chiefs might castigate their troops for the ""unnecessary danger"" of their actions, but the opposite is the truth. It is the intransigent behaviour and policies of those at the helm of the IDF and Knesset which expose all Israelis and Palestinians to such unnecessary danger, and they could learn a great deal from the bridge-building revelry of the dancing troops.'

The Montana judge who provoked outrage by sentencing a teacher who repeatedly raped a 14-year-old girl to just 30 days in jail has today claimed that his paltry sentence ‘actually upped’ the convicted rapist’s ‘debt to society’. In a written addendum to his sentence handed down in Billings District Court on Monday Judge G Todd Baugh stated: ‘Had the defendant pled guilty or been convicted by a jury three years ago, he would have had a basis from which to argue for a minimum sentence.’ Victim Cherice Moralez committed suicide on February 6, 2010. She shot herself in her mother’s bed just three weeks before her 17th birthday. Horror: Cherice Moralez, pictured, shot herself dead in her mother's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail . Controversial: Judge G. Todd Baugh sentence has sparked outrage and will be reviewed . Teacher: Rambold, 54, lost his house, his job, his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges. His lawyer suggested, and the judge seemed to agree on Monday, that he had been 'punished enough' According to her mother, Auliea Hanlon, the pending trial of teacher Stacey Rambold - 49 when the rapes were committed - and trauma of the abuse were ‘major factors’ in her daughter’s death. Speaking to MailOnline Mrs Hanlon said that her daughter had been ‘in hell,’ shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the abuse. Her death complicated the prosecution of former Billings Senior High School teacher Rambold, now 54, who was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008. Prosecutors who had sought to put Rambold behind bars instead settled for a three-year deferred prosecution. According to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this term if Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and entered a three-stage sex offender treatment program. But in December 2012 the case was revived when it transpired that Rambold had violated the terms of the program, having contact with minors and engaging in a sexual relationship [not with a minor] without informing his counselor. In his written explanation Judge Baugh maintained that these violations were ‘not significant’. He stated: ‘There were violations of the treatment program, but involved no violence, no inappropriate sexual conduct, and no new criminal activity. ‘Defendant’s old treatment provider recommended that the Defendant still be assessed as a low risk offender and treatable in the community. Critic: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's . mother criticized the judge's apology as 'meaningless' ‘Knowing that the Defendant had enrolled in another sexual offender treatment program, the Court is faced with deciding if the Defendant should go to prison for relatively minor infractions.’ Judge Baugh went on to state that there was other information that could not be publicly released but had played a part in the court’s decision: a July 2013 pre-sentence report from the Department of Corrections, an August 2009 psychological/psychosocial evaluation of Rambold, and two interviews with the victim in 2009. Judge Baugh was forced to apologize for his comments in court, in which he claimed that the victim was ‘older than her chronological years’ and ‘in control of the situation’ in which she was raped in Rambold’s car, his then marital home and on school premises. Similarly he drew fierce criticism when appearing to diminish the crime as, in defending his sentence, he said: ‘I think people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape ... but it wasn’t this forcible, beat up rape.’ In his addendum he conceded: ‘Rape under any circumstances is a horrible violent offense. Some involved physical beatings, broken bones. Others, as here, involve young victims legally not capable of consenting. All are traumatic and all are crimes.’ Though he stated that he believed a prison sentence to be ‘appropriate’ in this case Judge Baugh   stood by his decision to suspend all but 31 days of Rambold’s 15 years plus one day’s credit for time served. He said: ‘Based on all circumstances, the Court upped Mr Rambold’s debt to society from the almost expired three years Deferred Prosecution Agreement to the 15 years suspended sentence.’ Rambold’s sentence puts him on probation for 15 years and requires him to finish sex-offender treatment and to register as a convicted sex offender. Yellowstone County prosecutor Scott Twito is still reviewing the sentence with a view to finding some legal grounds for appeal, and Judge Baugh’s explanation and defense of his decision will do little to silence the voices of those clamoring for his resignation. 'Bad form': Judge Baugh is running for re-election next year. Protestors vowed to ensure he doesn't receive a fifth term . Tens of thousands have signed an online petition calling for him to be removed from his post and yesterday hundreds protested his sentence outside Billings District Court House. Speaking to MailOnline Cherry’s mother said: ‘Rambold took away everything beautiful in my life and he just gets to walk away. He confessed. He did it. ‘With this sentence the judge just lets everyone off – he lets the school off and he lets him off.’","Cherice Moralez, 14 at the .

Chelsea Manning is doing well at the start of her prison sentence after announcing her desire to live as a woman, according to her lawyer. Manning, who was previously known as Bradley, is currently going through a three- to four-week 'indoctrination' at Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas at the start of a 35-year jail term for leaking Government secrets. Her lawyer David Coombs wrote on his blog that he spoke with Manning on Wednesday and plans to visit medical staff and bosses at the prison in a bid to allow her to undergo hormone therapy and other treatment for her gender dysphoria. Officials have previously said they will not allow her to go through the sex change procedure in prison, but the lawyer has vowed to challenge the ruling. 'Doing well': Chelsea Manning, pictured here in a U.S Army supplied photo, is said to be doing well as she undergoes 'indoctrination' at the beginning of her 35 year jail term for leaking Government secrets . Mr Coombs wrote: 'Yesterday was my first opportunity to speak with Chelsea since her sentencing.  I am happy to report that she is doing very well at the [prison], and has already made several friends who accept her for who she is. 'She requested that I relay how grateful that she is for everyone's understanding and continued support.' Announcement: Manning, seen here during her trial, announced last week that she wishes to undergo hormone therapy and live as a woman . Mr Coombs went on the Today show last . week, a day after Manning was sentenced, to announce that Manning wants . to live as a woman named Chelsea and begin hormone treatment as soon as . possible. He wrote: 'These . requests address a serious medical need of Chelsea and are consistent . with the general medical community's practice of adequate medical care . for those with gender dysphoria.' It is Army policy not to provide such treatment; soldiers diagnosed with gender dysphoria - a condition where sufferers feel that there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity - are administratively discharged. But Manning cannot be discharged until she completes her prison sentence and exhausts all appeals of her court-martial findings. When asked on Thursday whether Manning has yet requested treatment, Coombs said it was too soon to provide additional information. He had said earlier in the week that if the Army refuses to pay for it, Manning will pay, but it is not clear whether the prison will allow that. Army Medical Command spokeswoman Maria Tolleson said soldiers are allowed on a case-by-case basis to pay for procedures not covered by the military's medical insurance programme, such as elective cosmetic surgery. Support: Manning's lawyer David Coombs announced the soldier's new identity on the Today show last week . Manning was diagnosed with gender . dysphoria by two Army behavioral health specialists before her trial, . but Tolleson said in an email that patient medical records are reviewed . and prisoners are re-evaluated when they move to a new facility.

Coombs . wrote on his blog that he told Manning during their conversation of the . public's response to the Today show announcement, and of the decision . by most major news outlets to refer to her as a woman using her new name.

The 2014 Honda Odyssey has become the first minivan to be awarded the Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety after passing a rigorous new crash test with flying colors. The Institute, an independent non-profit, named the Odyssey its top pick after the car received a 'Good' rating - the highest possible - in a series of crash tests. To win the commendation, a vehicle must earn 'Good' ratings in four out of five crash tests and no less than 'Acceptable' in the fifth. Safest ever: The new Honda 2014 Odyssey minivan displayed at the 2013 New York International Auto Show in March . 'Safety is high on the list for parents when it comes to shopping for a family vehicle' Institute President Adrian Lund told CBS. 'Consumers look for models with the highest safety ratings. Honda is ahead of many of its competitors in building state-of-the-art crash-worthiness into its vehicles.' The crash simulations the minivan was tested for were moderate overlap front, small overlap front, side, rollover, and rear crashes. The small overlap front test  measures how well the vehicle would protect its passengers if some, not all, of the front bumper hit another vehicle or vehicle. Small overlap collisions are some of the most common and most dangerous types of accident, and the Odyssey received a 'Good' rating in the test. Crash tests: The most rigorous crash tests ever were conducted on the Honda Odyssey, all of which it received top scores for . In the test, 25 per cent of a vehicle’s front end on the driver side struck a five-foot rigid barrier traveling at 40 mph. 'In the Odyssey test, the driver’s space was maintained reasonably well. Injury measures on the dummy indicated a low risk of injury in a crash of this severity,' read a statement from the Institute. 'Because the structure helped keep the steering column stable, the front airbag stayed in front of the driver dummy during the crash to provide good protection. The side curtain airbag deployed and had sufficient forward coverage to protect the head from contact with the side structure and outside objects.' Common accident: The 2014 Odyssey is the first minivan the Institute has evaluated in the small overlap front test . Although the recommendation is positive for Honda, many other vehicles in the Odyssey's class also received high ratings. The Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country, and Toyota Sienna have all been named IIHS Top Safety Picks. According to the LA Times, Honda made some key changes to its 2014 Odyssey including adding 60lbs of additional high-strength steel to help offset the force of a crash. The car remains the most fuel-efficient in its class, despite the extra weight. The base model Odyssey costs just less than $30,000, but if you're after a deluxe version, the Touring Elite model costs $45,000 and comes with an integrated vacuum cleaner.","The 2014 Honda Odyssey is the first minivan to be awarded the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Top Safety Pick Plus designation .

The 89-year-old son of philanthropist Brooke Astor convicted of stealing millions of dollars from his mother recently said he has regrets about what happened. A parole hearing document released Thursday shows that when Anthony Marshall was asked whether he'd do the things at issue differently if he could, Marshall said, simply, ‘Quite.’ Marshall's brief answers in the August 21 interview, which led to his release last week on medical parole, offer a glimpse into thoughts he didn't express at his 2009 trial or sentencing in a case that opened a well-placed window on New York society. Interviewed in a hospital bed two months into his one-to-three-year sentence, Marshall was asked whether he had regrets about the events leading to his imprisonment. ‘Well, regrets, yeah,’ he said, ‘naturally.’ Astor married Vincent Astor, a descendant of one of America's first multimillionaires, and she gave away millions to both big cultural institutions and neighborhood charities. She received the nation's top civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was a fondly regarded fixture in the city's society set. She was 105 when she died in 2007. Marshall, a former ambassador and Broadway producer, was convicted in 2009 of exploiting his mother's dementia to loot her $200million fortune. His trial plunged jurors into a world of Park Avenue apartments and sprawling estates; witnesses included Astor friends Henry Kissinger and Barbara Walters. Mr Marshall, who didn't testify at his trial or speak at his sentencing, denies the allegations and has fought his conviction. He remained free on bail until June. State law allows medical parole for inmates with serious and permanent illnesses. Court date: Anthony Marshall arrived in court in June, helped by Charlene, as a Judge prepared to sentence him to prison . Marshall . suffers from Parkinson's disease, his doctors have said. He'd been . taken to a hospital after falling down in prison and was interviewed . with an oxygen tube to help his breathing, according to the redacted . transcript released by the state Department of Corrections and Community . Supervision. Mr . Marshall told parole commissioners he can't stand up or walk for long, . gets dizzy and needs help to fasten a button. While he said he was fuzzy . about the date and how long he'd been in prison, he said his memory . overall was ‘fair.’ And when asked whether he recalled the allegations that led to his conviction, Marshall didn't hesitate. ‘I remember it,’ he said, ‘all too well.’ The New York Daily News reported that Marshall also told the panel that he ‘loved’ his mother and ‘found her to be an extraordinary person.’ ‘We . had lots of things in common, particularly a sense of humor, and we . went on lots of trips together,’ Marshall continued, singling out their . frequent summer vacations in Italy. When . asked by a parole board member what he would do if he were released . early, Marshall said he would ‘enjoy the pleasure and surrounding of . home,’ according to The New York Times. He then added, ‘I miss home.’ Emotional: Anthony Marshall's wife Charlene, cried and hugged him, as the heir to Brooke Astor's estate was jailed in June . The . New York parole board decided unanimously to free Marshall because he . was 'suffering from a significant and permanent non-terminal condition, . disease or syndrome'. He has been at an disclosed hospital for at least a month, according to the New York Post, and cannot walk or use the bathroom by himself. The . parole board also considered the $14.5million in restitution Marshall . paid for stealing from his elderly mother to fund a Maine estate and . 55ft yacht among other luxuries. Marshall, . who was given his discharge papers last Friday, will remain under . the supervision of a New York parole officer until June 20, 2016, which . is the latest possible date of his sentence. The . 89-year-old had been found guilty of stealing millions from his . family's estate after his mother had Alzheimer's diagnosed in the years . leading up to her death. When his lawyers first filed for medical parole last month, a source told the New York Post: . 'Anthony is dying, and he is in a lousy state prison. He has a new . doctor's letter stating he is even worse than a few months ago. 'He has very bad heart concerns. He is incontinent. It could be weeks or months or days.' Distraught: Charlene Marshall seen leaving court in June after her 89-year-old husband was ordered to serve his sentence . When sentenced in June, Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said: 'I take no pleasure in following my duties', as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009. Mr . Bartely said he would rather not jail the Second World War veteran, but . prosecutors argued that his state of health and war record should not . mean an early release. Marshall's . lawyer, William B. Zabel, said his client should be allowed to die in . peace at his home with his wife Charlene by his side. He had previously lost a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health. Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his 'preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times. The . original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law . and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'. Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them. Sentencing: Anthony Marshall seen in court with his lawyers on sentencing day . At Marshall's sentencing, the judge . read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court . to spare him prison. 'Please . consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My . father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, 'you . can't change the past', Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He . urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him. Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial. And . it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his . father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed. Prosecutors said Marshall, a former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, he bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money. High society, Anthony Marshall with his mother, Brooke Astor, at the Plaza Hotel in 2002 . He also took valuable artwork off her . walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most . of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite . charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Astor had devoted her life to . philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, . the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum. However, . the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly . heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue . apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help. She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill . estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home . in Manhattan, were later sold. When the wranglings over her $100million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick $74,680 worth of her possessions.

These peculiar portraits were created by a dedicated artist who spent every day for an entire year drawing a self-portrait using both hands. Ambidextrous artist Tom Mosser, 53, came up with the idea of his Bed Head Self-Portrait Series as a way of being creative at least once a day. Some days he would work for just one minute while others he would draw for hours - but the pictures always had to be finished that day. A year in the life: Tom Mosser stands before dozens of the portraits he created for his project . The project lasted nearly 13 months with Tom, from Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, completing 395 self-portraits. His unique talent meant that Tom could clench a pen or a paintbrush in both hands when creating his works. The technique, which he calls 'Ambidextrous Impressionism', requires using movements with his left hand and firm movements with his right. Tom said his works were created through whatever means took his fancy that day. Tom describes his technique as Ambidextrous Impressionism - movements with left hand and firmer movements with his right hand . Nods to Picasso and Warhol? Tom uses pens, pencils and paintbrushes . He uses pens, pencils and paintbrushes, planned some works but spontaneously sketched others and used surfaces ranging from paper to cardboard, wood, shopping bags and canvases. He even let his hair grow for an entire year to help depict change. Tom said: 'There were days that I relished creating them and there were days that I grew bored of drawing myself again but no matter how tired I was I would do it. More experimental: there were days when Tom relished creating and days when he grew bored . Scary: several times Tom was travelling with friends and would pop out to the bathroom with paper and pencil in hand to work . Tom was determined to finish at least one portrait per day . Discipline: Artist Tom wrote comments about his portraits on Facebook so he had to get on with it . 'Several times I was travelling and visiting friends and I'd pop out to the bathroom with paper and pencil in hand, taping the paper to the mirror for a quick sketch.

Zurich Insurance confirmed today that former finance director Pierre Wauthier left a suicide note naming the firm's then-chairman Josef Ackermann. The Swiss company said today that the letter documents the relationship between the pair but said that it would be 'inappropriate' to elaborate further. Mr Ackermann quit as chairman yesterday after saying he had come under pressure to take 'my share of responsibility' following the apparent suicide of Mr Wauthier. Chief Financial Officer Mr Wauthier, who had worked for the company for 17 years and had joint British and French citizenship, was found dead at his home on Monday. Shock announcement: Zurich Insurance chairman Josef Ackermann resigned yesterday following the apparent suicide of finance director Pierre Wauthier . Police are not looking for any other parties in connection with the death. A spokesman for Zurich told MailOnline: 'We were informed that such a letter exists and we are aware of its content. 'It is correct that it relates to the relationship between Pierre Wauthier and Josef Ackermann but it would be inappropriate for us to further elaborate on it. 'It is a very difficult situation, especially for the families and friends of Pierre Wauthier. 'We all need to respect their privacy during this difficult time and we deeply regret his passing, which was completely unexpected.' The latest development comes as Mr Wauthier's widow Fabienne criticised Mr Ackermann's management style. According to Swiss press, Mr Wauthier's widow is reported to have accused Mr Ackermann of forcing her husband 'into a corner' and cited his 'tough management style' as a factor in his death. Details of the note emerged a day after former Deutsche Bank chief executive Mr Ackermann issued an extraordinary statement in which he said Wauthier’s family had made allegations against him in connection with the unexplained death. Ackermann said: ‘The unexpected death of Pierre Wauthier has deeply shocked me. I have reasons to believe that the family is of the opinion that I should take my share of responsibility, as unfounded as any allegations might be. Tragedy: Pierre Wauthier was found dead in his apartment in Zug, Switzerland on Monday . ‘As a consequence, I see the . possibility of a continued successful board leadership to the benefit of . Zurich called into question. 'To avoid any damage to Zurich’s reputation, I have decided to resign from all my board functions with immediate effect.’ Vice chairman Tom de Swaan will replace Ackermann. It . is the second potential Swiss suicide in recent months at a high . profile firm. Carsten Schloter, chief executive of telecoms firm . Swisscom, also took his own life. Wauthier, . who had a wife and two grown up children, joined the firm as head of . investor relations and rose rapidly to board level. He was described by one colleague as ‘rational, easy going and wonderful’. A . spokeswoman for Zurich Insurance did not elaborate on what allegations . Ackermann was referring to surrounding Wauthier, who was 53 and left a . wife and two children. Zurich's chief executive Martin Senn had said he was not aware of any dispute that could have driven Wauthier to his death. 'We didn't spot any conflicts that could or should have led to such a death,' Senn told Swiss television. However, a former colleague of Wauthier's said there was pressure within the company to increase its share price. Two insurance executives outside the firm's headquarters in Zurich described their colleagues as 'somewhat shellshocked' and said Ackermann's departure was a surprise for the industry. One of Europe's leading economic power brokers, Ackermann, 65, transformed Germany's Deutsche Bank and played a role in the euro zone's financial crisis as chairman of the Institute of International Finance (IIF). High-flyer: Mr Wauthier was appointed to the post of CFO at Zurich Insurance Group in September 2011. He had been with the company for 17 years . He was touted as a candidate for top . financial jobs in his native Switzerland before he took the relatively . low-key role at Zurich last year. He also sits on the boards of Royal . Dutch Shell, Siemens and Investor AB. Ackermann . has survived controversy before. In 2006, he paid 3.2 million euros, . without admitting wrongdoing, to avoid trial in a dispute over payments . to executives at telecoms firm Mannesmann, where he sat on the board of . directors. One of few . senior industry figures to keep his job through the current financial . crisis, he became a forceful public advocate for the Swiss financial . sector after leaving Deutsche. 'Ackermann's . mission when he came was to shake up Zurich, to infuse a more dynamic . mentality into it,' said a person close to the former Zurich chairman. 'Yes, insurance isn't banking. But there was still more oomph to be wrung out of Zurich, he thought.' When Ackermann took over as Deutsche Bank chief executive in May 2002, radical surgery was needed. Burdened with high costs, it was slipping as one of the largest lenders in Europe. The first non-German to lead the bank, Ackermann was asked to transform it into a 'global champion', but fell out with a German establishment that saw Deutsche's traditional role as supporting national industries. When Ackermann joined the Frankfurt-based institution, the bank derived more than 70 per cent of revenues from Germany. Ackermann sold off industrial holdings and slashed jobs, and Deutsche now makes less than 30 per cent of its revenue there. However, his arrival at Zurich failed to impress investors and there was considerable change in the top ranks. Former general insurance head Mario Greco left a year ago to become head of Italian insurer Generali. Two weeks ago the head of its life insurance arm, Kevin Hogan, left to become AIG's head of consumer insurance. On Aug. 15, Zurich said it would be hard pressed to meet certain performance targets after posting a 27 percent fall in second-quarter net profit due to natural disaster payouts, which topped those of European rivals because of its high exposure to the United States. The shares closed down 2.47 percent at 228.80 francs, but remained above the low of 225.6 francs that they reached on Tuesday after news of Wauthier's death. The volume of shares traded on the day, however, was the highest in over three years.","Pierre Wauthier, 53, was found dead at his home on Monday .

The New York City comptroller candidate was given three opportunities this morning to defend himself against allegations he has a girlfriend, but instead chose to dodge reporters' questions. 'I am so tired of the personal attacks and I've answered all those questions,' he said at a Brooklyn campaign stop. Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer has refused to deny that he has a girlfriend . With wife Silda by his side, Eliot Spitzer publicly apologizes to his family after he was linked to a prostitution ring in 2008 . Spitzer spectacularly resigned from politics five years ago after admitting he regularly had sex with prostitutes, including Emperors Club VIP call girls Ashley Alexandra Dupré. While his wife Silda, 55, stood by him, it has been reported she now plans to leave her husband as soon as the New York election is held in November. The couple also reportedly live apart. Spitzer today tried to play down the fresh rumors about a new extra-marital tryst - telling reporters the public doesn't care about his love life. 'The public cares about what I did in government. That's what I'm going to be talking about and that's what the public is going to be voting on - based on what I did in terms of trying to clean up Wall Street, which got a lot more attention than the other things we did,' he said, according to the New York Post. 'But the other things we did was just as important.' When the topic was raised again, Spitzer insisted voters weren't interested in his private affairs. 'We've . said everything we can say about that and these are attacks that are . coming out of left field and frankly, you know, the public cares about . what the public should care about. The public frankly is a lot smarter . in this regard than some folks in the media,' he said. When a reporter gave him a final chance to 'reject' the rumors, Spitzer said: 'I have said everything we're going to say about this.' Spitzer's favorite call girl, Ashley Dupre, met for romps in room 817 of the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. on several occasions . Ex-New York madam Kristin Davis supplied Spitzer with prostitutes . Spitzer's controversial comeback follows the 2008 revelation he had spent about $80,000 on prostitutes supplied by Emperors Club VIP madam Kristin Davis. The married father of three daughters took call-girls, including his favorite Ashley Alexandra Dupré, to room 871 at the tony Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C., paying about $1,000 per hour for his sexcapades. Spitzer's extra-marital liaisons were revealed after Davis' illicit operation attracted the attention of federal law enforcement. They then caught Spitzer on a wiretap arranging a sex-for-pay session with Dupré. 'I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right or wrong,' Spitzer said in a short speech, after media reports identified him as a man referred to in court documents as 'Client 9.' Spitzer resigned but never faced criminal charges because federal authorities determined he didn't use public money to fund his trysts. Spitzer’s political comeback has been compared to that of New York mayoral contender Anthony Weiner, the married former U.S. congressman who resigned after sending racy photos of himself to several . women, including Sydney Leathers.

More than a quarter of home buyers are now paying stamp duty at the higher rates of 3 per cent or more, research has found. Hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers and hardworking families are losing out to the tune of more than £7,500 when they move home, the TaxPayers’ Alliance study found. The pressure group launched a Stamp Out Stamp Duty campaign calling for a cut in the ‘punitive’ levy, which raised £4billion for the Treasury in 2012/13 - some £3.6billion of which was collected at rates of 3 per cent or more. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers and . hardworking families are losing out to the tune of more than £7,500 when . they move home, the TaxPayers' Alliance study found . They say it is unfair that rising house prices mean that a greater proportion of homes are coming into the net of the higher levies because the thresholds have stayed static for years. Sales of residential properties are free of stamp duty up to the value of £125,000 and attract a 1 per cent tax between £125,000 and £250,000. But rising house prices mean that more and more purchasers are paying at the higher rates of 3 per cent applied to homes worth between £250,000 and £500,000. A rate of 4 per cent is charged on those valued at up to £1million, 5 per cent on those between £1-£2million and 7 per cent beyond that point. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Owning your own home is an important milestone, but for many families it seems harder and harder to reach. Sales of residential properties are free of stamp duty up to the value of £125,000 and attract a 1 per cent tax between £125,000 and £250,000 . ‘Ministers have done nothing to ease the burden imposed by stamp duty, which is an unfair double tax that gets in the way of would-be first-time buyers and others thinking about moving. Instead they have made things worse with new thresholds and new, higher rates. ‘The Government needs to act on ministers’ rhetoric about getting people onto the property ladder and cut this unfair tax.’ The TaxPayers’ Alliance research found that, unsurprisingly, home-buyers in London and the South East are hardest hit. But an increasing number of people in other parts of the country are being hit by stamp duty at the 3 per cent rate. The group argues that stamp duty acts as a barrier both for an increasing number of first-time buyers and existing home-owners wanting to move house to get a new job, be near to relatives or accommodate a growing family. Because stamp duty is imposed on the total value of the property, and not just the portion of the price which is above the threshold, families buying a home for between £250,000 and £500,000 pay between £7,500 and £15,000. Tax bills: The average house price has sat above the 1 per cent stamp duty threshold for a decade, Nationwide's chart shows, but many properties incur a much higher 3 per cent charge. In England and Wales, some 723,829 homes were bought in 2012/13, with more than 25 per cent (182,692) being liable for stamp duty at a rate of 3 per cent or more. Stamp duty rates of 3 per cent or more were imposed on 65 per cent of all residential transactions in London, and 39 per cent in the rest of the South-East. The figure was 27 per cent in the East of England, 24 per cent in the South-West, 12 per cent in the West Midlands and 10 per cent in the East Midlands, according to the TPA research. In the north, the figures were much lower: 9 per cent in the North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber, and 6 per cent in the North-East. Some 8 per cent of Welsh homes attracted the higher levies. The TPA did not look at Scotland. The recent 2020 Tax Commission review by the TPA and the Institute of Directors concluded that stamp duty should be abolished, as did the Mirrlees Review from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Simon Lambert: Stamp duty is an unfair tax that needs changing . Perhaps the most infuriating thing about the unfair stamp duty system is that today's buyers of an ordinary family home get stung with a tax bill originally designed for the wealthiest, writes This is Money editor Simon Lambert. That £250,000 threshold that hits ordinary families so hard has never gone up, despite rampant house price inflation since 1997, when then Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced extra levels of the tax. If it had been linked to property prices it would now stand at £716,000, according to Nationwide's data. As a point of comparison, today's £250,000 home would have cost you £87,000 in 1997 - a level that would currently incur no stamp duty whatsoever. Buyers pay the tax on a property's sale price, so those big bills they pay are ultimately driven by the seller's profit. You can work out how much stamp duty you would pay using our calculator below. Until Gordon Brown's arrival as Chancellor in 1997, stamp duty was a flat rate of 1% above £60,000. He first changed this to 1.5% above £250,000 and 2% above £500,000 and then cashed in on his property boom by hiking these to 3% and 4%, respectively, in 2000. The effect as house prices rocketed through the 2000s boom was a nice little earner as the tax dragged more and more families into a trap originally laid for the wealthy. Since then new stamp duty thresholds have also been added at £1m and £2m and George Osborne has given no indication that he will change the slab system, despite repeated calls to do so. This is Money has long campaigned against the unfair nature of stamp duty and called for a serious investigation into its change and welcomes the Stamp Out Stamp Duty campaign. It is a bad tax, it is levelled unfairly, hits some regions far worse than others, encourages extra debt and inhibits people moving for work. While a change to stamp duty would cut tax revenue, it would at least make the system fairer. It would also prevent the current situation that involves buyers loading themselves up with bigger mortgages as they need to use cash that could have gone into their deposit to pay a hefty tax bill. From midnight on 21 March, Budget Day 2012, a new tax tier was introduced on homes costing more than £2,000,000. These homes now attract a rate of 7%.","First-time .

The originator of the now-ubiquitous foam finger is disappointed at his creation being 'degraded' by Miley Cyrus in her controversial performance with Robin Thicke at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday. Steve Chmelar, 59, created the first finger back in 1971 when he was a 16-year-old looking for a way to cheer on his school basketball team in the Iowa state championships. Chmelar never imagined his homage to school sports would eventually find its way on-stage with a 20-year-old pop-star clad in a skin-colored latex bikini doing unspeakable things to it. Finger fiasco: The much-maligned performance by Miley Cyrus and her foam finger . Cyrus' thrusting, grinding, twerking and inability to keep her tongue inside her head has been much-remarked since the performance but for Chmelar, it was particularly distasteful. 'She took an honorable icon that is seen in sporting venues everywhere and degraded it. Fortunately, the foam finger has been around long enough that it will survive this incident,' Chmelar told Fox Sports. Cyrus' antics aside, the foam finger first found fame when an Associated Press photographer took a picture of the teenaged Chmelar with a large hand with pointing finger that Fox Sports reports he made from 'galvanized hardware cloth, paper mache, spray paint and a red marker over the course of a few days.' He was snapped at one of the two games he used the finger to cheer on his team - the state semifinal and the championship game in Des Moines. Family friendly: The photo taken by Associated Press and printed in the 1971 Ottumwa High School yearbook of Chmelar and his creation . Finger faux pas: The foam finger with brightly painted red fingernails was created by a stylist a year ago, but will now permanently reside with Cyrus, who took it home from the award show . Pointing the finger: The foam finger first made its appearance in Robin Thicke's music video for 'Blurred Lines' Infamy: Miley Cyrus and her foam finger during the cringe-worthy spectacle . 'It was pretty popular at the game,' Chmelar told Fox Sports. 'Nobody had ever seen anything like that before, so it got some attention. And then when the team made its trip back to Ottumwa from Des Moines, I recall being on the bus with the team, holding the finger out the window.' The finger: Chmelar's original homemade creation . A few years later, the first foam fingers began making their appearance at sports games after Geral Fauss began selling them at the 1978 Cotton Bowl game. Chmelar and Fauss have never met, but Chmelar thinks it was his homemade finger that was the inspiration for the famous foam finger. 'I don’t have evidence of newspaper clippings from around the country, . but I do recall people from other states saying that they had seen the . picture,' Chmelar said. As for the actual finger defiled by Cyrus onstage, it was originally made by stylist Lisa Katnic for a fashion shoot last year. It didn't make the cut but when styling the video for Robin Thicke's Blurred . Lines, she decided to bring it along as a prop. It featured in the video and then went on to become part of Cyrus' performance. And according to Yahoo Music, the pop star took it home with her without even buying it dinner first. As Cyrus furiously twerked and fondled Robin Thicke onstage, Chmelar was otherwise occupied. He only saw a clip of the performance after a family member showed him on YouTube. 'For people that like that kind of entertainment, I’m sure that it met their needs,' Chmelar said. 'If I had a choice between Julie Andrews singing The Sound of Music and Miley Cyrus doing Can’t Stop, I’d go the Julie Andrews route,' he said.","Steve Chmelar first used a homemade finger to cheer on his high school basketball team in 1971 .

It was a singularly evil chemical weapons attack, but tragically the hundreds killed in Damascus last week were just the latest victims in a long history of the use of poison gas to kill soldiers and civilians. Indeed, an examination of such past atrocities reveals many exacted an even greater toll.IRAQ AGAINST THE KURDS . Saddam Hussein’s regime used chemical weapons to remove Kurds from around 40 villages in northern Iraq. On March 16, 1988, he carried out the most deadly attack, dropping poisons including mustard gas, sarin and VX on the town of Halabja. Men, women and children choked to death in the indiscriminate attack. The atrocity prompted the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, an international pact banning production, stockpiling or use of chemical weapons. Only seven nations – including Syria – are not signatories. DEATH TOLL: Up to 5,000. Chemical gas was used to attack Iraqi Kurds in 1998. 5,000 civilians were killed . IRAN-IRAQ WAR, 1980-88 . Hussein used sarin and mustard gas against Iran to tip the war in Iraq’s favour and force Tehran to negotiate. But newly declassified CIA documents revealed recently the US knew about the use of chemical weapons but refused to act because Washington feared an Iranian victory. DEATH TOLL: Up to 20,000. VIETNAM . Between 1965 and 1975, in the bitter war against communist North Vietnam, the US dropped millions of tons of incendiary napalm to defoliate dense forests in which enemy fighters were hiding. The jelly-like substance ignited and stuck to skin, burning through muscle and bone, causing hideous injury and often death. America also dropped 50 million tons of Agent Orange, a super-strength chemical herbicide, to destroy all plants. But poisonous dioxins seeped into the soil and water supply, entering into the food chain and leading to severe health problems and disabilities for generations. DEATH TOLL: More than a million, as well as 400,000 Vietnamese children born with birth defects due to exposure to Agent Orange. Hundreds were killed in a horrific nerve gas attack in Damascus last week . NAZI GERMANY . Hitler refrained from using chemical weapons in battle but millions of Jews were transported to extermination camps, notably Auschwitz in Poland, and were suffocated in gas chambers using cyanide-based Zyklon B. DEATH TOLL: Approximately six million Jews died in the Holocaust, plus gypsies, homosexuals, the disabled, and Soviet prisoners. WORLD WAR TWO . Between 1937 and 1945, Japan launched both chemical and biological attacks while invading China. Emperor Hirohito authorised use of toxic gas on more than 2,000 occasions. In 1941, members of a secretive Japanese research and development facility – Unit 731 – airdropped fleas contaminated with bubonic plague on the Chinese city of Changde. DEATH TOLL: Tens of thousands. ITALO-ABYSSINIAN WAR . Ignoring the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning chemical or biological agents in war, Mussolini’s Italy unleashed mustard gas during its invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Retaliating for the killing of one of its pilots, the air force dropped up to 500 tonnes of poison. DEATH TOLL: Estimated 15,000. British soldiers in the First World War wore helmets as protection against gas attacks . FIRST WORLD WAR . Known as the ‘chemists’ war’ for introducing deadly poison to combat. In 1915, at Ypres, Belgium, Germany opened thousands of canisters of chlorine upwind of Allied troops, condemning many to an agonising death. By 1918 chemical weapons had proliferated on both sides – including phosgene, cyanide and mustard gas. Horrified by the effects, 15 countries signed the Geneva Protocol.

Jennifer Rosoff went outside for a cigarette with her date, who she met online, about 12.50am when the railing of the narrow balcony collapsed after she propped her leg on it to stretch, according to DNAinfo. When the volunteer charity worker's date told her that it wasn't safe to lean on the railing, she insisted she 'did it all the time' before tumbling from the Stonehedge 57 apartment ledge, landing on construction scaffolding on the first floor. A witness said the man was 'hysterical' as he ran outside screaming 'Oh my god!' Emergency crews pronounced Rosoff dead at the scene. A photo of the corner balcony of the apartment where Rosoff lived shows the top two railings bent down in a V-shape.

New York Post claims its sources revealed the date told police he heard two sharp pops before the railing collapsed. Police have cleared the man, who had met Rosoff in person for the first time that night, of any possible wrongdoing. DNAinfo reported the man's parents answered his apartment door and said he . was home, but declined to comment. Neighbors at the 400 East 57th Street building, near First Avenue in Manhattan's Midtown East, compared the sound of Rosoff's fall to a 'gunshot' and a 'punch'.

Modern break-ups are, it would appear, a lot more complicated than those of past generations. It used to be that ending a relationship was between two people, and two people alone; now there are the opinions of others to consider, as well as the post-break-up feelings of your ex when he reads about what you're doing online... and it's all down to wretched social media. A particular debt of 'gratitude' is owed, of course, to Facebook. As a result, having a 'social media cleanse' when a relationship crumbles into dust is increasingly common, with 42 per cent of people 'unfriending' their ex on Facebook or unfollowing them on Twitter before they've been broken up for a month, and 34 per cent deleting all online images of their former love, according to research. Facebook ex-iquette has made modern dating and breaking up a minefield of problems . Having a 'social media cleanse' when a relationship crumbles into dust is increasingly common, with 42 per cent of people 'unfriending' their ex on Facebook or unfollowing them on Twitter before they've been broken up for a month . Furthermore, almost a third (31 per cent) would extend the cull and remove all contact with their ex-partner's friends and family as well. Dramatically, one in three (34 per cent) of 18 to 34-year-olds consider it acceptable for break-up cleanses to also . involve deleting all photographs which feature their ex-partner; . effectively removing the relationship's digital footprint and rewriting . their personal social media history. The survey of over 2,000 British people makes up part of Diffusion's UK Social-ology Study 2013 into on how our personal lives are played out in our social media activity.

Two in three (65 per cent) deem it acceptable to flaunt their new unattached status by changing their Facebook profile to 'single' within the first month of a break-up, while one in five (18 per cent) would happily change their Facebook status to 'in a relationship' with someone new within the first month.

Modern break-ups are, it would appear, a lot more complicated than those of past generations . Psychologist and behavioural expert, Professor Craig Jackson, of Birmingham City University determined that: 'These findings confirm what many psychologists have suspected about those who have grown up surrounded by social media - that they fall in ""digital love"" quickly (that is, to provide on-line confirmation and validation of a new relationship) but are just as capable of falling out of it quickly too, and with some clinical precision. 'When new romances form, the digital confirmation (e.g. Facebook status) is often viewed as THE confirmation of the new relationship that makes it both real and public. 'It makes sense then that this method is also used as a decisive means of confirming to the world the end of a romance.'","Having a 'social media cleanse' is increasingly common after a break-up .

Two Crown Prosecution Service staff who swindled more than £1million from the taxpayer to fund a high-rolling lifestyle were each jailed for six years yesterday. Finance manager Lisa Burrows, 42, and her boyfriend, Tahir Mahmood, 50, worked ‘as a team’ to rake in up to £4,000 a week in a ‘colossal’ fraud stretching over five years. They set up a fake taxi firm to lodge hundreds of claims for non-existent journeys, which they claimed were to transport witnesses to and from court. Team: Lisa Burrows, an area manager with the . Crown Prosecution Service, left, operated a £1million fraud over five . years with her tax-driver boyfriend Tahir Mahmoo, right. They have both . been jailed for six years . The pair spent thousands of pounds on designer clothes, jewellery and holidays in New York, Spain and Dubai, cleared credit card debts and a mortgage, and put down a £20,000 cash deposit on a bungalow. They were so arrogant they named the fake taxi firm B&M Taxis, which stood for their surnames.Yesterday the lovers showed no emotion as they were jailed for what a judge described as a ‘gross abuse of trust’. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Burrows – who had worked at the CPS for more than 20 years – met Mahmood in an internet chat room in early 2008. He was a taxi driver and she began giving him legitimate driving work with the CPS at the Birmingham office where she worked. Prosecutor Brian Dean said Burrows was aware of the vast sums of money the service spent on taxis. Mahmood quickly suggested the fraud and within months of meeting the pair had set up the fictitious company. The court heard he had changed his name by deed poll to Joseph O’Neil to set up the account for the bogus taxi firm. Finance manager Lisa Burrows and her colleague both worked at CPS West Midlands . Lisa Burrows and Tahir Mahmood were both jailed for six years at Birmingham Crown Court today . Burrows signed off the invoices while Mahmood ‘held the purse strings’ managing the account and withdrawing the money. Last year, Burrows found her lover work as a trainee administrator at the same CPS office, but the pair kept their relationship a secret from colleagues. The scam was missed by four annual audits and was only uncovered in February when a colleague became suspicious of the amount Burrows was paying to B&M Taxis. By the time the pair were arrested later that month, they had stolen £1,021,475. Police found 11 B&M Taxis invoices in Burrows’ handbag which were ready to be submitted. Mahmood, who has children from a previous relationship, was discovered to have withdrawn more than £985,000 from the dummy account. Spoils: Burrows and Mahmood also visited New York with their stolen money . Financial investigators discovered that Burrows, who earned £24,000  a year as a regional finance manager, spent almost £250,000 on her Marks & Spencer credit card during the fraud. They found a receipt for an £8,000 luxury hotel stay in New York and a bill for a £10,000 trip to the five-star Dubai Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Burrows bought dozens of designer handbags and jewellery from high-end shops including  Tiffany and Prada and the department store Bloomingdale’s, while Mahmood was found to have put down the cash deposit on the bungalow in Erdington, Birmingham. Mr Dean said: ‘The money was spent on high living, foreign holidays, designer handbags, jewellery, expensive meals and deposits on properties. Burrows identified that the CPS spent considerable sums on taxis. They decided to exploit that by making claims for non-existent journeys. ‘Mahmood played a full and significant role in the conspiracy in the initial planning of the fraud and by ensuring that they could get their hands on the money in cash form by setting up bank accounts in false names. They were caught red-handed and had little option but to plead guilty.’ He said investigators are still working to discover how more than £660,000 of the stolen public money was spent. Burrows, of Oldbury, West Midlands, and Mahmood, of Hodge Hill, Birmingham, admitted a single count of conspiracy to commit fraud by abuse of position between January 1, 2008 and February 28, 2013. Judge William Davis QC said they had carried out a ‘huge fraud on the public purse causing substantial losses to a department already under serious financial pressure.’ He added: ‘The fraud was motivated purely by greed. ‘The fact the fraud involved the Crown Prosecution Service and was committed by a senior member of that service – the body responsible for bringing criminals to justice – will have affected and eroded public confidence in that service.’ Luxury: The couple took holidays to laces such as Dubai with the proceeds of their fraud .","Lisa Burrows, a CPS area manager, and her cabbie boyfriend Tahir Mahmood 'operated as a team' throughout five year scam .

Browning had hailed his taxi at 3am in Stratford and had asked to be taken to an address behind the Tate Modern.

After a few washout summers, this year saw a settled June followed by a July heatwave and a sunny August. So it comes as no surprise that the summer of 2013 has been our warmest, driest and sunniest for seven years, according to the Met Office. And as the season draws to a close today, the good news is that the balmy weather looks set to continue into autumn. Glorious: Four young women enjoy a Thames boat . ride on what has been the warmest, driest and . sunniest summer for seven years, with the heat set to continue into the . autumn, according to forecasters . Hot stuff: While the 19-day July heatwave stood . out as the most striking weather event of the season, a Met Office . report said it was 'more notable for its duration than the actual . temperatures recorded' Although temperatures will cool down over the weekend, the mercury could rise to as high as 28C (82.4F) in the South East and East Anglia next week. The Met Office has revealed that between June 1 and August 28, the average temperature in the UK was 15.2C (59F) – just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006. A total of 189mm of rainfall was measured, 78 per cent of the UK average and half last summer’s total of 379mm. In 2006, 188.3mm of rain was recorded, along with 601.5 hours of clear sunshine that was not blocked by any cloud. That compares to 588 hours this summer, making it the seventh sunniest summertime since 1929. Trying to keep cool: The Met Office has revealed . that between June 1 and August 28, the average temperature in the UK . was 15.2C (59F) - just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006 . But in a statement released yesterday, the Met Office said: ‘While this summer is warmer, drier and sunnier than the long-term average, it hasn’t been exceptional. ‘It stands out because the last six summers have been wetter than average, with 2012 and 2007 both being in the top five wettest, and 2008 and 2009 also in the top ten wettest in records from 1910.’ And while the 19-day July heatwave stood out as the most striking weather event of the season, the report said it was ‘more notable for its duration than the actual temperatures recorded’. The summer’s highest temperature was not during the heatwave but on August 1, when the mercury reached 34.1C (93F) at Heathrow – the highest in the UK since July 2006. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: ‘We’ve had the kind of summer we should have had, rather than the wet and cooler summers we have suffered in recent years. ‘There will be plenty of fine, dry weather for the south and South East next week - certainly warmer than normal for this time of the year. It could reach around 25C (77F)early in the week and perhaps a little warmer later next week. 'But it will only be a brief sunny interlude, with conditions becoming more unsettled and temperatures back to normal by the end of the week.’ The unseasonal temperatures will be caused by an area of high pressure dominating England and Wales which will draw in warmer air from the continent. MeteoGroup forecaster Alexi Boothman predicted temperatures of 27C (80.6F) in the South East on Wednesday, with the possibility it could go higher the following day. She added: ‘The average temperature for the start of autumn in the South is 20C-21C (68F-69.8F) so it will be a good few degrees higher than average. But in the north temperatures could be up to ten degrees lower, much closer to the seasonal average in that part of the country.’ The Met Office said this summer was likely to finish around eighth to tenth warmest since 1910.","Mercury could rise as high as 28C in South East and East Anglia next week .

A huge section of cliff crashed into the sea at a popular resort, covering holidaymakers and residents in a cloud of red dust. The rose-coloured rocks fell 200ft after the massive landslide, half-a-mile from the town of Sidmouth in Devon. The area on the Devon coast is prone to landslides, with some residents worrying their homes will soon be next. Holidaymakers and residents were shocked to see the rock falling from the cliff and into the sea . Locals first knew of Wednesday's landslide when they heard a massive rumbling sound coming from the cliff face. They looked up to see a huge chunk of rock plunging into the sea while throwing up a towering dust cloud. The slip occurred near properties at the notoriously unstable Pennington Point, where homes edge ever closer to the sea with each collapse. Richard Thurlow, chairman of campaign group Save Our Sidmouth, said: 'It was a fairly major one, quite immense. The red dust which was sprayed from the cliff covered local properties and eroded residents' gardens . 'Outside my home, which is half a mile away, a fine red dust was deposited on all the flat surfaces. 'The people who are seeing their gardens eroded are very worried.' Rockfalls along the Devon and Dorset Jurassic Coast are common, though rarely as dramatic. At Pennington Point, 12 properties are at risk of falling over an eroding cliff edge, which is said to be losing land at up to 13ft a year.

He raised another cause for concern by suggesting the light could distract or impair motorists as it casts blinding rays into their eye-line as the day goes on.

His wife Penny - famously referred to as 'er indoors' during the ITV drama - has also taken the news badly and has been prescribed valium to help her cope with the stress.

'George has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems. 'He has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet, otherwise he wouldn’t have been here for 70 years. 'At our age we do not socialise except with our children and grandchildren. We never go away, we’re always here.' Mrs Cole claimed her actor husband, now 88, was nothing like the over-the-top characters he once played on television and film, which included roles in St Trinians.

Mr Morris explained he was having diseased trees cut down, which were too big for the local sawmill to process, and would have to be cut up on site and stored until they could be removed. He denied he was setting up the mill as a commercial venture insisting he would only be processing wood from his estate. He argued his proposal would . result in less disruption than if lorries had to . transport the trees from his land.

Jailed: German trucker Anton Maizen caused a fatal crash on the M25 after driving for 15 hours without a break . A German lorry driver who been on the road for 15 hours without a break when he caused a fatal crash has been jailed for four-and-a-half years. Anton Maizen, 58, ploughed his 40-ton lorry into a queue of traffic on the M25 near Aveley in Essex, killing a 79-year-old man and injuring two others. Maizen, of Wixhausen, south of Frankfurt, admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Basildon Crown Court today. The crash, on Tuesday, April 2, came after Maizen had been at work for nearly 23 hours - driving for 15 of those hours without a break. Maizen's 840-mile journey had begun the . previous day in Germany, with the driver entering the UK via Folkestone. He then drove to south London, before continuing on his way to . Lincolnshire. During this time he did not take breaks of longer than an hour - and did not have any sustained period of sleep, the court heard. Maizen was returning to the Channel Tunnel when the crash took . place. During his police interviews, he was unable to explain why he struck the rear of the queue at his maximum speed of 56mph. He hit a BMW, which contained a . mother and her young son, propelling the vehicle into another lane and . into the path of a second lorry - though both escaped serious injury. Maizen's . tachograph charts were found hidden behind the driver's seat and a data . chart in his sock was later found disclosing his route and timings. Wreckage: A man died as a result of the pile up on the M25 in Essex . Dangerous: The crash came after Maizen had been at work for nearly 23 hours - with 15 of them spent on the road . The German motorist was disqualified . from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended driving test . in order to regain his licence. Tailbacks: The German was also disqualified from driving for five years following the collision . Judge Owen Davies QC said: 'It would . appear that you failed to slow your vehicle and were still driving at . 50mph when you applied the brakes. 'Expert evidence shows it must have been fatigue that caused this incident. 'You had been driving for 22 hours and 44 minutes without the lengthy period of rest required. 'Your actions in those brief moments have caused untold misery on others.' James .

Police were called to the property in Chadwell Heath, East London, by London Ambulance Service who were attending an 'incident' at the home yesterday morning. Officers found the body of the girl . at the scene and arrested a woman - understood to be the child's mother - . on suspicion of murder. Investigation: A policeman stands outside the flat in Bedwell House, East London where an eight-year-old girl died yesterday . Custody: A 34-year-old woman has been arrested after the death of the child . She was treated for minor injuries in hospital and remains in custody at an east London police station. Witnesses described a second woman leaving the flat with police in floods of tears. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out by Great Ormond Street Hospital to establish the cause of death. Neighbours say there were two women living at the flat with the girl and a young boy aged around six-years-old. Tributes have been left at the flat, . which is being guarded by a uniformed police officer, including a bunch . of carnations and roses by a local resident. A card reads: 'In memory of a little girl whom I would never have met. From a neighbour, rest in peace. Amen.' Resident Atik Molla, 39, said: 'There . were two women living at the flat and the girl and a boy around six . years old, who I think was the girl’s brother. 'We saw them quite a lot and they were always looking happy. 'We are very shocked by this, they seemed like a normal family. I think the mother was originally from India or Pakistan.'

'She was crying, just weeping. She . wasn’t saying anything. Then they just drove away. When I came in I saw . police were in her flat and I found out the girl was dead. 'It’s so shocking, just awful.' Another resident, who declined to be named, said: 'It makes you shudder when you walk through the door and see the police. 'My heart goes out to that girl.

A five-year-old girl has died from a rare blood disorder just seven weeks after her parents thought she was simply suffering from a cold. Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday. But within just weeks of contracting what turned out to be a rare blood disorder, she had lost her life. She had been suffering from a little-known condition called Hemophagocytic . Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday. Just weeks later, she had died from a rare blood disorder called Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Her devastated parents Kerry, 46 and . Ivan, 36, have spoken about their heartbreak in the . hope of raising awareness of the disorder, which leads to too many white . blood cells attacking the body. Mrs Mornington, from Fradley, Staffordshire, said: 'She’d always been a fighter and had a strong and determined personality. 'She was a real tomboy, too, and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas. 'She refused to wear dresses from the age of three and she loved unusual music - we played Depeche Mode’s Just Can’t Get Enough at her funeral as it was one of her favourite songs.' Violet's parents, who both work as benefits officers, first became worried about the youngster on the day she turned five. Her father recalled: 'It was a Monday . and Violet went to school as normal but when she came home, she said . she didn’t feel too well. 'We went for a quiet meal but throughout she looked pale. We thought she was exhausted from celebrating her birthday at school. Devastated: Violet's parents Kerry and Ivan said they assumed she was simply suffering from a cold. She was later diagnosed with tonsillitis but her symptoms continued to deteriorate . 'But over the next couple of days you could tell she wasn’t herself. She was still pale, tired and had a temperature. We put it down to a cold. 'We had a party planned for her on the Saturday. It was the first time we’d decided to throw a big do and had booked the local village hall, with a DJ and bouncy castle. 'We were debating whether to cancel it, but by the Friday, she had picked up so decided to go ahead. 'For the first half of it she was really energetic and jumping on the bouncy castle. But then she got all shivery and we gave her some Calpol. She did pick up a little bit later on.' On Monday, Violet's father took her to see the nurse at their GP practice as she was too unwell for school. He . was told she had tonsillitis and Violet was given antibiotics. But . instead of improving, she got worse and later that week she saw the . doctor. Again, her parents were told it would probably clear up. After repeated GP visits, Violet's desperate parents took her to A&E, where doctors suspected she had leukaemia. She was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital . The family went back and forth to see their GP over the next three weeks, but still there was no diagnosis. In desperation, the couple took her to A&E. More tests and scans were carried out and the next day the couple were told the youngster had suspected leukaemia. She was transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where a bone marrow biopsy was done.'Violet . was becoming more and more distressed because of all the tests being . done,' said Mrs Mornington. 'She was very upset and it was heartbreaking . to see her like that. 'She . would suffer from raging temperatures which was one of the symptoms of . HLH, but of course we didn’t know at that point it was the disorder.' Eventually . doctors ruled out leukaemia, and finally, tests found that she had the . Epstein-Barr Virus, which had led to Hodgkins Lymphoma. Mr Mornington, who has a daughter Beth, 19, from another relationship, said that Violet was given steroids - but her condition deteriorated. Tragic: Violet as a baby with mother Kerry (left) and right, shortly before she died. Her mother said: 'She was a real tomboy - and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas' Hemophagocytic . Lymphohistiocytosis was finally diagnosed but, although Violet started showing some signs of improvement after going through three lots of chemotherapy, it was short-lived as she started suffering from serious respiratory problems. Doctors were then forced to put her into an induced coma. 'It was like a whirlwind,' added Mrs Mornington, who has twins Molly and Caitlin, aged 16, and Matt, 26, from her first marriage. On July 20, the couple were told to get some rest and were staying in the hospital’s nearby facility for relatives.But they were woken at 5.55am the next day by a call telling them Violet had deteriorated. Mrs Mornington added: 'We rushed to . the hospital and saw Violet hooked up to so many machines. Doctors told . us that she was very poorly and didn’t think she would get through it. 'Later . that day, we were told she wouldn’t pull through and that they could . take away all the machines so that we could spend some time with her to . say goodbye. Violet, here with father Ivan, . was finally diagnosed with HLH, and underwent three rounds of chemotherapy. But she began to suffer from serious respiratory problems and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma . 'At this point . she wasn’t suffering, but it was heartbreaking to watch her go through . this. We decided to spend time with her, and we had 30 precious minutes . giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped . away.' Since Violet’s death the couple, along with their other children, have been trying to raise more awareness about the condition. Her father explained: 'We want people . out there to know about HLH and what it can do and how quickly it can . strike. GPs don’t seem to be aware, and if it is something they are . taught about then it can only help other sufferers. 'I’ve . read up on the condition and if it’s treated within four weeks of being . detected, then you can save the person’s life. When we first took . Violet to the doctors, she probably had it then. But because they didn’t . know about the disorder it went undetected.' Violet's mother said: 'Before she died, we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away.' The family are now trying to raise more awareness about Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Mrs Mornington added: 'There isn’t a minute that goes by where we don’t think about her. Her legacy for us is to help others and stop this happening again. We want to do this to keep her memory alive. It was too late for us but hopefully it won’t be for other families.' Family and friends are raising cash for Birmingham Children’s Hospital - where Violet Mornington was treated - by taking on Mount Snowdon. They hope to raise £5,000 for Birmingham Children’s Hospital, by carrying out the trek, and they will also be joined by Violet’s family. As well as climbing Snowdon, other events are being held.

Left waiting: Half of all services operated by Virgin Trains on the West Coast Mainline were late . One in three trains in Britain is late and on some routes more than half fail to arrive on time, 'real' official figures revealed today. Rail companies do not consider their services as delayed as long as they arrived no more than 10 minutes behind schedule. But Network Rail has produced new 'right-time' statistics, which look at delays of more than 59 seconds. The results have today been called 'shocking' and a 'national scandal'. It found 47.4 per cent of services operated by Virgin Trains on the West Coast Mainline were on time in the past year. The figures for this 12-month period also . showed that only 45.2 per of trains on the serpentine CrossCountry . service, from Aberdeen to Penzance, were on time. The best was Chiltern, with an 87.5 per cent punctuality record. Overall 67.6 per cent of all trains nationally were on time. This means that services have deteriorated as in 2011 the rate was 69.8 per cent. ‘Passengers tell us that punctual trains are what they want most from the railway – so they will be disappointed with the decline in overall performance,' Mike Hewitson, from the rail watchdog Passenger Focus, said. ‘Passenger satisfaction with punctuality has also gone down in our latest passenger survey. It is essential that this is reversed so that passengers can get back to depending on the railway.’ London and south east England train operators' punctuality reached 68.5 per cent but the figure for long-distance services was only 53.2 per cent. Network Rail publishes the right-time performance alongside the the public performance measure (PPM) figures under which the company's punctuality record is assessed by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). Under PPM, a short-distance train is only deemed to be late if it arrives five minutes or more after the scheduled time, while a long-distance train has to arrive 10 minutes or more behind schedule to be considered late. Under PPM, 90.8% of trains were on time nationally for the 12 months ending August 18 2013. Virgin Trains had the poorest punctuality figure - 83.1 per cent . NR says that as far as the right-time figures are concerned 'the process for gathering data of this accuracy is currently not 100 per cent reliable and the industry is working on improving the quality of this information to make right-time data more reliable'. Nationally, around 60 per cent of delays to train services are attributed to NR, which has been repeatedly warned by the ORR about its punctuality performance. 'Shocking': Real time figures show that more than half of all trains run late on some rail routes . Virgin Trains has been at loggerheads with NR over West Coast delays, with Virgin upset that its request to run more services on the line has been turned down. Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'These shocking figures show that under privatisation the British people are paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on some of the most unreliable services. 'It is a national scandal that profits and bonuses are being bled out of the rail system while services and capacity are collapsing into chaos.'","Network Rail has counted all trains that were more than 59 secs late .

A prostitution ring in New Jersey that ran a high-volume business with illegal immigrants from Mexico and Latin America was busted Thursday. The ring, headed by 38-year-old Jose Cruz 'Chato' Romero-Flores, brought women to the U.S. with the promise of jobs as house cleaners or babysitters. Once in the country, the women endured a 'miserable life of high-volume prostitution' according to New Jersey's acting Attorney General John Hoffman. Miserable lives: The Lakewood, New Jersey home where Romero-Flores was operating his high-volume prostitution business . Power couple: Jose Cruz 'Chato' Romero-Flores, left, was the ringleader of the business, and his girlfriend Odulia Bedran Trejo, right, helped him find the women in Mexico and transport them to and from the brothel in New Jersey . Romero-Flores set quotas for the women, which had them servicing about 100 men or 'johns' in a regular six-day work week. Some women would serve as many as 40 clients a day, at the going rate of $30 dollars a session. 'This case bears the classic hallmarks of international sex-related trafficking in that we have young women brought illegally into the United States,' said Hoffman in a press conference. 'They are fearful and they are vulnerable because of their illegal status, their inability to earn a living legitimately and their lack of a network of supportive family and friends.' Investigators believe that several dozen women were prostituted by the ring, but are still looking for all of them. 'We rescued a number of victims during the take down but we are seeking additional victims in what is an ongoing investigation,' Hoffman said. 'These victims are difficult to find.' Victims: Acting Attorney General John Hoffman is still looking for more women abused by the ring, but said finding the victims has been difficult . Authorities in New Jersey had been looking for the ring for over a year when they finally tracked them down to a house in Lakewood. Romero-Flores had been operating multiple brothels, but only one was up and running when police cracked the case. Romero-Flores was arrested at his Lakewood apartment on July 11 on charges of first-degree human trafficking, second-degree promoting organized street crime and third-degree promoting prostitution. The human trafficking charge carries a sentence of 20 years to life in state prison. The same day, police arrested five others involved in the ring, including 22-year-old Odulia Bedran Trejo, Romero-Flores' girlfriend. Felix Rios-Martinez, 47, Raul Romero-Castillo, 30, Haliro Bueno, 21, and Santos Lazaero Flores-Cruz, 58, were also arrested for their part in the ring. Accomplices: Felix Rios-Martinez, left, and Raul Romero-Castillo, right were also arrested July 11 for their part in the prostitution business . Illegal: In addition to their prostitution charges, the six arrested - including Haliro Bueno, left, and Santos Lazaero Flores-Cruz, right - will have to deal with immigration as all are Mexican nationals living illegally in the U.S. Those arrested in the ring are all Mexican nationals living illegally in the United States. The six members are being held in Ocean County Jail with bail set at $1million for Romero-Flores and $100,000 for the rest of the defendants. As for the victims, officials have urged the women to come forward regardless of their immigration status. They said they will work with the women to try and get immunity and citizenship, but so far Hoffman hasn't made any promises . 'This is not a charging document that includes them but the appropriate legal steps will be taken,' he said.","Authorities had been looking for the ring lead by Jose Cruz 'Chato' Romero-Flores for over a year .

Many western preconceptions of Middle Eastern culture envisage veiled women lacking the same employment and legal rights as their male peers. But a new exhibition of poignant photographs on display at a U.S gallery aims to challenge the traditional view that women from that part of the world are 'repressed and powerless'. Different: Moroccan-born Lalla Assia Essaydi's work attempts to subvert traditional feminine concepts such as the harem and the veil . Striking: This picture by Rania Matar aims to subvert traditional Western preconceptions about what femininity means to Middle Eastern women . Poignant: Another picture taken by Lebanese born Rania Matar in 2010 shows a young girl looking out of her window in Beirut . War-torn: This unusual image, taken by Rula Halawani in 2002, features a woman stood in a house destroyed by war . Instead, the She Who Tells A Story exhibit at the Boston Museum of Fine Art, which opened on Tuesday, aims to show what life in the Middle East is like from behind the veil. The powerful selection of pictures explores themes such as gender identity, war and peace, society and politics and features the work of a dozen prominent female photographers from Iran and the Middle East. Images range from photojournalism to staged and manipulated visions of various aspects of everyday life. The exhibition is the first to display the work of female photographers from the Middle East and Iran in the U.S. Subversive: One of Iranian artist Gohar Dashti's stunning pictures that will be on show at the Boston museum until January next year . Stunning: Newsha Tavakolian, from Iran, took this work entitled Dont Forget This Is Not You (for Sahar Lotfi) in 2010 . Powerful: Some of the pictures reflect war and peace through the eyes of the artist - this picture by Iranian born Gohar Dashti shows a woman hooking towels on barbed wire . Hidden message: Artist Shirin Neshat often covers her models with a form of text that is a mix of calligraphy and henna tattoos . Exhibition curator Kristen Gresh began exploring the photography of Middle Eastern women while living in Egypt in 2008. She said: 'This exhibition is an opportunity to discover very poignant and powerful art work coming from the Middle East today which touches on issues of social and political issues but directly from the point of view of the artist and not from the point of view of the media.' Iranian artist Shirin Neshat's work challenges differing perceptions of religious customs by the western world and the Middle East. Challenging: The Mother, Daughter, Doll series by Yemeni photographer Boushra Almutawake is part of the She Who tells a Story exhibition at the Boston Museum of Fine Art . Colourful: The Break by Nermine Hammam shows two militia eating against a beautiful backdrop . Cultures collide: Women of Gaza 2 by Tanya Habjouqa shows three women adjusting their veils in a downtrodden sports hall . War and peace: Dreamland I by Nermine Hammam juxtaposes a soldier armed with an automatic weapon with a picturesque scene of a sailing boat .

Hundreds of safari animals have been transported across Zimbabwe to a poaching-prone nature reserve ahead of a UN meeting to make the area appear populated. The decision to move the animals from a private conservancy in southeastern Zimbabwe to Victoria falls is to ‘repopulate’ the preserve before the United Nations world tourism body’s meeting for the benefit of visiting delegates. Giraffes, zebra, several types of antelopes and hundreds of wildebeest have been transported for over 400 miles, the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force of independent environmentalists said. Controversial: President Robert Mugabe has moved hundreds of safari animals across Zimbabwe to impress UN delegates . The animals have been released in the five sq mile Zambezi National Park overlooking the Zambezi River and the Victoria Falls. The decision to hold the six-day summit at Victoria Falls, on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, was met with raised eyebrows, as President Mugabe’s recent election victory was marred with accusations of vote rigging. Durign the opening of the summit, The UN World Tourism Organization’s Secretary-general Taleb Rifai, praised the Zimbabwe elections as ‘civilised and smooth’. UNWTO Organization also announced on Sunday that it has chosen Zimbabwe to lead its Commission for Africa, the continent-wide group for tourism development for the next two years. The animals were moved 400 miles to Victoria Falls, pictured, to repopulate the area ahead of the UN world tourism board meeting . Herds: Giraffes, zebra, impala and hundreds of wildebeest as well as Africa's largest antelope - the eland have been transferred . According to the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, 151 wildebeests, 100 impalas, 60 zebras, 25 eland and ten giraffes from the Save Valley Conservancy in Masvingo province have been transported to Victoria falls ahead of the summit. ‘Zimbabwe always claims to have an abundance of animals, so why is it necessary to move these animals to where the delegates of U.N. World Tourism Organization will be able to see them?,’ said Johnny Rodrigues, head of the trust. The U.N. World Tourism Organization, meanwhile, advised participants at Victoria Falls that no conference documentation will be distributed on paper to save trees ‘in compliance with the United Nations system's environmental protection policy.’ The six-day general assembly was formally opened by the two countries' presidents, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Michael Sata of Zambia. Mugabe told the opening dinner celebrations and tribal dancing that the meeting endorsed Zimbabwe as 'a safe and secure destination for world tourists.. The two host nations automatically take over the presidency of the U.N. tourism organization during the summit, which is expected to be attended by about 1,200 delegates from governments and tourism enterprises worldwide.","Safari animals transported over 400 miles from south Zimbabwe .

But Cliff, a two-year-old Beagle, shows enthusiasm for a far more unusual reason. The perceptive pooch has been trained to sniff out the hospital superbug Clostridium difficile in patients, with great success. By simply sniffing around a hospital bed, he can detect whether patients are carrying the deadly infection. Cliff's detection abilities were first put to the test on stool samples, which have a distinct odour when someone has the bug. Scroll down for video . Cliff the Beagle, in a special luminous vest, has sniffed out C.Difficile with super accuracy . Given that some experienced nurses can detect it, the researchers reasoned it could be even easier for dogs, due to their heightened sense of smell. After two months of training at VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam, Cliff was able to correctly identify all 50 samples from infected patients and 47 out of 50 negative samples. And his impressive work didn't stop there. On one hospital visit he was able to sniff out 25 out of 30 infected patients simply by smelling the air around their beds, while correctly deducing that 265 out of 270 patients did not carry the infection. When he detects a patient with the superbug, he sits by the patient's bed to alert doctor. Those who are passed by are deemed by Cliff not to be infected. But the hardest part, say the researchers, is getting him to sit still. Dr Marije Bomers, who helped train Cliff, said: 'We go into all the rooms, and it is . intended that Cliff quietly sits by the bed of patients who are . infected. 'But this is the most difficult thing for him to do as he gets very excited when he smells Clostridium.' Now, on the back of this success, the Dutch researchers suggest that more . animals could be trained to screen hospital wards in an effort to . prevent C diff outbreaks. In a study, published in the online journal BMJ.com, the Dutch team wrote: 'It is feasible to use a dog to detect Clostridium difficile in stool samples and in patients. He's got the bug: Cliff enjoys the challenge of sniffing out C.Diff . 'The dog's diagnostic accuracy with . stool samples suggests that immediate identification of C difficile is . possible. Moreover, our data suggest that the same may be true for the . rapid diagnosis of C difficile infection on clinical wards. 'For the purposes of detection, the dog did not need a stool sample or physical contact with patients. 'It would seem dogs can detect C . difficile in the air surrounding patients. In addition, dogs are quick . and efficient: patients in a hospital ward can be screened for the . presence of C difficile infection in less than 10 minutes.' The researchers did admit that the study . has limitations and said that using a dog as a diagnostic tool is not . 'fully predictable'. But there's no doubting Cliff's enthusiasm for the task, which is shared by his father Ralph. Primarily a police sniffer dog, he also enjoys sniffing out the superbug . 'It was not the intention to train . him in this, because he is a 'crime scene' sniffer dog, but . he trains at home spontaneously along with Cliff,' said Dr Bomers. C diff is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial cause of infectious hospital-acquired diarrhoea in developed countries. It can cause diarrhoea ranging from mild symptoms to a very severe illness and can be fatal. Certain groups of people are . particularly at risk of developing C diff. These include the elderly, . those who have recently had surgery, and people with serious underlying . diseases. The bacterium can be transmitted through either personal contact or the environment.","By sniffing around hospital beds, two-year-old Beagle can identify deadly infection C.difficile .

With £20,000 couture gowns, some intriguing headgear and a stellar front row, Paris Couture Fashion Week closed on a high yesterday with incredible showings from Zahair Murad, Valentino, Jean Paul Gaultier and Vionnet. The fall-winter shows have seen spectators transported from apocalyptic opera houses to the circus and flung across the four corners of the globe and the final day was no different. Chinese singer Li Yugang performed ahead of a stunning show from her compatriot, Lawrence Xu, while Lebanon's Zahair Murad proved that she understands glamour as well as fellow Lebanese couturier, Elie Saab, with an accomplished collection. Most of the couture collections have been awash with flamboyant glamour and sequins galore, so Rad Hourani's collection proved to be the perfect palate cleanser. The Jordanian designer showed an entirely monochrome collection with minimal Scandinavian silhouettes at odds with the Middle East's usual colourful style. Earlier in the day, Jean Paul Gaultier's feline-infused couture collection took Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini and 'The Pink Panther' as its inspiration. The references merged with theatrical panache to produce once of his best shows in seasons.

The quintessentially British pastime of selling homemade jams and cakes at the village fete to raise money for a good cause is as old as the hills. But when European guidelines on food hygiene were introduced it sparked panic among the self-appointed health and safety police. They issued strict new guidance which saw the pots of homemade gooseberry jam and chocolate cakes disappearing from community fundraisers. Victory for common sense: The ruling comes days . after Georgie Hippolite, 12, was told she couldn't sell homemade . cupcakes to her schoolmates because her mother, Kirsty, did not have a . food hygiene certificate . But now the food watchdog in the UK has handed every keen cake baker and jam maker a reprieve which should see village fêtes offering home produce once again. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ruled that volunteer cooks and charity groups who occasionally prepare food for community events are not covered by EU laws. So that means they no longer need to possess a food hygiene certificate before they are allowed to offer their wares for sale. In black and white, the ruling states: ‘There is no rule banning the sale of homemade cakes at school fêtes or other community events.’ The new FSA guidance comes just days after schoolgirl Georgie Hippolite, 12, was banned from selling homemade cupcakes to her schoolmates at an end-of-term charity event. Pleased: Prue Leith, restaurateur and judge on BBC¿s Great British Menu, called it 'the best news that has come out of the FSA for years' She was told he could not offer from for sale because the baker - her mother, Kirsty Hippolite, 39 - did not have a food hygiene certificate. James Stewart, headteacher at her school, the Cowes Enterprise College, said a health and safety adviser had told them not to accept home produce as they could be liable if someone fell ill. But the food watchdog now says that most charity and community organisation provide food less than once a month and do not need to register their activities. Only groups that serve hot food regularly, deal with the under-fives or the elderly or are involved in large scale events need to be registered. Scout and Guide groups as well as bring-and-buy sales, Women’s Institute events and village fêtes are also cleared to sell their produce without registering. The move has been welcomed by professional chefs and amateur cooks alike who have called it a ‘a refreshing injection of common sense.’ Mrs Hippolite, a mother-of-five from Cowes on the Isle of Wight, said: ‘Hurray. Hurray. Thank goodness for that. I am very pleased about that.’ ‘Selling homemade cakes and jams to raise money for good causes is a traditional British pursuit and something that should be applauded to banned. ‘I was stunned when my daughter, Georgie, was told she could not sell the cupcakes I had baked. It was a Mary Berry recipe - for goodness sake!’ She said: ‘It is a refreshing injection of common sense and I welcome it wholeheartedly. It make children self-sufficient to bake and also instils a sense of social responsibility of they are baking for charity.’ Prue Leith, restaurateur and judge on BBC’s Great British Menu, said: ‘It’s the best news that has come out of the FSA for years.’","FSA rules food made for community events is not covered by EU safety rules .

"By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 04:27 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 5 June 2013 . The girl at the centre of the child cruelty trial told the High Court she went along with her mother’s shocking attempts to get her pregnant because she thought: ‘If I do this . . . maybe she will love me more.’ The girl had been adopted as a baby and raised in a ‘toxic cocoon’ of her mother’s making – an atmosphere of intimidation and disapproval behind the closed  curtains of their terrace house. Despite the bullying and coercion, the girl remained pathetically devoted to her adopted mother and obeyed her commands, driven by a powerful mix of fear and love. Authorities missed four significant opportunities which may have prevented a woman from forcing her adopted daughter to impregnate herself with sperm bought on the internet . In a moment of unbearable poignancy . the girl, known only as A, told how she had gone along with her mother’s . plans to win the woman’s affection. She told the High Court: ‘Mum said to me, “A, the only way I can have a fourth child is for you to get pregnant”. ‘I was shocked, pretty shocked at . first. And then I suddenly thought, “Maybe if I do this then everything . will be over. Mum will be happy like she was before”. ‘And I also thought from a selfish point of view, “If I do this . . . maybe she will love me more”.’ A was only 13 when her mother revealed her plans, and just 14 when the . humiliating and painful ordeal of the insemination  ‘programme’ began. In March 2009, aged 15 and having . already suffered a miscarriage, she sent a Mother’s Day card. The girl . wrote: ‘Happy Mother’s Day List (the things I cannot give you but would . if I could).’ She stuck photographs of her mother’s favourite singers and  television programmes on the card. Below them, next to a photograph of a . positive pregnancy test, she wrote: ‘And the one thing that I can. And . will.’ Remarkably, A told the court hearing she was grateful to her . mother for adopting her and her sisters, saying: ‘My mum has done as . much as she could to give us a good and happy life.’ But Mr Justice Jackson heard  the . mother had excluded her  ex-husband from her daughters’ life and had . schooled them at home, leaving them isolated from the world outside. She could be ‘critical, rigid, . suspicious and obsessive’, the judge said, adding: ‘For the children, . who love her deeply, the threat of her disapproval is always in the . air.’ Eldest daughter A in particular had . coped with her domineering mother by becoming submissive to her, even . dropping her voice so she could barely be heard. Neighbours said she was so quiet and . timid that they had wondered if she had a ‘vocal disability’. Remarkably, it was only by becoming a mother herself that A found the . strength to stand up to the maternal bullying she had suffered. Midwives noticed that she refused to . hand her baby son to her mother, and she rejected the woman’s demands . that she call him Kalei, instead choosing a traditional English name. Astonished: Family judge Mr Justice Jackson expressed his 'abiding sense of disbelief' in a High Court judgement . Fears for her son’s wellbeing finally . drove her to confide in a family friend, an act of courage and defiance . she had been unable to make on her own behalf. A, now 19 and living in a foster home . with her toddler son, told the court: ‘I was scared to go home, because I . knew I wouldn’t be able to raise him as my child and I was scared at . how my mum might raise him.’ Her mother, an educated and highly . articulate woman, also gave the teenager recordings to listen to which . contained subliminal messages, saying: ‘I am going to conceive a girl.’ The girl, who was adopted, had not wanted to become pregnant but was terrified of jeopardising hermother’s love for her. The plan fell apart after the girl . gave birth to a boy and midwives at the hospital became suspiciousof her . mother’s ‘pushy and insensitive’ behaviour towards her and the baby, . and raised the alarm. The Daily Mail can reveal that social . workers were warned three times about the mother, but decided her . children were not at risk. On one occasion a social worker closed the . case after speaking to the mother on the telephone, without even . visiting the family’s home or seeing the children. The mother, a 48-year-old former . nanny, was jailed for five years for bullying her daughter into the . surrogate pregnancy plan and for cruelty towards another of her adopted . children. The case raises worrying questions about the regulation of adoptions from abroad and the sale of donor sperm over the internet. The High Court case was heard in secret but can be reported following a legal challenge by media groups. Family Division judge Mr Justice . Jackson said he felt ‘an abiding sense of disbelief that a parent could . behave in such a wicked and selfish way towards a vulnerable child’. The court heard the American-born . mother, who cannot be named to protect the identities of her three . adopted children and her grandson – the child born to her daughter, . chose to be sterilised in 2001 so she did not pass her diabetes on to . any children. The case was heard in the High Court but reporting restrictions prevent the naming of the family, the local authority and the area they lived in . Instead, she adopted three daughters . as babies from foreign orphanages and foster homes, two while married to . an Irish man and a third as a single parent, and raised them in . Britain. She was banned from adopting more children but longed for another child, and forced her eldest daughter to conceive. She told the girl about her plans . when her daughter was only 13, and the two-year insemination ‘programme’ began when the teenager – identified in legal documents only as A – was . 14. The judge said: ‘A did not want to . take part in the programme, but she allowed her body to be used by her . mother because she loves her. ‘A’s participation in the programme . caused her continuous anxiety. The physical steps that the mother asked . her to take were degrading, humiliating and, on occasions, painful.’ The mother bought frozen sperm over . the internet and prepared syringes full of it for her daughter to use to . inseminate herself. She was desperate that any resulting . baby should be a girl, and forced her daughter to follow a special diet . of dairy and alkaline foods in the belief this would affect the gender . of the child. In July 2010, the mother wrote an . ‘affirmation’ on her computer, setting out her wishes for the future – a . lottery win and a healthy baby girl, who she wanted to call Kelia. She wrote: ‘I desire to win the . Thunderball jackpot of £500,000 and for A to conceive and carry Kelia to . term for birth in April.’ In October that year, A became pregnant and . she gave birth to a son in June 2011, after a difficult labour which . left her needing surgery. Nurses knew she planned to give her . baby to her mother to raise, but were worried by her mother’s aggressive . behaviour, including a refusal to let A breastfeed her baby, saying: . ‘We don’t want any of that attachment thing.’ Midwives raised the alarm when the . mother tried to take the newborn baby from the ward, and A later . confided in a family friend about her ordeal. All four children were . taken into care and the mother was charged with child cruelty. She initially denied the allegations, . accusing her daughter of being a fantasist, and told authorities the . girl was mentally ill. She later pleaded guilty to five charges of child . cruelty. The High Court heard she had raised . her three adopted daughters in a ‘toxic cocoon’, teaching them at home . so they would not go to school and isolating them from friends or . neighbours. When she was 15, A was left alone to . look after her youngest sister, then only four or five, while her mother . and the middle sister went to the US for a ten-day holiday. A told the court she had seen her . mother smack her youngest sister regularly, and said she had tied the . little girl to a chair when she would not sit still and had stuck duct . tape over her mouth for answering back. The court also heard disturbing . details about failed attempts to alert social services to the family’s . set-up. Neighbours described the mother’s terrace home as like a . ‘fortress’, with the curtains always closed and no one allowed inside. In 2006, a GP neighbour contacted . social services, saying she could hear the mother shouting and swearing . at her youngest child, who was then two, and said the toddler was left . crying for up to two hours at a time. Social workers investigated and saw . all three children and the mother, but decided there was no cause for . concern. In January 2007, an anonymous letter was sent to social . services and other authorities. A social worker’s report warned that . the mother ‘appears to be doing things secretively for her own gain’, . but concluded there was no evidence of ‘significant harm’ to the . children, and the case was closed again. In 2008, the GP made another referral . to social services. A third investigation was launched but the case was . closed after social workers spoke to the mother on the telephone, . without seeing the children or visiting the house. Mr Justice Jackson said: ‘Between . 2006 and 2008, the mother succeeded in keeping social services at arm’s . length so that their investigations were essentially superficial. ‘Concerns were seen off by a parent who was recognised to be domineering. The children were never heard.’ The local authority cannot be named . for legal reasons but its Local Safeguarding Children Board has launched . a serious case review, due to be published next month. The LSCB said: ‘Nothing can change what has happened to the children in this truly terrible case. ‘It is clear that public bodies must highlight the major public policy issues which arise from this case.’","'Wicked and selfish' mother forced her daughter to inseminate herself .

The city of Tulsa is debating how to deal with the racist past of its founding father Wyatt Tate Brady as he stands accused of inciting a notorious race riot. A new magazine, This Land, has highlighted Brady's role in creating a racist atmosphere in the town before the riot in 1921. When Brady arrived in 1890 from Missouri, Tulsa was just a few dirt streets and tents occupied by white men seeking their fortune in uncharted Indian lands. The ambitious shoe salesman saw an opportunity and seized it, opening a general store, followed by a hotel. By the time Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Brady was a celebrated city father. He signed Tulsa's incorporation . papers, started a newspaper and chartered a train filled with boosters, . including humorist Will Rogers, to promote the new boomtown to people in . the East. However, a lesser-known side of Brady has become the focus of debate in his adopted hometown nearly 90 years after his death. The . son of a Confederate veteran, Brady was a member of the local Ku Klux . Klan. And new questions have emerged about his involvement in the most . notorious event in Tulsa history, a 1921 race riot that left 300 black . residents dead. The . issue is especially sensitive because Brady's name is all over town - on . a street, a mansion, a theatre and a historic neighborhood. It is also . the name of the city's most ambitious development effort in a generation . - a glitzy downtown entertainment district. Brady's . membership in the Klan was never a secret. It had been noted in Tulsa's . historical records but was largely forgotten until the new Tulsa-based . literary magazine, This Land, published a long article in late 2011 by . author Lee Roy Chapman, who detailed Klan activities and Brady's . involvement with the group. Specifically, the article said, Brady created an environment of racism that led to the riot. Honoured: Brady's name currently appears all over the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma . Dozens of businesses were looted and burned to the ground, and the chaos decimated the Greenwood District, where grocers, newspapers, prominent doctors and attorneys had thrived in an area historians often call the Black Wall Street. Even before the article was published, Tulsa had struggled to come to terms with its racial past. Black leaders had complained that the riot has been downplayed in local history. The city council, community leaders and residents are weighing what to do about a once-proud name that is suddenly tainted. 'There are councilors who are concerned and ashamed that we have this name, and we know what Mr. Brady stood for,' said Jack Henderson, the council's lone black member who plans to introduce a law Thursday to rename Brady Street as Burlington Street. Black people account for roughly 16 percent of the city's population of 400,000. Towering figure: The Brady Mansion pictured nearly 90 years after his death . Henderson's proposal, which is expected to come to a vote next week, reflects a recently discovered 1907 document on which someone crossed out Burlington Street and wrote Brady Street in its place. The downtown area is 'growing like it's never grown before,' Henderson said in an interview. 'So changing the name of the street isn't going to stop the momentum.' The council has asked business owners in the new Brady Arts District about the name, which is widely used in promotional marketing. The owners opposed any name change, concluding that it's better to be reminded of the city's checkered past in order to create a better world. 'Rather than seeking to revise history, today's residents, visitors and merchants should regard the name as a demonstration of a new set of principles,' they said in a July 14 letter. ""Removing the name is to surrender to the past.' Business owners have also protested that changing the name of the street would confuse visitors and hurt sales, among other concerns. Most politicians have remained mum on the issue. Others quarrel with the idea that Brady was a major instigator of the riot. Mayor Dewey Bartlett said he's read accounts that showed disagreement over Brady's role in the unrest. The mayor wants to keep the Brady name, citing concern that the renaming effort could become a slippery slope for other streets and landmarks named after people with questionable pasts. Race riot: This picture from June 1, 1921, shows Tulsa's Greenwood District during race riots that left 300 black people dead . 'We look at history as a good teacher, not something to emulate, obviously, but in this case something to learn from and avoid,' Bartlett said in an interview. 'My opinion, I guess, is that I have not heard a strong groundswell of support for changing the name and to what? What are we going to call it next?' The entertainment district is at the core of Tulsa's effort to rejuvenate its moribund downtown, which had long been pocked with half-empty offices, blank storefronts and weeds. The improvements come after the city invested decades, and many millions of dollars, in failed attempts to revive the area. Today the district has been reborn. It has a new ballpark, boutiques, a cigar bar, trendy restaurants and a museum and park dedicated to Oklahoma's Dust Bowl balladeer, Woody Guthrie. Man of influence: Wyatt Tate Brady with his wife, Rachel . The elegant Brady Theater is one of the jewels, opened by Brady in 1914 as the biggest arena between Kansas City and Houston. It's now a popular showplace for indie and classic rock shows. 'We've been here over six years, and no one seemed to notice or care' about renaming Brady Street, said Janet Duvall, executive director of the Tulsa Glassblowing School, one of many specialty shops that have taken root along the street in question. 'The success is finally here, and now we think we need to put someone else's name on it.' Others say the name can serve as an omnipresent reminder of 'never again' as the city moves ahead. 'It's like changing the name of the city of Tulsa because it has a racist past,' said Kuanza Johnson, a California transplant and teacher, who is black and lives in the Brady Heights Historic District. 'Where do you stop?' Anna Taylor, a white resident of the historic district, agrees, saying the city need not dredge up the battles of the past. 'It's not going to change anything,' she said. Confusion over the name seems especially apparent in the Brady Heights neighborhood, a section of large, nearly 100-year-old homes, including the Greek Revival-style mansion Brady built in 1920 and named Arlington, after Robert E. Lee's Virginia estate. Once home to business barons, the neighborhood is now is full of young families in fixer-uppers and newcomers to the city. Until recently, many never even knew who the district was named for. Still, 'You don't revamp history,' said Susan Kufdakis, who lives with her parents in Brady's old mansion, which has been turned back into a single-family house after being divided up in apartments. 'You shouldn't forget who Brady was, but you keep history the way it is.'","Chequered past of Tulsa's founding father raises questions over his presence around the town's landmarks and public spaces .

They may be the child heirs to a billion dollar fortune, but that was no protection against years of harrowing cruelty at the hands of their father. Forced to live in faeces-strewn basement, existing like slaves and enduring scalding baths in boiling water, some of the horrifying details of life for twins Georgina and Walker Inman III, 15, are just emerging. They are set to inherit part of the $1billion fortune of heiress Doris Duke - dubbed the 'richest girl in the world' thanks to trust funds set up by her father who founded American Tobacco - when they turn 21. Cruelty: Walker Inman III, left, and twin sister Georgia Inman, right, both 15, have trust funds worth millions of dollars, but they claim they have endured years of abuse at the hands of their heroin-addicted father . But Georgina has revealed that growing up at their heroin-addicted father’s mansion  was anything but a life of pampered privilege in a shocking interview for Rolling Stone magazine, out today. 'I never asked to be born into any of this. Sometimes I wish I was never born.' Georgia recalled one of the regular horrors she and her brother Walker faced at the hands of their father Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr and, allegedly, his fifth wife at the Duke family estate in South Carolina. Inhumane: Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr, pictured, made his children live in faeces-strewn basement until he died in 2010 of a methadone overdose . Speaking with a faltering voice, she described being dunked in a scalding bath. She told Rolling Stone magazine: 'They. Stuck my brother and I. In hot boiling water in our bath. It felt like our skin was melting away.' She called her fortune ‘blood money’ and told of one time when she put a gun to her father’s head in an attempt to end the torture. More details of their harrowing upbringing emerged in an affidavit related to a onetime lawsuit over damage at a rented, 10,000-square-foot mansion, dubbed Outlaw Acres, in Wyoming, provided by plantation caretaker Vick 'Butch' Deer. In it she recalled that 'Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr made them stay down in the . basement all the time’. Glamorous: Doris Duke, a New York socialite who died in 1993, was known as the 'richest girl in the world' for her trust funds left to her by her father, who founded American Tobacco . 'Richest girl in the world': Doris Duke lived her entire adult life as the subject of news and gossip pages. Her wealth, philanthropy and multiple marriages made her one of the most famous women of her day . Heir to a fortune: This chart shows how the twins are in line to inherit a $1billion tobacco fortune . 'The basement was covered in faeces, . and it was smeared all over, and it smelled terrible. It was so bad that . I wouldn’t leave a dog in that condition.’ Several others said the kids were . locked in their room each night, and, according to a former nanny, . 'There was food strewn across the floor and a foul smell from where the . kids had been relieving themselves in a corner.' The cruel father — who received an estimated $90,000 monthly inheritance — got custody of the kids in 2000 when they were two years old. He had custody until he died from a meth overdose in 2010. Daisha Inman is now embroiled in a court battle over the twins¿ trust funds . The twins now live with their mother Daisha Inman, Walker’s third wife, in a $20,000-a month Utah rental. Inman is currently locked in a vicious legal battle with executives from Citibank and JPMorgan — who administer the twins’ trust funds thought to be worth $60million — in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court over her handling of their inheritance. Titled 'Poorest Rich Kids in the World', the article includes horrified recollections from employees who worked at Walker’s estates and saw first-hand how the children were treated. One incident described within the article, details how Walker’s fifth wife, Daralee, crashed into a tree while drink-driving the children to school at 7.30am. But amidst the savage cruelty, Georgina reveals glimpses of extraordinary privilege. The children had a pet lion cub and brought diamonds to school for show-and-tell, but they looked malnourished with dark circles under their eyes to the stream of nannies who cared for them. The staggering wealth and extreme neglect and abuse created a warped environment for the youngsters to grow up in. And they are still living a cloistered life, having never played the childhood game Musical Chairs, and still believing in Father Christmas. 'Dear Santa, I know I haven’t been good, . but if you do come all I want is to say hi to you in person,' Patterson . recently wrote to the mythical character, according to Rolling Stone, in . the shaky handwriting of a first-grader. Georgia . claims she once spotted the bearded man in the flesh, but it’s more . likely the vision was an apparition of her late father, who’s haunted . her since his untimely passing. 'I think he’s here,' she whispered during the magazine interview, gesturing to an empty chair in her new Utah home. Uprooted: The twins now live with their mother Daisha Inman, Walker¿s third wife, in a $20,000-a month Utah home . Walker’s fondest memory of their father . was when he intentionally set off a tear-gas grenade in the house as . part of a whacked-out safety lesson. Despite the detailed incidents of cruelty, authorities did not act to remove the children from their abusers, according to a report in the New York Post. Wyoming law-enforcement never filed charges against the Inmans, who lavished local staff with exorbitant salaries and benefits. When Walker brought his family to the South Carolina plantation, the Department of Social Services logged three reports about the crazy clan. In one incident, police were called to a restaurant after Georgia’s dad slapped her so hard, fellow diners feared for her life. The troubled duo were sent to a mental hospital for three months of recovery from a childhood of trauma. And they’ve yet to fully heal. Both teens have recently contemplated suicide and suffered from anorexia. Daisha’s plans for her kids’ future? Pairing them up with fellow fatherless children with a similar amount of baggage. 'She’s working on getting the twins together with Michael Jackson’s kids, with whom she thinks they’d have tons in common,' the article concludes. Doris Duke inherited untold millions from her father James 'Buck' Duke - the founder of American Tobacco, maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes. His massive gift to a small, private college in North Carolina led leaders there to change its name to Duke University. The huge sum resulted in Duke becoming one of the most elite universities in the country . Doris Duke, who died in 1993, left a large philanthropic legacy, as well. She was know during her time as 'the richest girl in the world' and was a superstar celebrity and socialite for most of her life. On her death, she left nearly all of her $1billon estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which remains a major force in the philanthropic world. However, Doris Duke had no surviving biological children and part of the Duke fortune went into trust funds for the Inman twins.","Georgina and Walker Inman set to inherit part of $1BN tobacco fortune .

Oil chiefs told offshore workers to put on their 'big-boy pants' or quit if they couldn’t deal with the risk of helicopter crashes - just weeks before the Shetland chopper disaster last week which killed four. Bosses at Total oil company told stunned crew not to complain about the prospect of crashing at sea during risky flights on the same oil rig that the doomed helicopter left last Friday. The talk, which took place on August 8, involved helicopter company CHC’s chief pilot Will Hanekom, and Total head of logistics Christophe Barbier, according to the Press and Journal in north east Scotland. Investigation: The wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives around two miles west of Sumburgh Airport on Shetland . It was meant to reassure workers concerned about the safety of Super Puma choppers. But in a leaked audio recording from the meeting on the Borgsten Dolphin Rig one worker asked what Total would do if they refused to board a chopper because they feared for their life. One boss replied: 'If you can’t live with that risk then you can’t work offshore.' A CHC pilot added: 'I have to say how else are we going to get there? It is what we do. Response: The wreckage floats on the surface as the operation to recover the helicopter and the last of the four bodies was completed today . Loss of power: The helicopter was being operated by CHC for oil company Total and was transporting workers from the Borgsten Dolphin platform . Difficult task: RNLI volunteers and Coastguard workers inspecting the wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives . 'At some point we have to put our big-boy pants on and say either ""we believe"", either what I am telling you is the truth and I’m willing to sit in the front and risk my family and everything that I have got. 'If you don’t, well, I wouldn’t force any of my pilots to fly if they didn’t want to.' Today local trade union boss Jake Molloy criticised the oil and helicopter bosses. The RMT Regional Organiser said: 'It’s an appalling statement to make to anybody at anytime, whether it was before or after Friday’s incident. 'If anybody has any concerns about flying on helicopters, they should be given support if required.'For representatives of an oil company and helicopter firm to say that is just plain out of order. Model: An undated handout photograph released by CHC Helicopter shows a Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma L2 variant, the same model as the CHC operated helicopter that crashed in the North Sea . 'It’s poor, poor management and they shouldn’t be in a job if that’s their attitude towards their workforce.' The talk was meant to reassure workers about the Super Puma EC225 fleets, which had just returned to service after being grounded following safety fears when two were forced to make an emergency bail-out at sea last year. But Total and CHC stand by what was said in the safety briefing and claim they were trying to prove the safety of the EC225, not the older AS332 L2 model that crashed on Friday evening off the coast of the Scottish island.

The parents involved in the sacking of a school dinner lady who mistakenly served gammon to their daughter are to emigrate to a Muslim country. Alison Waldock, 51, was accused of gross misconduct and says she lost her job after Zahid and Rumana Darr asked that she be dismissed. Today it can be revealed that Mr and Mrs Darr and their three children are emigrating to the United Arab Emirates later this month. The family have chosen to move from their home in Cambridge to Sharjah, where alcohol is banned and there are the strictest decency laws in the emirates. Mrs Darr, 33, wrote on her Facebook page: ‘So we’re leaving the country end of August for good … We’re moving to Sharjah. We want to go relax in a nice hot Muslim country where the kids know their identities as Muslims.’ The move comes after Mr Darr’s recruitment firm was closed down in June when he was found to be working as a company director illegally. Following an investigation by the Insolvency Service, he was banned from holding company directorships after he was caught pocketing over £500,000 owed in tax in 2008. His firm Interecruit (UK) went into liquidation after Mr Darr, 36, ‘diverted’ money owed to the taxman in VAT, income tax and national insurance to another of his companies. The nine-year ban was imposed in February 2011 but in May this year he was found to be operating a similar company named Interecruit (GB), which supplied agricultural workers. As well as working as a director when disqualified, Mr Darr was not paying staff the minimum wage and failing to provide holiday pay. He had his gangmaster’s licence revoked by the licensing authority. Scroll down for video .

The dinner lady said she had previously warned the school that it was impossible to keep track of the various dietary requirements of the 200 children eating in the canteen. She suggested that children at the school, where the proportion of pupils from ethnic minority backgrounds is ‘well above average’, wore wristbands to show what they could eat, but this was rejected. She said: ‘I had gone to the school . and said, “Look, we need to have bands or something physical that we can . see, rather than just a list of names”. But they said no, because they . said that would brand children and show that they are different. ‘They said that would lead to segregation, but if all the children were wearing bands it would not be a problem.’ She accused the school and the company of not providing enough training. ‘When . the halal meat came into the kitchen, they did not say Muslims cannot . eat pork of any type,’ she said. ‘We could have had training on this, . but they did not do anything.

A woman who reacted to taunts about her appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show by smashing a glass in a bride-to-be's face was jailed for five years today . Mother-of-one Jennifer Eckley, 27, scarred victim Lucy Steers for life when she glassed her at her engagement party at a hotel in Newent, Gloucestershire. Ms Steers, a 28-year-old nurse, has been left with a v-shaped scar on the bridge of her nose and is to undergo plastic surgery next week. Scarred: Mother-of-one Jennifer Eckley (right), 27, scarred victim Lucy Steers (left) for life when she glassed her at her engagement party at a hotel in Newent, Gloucestershire. She has been off work with depression . since the attack last December and her relationship with her fiance . Craig Mortimer has broken up. During . Eckley’s trial at Gloucester Crown Court the jury was told that two . years before the assault she had appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show. She was involved in a programme about domestic abuse. Afterwards, the jury heard, she regularly had fun poked at her in her home town of Newent about her appearance on the show. She told the jury in evidence that she realised now she had been ‘silly’ ever to take part in the programme. The . court heard that on the night of December 1, Eckley was at a hen party . at the George Hotel, in Newent, at the same time as Ms Steers’ engagement party. Scene: The incident took place at the George Hotel (pictured), in Newent, on the night of December 1 . After . comments had been made by people at the hotel about her Kyle show . appearance Eckley walked up to Ms Steers and jabbed a glass into her . face. It broke Ms Steers’ nose and caused a 2cm cut on the bridge of the nose and two other facial cuts. In . a victim impact statement read to the court, Ms Steers said: 'I have . been told by the consultant that the scarring will be permanent. 'I now have to live with it as a constant reminder for the rest of my life. 'I feel my scar has made me look like someone who fights and people will judge me by it. Hearing: Eckley has been jailed for five years following a trial at Gloucester Crown Court . 'My relationship with Craig has ended. It was a 19 month relationship and this incident has left me feeling distraught. 'I . have only just started going to the shops again. I have been signed off . my work until the case is finished owing to me being diagnosed with . depression. 'My father has . given up his job (he was a manager at the George Hotel). I know he . wishes he had been working that night so he could have prevented it. I . feel like I am responsible for this.' Jailing . Eckley, who has a young daughter, the judge Recorder Richard Davison, . said she had received only ‘minimum provocation’ yet she had made a . ‘determined and deliberate’ attack on Ms Steers. Show: During Eckley's trial the jury was told that two years before the assault she had appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show . 'You . caused her devastating injuries - scarring a pretty young woman for . life,' he said. 'We have seen the photographs (of her injuries) and they . are horrific.' Eckley, a . childminder, from Newent, had denied wounding Ms Steers with intent to . cause her grievous bodily harm on December 1 last year but was . unanimously convicted by the jury. She was cleared of a second charge of assaulting another woman, Kate Taylor, at the engagement party an hour earlier. She . admitted a charge of assault by beating Ms Taylor’s sister, Nicola, . whose hair she pulled when she saw her in the pub and realised she was . her partner’s ex-girlfriend. During . the trial prosecutor Julian Kesner told the jury the engagement party . 'should have been one of the happiest days in Lucy Steers’ life - but it . became one of the worst.' Just before she glassed Ms Steers, Eckley told her: ‘I suppose you think you’re a f****** pretty bitch - well you won’t be now.' Later, when she was arrested, she told police she would never get work as a childminder again because she had glassed someone. However, she denied to the jury that she had a glass in her hand. In evidence she claimed Ms Steers had been among people who taunted her about the Jeremy Kyle show on the night of the attack. She said she told Ms Steers ‘I’m glad you find my pain funny. You don’t know what I have been through.' Eckley claimed Ms Steers told her she had found the show hilarious and had Googled it to watch it again. 'You . caused her devastating injuries - scarring a pretty young woman for . life. We have seen the photographs (of her injuries) and they . are horrific' - Recorder Richard Davison . Later, . she alleged, she got into a scuffle with Ms Steers but they were both . fighting each other and she did not have a glass in her hand. She said . she did not know how Ms Steers got injured or how her own hand was cut. Before . Eckley was sentenced today her solicitor Jason Coulter asked the court . to accept there had been ‘at least a degree of provocation, albeit mild’ from Ms Steers to cause Eckley to attack her. Her reaction was a ‘spontaneous moment of blind madness’ which was totally unjustified, he added. He . handed the court testimonials for Eckley who, he said, had been hoping . to make a career in child minding and had been due to start training in . January this year. Mr Coulter told the court that Eckley’s appearance on Jeremy Kyle had been ‘about an abusive relationship with another.’ 'As . a consequence of that she was the subject of some discussion and . perhaps tittle tattle in the small Newent community prior to this . particular night.'","Lucy Steers suffered gashes and a broken nose at hotel party .

A new cancer drug for patients with the same faulty gene as actress Angelina Jolie has shown 'impressive responses' in a clinical trial, researchers have said. The potential drug, called BMN 673, targets DNA repair in cancer cells and is designed to attack tumours that have been left vulnerable by genetic mutations. BRCA genes were brought into the public consciousness last month after Jolie, 37, revealed she underwent a double mastectomy when doctors told her that her faulty gene - BRCA1 - meant she had an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer. Faulty gene: Angelina Jolie arriving for the world premiere of World War Z, at the Empire Leicester Square, London. Last month she revealed she underwent a double mastectomy . Scientists studying BMN 673 found the drug was 'well tolerated' by patients and showed 'excellent anti-tumour activity', the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust said. The results of the trial - which was funded by US firm BioMarin Pharmaceutical and involved the University of Newcastle and several American institutions - were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) meeting in Chicago yesterday. Some 70 patients with a range of cancers, including ovarian or peritoneal, and breast, were monitored, and patients with cancers linked to BRCA mutations saw the most substantial improvement. The researchers used different measures of the drug’s effect on tumour instability and breakdown. One was a clinical score called Recist, which included a range of measures such as whether visible lesions, or cracks, appear in the walls of tumours after treatment. Some 70 patients with a range of cancers, including ovarian or peritoneal, and breast, were monitored as part of the trial . Some 11 of 25 evaluable ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations had a Recist-positive response to treatment, as did seven of 18 breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations. Signs of some clinical benefit were seen in several more patients, the experts said. BRCA mutations reduce cells’ ability to repair their DNA, and when inherited substantially increase the risk of developing a range of cancers, including breast, ovarian and prostate. No targeted treatments have yet been approved specifically for use in patients who have inherited BRCA mutations. BMN 673 - which is yet to be given a trade name - is one of a handful of a family of molecules called PARP inhibitors which are under development for the treatment of cancer. BMN 673 is one of the most promising PARP inhibitors being tested in clinical trials. Professor Johann de Bono, from the ICR, said: 'Patients with germline BRCA-associated tumours have no targeted treatment options, and there is a real need for these to be developed. 'Our promising study showed that BMN 673, a potent member of a family of potential drugs called PARP inhibitors, had excellent anti-tumour activity. It’s one of a range of new-style cancer therapies that target specific molecular defects in tumours and offer the potential of more personalised treatments to patients, including those with BRCA mutations.'","Drug, called BMN 673, targets DNA repair in cancer cells .

A US attack on Syria could provoke reprisals ranging from missile strikes to terrorist attacks and cyberwar, according to government officials and private analysts. US military commanders are preparing contingency plans for a potential counter-strike by Syria's military, defense officials have revealed. The officials expressed confidence that the United States and U.S. regional allies such as Israel could deter or neutralize an immediate response from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A European defense official said the . purpose of building up large forces near Syria - mostly in the form of . naval assets - was to deter Assad. 'The important thing is to have enough force to control the escalatory . response,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Even so, 'there is no military action without risk, and a punitive . strike on Syrian regime forces would carry some. Weapons could hit . unintended targets, perhaps killing civilians,' Jeffrey White of the . Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank wrote this week. 'The regime could strike back in unexpected ways against U.S. and allied . interests, or it could resort to further (chemical weapons) attacks . inside Syria.' Syria and its close regional ally, Iran, both are widely believed to . have ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel and other U.S. allies . nearby, such as Turkey and Jordan. Hezbollah, the Shi'ite militia backed by Tehran and fighting on Assad's . side in Syria, has tens of thousands of short-range rockets in southern . Lebanon, near Israel's border. A coalition spearheaded by the US, Britain and France is preparing to punish Assad for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week . The hope is that the attacks will deter Assad from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future . Many analysts predict that Syria and its allies will avoid a direct . conflict with the United States and opt instead for an 'asymmetric . response' aimed at Western vulnerabilities - terror or cyber attacks, . for example. Assad also could opt not to respond to a strike, hoping to wait out the US and allied military threat. A US official with experience in the Middle East said that Washington . also is concerned that Iran could turn up the heat in Iraq. So far, . resurgent violence by Sunni militants there has not been answered with . retaliation from Shi'ite militias with ties to Tehran. There are still militias in Iraq 'that would respond most likely if the . Iranians put pressure on them,' said the official, who is not authorized . to comment publicly on the matter. 'It's something that's of concern, . and something that's on everybody's minds.' The potential for retaliation by Syria or its allies is among the . growing concerns in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere about President . Barack Obama's moves toward launching missile strikes against Syria in . light of its apparent use of chemical weapons against civilians outside . Damascus on August 21. Some lawmakers and analysts say they worry that Washington could be . sucked into Syria's 2-1/2-year-old civil war - something Obama has long . resisted. Others argue that a few volleys of missiles aimed at Syrian . military facilities would have little effect, and might even embolden . Assad. 'It is vital we avoid shortsighted military action that would have . little impact on the long-term trajectory of the conflict. We can't . simply launch a few missiles and hope for the best,' Senator James . Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said . on Wednesday. How Syria itself will respond will be key, although many analysts expect . Assad initially will simply absorb any strikes as long as they do not . appear intended to decapitate his government. Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks on Wednesday, including many women and children . Activists say that somewhere near 1,300 were killed in the chemical weapons attack on Wednesday near Damascus. Syria has one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons of any country . 'I think the calculation will be, ""Let's just hunker down, take what we . think will be a limited series of strikes and then just live to fight . another day,'"" said Shawn Brimley of the Center for a New American . Security. 'I'd be surprised if Assad tried to respond because that would just . further draw the United States into an engagement,' said Brimley, who . recently served on Obama's National Security Council staff. 'He probably . has the calculation that if the United States becomes decisively . engaged that he's unlikely to survive.' Iran's military chief of staff, Hassan Firouzabadi, was quoted by a . state-run Iranian news agency on Wednesday as promising that 'any attack . on Syria would burn down Israel'. But Iran seems unlikely to directly attack Israel, which almost . certainly would deliver a robust military response. And Iran's newly . inaugurated president, Hassan Rouhani, took office promising to improve . Tehran's foreign relations. Iran could turn to Hezbollah, however, to accomplish its goals. Would bombing Syria be lawful? Britain . and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s . hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own . citizens present a direct threat to either country. What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification? The . UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in . self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. Neither applies here. Russia has made clear its intention to veto any proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China. Can a military strike be legal without a UN resolution? Unclear. In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without . one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on . humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians. The . intervention was widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable. A . similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in . Syria. If President . Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people, . he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an international . agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a signatory – banning . the use of chemical weapons. But . breaching the protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for . military action and it normally applies to international conflicts, . rather than civil wars. Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians? In . 2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia . in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the . ‘Responsibility to Protect’. It . was designed to protect the innocent from genocide, war crimes and . ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such . horrors within their borders, and an obligation to intervene if they see . it elsewhere. But former UN assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force. All . diplomatic efforts must have been tried first, and even then military . intervention requires the backing of the Security Council – taking David . Cameron and President Obama back to square one. 'A Hezbollah attack on Israel is likely, and in fact some are . speculating about yet another Hezbollah-Israeli war in Lebanon,' said . Hayat Alvi, a lecturer in Middle East studies at the U.S. Naval War . College. 'Iran and Syria can target coalition cyber-based infrastructure and . other potential targets,' Alvi added. 'They prove to be quite capable in . that domain.' A pro-Hezbollah religious leader, Sheikh Afif Nabulsi, warned on Tuesday . that a U.S. strike on Syria 'would be met by harsh responses against . U.S. interests in the region and against Israel directly,' according to . Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper. Yet Hezbollah's calculations might be complex too. The group has sent thousands of fighters into Syria to help Assad quash . mostly Sunni rebels, stretching its capabilities and sparking apparent . attacks against it by Sunnis back in Lebanon. 'Hezbollah may say, ""Actually, I don't want to get sucked in further . over Assad's poor decision to use chemical weapons,'"" said Matthew . Levitt, author of a book on Hezbollah that is due to be released next . week. Iran, Syria and Hezbollah 'are all inclined to do the asymmetric thing,' Levitt said. Hezbollah's most likely response, he said, will be to tell operatives . already in the field who are planning violent attacks 'to speed up'.","They cautioned could provoke revenge attacks home and abroad .

The boss of Microsoft's Windows division has left the company just two weeks after launching the flagship Windows 8 software and Surface tablet described as 'make or break' for the company. 23-year veteran Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit, was widely tipped to be the next . chief executive of Microsoft Corp. His 'shocking' departure is seen by many as an attempt by CEO Steve Ballmer to increase his control of the company as it faces increased competition from Apple and Google. Scroll down for video . Steven Sinofsky launching the Windows 8 operating system in New York City two weeks ago. Today it was announced he is leaving the firm. The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into computer hardware. However, it has hit problems with 'modest' sales and users complaining or problems with the gadget's snap on keyboard. Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM . Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is . not compatible with old Microsoft applications. However, . the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such . as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and . music apps. The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only . The move was unexpected and neither Microsoft nor Sinofsky gave an explanation, although an executive at the company, who asked not to be named, said the decision was 'mutual' and said he was not expecting Sinofsky to take a job at another company soon. 'This is shocking news. 'This is very surprising,' said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. 'Like a lot of people, I thought Sinofsky was in line to potentially be Ballmer's successor.' Sinofsky, 47, joined Microsoft in 1989 and made his mark as Bill Gates' technical assistant. He grew into an uncompromising leader whose ruthless style of cutting layers of management and formalizing the process of software development gave rise to the term ""Sinofskyization"" in the company. He wielded immense power as head of the Windows unit, the traditional center of Microsoft's business, but was not known for working well with other executives. One former Microsoft employee who worked with Sinofsky and other executives said his relentlessly aggressive style exasperated other leaders and may have alienated too many people, including his mentor Gates. 'He had no one left to fight for him,' said the staffer, who asked not to be named. 'Gates gave him cover, so he must have eventually caved.' It leaves Steve Ballmer, 56, shows no sign of leaving after almost 13 years in the job, despite almost constant criticism. Sinofsky was also one of the team behind Microsoft's Surface tablet, which has only had 'modest' sales the firm has said . He has now replaced all the leaders of Microsoft's five main operating units in the past four years. He told employees in a memo on Monday simply that: 'Steven Sinofsky has decided to leave the company.' In a later media statement, he added that it was 'imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams, and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings'. 'Windows has to be much more thoroughly integrated with Xbox, with other parts of the company,' said Barnicle. 'I don't know that was something Steven was as excited about as focusing on Windows.' Sinofsky had a stellar career at Microsoft, overhauling the hugely profitable Office division before going over to manage the release of Windows 7 in 2009. That was regarded as a success and Sinofsky was then tasked with overseeing Windows 8, Microsoft's new-look, touch-friendly operating system designed to bridge the gap with mobile computing leaders Apple and Google. Silicon Valley may have a stereotype . as the land of computer nerds and alpha males, but the modern technology . boss is increasingly likely to be a woman. In: Julie Larson-Green will replace Steven Sinofsky as Microsoft CEO . Now . the likes of Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo . have been joined by Julie Larson-Green, the new president of Windows . who is just the latest female tech maven to step in to a high-profile . role. Microsoft said on Monday that it has . promoted company veteran Ms Larson-Green to lead all its Windows . software and hardware engineering. Tech Titan: In 2008, Sheryl Sandberg became COO at Facebook and is now the first woman on the company's board of directors. Tami Reller will take over . responsibility for the Windows business, while retaining her posts as . chief financial officer and chief marketing officer. Since 1993, Ms Larson-Green has worked on and led some of the most . successful products for Microsoft, including the user experiences for . early versions of Internet Explorer, and helped drive the thinking . behind the refresh of the user experience for Microsoft Office. For . Windows 7 and Windows 8 she was responsible for program management, user . interface design and research, as well as development of all . international releases. She has a master's degree in software . engineering from Seattle University and a bachelor's degree in business . administration from Western Washington University, according to CNET. In her new role she . will be responsible for all future Windows product development in . addition to future hardware opportunities. Ms . Larson-Green is the latest woman to ascend the largely male-dominated . tech industry. Melissa Mayer was appointed CEO of Yahoo in July. In . 2008, Sheryl Sandberg became COO at Facebook and is now the first woman . on the company's board of directors. All Smiles: Melissa's Mayer was appointed CEO of Yahoo in July . At the same time, Sinofsky led the development of Microsoft's Surface tablet, its first own-brand computer, aimed at tackling Apple's wildly successful iPad head on. Analysts said it may be too early to judge whether Windows 8 and the Surface have been a success, after launching on Oct. 26, but Sinofsky's departure could have been tied to his abrasive management and ambition for the top job. From Windows 8 to Outlook.com to Windows Phone 8, Sinofsky has worked across all aspects of . He joined the Windows team after the Vista operating system debuted and headed up the development of Windows 7 and then Windows 8. 'We started to look back and we said, ‘Wow, the user interface, the experience, the form factors, the kinds of PCs were all developed in the mid 1990s,'' Sinofsky said last month in an interview with ABC News. 'We looked and we said, ‘Things are so different. We need to envision a new kind of software for those scenarios, because the world is a different place.’' 'It sounded like it had more to do with his leadership style,' said Barnicle at Pacific Crest. 'There wasn't really a next move for Steven at this point.' Sinofsky said: 'It is impossible to count the blessings I have received over my years at Microsoft,' he said in a statement. ""I am humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone I have had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company.' Sinofsky will be succeeded by Julie Larson-Green, who will head the Windows hardware and software division, and Tami Reller, who will remain chief financial officer of the Windows unit. Together, they will report directly to Ballmer. Sinofsky's departure comes two weeks after rival Apple shook up its own top management, forcing out mobile head Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett. One analyst cited talk that the moves might be related. 'Some are speculating that the availability on the market of Forstall might have something to do with Sinofsky's departure,' said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. 'I doubt we will have to wait long to know if this is the case.'","Head of Windows division Steven Sinofsky known as aggressive, divisive leader .

"Shadow health minister said charging foreigners for using NHS was 'xenophobic' By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 17:29 EST, 3 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:46 EST, 4 July 2013 . Doctors’ leaders yesterday attacked plans to crack down on ‘health tourism’ by making foreigners pay for NHS care. Dr Clare Gerada, of the Royal College of GPs, claimed the reforms could result in migrants ‘wandering around’ with infectious diseases. And the British Medical Association insisted doctors would not be prepared to ‘enforce immigration checks’ and did not have time to be ‘arbiters’ of who should get patient care. Claims: David Cameron said British families pay £5,000 a year each in taxes to fund the NHS . Their outburst comes after David Cameron said British families pay £5,000 a year each in taxes to fund the NHS, which should not be abused as an ‘international health service’. Medical leaders have been accused by ministers of scaremongering over the risk to public health – insisting there would be exemptions in cases of infectious disease. Doctors must play their part in ensuring free services are not exploited by those who should pay, say MPs. Proposals unveiled yesterday by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt include a new £200 ‘healthcare levy’ for anyone seeking a UK visa for more than six months, a charge to see GPs for stays of less than six months and a new system to track the use of the NHS by migrant workers. The Government is also considering changing the rules on organ transplants, which could exclude anybody who does not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK. A consultation document also suggests that the levy would not cover IVF treatment, cosmetic  surgery or treatment for ‘pre-existing’ pregnancies – which would all incur higher charges. 'Stigmatising foreigners': Shadow Health Minister Diane Abbott has condemned the charges . Visitors from the EU would continue . to access the NHS free, but a new central collection system would . recover the costs from their home countries. The proposals will also end free . access to GPs for short-term visitors. But the proposals have provoked . anger among healthcare professionals. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 yesterday, . Dr Gerada said the ‘rushed’ consultation could lead to migrants with . highly-infectious conditions ‘wandering around for fear of being . charged’. ‘I don’t think we should be turning the GP surgery into a border agency,’ she added. Dr . Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA’s GP committee, said reforms to . the system would mean ‘significant planning and resources’. ‘The botched launch of NHS111 . demonstrates what can happen if a  system is rushed through because of . politically driven deadlines,’ he added. ‘The BMA would strongly oppose . any system where GPs are required to act as UK Border Force agents and . enforce immigration checks. ‘Doctors should spend their time . treating patients and not acting as the arbitrators of whether patients . are eligible to receive NHS care.’ His . deputy, Dr Richard Vautrey, said: ‘It would clearly be discriminatory . for a practice just to ask for documentation from patients who happen to . look foreign and talk funny.’ Mr . Cameron told the Commons: ‘This is a national health service not an . international health service.’ Tory MP Philip Lee, a former GP, told the . House he was once called to Heathrow to see an arrival who claimed she . had only just realised she was nine months pregnant. n .

Christine Green yesterday . quit her £150,000-a-year post at Tameside Hospital in Greater . Manchester. An NHS report . found that A&E patients were left in corridors for hours. Tariq . Mahmood, the medical director, has also stood aside. Shadow health minister Diane Abbott yesterday said charging so-called foreign health tourists for using NHS treatment was ‘xenophobic’. She said ‘communicable disease was no respecter of immigration paperwork’ and questioned the scale of the problem in a total NHS budget of £109billion. Writing on Twitter, she asked: ‘What price xenophobia? Stigmatising foreigners accessing NHS creates a public health risk.’Other Labour MPs distanced themselves from her remarks. Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant welcomed  any attempt to tackle ‘abuse of the system’. David Cameron condemned the lack of cross-party support for a ‘sensible change’. Patients are being given basic first aid and taken to hospital by police, it was revealed yesterday. Officers are stepping in to help because ambulances take too long to arrive, said Paddy Tipping, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire. The former MP said officers were ‘quite anxious’ because they could face an investigation if a patient died in their care. East Midlands Ambulance Service – which has failed performance targets – said it was simply making sure both services helped  'each other’s needs'. It comes after NHS chief Sir David Nicholson said on Tuesday that firemen may help in medical emergencies.","Medical leaders have been accused by ministers of scaremongering .

Scientists have bottled the Earth’s most colourful light show, along with several auroras from other planets. The colours were created inside a glass dome known as a Planeterrella where charged particles glow vividly when exposed to a magnetic field. This is similar process to that which creates the Northern Lights and will help scientists better understand how different auroras are formed. Guillaume Gronoff (left) and his summer intern Sam Walker (right) built the Planeterrella, which recreates Earth's Northern Lights and the auroras from several other planets . Dr Guillaume Gronoff and . his intern Sam Walker from Letourneau University in Texas, built the . Planeterrella at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. ‘It recreates the atmosphere of the Earth at 80km in altitude when an aurora is occurring,' said Dr Gronoff, a research scientist at Nasa Langley. 'The aurora is created when particles, originally from the sun, precipitate into the atmosphere.' The Planeterrella machine is a spinoff of an experiment from the 19th century called the Terrella. The Terrella, created by Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland, first demonstrated the glowing result of electrically charged particles mixing with a magnetic field. The Planeterrella recreates the atmosphere of the Earth at 80km in altitude when the Northern Lights (pictured) are occuring . From, 1896 to 1917 the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland designed an . experiment called the Terrella, to better understand the formation of the polar lights. The experiment consisted of shooting electrons from a duct to a magnetised sphere in a vacuum. The electron gun represented the sun, and the magnetised sphere represented the Earth. A century later, new designs of the experiment have branched out to simulate different interactions between different stars and their planets, hence the new name, 'Planeterrella'. Dr Gronoff and his team upgraded the old experiment by adding several spheres, which allowed them to recreate the auroral ovals that occur on Earth and several other planets. ‘For example, we can show the reaction when Io, the satellite of Jupiter, sends particles to Jupiter. We can also simulate the aurora at Neptune and Uranus, when their magnetic fields are directly pointing towards the sun,’ said Dr Gronoff. There are around 10 other Planeterrella machines in Europe, and the first was created by Dr Gronoff’s PhD advisor, Dr Jean Lilensten, in France. Studying auroras and the relationship between the sun and the Earth is a key focus area of Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate. The Planeterrella machine will used for demonstrating how each variable interacts to create an aurora. The colour of the aurora in the bottle is purple because of the nitrogen used. The aurora on Earth is usually green due to reactions with oxygen in the atmosphere . ‘The Planeterrella allows us to create analogies with existing processes, like the aurora at Mars, which do not have a global magnetic field, but several localised magnetic fields, or Uranus and Neptune, when the magnetic fields of those planets point towards the Sun,’ explained Dr Gronoff. Dr Gronoff warned that the experiment is only an illustration; more complex phenomena are occurring in the magnetospheres of planets. For example, there are various gases on each planet that can create different colour effects within auroras. Dr Gronoff is now planning on incorporating this variable using a few extra magnets and some carbon dioxide to simulate the aurora on Mars.","Colours created when particles in a dome were exposed to a magnetic field .

NHS hospitals have just one consultant on duty at the weekend for every 120 patients in some areas, figures have revealed. The revelation comes after data revealed more than 4,400 people a year die needlessly as a result of poor out-of-hours care. North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust had just four consultants on duty to look after 485 beds and two Accident and Emergency Departments on a Sunday, figures revealed. Under fire: North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust, which includes the Cumberland Infirmary (pictured), had just four consultants on duty to look after 485 patients . A spokesman for the NHS Trust said they had additional consultant surgeons available on call. In some hospitals there are no consultants on duty at weekends at all and they instead use an on call system, the Sunday Times reported. The figures, put together by health information company Dr Foster Intelligence, offer a snapshot of the number of consultant's on duty. They looked at doctors on duty at all NHS Trusts across England on Sunday June 17 last year at 11am. North Cumbria Hospitals have been put in special measures by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt after they were heavily criticised for inadequate staffing levels and an over-reliance on locum cover in a report by Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director for England. Analysts found that no consultants were on the rota to work at all at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Out of hours failings: Some NHS hospitals have as few as one consultant on duty per 100 patients (file photo) Although 10 out of 72 consultants were on call, just three of them were at the hospital at the time. At the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust there were just six consultants on duty out of a total pool of 161. There were 12 consultants on site at Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust where there are 830 beds. The total number employed by the trust is 189. In contrast, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust had 82 consultants on duty. A review of the emergency and urgent healthcare system found at least 4,400 lives a year are lost in England because hospital death rates are worse at weekends, largely as a result of a shortage of senior doctors. A different report by the General . Medical Council has named 14 NHS trusts that struggle to find sufficient . staff to run A&E departments at weekends. Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the GMC, told the Sunday Telegraph: . 'Emergency departments are under very significant pressure - with . limited resources, they are coping with huge demand, staff shortages and . heavy workload. 'Training the next generation of . senior doctors in this area is vital and we need to make sure they are . given the supervision and support to develop.' The GMC have 'significant concerns' about 16 hospitals. They included Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals Foundation Trust, North Cumnria University Hospitals Trust, Tameside Hospitals Foundation Trust, United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust and Buckinghamshire Healthcare Trust. A spokesman for NHS England said that they were working to provide better weekend care across the country. He said: 'The NHS Services, Seven Days A Week Forum was set up by NHS England earlier this year and is currently at a crucial stage in its work as it gathers evidence into how the NHS could move towards offering patients better, safer and high quality health care every day of the week. 'Five work streams established by the Forum are investigating the benefits of providing seven day services across the country, as well as collating information on the challenges that such a move would inevitably throw up. 'Finance and workforce issues are being examined very closely, as these are key to helping commissioners and providers work together to improve outcomes for patients at weekends. 'Other work streams are considering clinical standards, commissioning levers and future provider/service models. 'Some Trusts are already developing their own local solutions to problems caused by the five-day service model, with seven day services increasingly being recognised as part of a wider solution to improve efficiency.' A spokesman for North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust said they had additional consultant surgeons available on call. They added that they are working to improve out-of-hours care. Jeremy Rushmer, Interim Medical Director, said: 'Surgery in North Cumbria is run as an on-call service with consultant surgeons available in all sub-specialties 24/7 as opposed to a ""shift system"". 'This allows complete cover over a longer period of time with the limited consultant workforce available.'","Just four consultants on duty to look after 485 beds and two A&E departments at North Cumbria University Hospitals .

Anti-terror police in Kenya have accused the British of ignoring their warnings that Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was a dangerous radical. Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 on suspicion of leading a jihadist plot to cross the border into lawless Somalia and join the ranks of the Al Shabaab terrorist group. But the Kenyans claim that when they presented their evidence to the British Embassy, it was insisted Adebolajo had no criminal record. Scroll down for video . Michael Adebolajo in a Kenyan court in 2010 with five other men after he attempted to cross the border . Adebolajo (centre in black top) was sent back to Britain after claiming he had been tortured in Kenya . Sources in Kenya also claim the . British Embassy put them under pressure to release Adebolajo after he . complained he had been tortured, starved for two days and denied access . to a lawyer. And another Kenyan source yesterday claimed the British failed to help them build a case against Adebolajo. Adebolajo was detained for several days before being deported to the UK. It came as Adebolajo’s family claimed harassment by MI5 in the months before the attack may have ‘pushed him over the edge’. On his return to the UK from Kenya, . family members claim he was ‘pestered’ by MI5 agents who tried to . recruit him as an informant and infiltrate Islamic extremist groups. Adebolajo’s brother-in-law Abu Zuybyr . claimed the intelligence services put Adebolajo under pressure to spy on . Muslim clerics and become an informer. Mr Zuybyr, who is married to . Adebolajo’s sister Christiana, said: ‘That is what [Adebolajo’s] family . is saying: that the secret service pushed him over the edge.’ He said Adebolajo was ‘elated’ following the birth of his child, but ‘then things became a little strange’. The family of Adebolajo, pictured during a 2007 march in London, said he was harassed by MI5 in the months before the attack . Speaking to The Independent on Sunday, Mr Zuybyr said Adebolajo went to Nairobi in 2010 to study Arabic and Islam. Following his return to England, Mr Zuybyr said authorities repeatedly questioned family members about Adebolajo. His elder brother, Jeremiah, who had . gone to Saudi Arabia to teach English, was arrested and quizzed. And Mr . Zuybyr said he was questioned at gunpoint when he visited Yemen four . years ago to learn Arabic with his wife. He said: ‘When I came back to Britain, . MI5 contacted me and showed significant interest in Michael. I was . harassed for a while, with constant calls from people claiming to be . from the FBI.’ In Kenya, Adebolajo was seized with . five others after travelling by speedboat to an island off the coast . near Lamu Island, 68 miles from the Somali border. A married couple who owned a guest house where they had been staying and a worker were also arrested. The Kenyans believed Adebolajo, 28, . had played a crucial role in recruiting his co-accused, including two . secondary school-aged boys, after they were radicalised during weekly . visits to a mosque in Mombasa. It is believed the Kenyan cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo – who was killed by gunmen in Mombasa last year – had helped to fund the men. Adebolajo was eventually deported without charge but the Kenyans insist they warned the British that he was dangerous. Mombasa’s anti-terrorist police chief Elijah Rop said: ‘We advised the British police about the man but they ignored us. ‘That is the man we deported to the UK . in 2010 after discovering he is among Islamic radicals who were . recruited to train as Al Shabaab in Somalia three years ago.’ A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, . brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the . killing.

At the . time of Adebolajo’s arrest, the security services were aware of the risk . that radicalised British Muslims were heading to Somalia to join with . Al Shabaab, which has links to Al Qaeda. Only two months before, the then-head . of MI5 Jonathan Evans had warned Britons were training in Somalia and it . was ‘only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets . inspired by those who are today fighting alongside Al Shabaab’. It is now accepted that Al Qaeda cells in Mombasa were at their peak around 2010. Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive . ‘white widow’ of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay is still on the run over . her role in a suspected plot to bomb western hotels in the city. However the security forces appear to . have been relaxed that Adebolajo – who was travelling under the name of . Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo – may have been prepared to train and fight . with the brutal Al Shabaab. Kenyan government spokesman Muthui . Kariuki said: ‘We handed him to British security agents in Kenya and he . seems to have found his way to London and mutated to Michael Adebolajo. The Kenyan government cannot be held responsible for what happened to . him after we handed him to British authorities.’ Father Lee Rigby was killed in the attack on Woolwich last week . Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave .

Geologists believe a thick sheet of ice once covering Mars could explain the formation of a mysterious type of crater on its surface. The unusual double-layered ejecta craters (DLEs) are, like other craters, surrounded by debris. But unlike other craters, DLEs have two individual layers- a large outer layer with a smaller inner layer sitting on top. Scientists believe the mysterious double-layer ejecta craters could have formed from blasts on Mars' once icy surface. The unusual shape could have been created when ejected material slid down steep crater walls and across ice, creating a top layer. Grooves, common in landslides on Earth, radiate out from the crater rim . Geologists believe these craters were formed as a result of hundreds of blasts on the Martian surface once covered by a layer of ice tens of meters thick. By understanding how DLEs formed, they believe scientists can reconstruct the environmental conditions at the time of impact. The findings were made by Brown University graduate student David Kutai Weiss and James Head, the university’s professor of geological science. ‘Recent discoveries by planetary geoscientists at Brown and elsewhere have shown that the climate of Mars has varied in the past,’ said Professor Head. ‘During these times, ice from the polar caps is redistributed into the mid-latitudes of Mars as a layer about 50 meters thick, in the same place that we see that the DLEs have formed. ‘This made us think that this ice layer could be part of the explanation for the formation of the unusual DLE second layer’. The unusual craters appear at middle or high latitudes on Mars. These are areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on Mars millions of years ago . Double-layered ejecta craters or DLEs, like other craters, are surrounded by debris excavated by an impactor. There are currently over 600  known DLEs on the Martian surface . What makes DLEs different is that the debris forms two distinct layers- a large outer layer with a smaller inner layer sitting on top. These distinctive craters were first documented in data returned from the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s, and scientists have been trying ever since to figure out how the double-layer pattern forms. DLEs appear at middle or high latitudes-  areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on Mars millions of years ago. In this scenario, the impact blasts through the ice layer, spitting rock out onto the surrounding ice. Because that rock sits on slippery ice, it doesn't all stay put. Weiss and Head believe the layering occurs when material near the top of an upraised crater rim slides down the slippery ice and overtops material on the lower slopes. That landslide, enabled by steep slopes and a slick ice layer, creates the DLEs' two-layered appearance. ‘I think for the first time since DLEs were discovered in the 1970s we have a model for their formation that appears to be consistent with a very wide range of known data,’ Weiss said. The landslide theory explains the unusual grooves that radiate out from the crater rim of DLEs. Weiss has likened these grooves to the ones found in landslides on Earth, especially landslides on glaciers. The theory also explains why DLEs tend not to have secondary craters surrounding them. Secondary craters are the result of big chunks of ejecta blasted out of the main crater, leaving gouges in the surrounding surface when they land. The strange double-layered ejecta craters were first documented in data returned from the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s. Scientists have been trying ever since to figure out how the double-layer pattern forms . But if that surrounding surface was covered by ice, evidence of shallow secondary craters would vanish when the ice disappeared. DLEs appear at middle or high latitudes on Mars-  areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on Mars millions of years ago. The scenario also requires a steep slope on the outside of a crater rim. A raised rim is partly a function of crater size, with larger craters generally having less uplift. Weiss calculated that craters larger than about 25 kilometres probably wouldn't have steep enough rims to cause an icy landslide. With those results in hand, he surveyed about 600 known DLEs and found that nearly all of them are between one and 25 kilometres in diameter. ‘There are over 600 DLEs on the Martian surface, so reconciling how they formed with our knowledge of the climate of Mars is pretty important,’ Weiss said. ‘It could tell us a lot about the history of the Martian climate on a global scale.’","Geologists believe double-layered ejecta craters were formed as a result of hundreds of blasts on the once icy surface of Mars .

Two great penpals who have been writing to each other across the Atlantic for almost 70 years are to stage an emotional get-together next weekend. The incredible friendship of Briton Muriel Cowley and American Peggy Shafer spans seven decades, 3,500 miles and hundreds of handwritten letters. The two soulmates were 10-year-old schoolgirls when they started swapping tales about their schools, siblings and hobbies just weeks after D-Day as the Second World War raged. Muriel Crowley, 79, from Norfolk, left, and Peggy Shafer, also 79, from Pennsylvania, right, began writing when they were 10-year-old schoolgirls . Peggy's first letter to Muriel, sent on 30 August, 1944, with a picture of herself . Mrs Shafer, 79, who lives near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with her husband, Dave, wrote her first letter to Muriel, of Attleborough, Norfolk, on August 22, 1944. Thrilled Muriel wrote back weeks later - having turned 11 - to tell her new buddy that she was a proud Brownie and had a sister, a brother, a cat and a dog. And she told her how she loved art, needlework and reading best. Mrs Cowley, also 79, said: 'My neighbour was in the army and he was posted to America to help build defences against the Japanese. He got to know the people out there and one of the men had a teenage daughter, Hazel, and she asked my neighbour if he could find a penfriend. 'He wrote to his wife and she suggested my sister as they were closer in age. 'But Hazel had a friend, Peggy, and she wanted to write, too. Muriel at the age of 13, three years after the girls began writing, and right, aged 20 . Peggy, her husband David and daughter Debbie in 1956 . 'When I was 10 years old, I had a great family life. 'My father was in charge of refuelling the flying boats and it was a top priority job and I was very lucky that I didn't have someone in active service.' She added: 'Peggy and I wrote about school. 'I just used to love writing. 'We couldn't do much in those days because of the blackouts.' Muriel also wrote about the tough sweet ration in the war-battered UK and how pleased she was that it was being introduced as it meant everyone was able to have some. The two girls soon found out that they had a lot in common and formed an amazingly strong friendship and bond that has lasted a lifetime. 'We were both born in the same month of the same year. Muriel with some of their magical correspondence down the decades - she has kept all Peggy's letters and photos . 'We had the same initials - Muriel Herman and Margaret Hicks - and we both had a brother and a sister,' said Muriel. 'We both married naval personnel whose fathers had both died when they were tiny and were brought up by stepdads.' The two friends married a year and a day apart and their daughters were born within months of each other, followed by their sons. Unbeknown to each other, they have also separately booked cruises to the Norwegian fjords to celebrate their 80th birthdays in September. Muriel, who moved to Norfolk from Dorset in 1995, said: 'In the 40s it took time for things to get over to the States. The two, Muriel, left, and Peggy, right, met in 1994 in Norwich to celebrate 50 years of friendship. 'We are still very close,' says Mrs Cowley . 'It wouldn't have been taken over by aircraft, it was by boat. 'I remember the first present she sent me - it was a bandana. 'I loved it and I wore it everywhere.' The pair first met in 1974 - 30 years after they struck up their astonishing rapport - when Muriel flew out to America. 'It was incredible,' she said. 'She carried a rose for recognition but she didn't need it. 'It was like meeting family, we were made to feel so welcome. 'I had to make a little dictionary for myself for the different words. 'A faucet is a tap, drapes are blinds and a trunk is the boot of a car.' The two have shared dozens of photos amid their correspondence so each knows each other's family history inside out. Here Peggy is photographed with husband David Shafer and their family . Muriel and Peggy last met on a shopping trip to New York in 2004. The two great friends have supported each other through difficult times, including the loss of Muriel's son, Robert, who sadly died four years ago. 'Peggy is my oldest friend and we really have grown up together. 'We are still very close,' said Mrs Cowley. The silver-surfing grandmothers have both embraced the supersonic cyber age and they now email each other across the Atlantic. To celebrate their 69 years of extraordinary friendship, Peggy and her husband Dave are visiting Muriel for an extra-special high tea, which is being organised by her daughter, Elizabeth Cowley-Gwilliams. They will enjoy champagne, cakes and sandwiches in Ms Cowley-Gwilliams's garden in Banham, Norfolk. Some of their early letters and photos will be on display for family and friends to see.

Google Inc co-founder Sergey Brin has separated from his wife of six years, and now the 40-year-old Silicon Valley mogul is reportedly dating a younger employee. Brin and Anne Wojcicki, who married in 2007, have been living apart for several months, the couple's spokesperson said last night. 'They remain good friends and partners,' the spokesperson added. The woman said to be seeing Brin has been named in reports as Amanda Rosenberg, a 26-year-old Google Glass marketing manager. There is no suggestion that the couple were dating before Brin separated from his wife. Split: Mr Brin, who is worth a staggering $23 billion, has separated from his wife of six years, Anne Wojcicki, left . Romance: Amanda Rosenberg, pictured in Google Glass (left), is reportedly dating Sergey Brin . The 26-year-old, who describes herself . as Asian but moved to the UK, has played a key role in the development . of Google Glass and came up with the product's buzz phrase 'OK glass'. She joined Google as an account manager in June 2008 before becoming mobile business development manager EMEA two years later. Wojcicki, 40, is the chief executive of a biotech firm that Google has invested millions of dollars in and whose sister is one of the Internet search company's top executives. The technology blog AllThingsD on Wednesday was the first to report of the couple's split and Valleywag named Rosenberg. Brin and Wojcicki, who have two children and who have a prenuptial agreement, are not yet legally separated, the report said. Susan Wojcicki, Anne's sister, is senior vice president of Ads and Commerce for Google and is considered one of the Internet company's top executives. Power couple: If Brin and Wojcicki, his wife of six years, divorce, Californian law suggests their massive fortune would have to be halved - although they reportedly signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement . The relationship between Google and . the Wojcickis dates back to the company's earliest days: in 1998, the . nascent search company set up shop in Susan Wojcicki's garage shortly . after raising its first funding. Google . has invested roughly $10million in 23andMe, the company that Miss . Wojcicki co-founded in 2006 and which sells DNA testing kits and . provides clients with information about their ancestry and medical . conditions. Forbes said that Mr Brin is currently worth $22.8billion and holds more than $20billion worth of Google shares. Since Larry Page took over as CEO of Google, Brin has been spending most of his time at Google’s research lab, Google X, which has been developing ambitious ‘moon shot’ projects like the Glass and a self-driving car. Interconnected: Google has invested $10million in 23andMe, the company that Miss Wojcicki (right) co-founded in 2006 and which sells DNA testing kits . New technology: Brin pictured wearing Google Glass at a conference earlier this year . Brin and Wojcicki have gained a . reputation as a philanthropic power couple, donating tens of millions of . dollars to a variety of charitable organizations. In 2012 alone, the couple gave away $223million, Los Angeles Times . reported, earning them the distinction of being the fifth biggest . donors to U.S. charities, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Much of the funds went to their own charity, The Brin Wojcicki Foundation, which promotes human rights and anti-poverty programs. San Jose Mercury reported that they have also given tens of millions of dollars to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, and the couple co-founded a new organization along with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, which awards $15million prizes to life scientists. According to reports, Brin has been linked to Google Glass Marketing Manager Ms Rosenberg. Romantic link: Hugo Barra, Google's product management drector for Android, introduces the Nexus 7 last year . Ms Rosenberg was appointed marketing manager in January 2012 moving from London to work at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and within seven months was assigned to heading up marketing for the Google Glass. In her blog, she charts her first thoughts at starting work in the U.S. She said: 'Hello new boss, hello new team... LIKE ME IMMEDIATELY.' She explained the origins of the product's key phrase 'OK glass' on her Google Plus account earlier this year. The idea came about while she dined with Glass project manager Mat Balez. When he told her that a phrase that transcended different cultures was needed to activate the Glass menu and let the device know that the wearer wants to use it, she came up with the phrase. Employee: Miss Rosenberg pictured in a YouTube marketing video for Google Glass. She won her role promoting the controversial spectacles after coming up with the voice command ¿Ok, Glass¿ to activate them . Not only did she consider it to be suitable for a global product, it was also decided that it was subtle enough not to embarrass the user in public. According to her post, the phrases 'go go Glass' and 'Glass alive' and even 'pew pew pew' were said to have been considered before her idea. Reports of the romance come as another Google high-flyer, with whom she has been romantically linked, Hugo Barra, quit the company to work for a Chinese smart phone firm. Mr Barra, vice president of Android product management, presided over the much-trumpeted launch of Google's Nexus tablet. He announced his departure for Chinese company Xioami on his Google Plus account after five years at the firm. He said he had 'decided to start a new career chapter'. In the post, Mr Barra also said that his colleagues at Google are 'the most amazing group of people I've ever worked with in my life.'","Brin and his wife, Anne Wojcicki, both 40, married in 2007 and have two children .

Tom Clarke’s 87th-minute winner for Preston against bitter rivals Blackpool sparked ugly scenes which ended with a steward being trampled by two police horses and taken to hospital. The Lancashire derby atmosphere boiled over when hundreds of home supporters flooded the Deepdale pitch at the final whistle. Simon Grayson’s side had booked their place into the Capital One Cup second round, but the significance of beating Blackpool in the first meeting for over three years became too much for some. A Preston spokesman said: ‘A steward was injured by a police horse. He suffered damage to his shoulder and has gone for an X-ray.’ Ugly scenes: A steward was trampled by a police horse as Preston fans invaded the pitch . Shock: The steward looks on in disbelief . Treatment: The steward was taken to hospital for a shoulder X-ray . Match commander Chief Inspector Nick . Emmett said: 'The behaviour of those involved in . the disorder and the behaviour of some people towards officers and . stewards was absolutely disgraceful. 'This . was a very difficult situation which presented significant challenges . for both the club and for ourselves and we were able to bring the . situation under control quickly. The disorder last night was completely . unacceptable and we will be making significant efforts to locate and . prosecute those involved. Blackpool manager Paul Ince was apoplectic afterwards and feared for the safety of his players. ‘It’s an absolute joke,’ he fumed. ‘Who knows what could happen? It’s going to take someone to get stabbed or something else to happen before we’re going to listen. ‘I wonder if there are enough stewards there. You see enough situations in football where fans are hitting a player. We sit down at these management meetings and talk about these respect campaigns, but what about getting enough stewards to control people?

It’s not . just Preston – it’s football in general. ‘We need to knuckle down because you can’t have fans running on the pitch. I don’t care whether they win, lose or draw.’ Fans fell over advertising hoardings in their insistence to get as close to the Bill Shankly Kop as possible. Police tried to act swiftly to diffuse the situation with horses employed to disperse the crowd, but in turn flattened a steward on what was a sad night for English football. One away supporter managed to confront the hundreds before him on the pitch and while Grayson was more laid back about the incident than his opposite number, Preston though are worried that they will now face serious FA ramifications. ‘Hopefully it was only supporters being boisterous and there’s nothing too intense or any damage to anybody,’ the manager said. ‘I’m not saying I’m pleased they did it. I hope not too many people were seriously injured Hopefully in the next few days everybody settles down.’ An FA spokesman said: 'We are aware of this and will be looking into what happened, including liaising with both clubs and the police to get a full picture of events and what preparations were in place.' Trouble had been rumbling on throughout the day. A number of Blackpool fans didn’t even make it to the match and were escorted back to the seaside town by train. Inside the ground, pipes were ripped out of the away end’s toilets. Jubilant: Clarke celebrates in front of a delighted Deepdale crowd . Late winner: Tom Clarke's header gave Preston North End a 1-0 win . A car had been set ablaze in the city centre earlier in the afternoon, although that hasn’t officially been labelled a football matter. The football itself was drab. Preston manager Grayson was facing his old employers for the first time since moving over to Deepdale but neither he nor Ince could inspire much creative spark and there was a lack of clear-cut opportunities. There were plenty of gutsy displays and a heap of endeavour but the dearth of quality indicated two sides still rusty and too keen on not making mistakes. There remained an edge to proceedings all evening and the lid almost flew off when Clarke’s thumping downward header from Lee Holmes’ free-kick put Preston through. Breaking free: Tom Ince bursts past the Preston defence in the first half . Strong tackle: Tom Clarke wins the ball cleanly from Blackpool's Jack Robinson . Grayson added: ‘It shows everybody what it means to this club. We played well tonight - kept our shape and worked hard. ‘They’ve got good players and we knew we couldn’t be gung-ho and go chasing the game. We could have got done on the counter attack.’ Ince called the defeat ‘daylight robbery’ but his son, Tom, was the only one to threaten for the visitors. But even he wasted a clutch of chances – while the hosts were largely restricted to efforts from distance until Iain Hume’s turn and shot forced Matt Gilks into a decent save. Angel Martinez, Michael Chopra and Gary MacKenzie all went close for Blackpool after the break but Clarke proved the difference before the shameful scenes afterwards.

"My Five Wives follows the Williams family in Salt Lake City, Utah . By . Catherine Townsend . PUBLISHED: . 10:26 EST, 29 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:12 EST, 29 August 2013 . Following the success of Sister Wives, TLC has announced that it will produce a new one-hour special about an even larger polygamous family who left the Mormon church due to its conservative beliefs. My Five Wives will follow Brady Williams, his five wives and their combined 24 children who live together on their large family property outside Salt Lake City, Utah. The show will go behind closed doors and focus on the frustrations, needs and fears of a family living the controversial lifestyle, according to a TLC press release. Progressive polygamy: Patriarch Brady (center) and his five wives . Nonie (far left), Robyn (near left), Paulie (near right) and Rhonda (far right) left the Mormon church due to its conservative beliefs . The Williams family emphasizes that their focus is on love and commitment rather than religion, and they believe in a God who loves and accepts everyone. Though their beliefs have estranged from many family members, the members of the Williams family believe that their sacrifices are worth it. Patriarch Brady Williams,a construction site manager, was born into the Mormon Church. But he did not hear about polygamy until age 16, when his parents converted to a faith that embraced the lifestyle. First wife Paulie, a dental hygienist, has been married to Brady for 21 years, and the couple's six children range in age from 20 to nine years old. She was raised in a polygamist family and expected Brady to have additional wives, but her oldest daughter is recently married and plans a monogamist lifestyle. Brady married second wife Robyn - dubbed 'the creative wife' for her art classes and love of making gifts for the family - about nine months after his ceremony to Paulie, and they have five children. Sister Wives: Kody Brown (center), his wives Meri (far left), Robyn (near left), Christine (near right) and Janelle (far right) and their 17 children introduced many Americans to the polygamous lifestyle . Third wife Rosemary worked in the family construction business but stopped after winning a scholarship at the local college, where she is studying for her teaching degree in music. She has four children with Brady. Nonie, Brady's fourth wife, was living in Montana when she met him 15 year ago, and the duo had a long-distance relationship. She is the only wife that works with Brady, handling the administrative side of the family's construction business, while being a mom to their five children. Fifth wife Rhonda is Robyn's cousin. She entered the picture 12 years ago, admits that it took eight years before she really felt that she belonged in the family. Though she says that there are downsides to polygamy, she loves that her four children have other mothers around. Cameras will reportedly be allowed into the bedroom, and the women will speak openly about their frustrations with Brady's schedule. The show premieres on September 15, right after Sister Wives - the reality show that first brought polygamy into many Americans' living rooms. Kody Brown, his four wives Meri, Christine, Janelle and Robyn and their 17 children have faced many challenges as a super-sized family living an alternative lifestyle .","My Five Wives follows the Williams family in Salt Lake City, Utah .

Before Lauren Silverman joined Miami Country Day School's 'mean girl clique' with Brooke Mueller, Simon Cowell's pregnant lover was an awkward preteen. With braces, frizzy hair and an unfortunate penchant for scrunchies, Silverman's fifth grade school photo is a far cry from the glamorous socialite we've seen frolicking around the Hamptons. Awkward: Lauren Silverman (Davis) in her fifth grade photo at Miami Country Day School, Florida . The photographic blast from the past comes after revelations Silverman is set to get a share of the multi-million dollar . pre-nup she signed before marrying Andrew Silverman - despite breaking a . cheating clause. The 36-year-old . socialite, who is expecting Cowell's child, has held . 'productive conversations' with her estranged husband as they continue . to thrash out their divorce agreement. And . the couple - who spent the weekend locked in talks at their rental home . in the Hamptons - are also working on plans to share custody of their . seven-year-old son Adam. Today, a source told MailOnline: 'There have been productive conversations over the weekend. 'Lauren and Andrew are intent on resolving this - and Simon also wants it resolved.' Far away: Lauren Silverman leaves lunch at Ambroeus restaurant in Southampton, New York, today while her lover Simon Cowell is thousands of miles away in Europe. He is keen that she settles her divorce soon . Sombre: Lauren Silverman showed off her figure in a clingy striped sundress as she enjoyed lunch with a friend in Southampton - however, she failed to raise a smile . As MailOnline revealed, the X Factor . supremo, 53, jetted out of Los Angeles on Friday, watching his band One . Direction in concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night before heading to . Europe, where he will spend the month on board the Slipstream yacht, . touring St Tropez. He . is believed to want to give his lover space in order to work out her . divorce case. If the case is settled somewhat amicably, then it will . avoid an ugly court battle, in which Cowell could be dragged into - and . any embarrassing secrets exposed. The . New York Post reported that Lauren waited until her 10th wedding . anniversary to break the news of her affair with Cowell to her husband . so the terms of her pre-nup would kick in. And . a source again insisted today that Lauren tried to 'max out her return . by stringing things along past the 10 year mark to increase what she . would be eligible to receive.

Lauren today appeared outside the Bridgehampton home where she is staying with her husband and son. The striking brunette, wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap, smiled as her son was picked up for summer camp. She then headed to lunch with a friend in nearby Southampton, where she had donned a clingy striped sun dress, with a black bikini top underneath. Lauren is now being represented by Bernard Clair - named as one of '10 lawyers you don't want representing your spouse in a divorce' - by Business Insider. Mr Clair famously represented socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein in her divorce from Alec Nathan Wildensteain, New York designer Carolyn Roehm, and Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher. Thrashing it out: Lauren is said to be trying to reach an amicable agreement with estranged husband Andrew over their divorce . While Andrew Silverman is being represented Jeffrey Cohen of Cohen Goldstein Silpe. As previously revealed, his parents Eleanora and Allen refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in Manhattan’s Midtown. According to a friend, the Silvermans 'did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about Lauren and the relationship.' Lauren did her utmost to take her mind off her situation over . the weekend, as she headed out for a spot of retail therapy. She wore a fitted yellow minidress as she was joined by her sister . and son Adam as the group browsed the local shops in Bridgehampton, New . York. Lauren's outing . came as Cowell headed to St Tropez, where he is expected to spend the . next month alongside ex-girlfriends including Sinitta. Cowell will . tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it . was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren - married to his . friend Andrew - is expecting his baby. Ironically, . it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured . sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came . to light last week. Despite the St Tropez trip, Cowell is also expected to fly to . Britain within the next few days to meet up with his 87-year-old mother Julie and brother . Nick to discuss the pregnancy and his plans for the future. Prior to heading to St Tropez, Cowell . was seen taking his mind off the drama in his personal life by . attending a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night. He was spotted mingling . with fans, standing alongside a male friend, as he stood in the audience . and watched his X Factor stars perform in the city - while his lover stayed on the East Coast.

Lauren's accusations that her husband . messed around, partying with girls all over the world, is only adding . fuel to their bitter custody battle over son Adam. Andrew's friend said that it sounds like a 'desperate attempt to smear him.' The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along. They . said Lauren was 'outraged' that when he feigned shock at pictures of . the Hamptons socialite kissing Simon on a yacht last year. The . website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew . 'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.'

Lauren's pregnancy is still in early days, Cowell is said to be . concerned about the strain the situation and publicity could put on the . socialite.

"By . Laura Collins In Billings, Montana and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 29 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:10 EST, 29 August 2013 . The mother of Cherice Moralez has rejected the apology of the Montana judge who sentenced her rapist teacher to 30 days in jail - saying he's 'only covering his butt.' Auliea Hanlon said District Judge Todd Baugh’s apology was 'irrelevant' because he has stood by the sentence given to rapist and former teacher Stacey Rambold, even though Cherice was only 14 when he had sex with her. Some 400 protestors turned out in front of the Yellowstone County courthouse on Thursday afternoon and demanded that Judge Baugh resign, that Rambold's sentence be reviewed and that the judge's past cases be looked over for similar outrageous rulings. Controversy: Judge Todd Baugh (left) has apologized for his comments about Cherice Moralez (right), but that has not satisfied protestors . 'Covering his butt': Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's mother criticized the judge's apology as 'meaningless' because the 30 day sentence for her daughter's rapist teacher still stood . Outrage: About 400 protestors showed up to demand that Judge Todd Baugh resign after making offensive statements about a teenage rape victim who killed herself . They were furious about both her sentence and the words the judge used when handing it down on Monday. After reviewing police interviews with Cherice, he said, he was convince that she was 'as much in control' of the sexual relationship as the teacher - despite being 35 years older than the student. He also said that the crime was mitigated by the fact that the girl was 'older than her chronological age.' On Wednesday, the 66-year-old judge apologized for his words - but not his actions. He stood by sending Rambold to jail for a month - despite allegations that he used his position at Billings Senior High School to groom troubled Cherice for sex in 2008. While the case was still pending, she killed herself. Ms Hanlon says Rambold's sexual relationship with her daughter was a 'major factor' in the suicide. Prosecutors carried signs like 'Justice for Cherice' and '14 is 14.' Another poster said simply 'Stop. You're Embarrassing Us.' Organizer Sheena Rice told the Billings Gazette that Judge Baugh's decision is not an isolated incident. Protestors said the judge's words are part of a bigger problem of victim blaming in rape cases . 'Bad form': Judge Baugh is running for reelection next year. Protestors vowed to ensure he doesn't receive a fifth term . 'Resign!' Angry community members called for the judge to step down - though he has shown no sign of doing so . 'It really points to a larger problem of victim blaming in rape cases across the country,' she said. 'To see it happen in Billings, it's time we as a community take a stand against victim blaming.' The judge at the center of a firestorm for handing a 30-day sentence to a teacher who repeatedly raped a 14-year-old who went onto kill herself had a history of controversial decisions. MailOnline can reveal today that Judge G Todd Baugh's latest decision is to be reviewed, as protesters take to the streets of the Montana . town outraged at the short sentence and the judge's criticism of the innocent victim. In Billings District Court, Yellowstone, the judge implied that Stacey Rambold's victim, Cherice Moralez, was ‘in control of the situation’ and outraged her anguished mother, Auliea Hanlon, with his view that Cherice was ‘older than her chronological years.’ Teacher: Rambold, 54, lost his house, his job, his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges. His lawyer suggested, and the judge seemed to agree on Monday, that he had been 'punished enough' Now, Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito has said that his office is seeking legal cause to appeal the sentence in which Rambold, who plead guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent, saw all but 30 days of a 15 year term suspended. Cherry, who was 14 when Rambold had a sexual relationship with her in 2008, committed suicide in 2010, as the case made its way through the courts. Speaking to the Billings Gazette County Attorney Scott Twito expressed his frustration and admitted: ‘I can’t instantly appeal this. ‘I have no legal authority in Montana whatsoever to appeal a sentence because I disagree with the sentence handed down by the judge.’ But he said: ‘We will review this matter, as we do all matters, as the judgement is prepared.’ Mr Twito’s office has received what he described as ‘hate emails’  following reports that his office would not review the Rambold sentence for a possible appeal. District Judge Baugh, who has defended his decision, is currently writing an addendum to the court file explaining his reasons for the sentence. Meanwhile School District Superintendent Terry Bouck has issued a statement saying that he disagrees with the sentence imposed. Horror: Cherice Moralez, pictured, shot herself dead in her mother's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail . Anguish: Cherry's mother spoke about how the teen was stunned and bullied after her attacker was charged . Noting that the school district’s involvement with the case ‘ended several years ago,' with the payment of a $91,000 wrongful death settlement to Cherice Moralez’s mother, Auliea Hanlon, Mr Bouck said: ‘What Mr Rambold did when he was a teacher was repugnant and inexcusable. ‘While I respect the court system, I disagree with the sentence, and I believe Mr Rambold deserves to spend more time in jail than 30 days.’ The news comes as ABC 7 reports the state's Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education criticized District Judge Baugh for last month dismissing what would have been a woman's 13th conviction for driving under the influence. The judge reportedly handed her a three-year suspended sentence for felony criminal endangerment, but the commissioner of higher education said the 'most shocking' thing about the case was the judge's comments to the women: 'If you drink and drive and kill someone, you will spend some real time in prison.' However District Judge Baugh has previously imposed tough rape sentences, including ordering a 26-year-old man who raped an 11-year-old boy to serve 100 years in prison. District Judge Baugh has reportedly served as a judge in Yellowstone County since 1984. He was an attorney in Billings and served as a U.S. magistrate before running for district court judge, according to ABC 7.","Cherice Moralez, 14 at the time, was bullied by classmates after charges were brought against her Montana teacher Stacey Rambold, 48 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:46 EST, 2 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:46 EST, 2 August 2013 . An American diplomat has been accused of causing a crash that killed a father of three after he allegedly sped through Kenya and hit a minibus. Joshua Walde, who worked at the embassy in Nairobi, was flown out of Kenya with his family the following day, leaving the victims of the crash, and the pregnant widow of the man who died, with no financial assistance. Latifah Naiman Mariki, whose fourth baby in due in three months, faced being evicted from her house this week after her landlord demanded rent. Her husband, Haji Lukindo, had been the family's only source of income. Widowed: Latifah Naiman Mariki, whose husband was killed in the crash, says she will struggle to raise their children . The 38-year-old said neither Mr Walde or the U.S. Embassy had contacted her and she does not know how she will provide for her new baby and other children, who are aged 20, 10 and 7. 'It is difficult for me to handle this matter because my kids need to go to school. They need everything, basic needs,' she said. 'We have no place to stay because we have to pay the rent. We have no money. ... Even if my kids are sick I have no money to take them to hospital.' State Department spokesman Hilary . Renner said the embassy extended its condolences to Ms Mariki's family . and wished a speedy recovery to those injured. She said she could not comment on whether Mr Walde would return to Kenya. Victim: Bus driver Haji Lukindo was killed when the diplomat's SUV hit his vehicle . 'The embassy is fully cooperating with the Kenyan authorities as they investigate the accident and work to aid the victims,' Ms Renner said from Washington. Mr Walde, an information management officer at the Nairobi embassy, crashed his SUV as he drove home on July 11. He gave a statement to police but, because he has diplomatic immunity, he was not detained. Nine passengers in the bus were injured and three were reported to still be in hospital after breaking limbs. A police dossier on the case, shown briefly to the Associated Press, contained sketches of how police believe the accident happened. The sketch shows Mr Walde's SUV turning at a four-way intersection on the edge of Nairobi and driving into the lane of oncoming traffic. A police officer familiar with the case, who asked not to be named because he was not an official spokesman, said: '[Walde] was driving very fast'. Pictures in the dossier showed that the SUV hit the front corner and side of the mini-bus, which crushed its frame. Kenyan mini-buses, known as matatus, are frequently driven fast and erratically. Ms Mariki told the Mwakilishi newspaper: 'I waited for him to arrive but he never came home. I called his phone several times but there was no answer. It was unlike him not to come home.' She said a colleague of her husband helped search for him and, after visiting several police stations, they discovered that he had been killed in a crash. A Facebook group of Kenyan mothers is trying to raise money for Ms Mariki online. In dozens of comments on the page, AP said many demanded accountability and expressed dismay that no financial help has been given. 'She's such a decent and honest lady . you feel so bad for her. She wasn't employed,' Zahra Ashif, who started . the Facebook thread, said. 'The . point is that [Walde] is not here so he can't be arrested, but after . that point did he not have any courtesy to get in touch? For them life . has gone on, but what about these kids?' Crash victim Mr Lukindo had been . employed as a driver for the past seven years. His boss, Farzana Jiwa, . donated money to help pay for Mr Lukindo's funeral and to help pay his . family's rent for August. He said he was angry that neither Mr Walde nor the U.S. Embassy was helping the victims. 'I'm . not asking him to go to jail, but do right by the family, it's so . simple. Insurance would have taken care of it,' Mr Jiwa said. 'They . couldn't jail him, they couldn't take his passport from him. All we want . is for him to take some responsibly.' Mr Walde has worked for the State Department for 11 years, which has included postings in Kazakhstan, Uruguay and Croatia. Struggle: The victim's pregnant wife says she cannot afford her rent in this Nairobi slum because the family survived on her husband's wages . Shortly after the crash, he updated his work history on the networking site LinkedIn to put his time in Nairobi in the past tense, from July 2012 to July 2013. After the Facebook group noticed the updated resume and pointed to that as evidence that Mr Walde would not return to face charges or help victims, the LinkedIn account was deleted, though a cached version is still available through Google, according to AP. Mr Walde's wife was reported to have circulated an email trying to sell a family vehicle and find new work for the family's nanny and gardener after the crash. When AP approached her for comment on Thursday no response was sent. Ms Mariki, the widow, lives in a . $125-a-month sheet-metal home in one of Nairobi's slums. It has no . running water and the tiny alleyways turn into a swampy pit when it . rains. She needs to . find $500 a year to send her two school-age children to class but she . said she did not know how she will afford it. Ms Mariki said she wanted Mr Walde to be prosecuted in court, adding: 'What I want is justice to be done.' Kenyan police spokesman, Ziporah Mboroki said no charges had yet been filed against Mr Walde. 'He . is a diplomat and has the privileges of a diplomat. If you're a . diplomat and you commit any crime in Kenya, the case is investigated and . is forwarded to your embassy,' she said. 'That's what the law says and . we work per the law.' Nairobi traffic police chief, Patrick Lumumba, said he was seeking assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to liaise with the U.S. Embassy. He added that authorities did not detain Mr Walde because 'we don't take diplomats into custody'. However, he told Mwakilishi that police have written to Attorney-General Githu Muigai and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for help in having Mr Walde brought back to the country to face charges. Justice: Latifah Mariki wants the U.S. diplomat to be returned to Nairobi and charged . A State Department guidance paper for . U.S. law enforcement officials on how diplomatic immunity works states . that even at the highest levels 'diplomatic immunity is not intended to . serve as a license for persons to flout the law and purposely avoid . liability for their actions'. It . added: 'The purpose of these privileges and immunities is not to . benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient and effective . performance of their official missions on behalf of their governments. There is concern about the impact the accident could have on U.S.-Kenya relations, a U.S. government official said. The . official noted that embassy employees are typically removed from a . posting for medical evaluations after traumatic events, but added that . they can also be flown out of a country to avoid any possible . retribution or attacks from others involved in an accident.","Information officer crashed into bus, killing driver and injuring nine others .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 17:26 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:23 EST, 13 June 2013 . Trials of 80mph motorway speed limits could start next year, the road safety minister said yesterday. Stephen Hammond said raising the limit to 80mph is still firmly on the Government’s agenda. There will be three trials of the higher speeds in different areas, and if successful they will be introduced across the country. The higher 80mph speed limit could be trialled at three sites across the country as early as next year . Speaking in a magazine interview Mr Hammond said: ‘It is not dead. We are thinking about it. We are thinking about how we could trial it rather than go to a consultation. ‘It would be important to have a good evidence-based trial.’ He said there will be an announcement in the autumn on the prospect of an increase and that trials could take place during 2014. He told Auto Express magazine: ‘You probably will not see it happen before the summer of next year. It might need a whole year to put the whole regulatory format in place. ‘My message, though, is that it [80mph] has not been lost. Our philosophy is that we should have the right speed on the right road.’ He added: ‘Drivers will have noticed that we have made some significant changes to guidelines to local authorities about lower speeds in rural areas. ‘We have also made it easier to introduce 20mph limits and zones.’ Supporters of the idea argue that motorways are the safest of all roads and that cars become safer at speed. Road safety minister Stephen Hammond (left) said 80mph speed limits are still on the Government's agenda but Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) is said to be 'cooler' on the issue . The move towards an 80mph limit has . fallen down the Department for Transport’s list of priorities under . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who is said to be ‘cooler’ on . the issue. By contrast, former transport secretary Philip Hammond was a major supporter, arguing that raising the limit could ‘provide hundreds of millions of pounds for the economy’, generated by lowering journey times. Road safety charity Brake opposes the plans, arguing an 80mph limit is likely to ‘lead to more deaths, crashes and serious injuries’. But AA president Edmund King said: ‘Our view is that 80mph in a modern car, in good weather, driven at a safe distance from the car in front is a safe speed. ‘Whereas 50mph in bad weather, tailgating the car in front is a very dangerous speed.’ Auto Express editor in chief Steve Fowler said: ‘My personal view is we don’t need an increase to 80mph. ‘Everyone knows people drive faster than 70mph on motorways. 'If the limit were to increase to 80mph, people would drive at 90mph.’ Mr Hammond said the Government has made it easier to introduce 20mph limits and zones . Supporters of raising the speed limit point out that when the current 70mph limit was introduced in 1964, it was set at the flat-out speed of most cars which were pretty basic compared with today’s. Last February Labour announced that, subject to safeguards, it was dropping its opposition to raising the limit and supported a switch to ‘variable’ limits of up to 80mph as a ‘safer alternative’ to blanket rises. A recent Road Safety Foundation report found motorways do not currently provide enough protection to drivers and car occupants to justify raising the speed limit. It notes England’s motorways account for 6 per cent of road deaths. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘If the limit is raised then there is likely to be an increase in carbon emissions and deaths. ‘The big question is at what speed the police will enforce a new limit. Will 80mph actually mean 90mph? 'The irony is that free flow speeds on motorways have actually fallen in recent years, so you have to question the public appetite for a change.’","Stephen Hammond said an announcement will be made in the autumn .

Experts have found that dramatic surgery carried out on young epilepsy sufferers to remove half of their brain can give children the best chance at living a life free from seizures. The rare and dramatic surgery, known as a hemispherectomy, involves surgeons removing, or disconnecting, one half of the brain and a new study has found that the procedure can prevent the seizures. Scientists reviewed the medical records of patients living with epilepsy and found that after the surgery 56 per cent were left seizure-free. Medical marvel: Experts have found that dramatic surgery, known as a hemispherectomy, can give children the best chance at living a life free from seizures (picture posed by models) Of the 115 patients involved in the study another 36 per cent still had seizures but around 15 per cent of them saw a reduction in their frequency of more than 90 per cent. The study, published in specialist medical journal Epilepsia reviewed the records of patients aged two to 28, most of them children, who had developed epilepsy before the age of three. Three-quarters of those monitored had daily seizures, while 18 per cent had seizures every week prior to the surgery. All of those involved in the study had been treated at the specialist unit of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Head of pediatric epilepsy at the clinic, Dr Ajay Gupta, and his colleagues looked at 186 operations performed at the medical centre between 1997 and 2009, with a particular focus on the 155 patients, as part of the first extensive study to look at the children who have undergone a hemispherectomy. The researchers were able to confirm what many doctors had already known, despite the fact that there was little data to support the idea that removing the diseased part . of a seizure-prone brain can allow those affected by epilepsy to lead a more normal life. 'The brain has an amazing capacity to work around the function that it has lost,' Dr Gupta told NBC News. Recovery: Researchers found that nearly 60 percent of the children were able to attend mainstream schools with assistance after their operations (posed by model) Only a small number of people with epilepsy are eligable for a hemispherectomy, which involves surgeons either removing half of the brain entirely, disconnecting . the links between the half in which the seizures were originating from the other side. Dr Gupta said that doctors at his clinic performed around 15 of the operations every year, and that they were often carried out when anti-seizure medication stops working effectively. One of the children featured in the study was three-year-old Aiden Gallagher, from Attica, Ohio, who was having more than 12 seizures a day before his operation, after he was diagnosed at just 10-months-old. His father Pete said the effects the seizures were having on his little son were such that the child had forgotten his alphabet and how to count. When Aiden turned three his medications stopped working and he started seizing almost constantly, making surgery the only option. However, since having the operation to remove almost all of the right side of his brain Aiden has not had a single seizure, and is a healthy child who loves playing baseball and basketball. 'I didn’t think the recovery would be anywhere near the point that it is,' Mr Gallagher said. The researchers discovered that after their operations, 83 per cent of patients were able to walk without aid, and 70 per cent had . satisfactory speaking skills. Nearly 60 percent of the children were able to attend mainstream schools with assistance, and 42 percent of . children older than six had satisfactory reading skills. 'Given that if you had not done the intervention most of these kids would be so severely disabled, the results are actually pretty positive,' said Dr Gary Mathern, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.","Rare and dramatic surgery known as a  hemispherectomy .

Lilly Rogerson would have celebrated her second birthday last week, but instead her grieving mother Samantha Pogson, 27, is mounting a legal case for medical negligence. Ms Pogson is angry that Lilly was sent home from Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, West Yorkshire, in April after developing croup. Samantha Pogson, 27, is suing Huddersfield Royal Infirmary after her daughter, Lilly Rogerson, was sent home to die of croup by the hospital's A&E department . Hours later, Lilly stopped breathing at home as her mother called 999 and desperately tried to resuscitate her. Ms Pogson, of Rastrick, said: ‘Lilly was let down by the system. She was so ill she should have been kept in for observation but she was given steroids and sent home after 20 minutes. ‘I’m still numb and can’t believe this has happened. It has left a hole in my life.’ Lilly was born at Calderdale Royal Hospital on August 22, 2011, weighing a healthy 9lb 7oz. She never suffered any respiratory problems until she caught a cold in March 2013, which went to her chest. ‘She’d been unwell and had been to the GPs who said to give her plenty of fluids and paracetamol,’ recalls Ms Pogson, whose partner is Lilly’s father, 30-year-old Chris Rogerson. Lilly, one, was taken to the hospital suffering from wheezing and unresponsiveness. She was given steroids but was released 20 minutes later. That night she stopped breathing and suffered brain damage . ‘On Good Friday, she was worse and on the Saturday morning her chest sounded shocking. She was wheezing, her eyes were rolling and she felt floppy. She needed help.’ Ms Pogson’s mother and sister took Lilly to A&E as Ms Pogson stayed with her two other children Tamzin, nine, and seven-year-old Mcauley, who were also unwell. Her sister, Leanna Plunkett, said: ‘We were seen straightaway and were only there an hour and 10 minutes. She was examined and they said it looked like croup. Ms Pogson believes that Lilly might have survived if she had been kept in hospital . ‘The doctor gave me a syringe with . steroids in it which I gave her. He said to wait 20 minutes to see how . she was, then we were told we could go home and were given a leaflet . about it.’ Lilly was prescribed more steroids and liquid paracetamol and sent home to recover. Ms Pogson said: ‘She was shattered when she got home, she just wanted to go to sleep. She woke up for a bit, but then it was bedtime again and went to sleep as normal. ‘Then, at 3.10am she woke and she was shocking. She was staring again and her breathing was awful. ‘I brought her downstairs to try to make steam for her croup with the kettle, gave her some paracetamol and then changed her nappy. She wasn’t crying, but was just staring. ‘Then she gasped, stretched out and went stiff. Her head went back and I didn’t know what was happening. I scooped her up to bring her round but she was stiff. ‘I called 999 and tried to do CPR but didn’t have a clue what I was doing.

It was eventually started again at Calderdale Royal Hospital, but by then she had suffered severe brain damage. The toddler was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary and spent the next five days in intensive care, with her parents by her side. ‘She was on a ventilator but her heart was beating on its own,’ said Ms Pogson. ‘We had doctors telling us she would survive but we didn’t know the extent of her disability. ‘But all the time, her brain was swelling. Then, we got a call to say she was deteriorating. Her heart rate had dropped suddenly from 90 to 46. Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust director of nursing Helen Thomson said: 'This is a very sad case and we wish to offer our sincere condolences to Lilly's family' ‘When I saw her, I just picked her up . and held her in my arms. We fell asleep together for two hours and when . I woke, she had gone. We were all so devastated.’ Lilly was baptised and her machines were switched off on April 5. Croup is a childhood condition, usually caused by a virus, that affects the windpipe, bronchi and voice box. A child with the condition tends to have a distinctive barking cough, a hoarse voice and breathing difficulties. It can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home but in rare cases a child may need hospital treatment. The condition is most common in children aged between six-months-old and three-years-old. It is more common in boys than girls and usually occurs during the autumn and winter. About 60 per cent of cases clear up within 48 hours but in some children the condition lasts for up to two weeks. It is very rare for a child to die of croup. Source: NHS Choices .

Ms Pogson added: ‘Her white casket was decorated with butterflies and whenever we see a butterfly, the children think it is Lilly. ‘We talk about her all the time to get through it. ‘I don’t want any other family to go through what we have been through. Croup is bad and if she had been kept in, they would have been there when she stopped breathing and might have saved her.’ Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust director of nursing Helen Thomson said: ‘This is a very sad case and we wish to offer our sincere condolences to Lilly’s family. ‘We are in contact with them so that we can answer any questions they have at this very difficult time for them.’ Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe, the airways to the lungs and the voice box.

And with past editors such as Iain Macleod, Ian Gilmour and Nigel Lawson all going on to become cabinet members, it really does seem to be the case. Boris Johnson, who was editor between 1999 and 2005, also seemingly used his position at the magazine as a springboard for a greater role in public affairs. So it comes as no surprise that the Tory's were out in force.

Now, the teenager, from Dublin, Ireland, is on the road to recovery and is starting to enjoy normal life again. Grainne said: 'I used to love trawling the pro-ana websites for tips and looking at pictures of the girls with their bones jutting out. 'I thought they were beautiful, and I started up my own blog, where I posted pictures of me, for other people to judge.

'It was only when I collapsed from exhaustion and could see what I was doing to my family that I realised I needed to get better. 'I’m now on the road to recovery and I’m horrified when I see pictures of what I used to aspire to.' Grainne first began to obsess about her weight when, aged 15, she bought a new dress and struggled to fit into it. Despite already being a size six, Grainne crash dieted to lose five pounds to be fit into it. Before developing the condition, Grainne (pictured before her weight loss) was an outgoing, happy young woman who was interested in fashion . Grainne is pictured before she developed anorexia, aged 15. She was a healthy weight but already very slim and did not need to lose weight. It wasn't until she found a dress she could not fit into that she started to diet and the disorder quickly took over her life . She said: 'I was devastated when I . couldn’t fit into this beautiful dress. It was an extra small, but I . felt fat when I couldn’t fit in it. 'I started dieting, and I was . amazed how easy it seemed to be to lose weight. Once I’d fit into the . dress, I just carried on dieting. 'I kept a fashion blog on Tumblr, and .

But within 12 months, she had lost almost a third of her bodyweight and had plummeted to less than six stone - with a dangerously low BMI of 14. And despite spending 10 weeks in hospital and undergoing intensive treatment, she remained determined to lose more and more weight. Grainne said: 'I had been ill for about a year when my mum and aunt took me back to the doctors. 'The doctor looked at me and said: “Grainne, you’re going to die if you carry on like this.""

A former programming manager at Microsoft has been arrested and charged with raping a female janitor on the company's main campus - and then telling police that he was the victim. Vineet Kumar Srivastava, 36, is accused of luring the victim into his office in Redmond, Washington, on the night of July 22 and attacking her, according to prosecutors. Following his arrest, however, the suspected rapist told police that it was the woman who forced him to have sex with her. Sexual attack: Vineet Kumar Srivastava, a former programming manager at Microsoft, is accused of raping a 32-year-old woman inside Building 27 on the company's Redmond campus . According to investigators, the incident took place at around 11pm July 22 when the 36-year-old senior programming manager approached the 32-year-old female custodian as she was cleaning a third-floor kitchen inside Building 27 on the sprawling Microsoft campus, the location station KING5 reported. A Redmond police detective told the court that Srivastava lured the woman into his office, where he then pulled down her shirt and showed her a pornographic video on his cell phone. ‘He asked her if she liked it and [the victim] cried, “No” covering her face,’ King County Sheriff's Detective Laura Murphy wrote in a probable cause document, the station KIRO-TV reported. When the janitor pushed the man away and attempted to flee, the investigator said the Microsoft worker stopped her, unzipped his pants and exposed himself to her. Srivastava then demanded that the janitor perform oral sex, saying his wife was in India, according to prosecutors. The man then fondled her buttocks, slammed the custodian to the floor and proceeded to rape her as she screamed, the detective told the court. Following the attack, Srivastava threw out a used condom in the trash, which he carried out with him on the way out of the building, the court documents cited by Seattle Post-Intelligencer stated. The victim reported the alleged rape to her supervisor at a company called ABM, who dismissed her allegations and failed to contact police. Another manager with ABM reached out to authorities a day later. When police went to interview the 32-year-old victim, they noted that her shoulders bore finger-shaped bruises consistent with a sexual assault. She identified Srivastava as the man who had raped her from a photographic line-up. The 36-year-old senior programming manager was taken into custody July 26 at his office. During questioning, police said that he presented himself as the victim, claiming that the female custodian forced him to have sex with her. According to Srivastava, he was afraid of the woman, so he went to his car to get a condom, and then returned to the office to have intercourse with the custodian. Neighbors in Richmond Ridge, where Srivastava lives, told KIRO-TV that he has a wife and children. A spokesperson from Microsoft said that Srivastava is no longer employed by the company. Srivastava has been charged with second-degree rape. He remains free on $75,000 bail and is due back in court later this month for his arraignment.","Vineet Kumar Srivastava, 36, charged with second-degree rape in July 22 incident .

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 30 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 30 July 2013 . Experts believe they can save as many as 20,000 lives with a free yearly lung cancer screening. The decision was made by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), which  is comprised of 16 healthcare experts who make recommendations about preventative services. The task force gave the preventative . service a 'B' rating, meaning that under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, . qualified Medicare and private insurance patients could receive the annual . screening free of charge. For now, the grade is just a draft recommendation and open for public comment until August 26. After that, it will take three to six months for the final recommendation to be instituted by health care providers. Lifesaver: The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force announced yesterday that they are recommending free lung cancer screenings for those at the highest risk of contracting the disease . Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer - . killing about 160,000 people a year - because symptoms usually don't . appear until it's too late. Screenings for the disease are rare, because until recently health care professionals weren't sure a CT scan could accurately find the cancer early enough to make a difference. But recent studies show that the early screening can, and does, save lives. In 2010, the National Cancer Institute held a large-scale trial involving 53,000 patients using a CT scan that detected smaller tumors. They found that the screening could reduce the lung cancer mortality rate by 16 per cent among those at the highest risk of getting lung cancer. Dr Claudia Henschke of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York was part of a study that pushed for early screenings. She says this decision is going to make a big difference in how many people die from the disease. Game changer: The task force estimates that as many as 20,000 of the 160,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer every year could be saved with early detection . 'Back in 1999 when we published our results, we were very confident that it was going to make a big difference,' Dr Henschke told NBC News. 'Now, finally, it will be made available to those people who are at highest risk. I am thrilled.' These findings were used as evidence in the task force's recommendation Monday. Nine million current and former smokers will be eligible for the yearly screening. Senior citizens are a priority with current smokers 55 to 80 eligible for the procedure. Former heavy smokers who quit less than 15 years ago, those who smoked a pack a day for 30 years, and patients who smoked three packs a day for 10 years, fall into the group. Task leader Dr Michael LeFevre told Fox News that the yearly screenings can save 'a substantial number of lung cancer deaths' - an estimated 20,000 of the 160,000 that happen each year in the U.S. Some are afraid this will only encourage current smokers to continue smoking if they're eligible for a free screening. But the lung cancer test is enough to make current smokers quit. The yearly screening involves a CT scan. If a spot shows up on the scan it could mean cancer, but it could also be emphysema, an infection or nothing. Risky: The screenings save lives, but also involve a lung biopsy to confirm the cancer which can collapse the lung and cause death as well . Doctors must perform a lung biopsy in order to confirm the cancer. This means inserting a needle into the chest and lungs to retrieve a sample. The procedure is borth painful and risky, and can cause the lung to collapse. A study at the National Lung Screening Trial found that for every five to six lives saved by the screening, one person died from procedures done in the screening - including collapsed lungs caused by biopsies. Dr Harold E Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, told the New York Times that the recommendation should not 'change the way people think about lunch cancer.' 'The main message is unchanged,' he said. 'Don't smoke.'","The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force estimates that 20,000 of the 160,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer each year could be saved .

An SAS sniper is facing jail after being found guilty of stashing an Iraqi pistol and more than 300 live rounds in his bedroom. Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, could now be sentenced to five years in military detention. He was originally ordered to serve 18 months in military detention after pleading guilty in November 2012. But this was overturned on appeal on the basis that he had been placed under ‘improper pressure’ to plead guilty. Yesterday the elite soldier said he felt ‘great shock’ at the court martial’s new verdict. Scroll down for video . SAS sniper Sergeant Danny Nightingale has been found guilty by a court martial . Police found the arsenal at the home he shared with an SAS comrade – identified only as Soldier N – after a tip-off. Sgt Nightingale, a veteran of 18 years, told detectives he was given the Glock as a war trophy by Iraqi troops he trained in the warzone in 2007. He said the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor. But at his six-day trial the soldier changed his story, insisting he had made a ‘false confession’. The married father-of-two blamed his confusion on memory loss caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run in the Brazilian jungle in 2009. He said he had no recollection of receiving the weapon and explained he filled in gaps in his memory with stories other people had told him – a medical condition known as ‘confabulation’. Hidden: The Iraqi Glock 9mm pistol stored in Nightingale's home . Sgt Nightingale had said he had no knowledge of the Glock and ammunition being in his bedroom and said they were put there by someone else . He argued that Soldier N, serving two years in prison after admitting possessing another Glock, brought both pistols back from Iraq and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence. But yesterday at Bulford Military Court, Wiltshire, the board rejected his story and found him guilty, concluding he had put the public at risk by storing the cache in his rented house in Hereford. Sgt Nightingale showed no emotion as the verdict was read out but his wife Sally struggled to fight back tears.  Sentencing was adjourned pending a Court of Appeal hearing on length of punishment. Sgt Nightingale now says the confession he made to the police was false because of memory problems caused by a brain injury he suffered during a charity endurance marathon in October 2009, which left him in a coma . Speaking outside court, Sgt Nightingale said he would consider appealing, but added: ‘We’re close to financial ruin. Realistically, we have to look at whether we can keep going.’ His wife said: ‘He isn’t guilty and he is not a criminal. We know the truth, and we know most of the public know the truth. Unfortunately we have not got the result we should have.’ He won the right to a retrial earlier this year after having his detention reduced to a suspended sentence of 12 months following a campaign led by his wife and supported by the Mail. Sgt Nightingale will be medically discharged from the Army in February. Former SAS sniper, Sgt Danny Nightingale has been supported by his wife Sally and father Humphrey .

Ad men and social media gurus have been scratching their heads trying to work out why some videos and advertising campaigns go viral on Twitter. But now the social network has confirmed what many might have feared - that there is 'no single magic formula' for widespread success. Twitter examined three big viral video hits - actor Ryan Gosling 'refusing' to eat cereal, astronaut Chris Hadfield singing Space Oddity and Dove's Real Beauty marketing campaign. Scroll down for videos . Commander Chris Hadfield sang David Bowie's Space Oddity' aboard the International Space Station and his rendition spread around the globe. According to Twitter, more than 90 percent of shares took place in the first three days after Mr Hadfield posted it, demonstrating that it is possible to have a real word-of-mouth hit . Twitter UK's Gordon Macmillan wrote in a blogpost: 'One of the key things we learned from looking closely at these three is that videos don’t go viral in the same way. 'There are no rules to “virality” — while some ignite, and spread like wildfire across the web, the growth of others is much more measured, like ripples spreading across a lake.' Twitter produced 'dynamic visualisation' videos to show how the videos went viral, using different coloured dots to show how they spread on the social network. He said: 'The blue nodes represent Tweets; the bigger they are, the larger the potential reach of that Tweet. 'The yellow dots represent retweets. In each case, reach takes into account not just followers, but also audience size and amplification by retweet.' Singing astronaut Commander Chris . Hadfield sang David Bowie's Space Oddity aboard the International Space Station and his rendition spread around the globe. According to Twitter, more than 90 per cent of shares took place in the . first three days after Mr Hadfield posted it, demonstrating that it is possible to have a real viral hit by word-of-mouth. The link mentions peaked fast and were driven by 'global influencers' but the videowas first shared by Mr Hadfield himself, demonstrating the sustained growth was driven by one man's efforts. It is thought the song proved so appealing because of its unique origin and was therefore far more popular than videos filmed on Earth. The creators of the 'Ryan Gosling won't eat his cereal' video was seeded with only a small handful of top vine influencers to go global. It was made using video clip tool Vine, collecting a series of six second clips of the actor being offered - and refusing - cereal in a dramatic way. The videos were then seeded with key influencers within the Vine community to ensure the videos went viral and spread in a similar manner to a breaking news story. However, of more interest to marketing agencies looking to create the next big viral hit, Dove's Real beauty campaign spread quite differently among clusters of local communities to enjoy a longer shelf life. Mr Macmillan said it was driven by 'a long tail of link-sharing and by positive audience sentiment'. Interestingly the Twitter video shows there were less spikes caused by influencers mentioning the campaign, which instead spread in clusters of communities, demonstrating the value of local engagement. Mr Macmillan's blog post seems designed to promote Twitter's benefits to brands at a time when the social network is under fire for allowing trolling and threats to female users, among others. Some users are boycotting Twitter in protest, while Twitter has promised to simplify its abuse reporting process, make its rules more straightforward and promote responsible use of the network. Twitter is keen to show the community of over 200 million people is still a place where brands should be interested in spreading their messages and has recommended that companies hoping to have a big viral hit should use hashtags, use Vine and pay for promoted tweets and trend adverts.","Twitter examined three viral video .

Enzalutamide extends survival time for men with untreatable prostate cancer (file picture) A new drug for prostate cancer patients who have run out of treatment options has been licensed for use in the UK. Enzalutamide (Xtandi) extends survival time and improves the quality of life. It is now available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund to men whose disease has become resistant to first-line hormonal treatments and has not responded well to chemotherapy. One in eight men in the UK is affected by the cancer that develops in the walnut-sized gland underneath the male bladder. About 40,000 new cases are diagnosed every year, and it is the second most common cause of cancer death in men. Early-stage prostate cancer can be treated but it is incurable if the disease spreads. Up to 30 per cent of men are not diagnosed until the disease has reached this stage, and 72 per cent of these will die within  five years. A multinational trial involving 1,199 men with advanced cancer showed that Enzalutamide improved overall survival by an average of 4.8 months compared to a placebo. Prostate cancer is fuelled by the . male hormone testosterone. Enzalutamide works by targeting the male . hormone receptors in the cancer cells, so blocking the effects of . testosterone. Heather . Payne, Consultant in Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, . London, says: ‘Enzalutamide allows us to offer men another option which . will extend their lifespan, improve their pain and allow them to . maintain a good quality of life for longer.’ One in eight men in the UK is affected by the cancer that develops in the walnut-sized gland underneath the male bladder (file picture) Although . Enzalutamide is currently licensed for use only when other treatments . have stopped working, it is also being trialled for use in earlier . stages of the disease. She . adds: ‘It’s not a cure but  it slows down the progression of the . disease. This drug gives huge hope to men with  prostate cancer.’ Enzalutamide, . which is taken in capsules once daily, is now awaiting approval by the . National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.","New drug can extend survival time and improve quality of life for men with untreatable prostate cancer .

Fired: Paramedic Bryce Reed was dismissed from the West, Texas emergency response squad two days after the blast . The West, Texas first responder arrested for having bomb-making materials was fired from his EMT job two days after the catastrophic blast, it has been revealed - as he has been accused of stealing from a fireman killed in the explosion whom he falsely referred to as his brother. On Friday, it was revealed in that Bryce Reed had been 'let go' from the West, Texas emergency response squad -  two days after the blast that killed 15 people and injured about 200 others. Reed was no longer part of West EMS on . April 19, according to an email obtained by The Associated Press that . was sent by a regional EMS organization, the Heart of Texas Regional . Advisory Council, to the state health officials. The documents do not explain the reason for his firing. Reed, 31, has been charged with possessing bomb-making materials, including a pipe and chemicals. Authorities allege Reed possessed . canisters that included a lighter, a digital scale, a plastic spoon and . 'several pounds of chemical powders' in separate bags. His arrest came hours after Texas . law enforcement officials announced a criminal investigation into the . massive April 17 explosion, but authorities will not say whether they suspect Reed was involved. The cause of the blast has not yet been determined. Still, Reed's arrest was drawing attention in part because in the days following the blast, Reed didn't duck attention in West.

Destruction: This apartment complex near the fertilizer plant was destroyed by the explosion . Grieving: At last month¿s public memorial for the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy for his close friend Cyrus Reed . He gave lengthy interviews to reporters, while other emergency responders didn't want to talk. At the Czech Inn along Interstate 35, . his wife, Brittany, was a constant presence, always in motion . organizing relief efforts and guiding the displaced to what they needed. Reed is also being accused of stealing from one of the victims of blast, a firefighter that Reed eulogized and has referred to as his brother. Fallen: Reed has been accused of stealing from blast victim and firefighter Cyrus Reed, pictured, who Reed eulogized and has referred to as his brother . Though they share the same last name, Reed and Cyrus Reed are not related. Cyrus Reed's sister Sarah told The Dallas Morning News that she has requested police officers to guard her brother’s apartment due to suspicions that Reed has been taking items from there since the explosion. She told the paper: 'Instead of grieving my brother's death, we're dealing with all of this.' Reed had credited Cyrus for saving his life. Upon reaching the plant, Bryce Reed . said, he saw Cyrus' truck, so he kept on driving because he was . confident the firefighter could handle the call. Minutes later, the . plant erupted in a fire ball. When Cyrus' body arrived at a funeral home three days later, Bryce Reed said he stayed up all night holding him. 'I got to hug him for the last time. He got there at 9 o'clock last night and I was there until 4 in the . morning, holding onto my brother,' Reed said. 'And telling him I'm sorry . for everything that I did.' Another of Reed's bizarre claims came in an interview outside the Czech Inn on April 21, when he spoke about being sick and facing his own mortality. He said that he lost 60 pounds in . five months, and that doctors couldn't pinpoint the source of his ailing . stomach despite performing 26 biopsies. Three days after the explosion, Reed . climbed onto a coffee table at a local hotel where displaced families . picked over donated sweatshirts and pizza, telling the crowd, 'You're safe where you're at. 'If you're not, I'd be dragging you out of here myself.'

On Friday afternoon in West, several . of Reed's neighbors stood outside near his red brick duplex, a . neighborhood less than a mile from the plant where some homes' windows . remained boarded. They said they were shocked about his arrest. Crystal Le Dane said he was a good . neighbor who had changed her flat tire and sometimes gave medical advice . about her children's minor injuries and rashes. 'I would say he's an everyday guy. I never saw a red flag,' she said. Reed grew up in suburban Dallas and said he had lived in West for 12 years. At the Czech Inn the weekend after the . explosion, Brittany Reed pulled out her phone and played a video of . what she said was the couple's young daughter playing with Cyrus just . days before the blast. According to an affidavit released by . the federal court in Waco, the McLennan County Sheriff's Office was . called on Tuesday to home in Abbott, which is near West, about 'a . possible destructive device' and related items. Speaker: Bryce Reed was a paramedic who essentially became a spokesperson for the town of West after last month's deadly explosion at a fertilizer facility . Charged: Bryce Reed, a first responder at the fertilizer plant blast in West, Texas, is facing a charge of possession of a destructive device . The affidavit said that law enforcement officials determined that the device and related items belonged to Reed. The . material is described as a 3.5-inch galvanized metal pipe an inch and a . half in diameter. Two galvanized end caps were attached to the pipe. One end cap had a small hole drilled into it. Canisters containing a fuse, a lighter, six coils of metal ribbon and several pounds of chemical powders were also found. The . powders were described as potassium nitrate, aluminum powder, red iron . oxide, ammonium perchlorate, sulfur powder and other materials. The . affidavit said that the materials had been left in a home near Waco by . Reed on April 26, but the person at the home did not know what had been . left. Clearup: Students clean debris at a home in West, Texas, that was damaged due to the explosion. The blast caused tens of millions of dollars in damage to the surrounding area .

Wonky, the bandy-legged puppy who won the nation's affections after being abandoned, has found a family to call her own. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross was rescued by staff at Dogs Trust Leeds last month and walked on her wrists because her front legs had not formed properly. But after care and attention from staff at the charity, physiotherapy helped to straighten out her legs. Now Wonky, now known as Hope, has been adopted by professional dog walker Kimberley Beaton and was pictured yesterday enjoying a run near the family home in Bradford. Wonky, renamed Hope, has found a new home with Kimberley Beaton and her family in Bradford . The Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross puppy cut a pitiful figure when she was abandoned with malformed front legs. But now, after physiotherapy, she has new owners and a new leash of life . Miss Beaton, 21, said: 'We've renamed . her Hope because the staff at the Dogs Trust didn't give up on her and . helped her recovery.' About 600 people applied to the charity to offer the puppy a new home. Miss Beaton said: 'I was gobsmacked when we heard we had got her as I knew there would be hundreds of applicants for her. 'We filled out a form anyway, and now here she is. We are over the moon. Hope now . shares the family home with Miss Beaton, her parents Helen, 50, and . Harry, 53, and 18-year-old sister Emily, as well as three-year-old . chocolate labrador Dayna, three guinea pigs, two tortoises and two fish. It is the third time the family has adopted a pet from Dogs Trust. Miss Beaton said: 'We feel so lucky to have been able to offer Wonky a home. 'Luckily we live close enough to the . centre for the vet to continue to keep an eye on her, and she continues . to get better every day. 'We fell in love with her when we saw her story and she has fast become part of the family.' Hope enjoys her walks and sleeps at the end of Miss Beaton's bed. 'I think she is a very mischievous personality and affectionate, she loves to cuddle. 'Although she is the family's dog she is my baby.' Mrs Beaton, also a professional dog walker, said: 'She's a good dog and has been out for walks with the other dogs. She is a bit frightened of going out at night though.' When the world was first introduced to Hope last month, she cut a pitiful figure. She was given the nickname Wonky because of . severe problems with her malformed front legs, which failed to develop after she was . separated from her mother. But after intense physiotherapy, the 12-week-old made a fantastic recovery. Where once she walked awkwardly on bent joints, she can now bound along normally, her tail wagging as she goes. WONKY WHEN SHE WAS FIRST RESCUED... Wonky, disabled by malformed joints, was found dumped on a street in Leeds last month . ... AND AFTER A FORTNIGHT WITH DOGS TRUST . Since physiotherapy, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross has made remarkable progress . John Wannop, a vet at the Dogs Trust in Leeds, told how the puppy was taken there on February 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - leading to a condition known as 'knuckling'. Knuckling of the carpal joints is caused by contraction of the tendons which prevents the wrist joint . from extending fully - and meant her front feet bended inwards because her . tendons were too short. He said that without treatment, it would have been impossible for Hope to straighten her legs. She was found wandering the streets as a stray and was taken to the Dogs Trust by a member of the public. Because of her unorthodox looks, there had been concern she would struggle to find a new home. There were 600 offers from households . wanting to take care of Wonky and after a thorough vetting process she . was rehomed with the Beatons. Amanda Sands, manager at the trust, said: 'The Beaton family proved to be an excellent match for the puppy. 'We are confident that the love and care the family can provide will ensure she has a very happy life.' With . further physiotherapy, the prognosis for Hope is good, and the trust . wanted to rehouse her close by so it can keep her under review. The Beatons renamed the puppy Hope, because the staff at Dogs Trust Leeds didn't give up on her . 'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' Ms Sands said previously. 'She had not had the right supplements to enable her to grow properly and so her front legs were too weak. 'We . don't know everything about her background but we think that she was . removed from her mother too early and was then abandoned. She had not . had the right nutrition and a poor diet meant her front legs were underdeveloped. 'She will need regular trips to the specialist vet to keep a track of her progress. 'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' said Amanda Sands, manager at the trust . 'With . the right treatment, she will hopefully be able to live a normal life . and do all the things a puppy should be able to enjoy. Dogs Trust is the UK's largest dog welfare charity and cares for more than 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year through its network of 18 . Rehoming Centres across the UK and one in Dublin. Amanda Francis, spokesman for the charity, said: 'Usually, physical deformity is the . result of unscrupulous breeders or they haven't been properly looked . after and most of the time it's something that is completely . preventable.'

Ill: The Queen, pictured touring the Royal London Hospital in east London on Thursday, has cancelled a visit to Swansea because she is suffering from gastroenteritis . The Queen has been forced to cancel a visit to Wales today after being struck down with suspected gastroenteritis. The monarch was due  to attend a military celebration in Swansea as part  of the city’s St David’s Day celebrations. But a Buckingham Palace spokesman said she will instead spend the weekend at Windsor, and will be assessed by doctors in the coming days. The Queen, 86, was due to spend three hours in Swansea meeting soldiers and their families before a lunch at the George Hall. She had also planned to present St David’s Day leeks to members of 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh Regiment. The ceremony will continue in her absence, but will now instead be carried out by the Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan, Byron Lewis. A council spokesman said: ‘The Lord Lieutenant will be met upon arrival at the Guildhall by Brigadier Philip Napier, Colonel of the Regiment. ‘The parade will present arms for a royal salute and play the national anthem before the Lord Lieutenant is invited to present leeks to a representative body of the regiment. ‘Following the parade, the Lord Lieutenant will attend a reception with members of the battalion and their families, before proceeding to the George Hall for lunch.’ The Queen has rarely taken time off due to illness during her six decades as monarch. She is normally in robust health and is known not to make a fuss in times of sickness or discomfort. She has, however, suffered occasional problems with her back. In October, she was forced to cancel an appearance at a Windsor Castle investiture ceremony, and also had to miss a church service in Scotland a few days earlier. Host: The Queen was well enough to award Jessica Ennis a CBE and Nicola Adams an MBE at the Investiture ceremony on Thursday, but has since taken a turn for the worse . In 2006, she suffered a strain to her . back during her annual summer break at Balmoral which led to her . cancelling a tour of Arsenal’s new stadium. She also missed a visit to the British Museum in October 2011 because of a bad cold. Disappointed locals took to Twitter . last night to voice their upset at today’s change of plans. Becca . Masters commented ‘poor Queenie’ while Peter Grant added ‘Get well soon . your Majesty!’ June Marcroft added: ‘Jeez, she’s human after all, I thought she was bionic.’ Honoured: Olympic cycling coach David Brailsford received a Knighthood at The Queen's Investiture ceremony . Strong: Her Majesty has always refused to fuss over a string of ailments over recent years . Leaders: Although the Queen has suffered various illness and injury in recent years, it is the health of Prince Philip that is more often in the spotlight . The Queen’s most recent appearance was . to present a host of Olympic stars with honours during an investiture . ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. She and the Duke of Edinburgh are scheduled to fly out to Rome for a two-day visit next week. A Palace spokesman said the trip was . still due to take place but a decision would be made after the Queen is . assessed in the next few days. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel, with common symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. In England, the two most common causes . of gastroenteritis in adults are the norovirus and food poisoning, . according to NHS Choices. In June, the Duke of Edinburgh . succumbed to a bladder infection thought to be brought on after being . forced to stand for several hours in cold, wet and windy conditions on a . barge sailing down the Thames during the Jubilee River Pageant. The 91-year-old was taken into . hospital just hours  before the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee’s closing . celebrations at Buckingham Palace,  where she was joined by some 12,000 . people. The illness forced him to miss several other key events, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel and is very common in England, with about one in five people affected every year. The two most common causes in adults are a virus, such as the norovirus, or food poisoning, according to NHS Choices. The infection interferes with one of the main functions of the intestines, the absorption of water from the contents of the intestines into the body. Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Most types of gastroenteritis are highly infectious, and bacteria can be transferred through poor hygiene, such as not washing your hands after going to the toilet. Viruses and bacteria on hands can be transferred to whatever they touch, such as a glass, kitchen utensil or food. Most people with gastroenteritis only have mild symptoms and the infection passes after a few days without the need for treatment. But sufferers may need treatment in hospital if symptoms are severe or if they are vulnerable because of their age or another illness. This is because diarrhoea can quickly cause dehydration which, if severe, can be fatal. Each year in England and Wales, an average 190 deaths occur because of gastroenteritis. Most deaths are in people over 65. Worrying: It is unknown at this time whether The Queen will be well enough to travel to Rome next week .","Her Majesty to miss Swansea's St David's Day celebrations .

Peers with serious criminal records or those who stop attending Parliament could be kicked out of the House of Lords. The proposal follows the storm of criticism yesterday over the appointment of 30 new members – a move which left all three main party leaders accused of polluting politics. Now, after being attacked for rewarding major donors, cronies and lobbyists, senior ministers say they will seek to introduce fresh Lords reforms to cut the upper chamber. Lord Hanningfield (pictured left) was jailed, but could continue as a peer, while Lord Archer (right) could lose his seat following his perjury jail term . At the moment the Lords, which has swollen to 836 members, is second only to the Chinese Politburo as the largest legislature in the world. But under the proposals peers who do not attend the House or who have left the country will be told to retire. And those who have been given custodial sentences of a year or more will be stripped of their peerages. Currently MPs are kicked out of the Commons if they are sentenced to more than a year behind bars. But peers are simply banned from the Lords for the duration of their sentence or for the period when they are bankrupt. The new plans would affect Tory peer and novelist Lord Archer, who was jailed for four years for perjury and perverting the course of justice in 2001. The Lords (pictured) is second only to the Chinese Politburo as the largest legislature in the world. Under new proposals peers who do not attend the House or who have left the country will be told to retire . But they would not hit Lord Hanningfield, who received a nine-month sentence in 2011 for fiddling his expenses. Lib Dem ministers, backed by Tory Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin, are now drawing up plans to give life peers the opportunity to retire. They would keep their titles but would lose the right to claim allowances and vote on legislation. Ministers have also vowed to tackle the huge levels of absenteeism. At least 51 peers who are thought to have moved abroad are expected to lose their places. And hundreds of peers rarely or never speak in the upper chamber but are still able to claim allowances of £300 a day. Plans to make the Lords an elected chamber were shelved last year after a bitter row between the Tories and Lib Dems. The Lib Dems are still keen to remove the ‘historical anomaly’ that allows 92 hereditary peers to remain in the Lords. But they are apparently unwilling to push the idea for fear of generating further opposition from the Conservatives. Lord Oakeshott, pictured at his pub the Town of Ramsgate in Wapping, told Mr Clegg: 'I am now saying: Nick, you are in charge, show some leadership, don't bottle out' A senior Lib Dem source said his party would rather have an elected chamber, but that the Coalition will tackle the worst elements of the existing rules. ‘The current system is archaic, as we’ve seen this week. ‘Any other reforms in this area must not be seen as a substitute for meaningful democratic reform of the Lords,’ they said. ‘But we are looking at the areas of low hanging fruit which almost everyone agrees are crying out for reform – some sort of retirement plan, dealing with those who have been convicted of criminal offences and those who never turn up or live abroad.’ Proposals to offer peers a chance to retire have already been put forward by former Lib Dem leader Lord Steel. But Whitehall sources say government legislation is now being written that would bring all the Lords reforms into effect. Details of the new plans emerged as Nick Clegg came under pressure from his own party to ‘show some leadership’ and stop the next election being fought with ‘dirty money’. Lord Oakeshott, a former member of the joint committee on Lords reform, called for political donations to be capped at £5,000 to stop people buying their way into the Lords. Speaking on the Radio 4’s Today programme, Lord Oakeshott told Mr Clegg: ‘I am now saying: Nick – you are in charge, show some leadership, don’t bottle out. Please take a lead and shame people into doing it. We can stop the next election being fought with dirty money.’","The Lords is second only to the Chinese Politburo as the largest legislature in the world .

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time. After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines. Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations. Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.","Owen and Emmett Ezell shared a liver and intestines when they were born .

A former Cabinet minister tonight revealed urine has been pouring through the ceiling of his Commons office. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw took to Twitter to complain that his office ‘stinks’ after sewage from a toilets above his office seeped through Parliament’s crumbling walls. The former Culture Secretary revealed Victorian copper piping was to blame for the disgusting plumbing problem which has plagued his office for two days. Ben Bradshaw posted this picture on Twitter, telling his 18,000 followers 'urine not visible but *stinks*' The Exeter MP revealed on Twitter that he has been struck with the plumbing problem two days . Mr Bradshaw, who served in Gordon Brown's last Cabinet, revealed the smell was only made bearable by his staff wearing strong perfume. The Houses of Parliament are in such a dreadful state of disrepair that MPs could be moved out for five years for massive renovations to be carried out. Mr Bradshaw suffered the consequences first hand when waste from toilets above his office began seeping through. Parliament is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world . ‘Urine seems to be pouring through the ceiling into my Commons office for the second day running!’ he wrote on Twitter. Quizzed by other users of the site, he said the problem was caused by ‘a men's urinal with Victorian copper piping with holes in it’. He later used the hashtag #urinegate. When someone suggested by a can of air freshener, Mr Bradshaw replied: ‘Thankfully my 2 female student assistants wear very nice strong perfume.’ Another Twitter user asked if his office was ‘all grandeur and pomp’, but the Exeter MP posted a photograph, adding: ‘v grand as you can see urine not visible but *stinks*#urinegate’ An aide in the MPs office said Commons officials had leapt into action after he started posting the tweets. A contractor will be sent to clean up the mess in the morning. The Commons Commission has warned the repair bill for Parliament will top £1.6billion, saying it is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world. A recent report by MPs revealed decades of alterations had created a complex patchwork of wiring and plumbing which was almost impossible to repair. ‘Even routine tasks, such as unblocking down pipes and sewage outlets, are problematic in this environment, where pipes disappear into inaccessible voids and are entangled with other uncharted services and asbestos,’ the House of Commons Commission said.","Former Culture Secretary uses Twitter to reveal his office 'stinks' after urinal springs a leak .

In films and television dramas, bespoke plates are often used to hint that a character is a bit of a show-off or desperate for attention. But the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has decided that there is no doubt about the taste of certain number plates. Censors at the government body that hands out number plates has banned hundreds of personalised registrations because they are seen as in bad taste. Vulgar: Certain personalised number plates containing rude or offensive words have been scrapped by the DVLA. Pictured is Towie star Amy Child's Range Rover with a personalised plate reading 'Well Jell' (well jealous) The DVLA’s ‘propriety committee’ has withheld plates with letter and number combinations that spell out words such as ‘arse’, ‘bonk’, ‘bum’, ‘drugs’ and ‘slags’. The group meets twice a year to vet potentially offensive registration numbers before they are released in March and September. It looks at the sequences of numbers and letters to be used on plates to check if any appear to spell out words they deem inappropriate. Plates including SH12 EDD, BO11 CKS and anything ending with KOK have been banned according to lists released under the Freedom of Information Act. Also censored are *S** HAG, TW** AAT and UP** YOU, where the stars denote different combinations of other numbers and letters. The boss: Sir Alan Sugar with his personalised number plate containing his initials . Drivers are not able to get their hands on BL08 JOB, 51 LUT, BB11 TCH, K11 LLA and BU62 GER. The DVLA has also stopped plates with racist or extremist overtones, such as DA** RKY, MU11 AHS and Y11 DOS. Insults popular with young people including SP**AZZ and M0**NGS, which are offensive terms for someone with a learning disability, have also not been allowed. Currently numberplates that end in the common text message abbreviations OMG and WTF are still allowed, but the DVLA said that these too may soon be added to the banned list. A spokesman for the DVLA said: ‘The vast majority of registration numbers are made available but we have a responsibility to ensure that the combinations used do not cause offence. ‘We try to identify combinations that may cause offence and, having considered the appropriateness of these registration numbers, we have withdrawn them as they could cause offence or embarrassment on the grounds of political or racial sensitivities or are in poor taste.’ Naff: Speaker John Bercow and his wife Sally both have personalised number plates . Last year the DVLA raised £67m from the sale of personalised number plates. The highest ever price paid for a plate sold by the DVLA in the UK was £352,000 for plate 1 D in March 2009. Other expensive plates sold by the body include 51 NGH, which sold for £254,000, 1 RH, £247,000, and K1 NGS, £231,000. Lord Alan Sugar uses the numberplate AMS 1, which is based on his initials. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge drove away from their wedding with one that read JU5T WED. Since 2001, the third and fourth digits on a British number plate identify the age of a car and change every six months - the current number is 13 and will be 63 from September. The first two letters denote the area where the car was registered and the final three letters are random.","Vulgar language banned from personalised number plates .

Wisconsin authorities think they may have finally found the remains of an eight-year-old girl who went missing 66-years ago. Based on a tip they received, officials have begun searching a lot in hope of finding the remains of blonde haired, blue eyed Georgia Jean Weckler after she went missing in 1947. The man who tipped authorities to the location said she may be buried in the lot, according to reports. Weckler was last seen retrieving the mail from her mailbox, according to the Janesville Gazette. Never found: Georgia Jean Weckler, 8, went missing May 1, 1947 and was never seen again . Both the local sheriff’s office and town police descended on the Janesville, WI., lot after being told by an elderly man that he believed Weckler may be buried there, according to WISC. A preliminary search of the property by a K9 unit detected human remains at the site and authorities moved in. ‘[The tip] is credible, and we’re going to do our best to hopefully find evidence, either she’s there or she's not,’ Rock County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Todd Christiansen told WISC. Of the 48 square plots the parcel of land has been divided into, investigators have only dug and sifted through two so far, according to WISC. Remains have yet to be found. ‘It could take days. It’s quite a big area and we have to sift through the dirt that’s plotted out,’ Christiansen told WISC, ‘there’s numerous plots that we have to go through and individually sift the dirt.’ Based on a tip: Authorities are digging up a lot in Janesville,. WI., after acting on a tip that led to a K9 unit detecting human remains . The young girl was reportedly abducted in broad daylight May 1, 1947. Given a ride home by a family friend, according to an archived Gazette report, Weckler was seen taking ‘the family's mail from the mail box along the highway and stroll down the lane. She was never seen again. The mail was never found.’ Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were involved at the search, according to the Gazette. Neither Weckler’s remains, nor an abductor were ever found. No easy task: Investigators have only dug up and sifted through two of the 46 sections the lot has been divided into . An imprisoned murderer confessed to the crime but changed his story enough times for authorities to shift their focus away from him, reported the Gazette. In 1967, then Sheriff Roger Reinel expressed his disappointment over having not solved the case, even after 20-years. ‘I don't imagine it will ever be closed,’ Reinel told the Gazette, ‘tt will always be on file.’ Almost 70 years later his words ring true, authorities hope to prove him wrong.","Georgia Jean Weckler was last seen by a family friend who took her home from school May 1, 1947 .

Today, its computer screens are dark, the control desks unstaffed and the giant, supercooled tunnel empty of the crashing proton beams whose snapshots of the Big Bang helped flush out the elusive particle. But the silence is an illusion. Behind the scenes, work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade, enabling it to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther.

The 27km circular lab, straddling the French-Swiss border 100metres underground, went offline in February for an 18-month overhaul. And when experiments resume in 2015, scientists at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter, dark energy and super symmetry -- ideas considered as wild as the Higgs boson was, half a century ago.

'That's our bread and butter. Most of that stuff is not very interesting, so there are real challenges sorting out and throwing most of that away, and picking out the interesting stuff,' he explained in the tunnel, which mixes installations fit for a starship with the low-tech practicality of bicycles for inspection tours. CERN's supercomputers are programmed to identify within microseconds the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter. The LHC's computer screens are dark, but behind the scenes, work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade, enabling the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther .

CERN's work can bemuse beginners, but the researchers find ways to make it simple. 'Everybody knows what an electron is, especially if they put their finger in an electric socket,' joked Pierluigi Campana, whose team has just provided the most exhaustive confirmation to date of the Standard Model, the chief theoretical framework of particle physics conceived in the 1970s.

They achieved the most accurate measurement yet of a change in a particle called a Bs, showing that out of every billion, only a handful decay into smaller particles called muon, and do so in pairs. For the experts, that finding was almost as thrilling as tracking the Higgs boson -- nicknamed the God Particle. It was theorised in 1964 by British physicist Peter Higgs and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others, such as light, have none.

Masao Yoshida, the man who led the life-risking battle at Japan's crippled nuclear power plant when it was spiraling into meltdowns, died today of cancer of the esophagus. He was 58. Tokyo Electric Power Co. spokesman Yoshimi Hitosugi said Yoshida died at a Tokyo hospital. Yoshida led efforts to stabilise the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami knocked out its power and cooling systems, causing triple meltdowns and massive radiation leaks. Recalling the first few days when the three reactors suffered meltdowns in succession, Yoshida later said: 'There were several instances when I thought we were all going to die here. I feared the plant was getting out of control and we would be finished.' Yoshida was an outspoken, tall man with a loud voice who wasn't afraid of talking back to higher-ups and was known to his workers as a caring figure. Even then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who was extremely frustrated by TEPCO's initial lack of information and slow handling, said after meeting him that Yoshida could be trusted. On March 12, after Unit 1 reactor building exploded following a meltdown, Yoshida kept pumping in sea water into the reactor to cool it, ignoring an order from the TEPCO headquarters to stop doing so as Kan feared a possibility of sea water triggering a fission chain reaction. Yoshida was initially reprimanded for disobeying the order from above, but later praised for his judgment that eventually helped keep the reactor from turning worse. TEPCO officials said his illness was not related to radiation exposure. 'I bow deeply in respect to his leadership and decisiveness,' Kan said today. Kunio Yanagida, former member of a government-commissioned accident probe panel who interviewed Yoshida for 10 hours, said his death is a major loss for future investigations into the disaster at the plant, which hasn't been fully examined due to high levels of radiation. Japan's former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda (centre) listens to Masao Yoshida (left), during a visit to the crippled plant in September 2011 . The Japanese government ignored radiation threat forecasts in the early days of its Fukushima crisis and allowed thousands of residents to remain in areas it had ample reason to believe put them in serious danger . Yoshida studied nuclear engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and joined TEPCO in 1979. He worked in the company's nuclear department before landing a top job at the Fukushima Dai-ichi a year before the crisis. Yoshida stepped down as plant chief in December 2011, citing the cancer, after workers had begun to bring the plant under control. Yoshida had brought workers together and kept their spirits up to survive the crisis, and had expressed hopes of returning to work for Fukushima's recovery even after falling ill, TEPCO President Naomi Hirose said. 'He literally put his life at risk in dealing with the accident,' Hirose said in a statement. 'We keep his wishes to our heart and do utmost for the reconstruction of Fukushima, which he tried to save at all cost.'","Masao Yoshida led efforts to stabilise the plant after it was hit by a tsunami .

A 17-year-old gang-rape survivor's insistence on justice has led a blackballing by her community and, it is alleged, her mother's murder. The girl from Karnal in the Indian state of Haryana, who cannot be named, has been shunned by neighbours since accusing two men of a higher caste of raping her. Even in a country racked with guilt over violence towards women, she and her father claim they have faced official indifference - and even obstruction - to their efforts to see the suspects sent to jail. Ostracised for seeking justice: The girl from Karnal in the Indian state of Haryana, who cannot be named, has been shunned by neighbours since accusing two men of a higher caste of raping her . The victim was 16 when she was snatched from the street as she walked to school and raped by two men in a moving car. She reported the attack to the police but three weeks later, on a date etched on to the wall of her home, her mother disappeared. Two days later she was found dead in canal. Doctors said she too was raped before she was murdered. Now the teenager's fight to see the men accused of her rape sent to jail has pitted her and her family against a hostile neighbourhood. They are Dalits, India's lowest caste who are derided as 'untouchables'; the suspects, who police say also raped and killed her mother, are upper caste. Haryana is at the front line of India's rape epidemic. At one point last year, two women were raped every single day in the state, which has a population of 25.3million. But despite a high-profile national political drive for greater safety for women and girls on India's streets, rape convictions remain difficult to secure - a situation worsened by the politics of the country's caste system. 'We didn't compromise, that's why everyone is . angry with us': The victim's widowed father, a day labourer, said . neighbours had repeatedly told them to drop the charges against the suspects, who are from the upper caste . The victim's widowed father, a day labourer, said neighbours had repeatedly told them to drop the charges. 'We didn't compromise, that's why everyone is angry with us. We want the culprits to get the life sentence. Only then our struggle will be justified,' he said. The government gave him four lakh (£4,668) compensation for his wife's murder and the rape of his daughter last year. That money has now all been spent on lawyers for the case which still drags on in a 'fast-track' court. To compound matters, he believes that a police officer related to one of the accused tampered with evidence that is crucial to the prosecution. The young victim now hopes to find salvation through education - although she struggles to afford school books . For his daughter, her insistence at speaking out has had terrible consequences. 'No one speaks to me,' she told Indian news network NDTV. 'I don't talk to them. Or visit anyone. I just stay at home. What is the point? 'Nobody talks nicely to me. Even my uncle bad-mouths me. It would be better to just leave this village.' She now hopes to find salvation through education. 'Though I am at home, I can do better than those girls who are attending school. I can still get better marks than my classmates,' she said. 'But I don't have money to buy books.'","Girl, 17, from Karnal, Haryana, was snatched last year on her way to school .

The controversial Yankees third baseman hit a towering home run Friday during a minor league rehab game and then took a few swings at the Yankees while addressing the media about the possibility of a long suspension or lifetime ban from baseball stemming from the Biogenesis performance enhancing drug scandal, even saying fans will be the ones who suffer if he is banished. ‘I am mentally prepared to play for five more years,’ the slugger defiantly said after the game. ‘It’s not time for me to hang it up, I have a lot more left in me. I will keep fighting.’ Scroll down for video . Five more years: New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez believes he can play five more years - despite the threat of a lifetime ban . Starting to round into form, Rodriguez went 1-for-2 with the home run and a walk, as well as solid play in the field while playing third base for the Trenton Thunder, the Yankees Double-A affiliate. Alluding to the belief that he is being singled out by Major League Baseball, Rodriguez said ‘I think it’s pretty self-explanatory. I think that’s the pink elephant in the room,’ before adding that he agrees the game needs to be rid of PEDs. Rodriguez admitted to using steroids while with the Texas Rangers, but has denied using PEDs since joining the Yankees in 2004. ‘I will say this, there’s more than one party that benefits from me never stepping back on the field. That’s not my teammates and not the Yankee fans,’ said Rodriguez. The latest allegations claim the 14-time all-star used PEDs as far back as at least 2009, possibly further. But Rodriguez didn’t stop there, with his next comments aimed squarely at the Yankees, the team that owes him more than $100million over the next four years. Out with a bang!: A-Rod admires what may be the last home run he hits as a professional ball player Friday night during a rehab game with the minor league Trenton Thunder . ‘But when all this stuff is going on in the background, and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract, that’s concerning for me, concerning for present and I think it should be concerning for future players, as well,’ said Rodriguez. His comments came after his first minor league rehab game as he races to come back from both off-season hip surgery and a strained quad before MLB Commissioner Bud Selig suspends him, which reports indicate will happen no later than next week. Stepping onto the field, there was an even mixture of boos and cheers from the 8,000-plus crowd on hand against the Reading Fightin Phils, a minor league affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. Rodriguez attributed the Bronx cheer to his role in helping the Yankees beat the Phillies in the 2009 World Series. ‘I think there were a lot of Phillies fans out there, and they don't have good memories from me,’ said Rodriguez, perhaps half-jokingly. Soaking it up: A-Rod gestures to the crowd as rounds the bases after his monster home run . The suspension hanging over Rodriguez is a result of his alleged involvement with Biogenesis, a South Florida anti-aging clinic MLB investigators have accused of selling PEDs such as steroids and human growth hormone to a list of athletes long enough field an all-star team on its own. Varying reports say anywhere from eight to 14 other players are expected to be suspended in connection with Biogenesis. The suspensions were due to be announced by the end of this week, but the latest reports say the axe will fall in the next two or three days. At the same time, the Yankees have publicly stated their plan is to have the 19-year veteran Rodriguez in their lineup Monday against the Chicago White Sox. ‘I think it’s possible, yeah,’ manager Joe Girardi said when asked if the embattled slugger would return to the lineup. Rodriguez was a bit more jovial in his answer to the same question, saying he’d be in the lineup ‘unless I get hit by lightning, and these days you never know.’ You lie!: Fans let the alleged steroid cheat know how they really felt, both with boos and signs held before, during and after the game . A-Rod was set to join the Yankees in July when his strained quad delayed his return to the Bronx, an injury he openly contested in the media. The move backfired when the doctor his handlers picked turned out to have been in trouble with New Jersey officials earlier this year. Rodriguez, in the end, accepted the rehabilitation assignment, Friday’s game in Trenton was the first game of his assigned rehab. The league’s highest-paid player, at $28million per season, it has been widely reported since at least last season that the Yankees were trying to figure out how to get out from under the ill-advised contract owing him more than $100 million over the next four seasons. On his way: Rodriguez said he will be back with the Yankees for Monday's game against the White Sox in Chicago, unless he's 'struck by lightning' Current Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter – himself a former Yankees manager – went so far as to say the league is perhaps even conspiring with the team to deal with A-Rod, saying that if the Yankees are allowed to ‘get away with that,’ they will go on another spending spree snagging big name free agents as they have in the past. There are two schools of thought on what Selig may do with A-Rod. One has him using the ‘best interest of the game’ power afforded him as commissioner to ban the suspected cheater for life.

A studio assistant to artist David Hockney died after swallowing bleach during a drink and drugs session with the millionaire artist’s former partner, an inquest heard yesterday. Dominic Elliott, 23, was in a relationship with Hockney’s ex John Fitzherbert and the pair ended up in bed together after their all-night session while the painter slept just down the corridor at his home. Mr Fitzherbert, who is in his early 60s, told the inquest in Hull that after spending most of the day sleeping he was woken at 4am on Sunday March 17 by his young lover asking to be driven to hospital. Friends: Renowned artist David Hockney (left) employed keen sportsman Dominic Elliott (right) as an assistant . He said he found an open bottle of . toilet cleaner – which was 95 per cent sulphuric acid – in the bathroom . sink but ‘didn’t connect’ the two. Mr . Elliott ‘slouched forward groaning and grunting’ during the 45-minute . journey to Scarborough General Hospital but was pronounced dead soon . after his arrival. He would have died in agony and suffered shocking internal injuries, the inquest was told. Mr . Hockney, one of Britain’s most successful artists and worth around . £37million, did not attend the inquest but he submitted a statement. He . described how he shared his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, with . his ex-partner and two other male studio assistants, but had his own . room where he slept alone. Mr . Hockney said he knew Mr Elliott, who had his own home in the town, only . on a professional basis but described him as a ‘Jekyll and Hyde . character’ when drunk. Scene: Mr Elliott was taken to hospital from David Hockney's home (pictured) in Bridlington, East Yorkshire . Mr . Hockney said he saw Mr Fitzherbert at midnight on the Saturday but . noticed ‘nothing out the ordinary’. He said he knew nothing about . drug-taking that night and was asleep when Mr Elliott was taken to . hospital. He was woken by an assistant at 9.30am and told of his death. Mr . Fitzherbert told the inquest that he had been Mr Hockney’s partner for . 24 years, but the pair split amicably four years ago. They remained . friends and continued to share the five-bedroom house in Bridlington. Mr . Elliott, who had a relationship with Mr Fitzherbert before he went to . university, became an assistant for Mr Hockney after dropping out. Mr . Fitzherbert said Mr Elliott came to see him on the Friday night before . his death. He was upset about his exclusion from a Vanity Fair . photoshoot of Mr Hockney and his team by the leading photographer Annie . Leibovitz. Hockney painted this portrait of Dominic Elliott in 2008, left. Hockney's former partner John Fitzherbert, right, had smoked cannabis and drunk alcohol with Elliott during the course of the day, the inquest heard . The two men spent . the night alone together in Mr Hockney’s house drinking and taking . drugs, with Mr Elliott snorting cocaine. The following day they were in . bed when they heard Mr Hockney leave the house. Mr Fitzherbert said Mr . Elliott was ‘laughing hysterically’ and leapt out of bed before throwing . himself off an internal balcony. Mr Elliott could not explain his behaviour but Mr Fitzherbert said he was ‘prone to random behaviour’ when drunk. They smoked more cannabis but spent most of the day sleeping until Mr Elliott asked to go to hospital. A post-mortem examination revealed cause of death to be ingestion of sulphuric acid ‘associated’ with taking drugs. The . pathologist said Mr Elliott had a ‘significant quantity of ecstasy’ in . his system and that would have ‘exerted influence at the time of death’. The inquest continues.

Jeffrey Archer has revealed his sadness over the declining health of Margaret Thatcher, admitting that his long-term friend no longer recognises him. The author and former Tory MP, who served under Lady Thatcher when she was prime minister, said that the 87-year-old had been one of three ‘remarkable women’ in his life alongside his mother Lola and wife Mary. But he says that her failing memory means she doesn’t know who he is when they now meet. Suffering ill health: Former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street in 2010 . ‘I still see her and get weekly updates - she’s not well,’ he told Reader’s Digest. ‘Mary and I were among her closest friends; Margaret adored Mary. Now she doesn’t even know who I am. So terribly sad.’ Archer was made deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Lady Thatcher 1985, but was forced to resign the following year after a scandal in which it was revealed he had made payments to prostitute Monica Coghlan. He was later jailed in 2001 for two years for perverting the course of justice. However, he added: ‘As an MP, I obviously knew Margaret before she became prime minister. What drew me to her was conviction. If she believed something, she fought for it and followed it through. These days—the Tony Blairs and the David Camerons—it’s all about focus groups. Firm friends: Lady Thatcher was close to Lord Archer, right, as seen at the 1986 Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth, but now she cannot remember him . ‘The focus groups say the mansion tax is a good thing. Then they’ll say, “No, it’s a bad thing.” Margaret Thatcher didn’t give a damn about focus groups! ‘When Margaret had an idea, she called me into her office and said, “Jeffrey, this is how it’s going to be. Now, get out of my office and sell it to the country!” Yes, prime minister; sorry for speaking, prime minister.’ Britain’s first and only woman prime minister, Lady Thatcher won three consecutive general elections, but has been in fragile health since she suffered a series of minor strokes more than a decade ago. She now suffers acute short-term memory loss and is now rarely seen in public. In January she was admitted to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder, before spending time convalescing at the Ritz Hotel. The novelist has described Lady Thatcher as ‘a remarkable woman’, alongside his wife Mary and his late mother Lola, a former local councillor in Weston-super-Mare. Popular portrayal: The film The Iron Lady from 2011, with Meryl Streep playing the lead, brought Lady Thatcher's time in power to life for a new generation of young people . Talking about the death of his father William when he was 15, he said: ‘What’s clear in my mind is the sadness of my mother and how she suddenly became this extremely powerful figure in my world. ‘Life had knocked her down, but she was determined to get back up—that’s probably where I get it from. ‘My mother Lola was a formidable woman, way ahead of her time. She was a councillor, she wrote for the local paper and she’d written a novel. There have been three remarkable women in my life: my mother, my wife Mary and Margaret Thatcher.’ Archer has been married to his Chemist wife for 46 years. She was made a Dame last year for her services to the NHS and has battled bladder cancer. Family friends: Lady Thatcher, right, with Lady Archer, left, at the 1999 Conservative Party conference . He added: ‘As people will know, our marriage has had its difficulties. What marriage doesn’t? I suspect I’m not always the easiest man to live with, but Mary seems to cope with everything in that same calm and dignified way. ‘When she said, “For better or for worse; for richer, for poorer,” she meant every word. I know there are a lot of people who were sure our marriage was going to fall apart when I got sent to prison. They don’t know Mary! ‘Is there a secret to getting over those difficult bits?

A leading art expert who first beat his wife on their honeymoon 10 years ago walked free from court today despite punching her in front of his two young children. Art specialist Damian Brenninkmeyer, 42, former head of the Old Masters department at Christie's auction house, first started beating his wife of ten years, Fiona, when the couple were on their honeymoon and she was eight months pregnant with their first child. The history of violence came to light after the Kingston-upon-Thames resident flew into a rage and lashed out at his 40-year-old wife as he drove her and their two daughters, aged five and seven, along a busy road in west London on July 7 this year. Damian Brenninkmeyer (left) arrives at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court in London today for sentencing after he slapped his wife Fiona (right) in the car in front of their two children . Just two days earlier he had been given a police caution for assaulting his wife by dousing her with water at their luxury home, magistrates were told. Brenninkmeyer, a member of the Dutch dynasty that owns the C&A chain store, admitted assaulting his wife. However, he was handed a four month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court. He was also made the subject of a restraining order, banning him from contacting his wife and from their family home in Fulham for six months. He was also ordered to take a domestic violence rehabilitation course and told to pay £120 in costs. Helen Clutton, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Brenninkmeyer says that she has been a victim of domestic violence since she was pregnant with her first child. 'When she was eight months pregnant . they were on their honeymoon when he hit her, put his hand round her . neck and pushed her onto the bed and hit her.' But Brenninkmeyer insists he is desperate to save his marriage. Brenninkmeyer, 42, is the former head of the Old Masters department at Christie's auction house (pictured) The court heard he was fuming at his spouse for calling the police two days before and hit her across the face as a 'punishment' in front of their two young daughters as they were driving to his mother-in-law’s Buckinghamshire home. Just two days before the attack he had returned home in a violent temper and doused his wife with water, causing her to flee and hide from him in the bedroom, the court heard. He shouted at his wife ‘I want to . punish you for what you did to me’ and had earlier warned her: ‘I’m . going to break your phone and tell the accountant not to allow you to . have another.’ She pleaded . with him to stop, begging him: ‘Please calm down for the kids!’ But he . bashed his fist against the steering wheel and hit her across the face. His wife then fled the car at a service station and broke down in tears with her two children. The art expert was handed a four month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, at Hammersmith Magistrates¿ Court . Describing the attack, Mrs Clutton said: 'She could sense that Mr Brenninkmeyer was in a bad mood, but he assured her everything was going to be okay and that he wasn’t angry with her. 'They were driving along the Fulham Palace Road when he became aggressive towards her and shouted: ‘I want to punish you for what you did to me’. 'The children were in the car when he was saying this and they were awake. 'He said ‘I’m going to break your phone and tell the accountant not to allow you another one.' She pleaded with him to calm down 'for the children' but the art specialist lashed out and hit her against her right cheek as he drove 'erratically' down the road. Mrs Clutton said: 'He grabbed her phone and grabbed her sunglasses and threw them out of the window. 'Throughout the journey the right of her face was throbbing and she could see bruising.' His wife then fled out of the car at Beaconsfield services and broke down in tears. But she eventually got back into the car and returned home after Mr Brenninkmeyer said: ‘Why don’t you get back in the car? You’re causing a scene.' The couple returned home but another row erupted that night when Brenninkmeyer discovered his wife had taken money from their joint account to pay a cleaner and he pushed her down on to a sofa. Sentencing him, District Judge Andrew Sweet said the time Mr Brenninkmeyer spent in custody was 'nothing in comparison with what you put your wife through'. 'He has anger management issue he is addressing. Given the right circumstances, he hopes his marriage can be saved' - Mark Haslam, in mitigation . He added: 'An aggravating feature is that your children were in the car. 'What they are thinking, we don’t know. It is all about you exercising power in your relationship in a bullying way.' Mark Haslam, in mitigation, said his client was on medication and was desperate to save his marriage. Mr Halsam said Brenninkmeyer 'bitterly regretted' assaulting his wife 'especially in front of the children'. He said: 'He has anger management issue he is addressing. 'Given the right circumstances, he hopes his marriage can be saved.' He also said that spending two nights in custody was 'a salutary experience, especially for a man of his background'. Brenninkmeyer, who pleaded guilty to assault at an earlier hearing, stood with his head bowed as the judge passed sentence. Speaking with a hint of a Dutch accent, he only spoke to confirm his name, age and address and refuse to comment as he left court this afternoon. The court heard how Mr Brenninkmeyer’s wife has declared she wants a six month 'cooling off period' during which time she won’t see her husband. Brenninkmeyer, who is living with his father, will continue to see their two children. His sister Chantal is a 'trusted' friend and relative who will mediate between the couple, the court heard. Brenninkmeyer worked at Christie’s until 2010 and has also previously worked for London auctioneers Bonhams & Butterfields. He is currently the London director of Vienna auction house Dorotheum, has been undergoing treatment for anxiety.","Damian Brenninkmeyer hit wife on honeymoon while she was pregnant .

More than 100 Bulgarian lawmakers and ministers were trapped inside their Parliament building today by protesters calling for the government to resign. The politicians in the Bulgarian capital Sofia had to call riot police who pushed away protesters and formed a corridor with their shields to allow those who had been trapped inside since yesterday to get out of the building. They had been blockaded for more than eight hours by demonstrators seeking to oust the left-leaning government which has only been in office since May. Scroll down for video . Bulgarian politicians had to be freed by riot police after they were trapped in Parliament by angry demonstrators . Riot police were brought in to break the blockade after an earlier attempt to get the politicians out by bus failed . Anti-government protests in Sofia have been going on for 40 days, and escalated yesterday evening as several hundred demonstrators trapped 109 people - including three ministers, some 30 lawmakers and their staff - inside Parliament. Police had tried to escort the officials out by bus on Tuesday, but protesters blocked the vehicle hurling stones at it. Seven protesters and two police officers were treated in hospital for head wounds. The Socialist-backed government took office after early elections in May, following the resignation of the previous cabinet amid anti-austerity protests. The government commands only 120 seats in the 240-seat Parliament and has to rely on the support from a nationalist party. The appointment of controversial media mogul Delyan Peevski as head of the national security agency sparked this wave of protests. The appointment was immediately revoked but demonstrators insist the government is corrupt and must resign. Recent public-opinion polls show they are supported by about two-thirds of Bulgaria's 7.3 million people, who have the lowest incomes in the European Union. Demonstrators were pulled out of the way to allow a bus with politicians on out of the buiding - the attempt failed . Police initially tried to get the politicians out in a bus but the demonstrators hurled rocks at it . President Rosen Plevneliev issued a statement calling on the protesters to keep the demonstrations 'peaceful and civilised.' 'For the first time since the start of the protests we have now witnessed tension and attempts for provocation,' Plevneliev said, urging the protesters to restrain from any acts which increased the tension and breach public order. He also called on the police to help keep the protest peaceful.","More than 100 people trapped in the building in capital Sofia overnight .

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 20:03 EST, 9 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:44 EST, 10 November 2012 . The dramatic resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus on Friday threatens to undermine next week's hearings into the deadly attack at the U.S. Consulate in Libya, at which he was scheduled to testify. Petraeus resigned as head of the CIA following revelations he had engaged in an extramarital affair and acknowledging that he 'showed extremely poor judgment'. The highly-decorated general, 60, had recently traveled to Libya and the Middle East, and was to testify about the Benghazi attack next week behind closed doors to the House and Senate intelligence committees. Bad timing: Petraeus' resignation comes at a sensitive time; the CIA chief was slated to testify at the Benghazi hearings next week . Fears have also emerged as his resignation comes at an extremely sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. Shocking: Petraeus resigned after an FBI investigation on his biographer Paula Broadwell was revealed . It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday. Petraeus had led the CIA for only 14 months. His sudden departure threatened to usher in a period of instability at the spy agency, which is grappling with a leveling off in its budget after a decade of steady increases. The agency is also fending off questions about its performance before and after the attack that led to the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. officials insisted that the CIA's handling of the Benghazi incident had nothing to do with Petraeus' decision to resign. The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world. Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the Sept. 11 attacks on the consulate in Benghazi. According to the New York Times, Petraeus told the White House of the affair, only one day after Obama secured a second term in the White House. The president did not immediately accept it, aides told the Times, and only reluctantly agreed to it on Friday. Under attack: An armed man waves his rifle as buildings and cars are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the US consulate compound in Benghazi late on September 11 . Horrific: Two days after the attack, a Libyan man shows that the bloodstains on the column are from one the American staff members who grabbed the edge of the structure . Ruins: A Libyan man investigates the inside of the U.S. Consulate, after the attack; this was only part of the damage incurred to the compound . News Corps’ Rupert Murdoch was one of masses who took to Twitter to voice his opinion. The 81-year-old Aussie wrote: ‘Petraeus resignation. Timing, everything suspicious. There has to be more to this story.’ Chiming in with her own conspiracy theory, conservative talk show radio host Laura Ingraham wrote: ‘CIA Chief Petraus resignation…something about this stinks to high heaven.’ She added: ‘COINCIDENCE?! Petraeus is set to testify NEXT week at a closed door session on Capitol Hill about Benghazi. Did BHO push him out? This stinks!’ But some, like Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, reacted to the news in a very forgiving fashion. ‘Turns out Petraeus is (sic) human being. And of course we definitely can’t have human beings in government!’ she wrote. Highly suspicious? News Corp's Rupert Murdoch said that the timing of this was 'suspicious' Suspicious: Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham tweeted her leering suspicion over the timing of Petraeus' resignation . For the director of the CIA, being engaged in an extramarital affair is considered a serious breach of security and a counterintelligence threat. If a foreign government had learned of the affair, the reasoning goes, Petraeus or the person with whom he was involved could have been blackmailed or otherwise compromised. Military justice considers conduct such as an extramarital affair to be possible grounds for court martial. Failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank-and-file that such behavior is acceptable. At FBI headquarters, spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the information that the affair had been discovered in the course of an investigation by the bureau. Gone: U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was killed along with three other Americans in the attack; an autopsy revealed he died of smoke inhalation . Victims: From left to right, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods were also killed in the violent attacks . In a statement from the president, Obama said, 'I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission.' But there is no indication that he broke any agency rule in connection with his admitted affair, sources familiar with the matter said. The CIA has no broad rule banning officials from engaging in extramarital affairs, though if discovered, liaisons by CIA personnel with suspected foreign agents would pose security problems for a U.S. spy. Obama, who accepted Petraeus' resignation in a phone call with him Friday afternoon, said that Michael Morell, the agency's long-time deputy director, would serve as acting CIA chief. Morell, who is well respected at both the White House and on Capitol Hill, had previously served as acting director following the departure of former CIA chief Leon Panetta. He is a leading candidate to be Petraeus' permanent successor, sources said. Other possible candidates being discussed on Capitol Hill include John Brennan, Obama's chief counter-terrorism adviser; Obama national security adviser Thomas Donilon; and former congresswoman Jane Harman, who chaired the House intelligence committee. Classified: A redacted copy of an email discussing the attack of the Benghazi, Libya mission two hours after it happened . Stepping up: Michael Morell, the current CIA deputy director, will serve as acting director and will testify at next week's Benghazi closed-door hearings . Petraeus' resignation also adds a new vacancy on Obama's national security team. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said she will leave after Obama's first term, and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is widely expected to leave as well. Petraeus' wife, Holly, has been an advocate for U.S. veterans and head of the Office of Servicemember Affairs at the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Last month, Petraeus and Holly appeared together at a reception at the Canadian Embassy in Washington to celebrate the premiere of the Ben Affleck film 'Argo,' which chronicles a successful operation in which the CIA and Canadian diplomats smuggled a group of U.S. officials out of Tehran during the 1979-80 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. In a letter to the CIA workforce, Petraeus said that he met with Obama at the White House on Thursday and asked 'to be allowed, for personal reasons, to resign from my position.' 'After being married for 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair,' he wrote. 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.' Saddened: White House aides said that President Obama did not immediately accept Petraeus' resignation, but later wished him the best, 'I wish (he and his wife Holly) the very best at this difficult time' Reliable: Then-President George W. Bush, right, was very close to Petraeus, left, who was then in charge of the Iraq War . Obama, who was re-elected to a second term on Tuesday, said in a statement that he accepted Petraeus' resignation, praising him for his work at the CIA and for leading U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The sudden and dramatic turn of events appeared to end the public career of a widely admired man who played a key role in the Iraq war, led the U.S. Central Command and commanded U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Petraeus' name had circulated speculatively as a possible Republican presidential nominee before Obama tapped him as CIA chief. Before taking the CIA post, he retired as an Army general after nearly four decades of military service.","Gen David Petraeus, who held CIA director post for only 14 months, dramatically announced resignation Friday .

University of Southern California students claim in a federal complaint that the school has ignored or mishandled dozens of sexual assault cases, including one case in which a woman was allegedly told by campus police that her rape report was groundless because the assailant did not orgasm. 'Because he stopped, it was not rape,' the student was allegedly told by a Department of Public Safety detective, according to the complaint, which details similar stories from more than 100 other students. 'Even though his penis penetrated your vagina, because he stopped, it was not a crime,' the detective allegedly said. As a result, the woman's case was not referred to the Los Angeles Police Department, the complaint says.

Ariella Mostov said officials ignored her claims that she was sexually assaulted and that afterwards, she was forced to attend classes with the suspect for an entire semester . The U.S. Department of Education is launching a federal investigation into the woman's claims, along with the dozens of other allegations lodged against the school in the 110-page complaint.
