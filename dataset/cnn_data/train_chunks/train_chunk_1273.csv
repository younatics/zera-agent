"Fasting diets like the popular 5:2 regime may make you live longer, but experts have warned they could leave you more susceptible to infection. The extreme diet, which involves drastically reducing calorie intake for two days a week, has been widely credited with weight loss, longer lifespans and lowering blood pressure. But scientists at the University of Bath - who have spent the last year testing their theory on fruit flies - have warned the diets could lead to a 20 per cent increase in infections. Experts discovered that the genes in flies which are activated by a fungal infection are very similar or identical to the genes activated in people when they restrict their diet. Scroll down for video . Experts at the University of Bath have warned fasting regimes, like the popular 5:2 diets, may make you live longer but they leave people more susceptible to infections . When the flies were exposed to the fungal disease their lives were extended by around 14 per cent, but worryingly their susceptibility to infection increased by 20 per cent. The scientists warned extreme dieters could be experiencing the same reaction to fasting as the flies do to the fungal disease, so should be aware of the 'trade off' when following the diets long term. Dr Nick Priest, lecturer in biology and biochemistry who led the study, said: 'Many studies have documented benefits of diet restriction, but there is a lack of data on levels of illness in people administered these anti-ageing treatments. The new study found the risk of infection in fruit flies, rose 20 per cent when they were subjected to fasting . 'We know that certain stresses such as starvation or exposure to pathogens can extend life and increase fertility, but we have found that ironically this has a trade-off in terms of immune function. 'Our findings are not all that surprising. We have known for decades that starved mice are more likely to succumb to serious infections. 'But, there has been a lot more interest in the short term benefits than potential long-term costs. 'There are clear health benefits to diets such as the 5:2 regime, but we need to bear in mind there are side effects. 'It shows that even the fountain of youth should come with a warning label.' Dr Priest and his team discovered three years ago that a fungal pathogen made fruit flies live 14 per cent longer by activating the same 'stress' and 'immunity' genes which responded to fasting in humans. But for the last year they have used 30,000 flies to discover that the same flies become 20 per cent more likely to catch an infection than flies which were not exposed to the life-lengthening fungus. He said more work needs to be done to establish why and how extreme diets leads to more infections. He added: 'This is the aspect that people haven't studied. 'We know that when we have friends that go on crazy diets there can be massive changes in physiology. 'There is lots of evidence to say that in ideal condition animals live much longer with restricted diets calorie intakes, but our study shows there is a good reason for that - the trade off for that occuring is the suppressing of the immune system.'","Experts at the University of Bath found fasting diets increased the risk of infection by 20 per cent .

"Swansea striker Wilfried Bony returns to Anfield on Monday night, seven years after his first visit to Merseyside. Taking on Liverpool as the Premier League's top scorer in 2014 - having netted 20 times this calendar year - Bony will be keen to add to his tally against the club who rejected him. The Ivory Coast international spent two weeks on trial with Rafa Bentiez's Liverpool in 2007 but failed to impress and was not offered a contract. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony returns to Anfield on Monday, seven years after his first visit to Liverpool . Former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez had Bony on trial in 2007 but decided against signing the young striker . Having failed to impress Liverpool, Bony earned a move to  Sparta Prague in the Czech Republic later that year . Bony caught the eye of Premier League clubs after scoring 46 goals in 65 matches for Dutch side Vitesse . Wilfried Bony - 20 . Sergio Aguero - 18 . Yaya Toure - 17 . Wayne Rooney - 16 . Edin Dzeko - 14 . Daniel Sturridge - 13 . However, eventually earning a move to Europe with  Sparta Prague, Bony proved his credentials in front of goal with the Czech giants before finally catching the eye of Premier League clubs with 46 goals in 65 league matches for Dutch Eredivisie side Vitesse Arnhem. Joining Swansea for £12million in 2013, Bony has since become one of the English top flight's most lethal marksmen. Having scored against Liverpool during the Swans' 4-3 defeat last season, Bony admits it was nice to find the back of the net against the club who decided against signing him as a teenager. Striker Bony scored on his return to Anfield during Swansea's 4-3 defeat to Liverpool last season . Bony is mobbed by his Swansea team-mates during the Premier League clash on Merseyside in February . Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Bony said: 'I scored there [against Liverpool at Anfield] last season and it was nice because I had been on trial there when I was younger. I was there for two weeks in 2007 when Rafa Benitez was the manager. 'They wanted to see what sort of a player I was and it was amazing as a young guy to get the chance to use facilities like that and to see a stadium like that. 'I remember sitting up in the stand there watching a game and I enjoyed the chance to go and play there because it was my first experience of English football. 'It is always nice to score at places where you have been and you were not able to make it. It's not that you have a particular point to prove, you always have a point to prove in football, but it is nice.' Bony admits it was 'nice' to score against Liverpool having failed to make the grade during his trial at Anfield . Now 26, Bony was in fact the subject of interest from Liverpool during the summer transfer window and how Brendan Rodgers' side could do with the Swans frontman they will come up against on Monday. Without last season's dynamic striking duo of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge - the former now a Barcelona player and the latter sidelined through injury - Liverpool have managed to find the net just 22 times this season. Compare that to the 44 goals the Reds had scored at the same stage of last season and it's not difficult to work out why they are struggling in mid-table. A summer move for Bony may have seen a much bigger total in Liverpool's 'Goals For' column but instead they will have to do all they can to stop 2014's top scorer. Liverpool have been interested in Bony in the past and the striker would surely  improve the Reds' goal tally . Liverpool have struggled for goals this season without the   partnership of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge . Having dropped goalkeeper Simon Mignolet - only to reinstate the Belgian following an injury to Brad Jones at Burnley on Boxing Day - Liverpool boss Rodgers will be desperate for his leaky defence to tighten up against the Swansea No 10, fully aware of the test that lies ahead for his backline. Bony will be relishing the opportunity to add to the 20 goals he has netted in the last 12 months; particularly against a defence struggling to keep goals out. It's his goals which have earned the striker plaudits but those who watch him week in, week out at the Liberty Stadium will tell you there is much more to Bony's game than just finding the back of the net. Built like a giant with tree trunks for legs, Bony has  boasted a muscular physique since his early playing days - as seen during his time on the field in Prague - and uses it to his advantage. Frontman Bony leads the line for Swansea and provides a huge presence up front for Garry Monk's side . Bony holds off the challenge of Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph during Swansea's  Boxing Day victory . At ease with his back to goal, holding the ball up for his Swansea team-mates and providing a huge presence as he leads the line,  Bony - who has created 35 chances this year - would aide any team in the Premier League. Of course, having developed during eight years in Europe, Bony is a much improved player to the one that first visited Liverpool as a promising 18-year-old striker. However, now Bony is one of the Premier League's most potent attackers, it would make sense for Liverpool to make another beeline for the one that got away. Especially if the striker impresses during his latest Anfield audition.","Swansea City face Liverpool in the Premier League on Monday night .

"Think you know what everyone else says about your state? Maybe you should ask Google. One enterprising blogger has and got some surprising and - some might say - less surprising results. As part of her research into stereotypes, Renee DiResta hit on a clever idea to find out what people think about different U.S. states. Boring: For 18 U.S. states (shaded purple) autocomplete included 'boring' among the top searched words . She began typing the names into Google and used the search engine's autocomplete function to complete the query. So, for example, she asked 'why is . Georgia so' and Google's algorithm, which tries to predict the next word . based on popular searches, did the rest. The result showed what people ask most . about a state. In Indiana's case they want to know why it's so . 'boring', and the same with Maine. Georgia is 'hot', 'racist', and also . 'boring'. Oregon is 'liberal', 'weird', 'rainy', and again, 'boring'. Ohio is also 'boring', but 'important in the primaries'. Why is ... so obese? States with 'obese' among popular searched terms include Texas, Tennessee and West Virginia, where obesity is most prevalent . When DiResta used the . formula of 'Why is Arizona so ...?' the terms that popped up included . 'hot', 'racist', 'conservative' and 'crazy'. West Virginia also didn't come out well, the top suggested search terms included 'poor', 'racist', 'fat' and 'weird'. When a user types a word into the Google search box, the autocomplete algorithm offers search terms based on what is entered. For example, if someone starts to type 'new york', autocomplete will offer searches for 'New York City,' 'New York Times,' and 'New York University' based on the first word. Queries are algorithmically determined based on a number of purely algorithmic factors (including popularity of search terms) without human intervention. Source: Support.google.com . According to recently released Gallup . research, West Virgina was ranked the least livable state based on low . unemployment, appalling obesity rates and lack of economic growth. For 18 states, the common search term associated with them was 'boring'. Among those considered snoozeworthy included Idaho, Montana. But Google wasn't all negative. When the state of Colorado was searched, autocomplete terms that appeared were: 'cold', 'healthy', 'skinny' and 'awesome'. Venture capitalist DiResta, a recent New York transplant to San Francisco, said in  her blog about the experiment: . 'I started wondering, how do Americans really think about ""those . people"" in other states? What are the most common stereotypes?' 'The qualitative searches were most interesting to me. There are 12 unique terms that are classifiable as ""culture/sentiment"" queries, of which ten are negative: backwards, bad, boring, crazy, dangerous, hated, racist, stupid, trashy, weird. 'There were a few redeeming positive results; Colorado, Minnesota, Texas, and Vermont are ""awesome,"" and Montana, New Hampshire, and New York are ""great"". 'But for the most part, it doesn’t seem like we think very nice things about each other… at the very least, we’re more inclined to search for articles supporting (or related to) negative biases. 'The single most common result of all was ""boring,"" which appeared for 18 states with no particular regional concentration. Other popular terms (returned for >10 states) were ""humid"", ""windy"", ""expensive"", and ""liberal"". 'Strangely, Connecticut and Pennsylvania both returned ""haunted""; apparently there are a lot of ghost sightings (and related walking tours). 'My favorite result of all was ""enchanting"": New Mexico is beautiful.'","Research shows people ask search engine why Georgia is so 'racist'

"Whitehall staff have been ordered to take down ‘inappropriate’ Diamond Jubilee bunting and scolded for breaking health and safety rules by ‘standing on tables and chairs’ to put it up. In an extraordinary leaked email, workers in the Cabinet Office and the Treasury are told that it is ‘clearly not sensible’ to have put up Jubilee decorations. They are also warned that it is ‘potentially embarrassing’ for the Government if office walls are revealed to be ‘strewn with non-work-related posters and notices’ – and further reprimanded for using colour printers to make the decorations in breach of eco-friendly workplace rules. Still flying the flag: Bunting remains at the Treasury despite the stern edict against bunting . Staff are told bunting must be removed – though they are warned that they ‘shouldn’t attempt to take it down themselves’ and advised to call a helpdesk. One member of staff said the message had . initially been assumed to be a joke but had caused widespread anger . when it was established that it was genuine. The Government has launched a concerted . effort to rein in Britain’s health and safety culture, making the . message leaked to the Daily Mail from the heart of Whitehall still more . embarrassing. Last night, after the Mail brought the . warning to the attention of Chancellor George Osborne, the edict was . overruled. He told staff that they should ignore the instructions and . encouraged them to ‘cover the building’ with Jubilee bunting. Staff were warned that non-work-related posters should be removed from offices to avoid potential embarrassment for the Government . A policeman stands guard in front of the bunting-adorned Number 10 front door . Despite the banning of bunting elsewhere in Whitehall, Downing Street displayed its colours with pride at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations this weekend . An aide to Mr Osborne said: ‘As loyal servants to Her Majesty, the Chancellor was delighted to hear officials have got into the Jubilee spirit in such a way. The bunting is still up and is staying up.' Employment minister Chris Grayling, who is responsible for health and safety law, said: ‘No one anywhere in the country should feel that they can’t have bunting and decorations up to celebrate the Jubilee. Health and safety law is all about protecting people in high-risk workplaces. It is not about ruining the fun of the Jubilee.’ Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This is typical of the killjoys and jobsworths that pervade parts of Whitehall and the civil service.’ The email was sent on Thursday by Sue Morris, head of ‘supplier management’ at an organisation named Joint Workplace Solutions, a division of the Treasury. Larry the Downing Street cat appears to do his best to comply with the Whitehall edict to remove 'inappropriate bunting' Addressing staff on a shared floor of the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, she  wrote: ‘I note that some of the teams have decorated the area with bunting that has been strung from the ceiling and light fittings. I assume this was put up by standing on tables and chairs – clearly not sensible from a H&S aspect and not something we want to encourage. ‘It’s also not appropriate to tie anything to the light fittings. As well as the H&S concerns, the appearance of this isn’t appropriate to a professional workplace – particularly a multi-occupancy building like this. The bunting needs to be removed and I’d be grateful if you could speak to whoever is responsible. However staff shouldn’t attempt to take it down themselves – please ensure that they call the helpdesk instead.’ Mrs Morris expressed further concern that some of the Jubilee decorations appeared to have been made from ‘A4 coloured printed pages which I assume have been produced on the Flex printers’. She added: ‘If this is the case, then could you also please remind your colleagues that that’s not an appropriate use of these fairly expensive resources … colour printing needs to be used sparingly and only for work purposes.’","Leaked email tells Cabinet Office and Treasury staff that Jubilee decorations are 'clearly not sensible'

"Most people hop, skip and jump out of the way when a bee is in site. But this 22ft-high man-made hive allows those with a curious nature to step inside and watch how the fastidious creatures produce their honey - with little risk of getting stung. Students at The State University of New York created the stainless steel tower for a project. More than 5,000 bees reside in this man-made hive, which is 22ft high. The insects produce more than five gallons of honey over the spring and summer . The impressive tower is made from stainless steel and was built on reclaimed land in Buffalo for an environmental project . The project will act as an important conservation exercise for bees in the wake of their dropping numbers . Called Hive City, it is home to 5,000 bees, who produce an incredible five gallons of honey in the spring and summer months by flying up to five miles to collect pollen from local wild flowers. It was built on formally abandoned land in Buffalo and is designed so human visitors can watch the bees go about their business in the hive. Designer Courtney Creenan, 26, explained the idea behind the giant home for bees. A child takes a look inside the impressive tower, which only holds one person at a time . The students say people soon lose their fear of the insects when they enter the tower . With the sheer volume of bees inside, it is no surprise a few strays seep outside . The students, from the State University of New York, reckon they have become bee enthusiasts for life since the tower went up . The bees travel up to five miles to get pollen from flowers before heading back to the hive to produce their honey . 'We won a competition to design a habitat for a large bee colony that needed to be relocated,' he said. 'The entry to the bee cab is approximately ten feet off the ground which keeps the bees separated from their human visitors as well as protected from any animal predators. 'Visitors are timid when they first enter Hive City because of the stigma of being stung. Scientists have been concerned for some time about the dwindling bee population . America is one of the largest consumers of honey in the world . Bees are one of the most important creatures in the food chain and without them, scores of other species wouldn't survive . 'However, once inside the fear is usually overcome and rarely do humans come in contact with the bees. 'When people go inside, sunlight streams through the triangular perforations in the steel and makes for a beautiful, atmospheric experience. 'Our team has become amateur bee keepers and we have assumed care for them since their move. 'We did work with a professional bee keeper, who moved them into their new home. 'Hive City is meant to be a symbol of the economic and ecological transformation of the site.'","Structure was designed by students in Buffalo, New York ."
"A British paleontologist has discovered not one, but two new species of dinosaur while studying fossils in a Canadian museum. Dr Nick Longrich was examining fossilised bones from two horned dinosaurs, which had been kept in the Canadian Museum of Nature for 75 years. And he found that, while they had previously been classified as a species from Canada, they more closely resembled dinosaurs from the American south west - suggesting they are a new species. This illustration shows Pentaceratops aquilonius, a new species of dinosaur discovered by a British paleontologist in a Canadian museum. Dr Nick Longrich was examining fossilised bones from two horned dinosaurs, which had been kept in the Canadian Museum of Nature for 75 years, when he made the finding . The fossils had previously been classified as Anchiceratops and Chasmosaurus, species known to be from Canada, but now that classification may need to be changed. One represents a new species of Pentaceratops, said Dr Longrich, named Pentaceratops aquilonius - a buffalo-sized plant-eating dinosaur from around 75 million years ago. The second appears to be a new species of Kosmoceratops, a dinosaur with an ornate skull from Utah, though more complete fossils are needed to confirm this. Back in September, scientists announced they had discovered a supermassive dinosaur measuring 85ft (26m) long and weighing 59,300kg (about 65 tons). The skeleton of the Dreadnoughtus schrani, seven times bigger than T-Rex, was also the most complete skeleton ever found of its type, with more than 70 per cent of its bones - excluding the head. Because all previously discovered supermassive dinosaurs are only known from partial remains, Dreadnoughtus offers an unprecedented window into the largest animals to ever walk on Earth. Dr Longrich, from the University of Bath, said his find revealed dinosaur species from the region were much more diverse than previously thought. 'We thought we had discovered most of the species, but it seems there are many undiscovered dinosaurs left,' said Dr Longrich, from the university's Department of Biology & Biochemistry. 'The total dinosaur diversity must have been extraordinarily high. 'We've really only just scratched the surface.' Pentaceratops was a smaller cousin of Triceratops, belonging to a group of large, horned dinosaurs with a long brow horn and elongate frills called the Chasmosaurinae. The dinosaurs were based in western North America at the end of the Cretaceous Period, around 75 million years ago. Up until now, ten Chasmosaur species have been recognised from that period, with distinct species occurring in the northern and southern parts of the continent. Dr Longrich believes that, although distinct northern and southern provinces existed, there was contact between them. Dinosaurs would spread from one part of the continent to the other, then diverge to form new species. Competition between the different species then prevented the dinosaurs from moving between the northern and southern regions. Pictured here is the fossil previously believed to be Anchiceratops ornatus at the Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Ontario. But Dr Longrich said it may have been classified incorrectly . This image shows what was previously thought to be Chasmosaurus russelli. Dr Longrich said his find revealed dinosaur species from North America were much more diverse than had been previously thought . 'The distribution of dinosaur species was very different from the patterns seen in living mammals,' Dr Longrich said. 'In living mammals, there tend to be relatively few large species, and they have large ranges. With Cretaceous dinosaurs, we see a lot of large species in a single habitat. 'They also tend to be very regional - as you move from one habitat to another you get a completely different set of species.' The patterns help explain why paleontologists keep finding more species, as they discover them when examining different habitats. Dr Longrich believes such patterns are caused by dinosaur biology. 'In this sense, dinosaur biology seems quite different from mammal biology,' he said. 'It could be that mammals are more intelligent and so they tend to have more flexible behaviour, and adapt their behaviour to their habitat . 'On the other hand, dinosaurs may have had to adapt themselves physically to survive in a different habitat, and evolved new species.' Dr Longrich's study appears in the academic journal Cretaceous Research.","Dr  Longrich from Bath University has discovered new species of dinosaur .

"Shocking footage has emerged of an Ohio woman handcuffed and charged with resisting arrest after sheriff’s deputies pinned her down on the floor pried open her mouth to retrieve a Tylenol tablet. Surveillance video shows Siobhan Householder, 35, of Akron, being confronted last week by a police officer after she took the prescription medication – the altercation left her injured and arrested. Householder was in a holding area while waiting to make a court appearance when she took the medication for a tooth infection, she told the Akron Beacon-Journal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forced to the ground: Siobhan Householder is shown on the ground as the sheriff's deputy tries to force her mouth open . How it started: The deputy rushes over and grabs Householder's mouth shortly after she takes the pill . 'It was terrible': Householder says her mouth was left bloody and bruised after the incident . The mother of three says the incident left her with bruises to her chin and legs, cuts on the inside of her mouth and hair loss. There is no audio in the video, but what happens is very clear – Householder puts a pill in her mouth and the Summit County sheriff’s deputy bolts towards the woman to stop her from swallowing it. ‘He said, ‘What are you taking?’ and I said, Tylenol,’ she recalled to the paper. ‘And he said, ‘Spit it out’ and I said, ‘I can’t.’ I meant to say I can’t spit it out because I had already swallowed the other pills. ‘But I didn’t even get that part out before he just yanked me up and threw me down on the ground and was trying to dig these pills out of mouth,’ Householder continued. The video shows the officer grab the woman while her purse and prescription pill bottle fall to the floor. ‘There was one [pill] in there and I couldn’t even get it out because he kept shoving his hand in my mouth and squeezing my face and pulling my hair at the same time,’ she said. Scuffle: The woman's purse and pill bottle tumble to the floor as she struggles with the deputy . Pinned: He then pins her to the floor and reaches for her mouth . Watchful eye: Another deputy looks on as the struggle continues . Helping hand: A separate deputy then helps hold the woman down while the original officer pulls Householder's hair as he tries to force the pill out of her mouth . The officer then grabs the mother of three by the back of the head and tries to force her mouth open. ‘He was pulling down on my bottom lip and squeezing my face at the same time,’ said Householder. ‘He basically pulled my lip away from my teeth.’ More deputies pile into the room – there were at least five visible at one point – as the officer trying to force the pill out of Householder’s mouth examines the prescription bottle that fell to the floor. They hold the woman down as one officer pulls out handcuffs and slaps them on her wrists as they frisk her. ‘They were acting like I wanted to escape from Alcatraz. It was awful,’ she lamented. The search yielded nine prescription Tylenol and two diazepam tablets, police said. Also found were an additional 26 ibuprofen tablets the woman kept in a sandwich bag. Householder disputes police assertions they found three additional unknown pills in a latex glove. Drawing to an end: The second deputy is seen gesturing to the left while still helping hold the mother of three down . Finally over: Five deputies are in the room (one is off camera) as Householder is handcuffed and arrested . A sheriff’s office spokesperson told the paper that Householder was taken into custody earlier in the day on a warrant for failure to appear for a domestic relations case. ‘While taking Ms. Householder into custody, Deputy Vaughan witnessed her attempt to ingest several pills,’ said the spokesperson. ‘He restrained her for her safety and she was transported to a local hospital where she was treated and released.’ The bruised woman says she showed up to the courthouse May 8 on her own and was unaware she was in any kind of custody, that she felt free to take pills. Householder was treated for a bloody mouth and handed summonses for resisting arrest and obstructing official business. An internal affairs investigation remains ongoing, authorities said. It is not clear if Householder will sue the department, and a message left by MailOnline seeking further comment from her was not immediately returned. No drug charges were filed.","Siobhan Householder, 35, was in a holding room while waiting to make a court appearance last week when the incident occurred .

"Many families outlaw politics at the dinner table, but food is far from common ground on which Republic and and Democrats can agree. A new study published in the Wall Street Journal has revealed which fast food joints, chain restaurants and grocery stores conservatives and liberal prefer. Experion Marketing Services surveyed thousands of Americans across the country, asking them both their political identity and what food establishments they frequent. Red-meat lovers: Conservatives appear to favor the traditional American food available at pub-style eatery O'Charley's, southern country kitchen Cracker Barrel and Longhorn's steakhouse . Around the world: The favorite restaurant chains of liberals were more ethnic, including Italian, Mexican and Asian cuisines . The most conservative chain restaurant: O'Charley's is a casual bar and restaurant chain with locations throughout the South and Midwest . Most liberal chain restaurant: Democrats can't resist a slice from California Pizza Kitchen . Each store included in the survey was then given a score, with the number 100 being average. A score of 120 was 20 per cent more liberal or conservative than average and scores below 100 meant it was less liberal or conservative than average. Restaurants and supermarkets with scores far below 100 were favored more by independents. While some of the results were surprising, like sub sandwich chain Blimpie's being a favorite of liberals, most of the results adhered strongly to regional biases. For example, the most popular supermarket for conservatives is Randall's which is based in Texas - a strong red state. Southern stores: The results for grocery stores was somewhat unsurprising, considering supermarkets vary regionally. However, Foodtown's inclusion in the top-five conservative stores is interesting considering the market is found mostly in blue-leaning New York and New Jersey . Whole Foods and Trader Joe's are popular stores in major metropolitan areas which tend to skew liberal. Fred Meyer is a Pacific Northwest store, while ACME is found mainly in Pennsylvania. Safeway is the second-largest grocery chain in North America . Most conservative grocery store: Right-wingers grab their groceries at Randall's, which is based mostly in Texas . Most liberal grocery store: Whole Foods grocery stores are popular in major metropolitan areas across the country, and sale mostly organic products . The favored grocery store for liberals on the other hand, is Whole Foods which is popular in major metropolitan area across the country and hubs for Democrats. However, some of the restaurants have a noted political identity, such as Chipotle. The Mexican chain has a company ethos to use animal products that have been raised in a humane way and locally source ingredients. Chick-fil-A has also appealed to the strongest conservatives in recent years on the topic of same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A is a notable conservative fast food joint, since it's COO caused controversy for making statements against gay-marriage . Chipotle has a company mission to sell locally sourced ingredients and only meat that has been humanely raised . Most conservative fast food chain: Southern favorite Krystal is famous for its slider burgers . The most liberal fast food chain: Liberals get their morning coffee and croissants on the go at Au Bon Pain . The chain's COO Dan T Cathy caused controversy when he made comments against gay marriage. Cathy said that those who 'have the audacity to define what marriage is about' were 'inviting God's judgement on our nation' Those statemnts caused boycotts at chains across the nation, but many die-hard conservatives countered the protests by showing up in hordes at the restaurants.","Casual restaurant O'Charley's, burger joint Krystal and Texas grocery store chain Randall's are conservative favorites .

"A senior World Rugby head-injuries expert has clashed with the RFU over the presentation of concussion data contained in their annual injury audit. RFU head of medicine Dr Simon Kemp this week published a report drawn up by a Bath University student - which showed reported concussions in professional Rugby Union had risen by more than 400 per cent in the last decade. Kemp, whose position was supported by Premier Rugby and the Rugby Players Association, claims the dramatic rise has been caused by increased awareness of a problem which was highlighted by the shambolic handling of George North’s double head injury in Wales’ RBS Six Nations opener against England. George North puts his hands on his knees and during Wales' 21-16 loss to England at the Millennium Stadium . North (bottom) is inadvertently kicked in the face by England second row Dave Attwood on Friday . But that view is strongly contested by Professor Willie Stewart, who sits on World Rugby’s concussion advisory panel. ‘The underlying trend over 10 years in professional rugby has seen a year-on-year increase in concussions,’ Stewart told the Mail on Sunday. ‘I do not believe this has anything to do with greater awareness of concussion. Instead, it reflects a steady rise in concussion rates over 10 years as on-field collisions have got bigger. ‘People are more aware because the problem is much greater than it ever used to be.’ Attempting to tackle England fullback Mike Brown (centre right), Hibbard's momentum also takes North . North lays poleaxed on the Millennium Stadium turf after the nasty-looking collision on Friday night . The Injury Surveillance Project - formerly known as the Injury Audit - found that 86 concussions were reported last season, a rise of almost 60 per cent from the 2012-13 season. Rugby’s concussion rate of 10.5 per 1000 hours compares to 2.5 in 2002 when Dr Kemp initiated the data project. Professional boxing has a concussion rate of 17.5 per 1000 hours and Dr Kemp admits rugby should brace itself for continued rises in future seasons. There was public outcry last weekend when Wales winger North was allowed to play on despite television replays appearing to show him knocked unconscious on two separate occasions against England. The 22-year-old (left), missing a tackle on Jonathan Joseph, saw his game suffer after the first head injury . North passed the controversial Head Injury Assessment after the first incident and was allowed to carry on playing following the second injury. ‘If North had been a boxer he would have been removed from the arena after his first concussion and taken for neurological assessment,’ said Stewart. ‘A brain-injured boxer would have stood down for a minimum 28 days. ‘I would say the level of brain injury in professional rugby has now become unacceptable,’ Stewart added.","Wales wing George North suffered two head injuries against England .

"A new mother was thrown out of a women’s bathing pond by a female lifeguard because her baby was a boy. Harriet Taylor, 29, and three-month-old Arthur were having a picnic with friends at Kenwood Ladies’ Pond on Hampstead Heath, North-West London. The lifeguard came up and told her to leave because there was a ban on children under eight – and her baby was especially unwelcome because he ‘had a penis’. Scroll down for video . Harriet Taylor was forced to leave the popular bathing by a lifeguard area because her son Arthur is a boy . The guard stood over Miss Taylor – who said she had not seen the sign banning children – as she and her companions packed up, then marched them out. ‘I felt quite upset and embarrassed that she called us out in front of everybody so rudely,’ said Miss Taylor, a research scientist. ‘I can’t think of one occasion since I’ve had Arthur when I’ve been made to feel uncomfortable when out with him or breastfeeding him. I also can’t think of anywhere else I’ve been that would refuse a woman and a breastfeeding child entry.’ Miss Taylor, from Mill Hill, North London, said Arthur was being quiet when the lifeguard came up. ‘She stood over me and, gesturing to Arthur, said, “Children under eight are not allowed here – especially ones with penises”. I was quite upset and shocked. Then she stood over us while we were packing up and escorted us out. ‘The comment she made was so unfair to Arthur as a little baby – he’s not a sexual being.’ The site is owned by the City of London but is run by Kenwood Ladies’ Pond Association, a voluntary group. A spokesperson for the City of London Corporation who manage Hampstead Heath said that no children under the age of eight are allowed to bathe in the pond, pictured,  as the area can be deceptively dangerous and cold . Its website says the pond is supposed to be a ‘quiet, peaceful place for women and girls to bathe, swim and relax’. Miss Taylor, who lives with her partner Stuart Radford, 35, a designer, said the pond should allow new mothers with babies. ‘Kenwood is supposed to be welcoming to women. I’m a breastfeeding mother – I can’t be separated from my son. I understand that they don’t want it to be a child’s playground, but we were just quietly sitting on the grass.’ She was disappointed by the way she was treated during the incident last month. ‘The worst thing was the way the lifeguard spoke to me. I felt that it was not the way to speak to a new mother,’ she said. A spokesman for the City of London Corporation, which manages Hampstead Heath, said: ‘Up to two children aged between eight and 15 are allowed in the Kenwood Ladies’ Pond in the company of an adult but the wild swimming environment is not suitable for children under the age of eight. ‘The Ladies’ Pond can be deceptively dangerous because it has no shallows and is a straight drop into deep, cold, murky water with virtually no visibility. This policy is clearly signposted.’","Harriet Taylor was with her son Arthur in Kenwood Ladies' Pond in London .

"A businessman has vowed to never visit a posh London hotel again after he was charged £75 - for three bottles of water. Edward Heaton was meeting a client at the exclusive Wellesley Hotel in Knightsbridge during the recent heatwave. Instead of a tea or coffee, he ordered three 500ml bottles of San Pellegrino - which typically cost 60p in supermarkets. Scroll down for video . Water joke! Edward Heaton was charged £75 for the three bottles at the Wellesley Hotel in Knightsbridge . Ed Heaton who had to fork out £75 for 3 bottles of water in a restaurant in London . But when the property buying agent asked for the bill he was staggered to be charged £75. It emerged the Wellesley - a five-star hotel which charges £600 a night for a suite - operates a minimum charge of £25 per person when using its bar after 4pm. The water had already cost £5.50 per bottle and there was also a service charge of £8.33. A 'minimum spend' charge of £50.17 was also added, bringing the total to £75. Edward, . who runs property buying firm Heaton and Partners, said: ‘I have no . issue if they have a minimum charge, but they need to make it clear. It . is the lack of transparency that I have a problem with. ‘I . was meeting a client at a hotel. When we sat down, a waitress came over . and took our order. It was a very hot day, around 4pm and we asked for . three bottles of water. ‘There . was no menu, we just gave our order, had the water and then I asked for . a bill. It came to £75 - for three small bottles of water. ‘I . thought it was extraordinary and I quietly asked if it was correct and . they said “yes, there is a minimum order of £25 per person after 4pm”. ‘I didn't . want to make a scene because of the people I was with so I paid the bill . but got in touch with them later to complain. ‘They . were incredibly unapologetic and would not budge, but there were no . menus when we sat down and no one explained the minimum spend.’ The . Wellesley, in Knightsbridge, opened in December 2012 and takes its name . from Sir Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington. Suites cost from £600 and the hotel raves about its terrace, which it calls one of London's finest. But . their customer service has been criticised by Edward, who emailed the . hotel to say he wasn't happy with his experience on July 17. He also . tweeted his thoughts. Luxury hotel: The Wellesley in Knightsbridge, London, where guests are charged a minimum spend fee after 4pm . The hotel . responded by tweeting: ‘Thanks for letting us know. We will make sure . our policy at the Crystal Bar is dazzlingly clear to all in future. All . the best.’ Edward, 44, said: ‘For £75, we probably could have had a nice glass of wine each or maybe even a bottle of champagne. ‘But three bottles of water? I wasn't angry. I was just totally bemused. ‘I spend a lot of time in central London and I have a lot of meetings in the top hotels. I am pretty well versed in how these places work but I have never had this before. ‘I will never set foot in that hotel again.’ Most supermarkets charge around 60p for a 500ml bottle of San Pellegrino, which is a popular brand used in hotels and restaurants. For £75, Ed could have bought 125 bottles or 62.5 litres of the water. A statement from the hotel said: ‘The Wellesley applies a minimum spend of £25 per person as standard after 4pm for guests occupying the hotel's cigar terraces where Mr Edward Heaton held his business meeting on 17 July 2014. ‘Guests are made aware of this policy on arrival and the rates are printed on the menus distributed on the terraces. The minimum spend of £25 per person is comparable to similar venues across London. ‘Mr Heaton did not raise concern at the time of his visit but did send an e-mail of complaint the following week. ‘In response, The Wellesley's management team replied on the same day to offer its sincere apologies to Mr Heaton for an experience he deemed less than satisfactory and we would like to take this opportunity to apologise again. ‘ .","Businessman Edward Heaton was meeting a client at the Wellesley .

"Wolfsburg are lining up a £23million bid for Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle. Jose Mourinho has underlined that the Germany international needs to improve his physical shape and the striker has been placed on a bespoke fitness programme to help cope with the rigours of the Premier League.

"The family of a Georgia man who had Alzheimers and was shot dead in the middle of the night as he knocked on the door of a house, have spoken of their heartbreak that the person who carried out the shooting will not face criminal charges. Joe Hendrix, 35, fatally shot 72-year-old Ronald Westbrook on November 27 last year. The elderly man had slipped from his home as early as 1 a.m. and wandered in the cold and dark for hours until randomly approaching the home of Hendrix's fiancee on a rural cul-de-sac, repeatedly knocking on the door and ringing the bell. Hendrix's fiancee called 911, while Hendrix grabbed his .40-caliber handgun, went outside and confronted Westbrook in the dark. Hendrix told police that he fired four shots after Westbrook ignored commands to stop, identify himself and raise his hands. Heartbroken: Ron Westbrook with his family. His family are struggling to come to terms with his death and are furious that charges will not be brought to the man who shot him dead . Mistaken: Ret. Lt. Col. Ronald Westbrook, 72, who suffered from Alzheimer's Disease was shot in the early morning hours of November 27, 2013. Joe Hendrix who shot him will face no criminal charges. Henderix mistook Westbrook for an intruder when Westbrook tried to enter the home of Hendrix's fiancee just before 4 a.m. District Attorney Herbert 'Buzz' Franklin's office characterized the incident as a 'tragic shooting death' in a written statement. Franklin did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Mr Westbrook's 26-year-old granddaughter, Kimberly Westbook, made her feelings clear on her Facebook page. 'You can get away with anything if you claim you were scared,' Ms. Westbrook said refelecting on the county prosecutors' decision  not to press charges against Hendrix.  'It's Heartbreaking. I've barely stopped crying since I heard the news,' she continued. 'I'm a little upset,' said Deanne Westbrook, the slain man's widow. She said she felt police and prosecutors had done a thorough job. 'I really wanted to see it go before a grand jury, and then maybe before a jury. But they tell me there's not enough evidence for that.' Heartbreaking: I've barely stopped crying since I heard the news said granddaughter Kimberly Westbrook on Facebook . Summing up: 'You can get away with anything if you claim you were scared' wrote Kimberly Westbook, the granddaughter of Ron Westbrook who was shot dead in November . Hendrix appreciated the care and deliberation shown by investigators, said his attorney, Lee Davis . 'Mr. Hendrix fully acknowledges the loss to Westbrook family, and his thoughts and prayers are with them,' Davis said in a statement. A series of chance events, even a missed opportunity, preceded the shooting. On Nov. 19, Hendrix's fiancee called 911 just before midnight to report that a man carrying a piece of paper and a flashlight rang her doorbell and wanted to see a person whose name she did not recognize, according to Hendrix's attorney and police reports obtained by The Associated Press under the state's open records laws. The woman had only recently moved into the rented home and was suspicious, Davis said previously. Worried, the fiancee called Hendrix, who told her to call 911. By the time Hendrix and police officers arrived, the suspicious man was gone. Afterward, Hendrix, a former soldier, took a handgun from his apartment in nearby Chattanooga, Tenn., and brought the weapon to his fiancee's home. About a week later, Westbrook slipped out unnoticed from the home he shared with his wife of 51 years. Westbrook suffered from Alzheimer's, a progressive disease that causes memory loss, impairs judgment and can leave it victims disoriented. His widow, Deanne, previously said her husband had become confused about where he lived and struggled to identify those closest to him.

'I can't imagine him feeling threatened by my husband, that's what surprises me,' Mrs Westbrook said. 'I think he was so cold.

"Britons lacking motivation for that overdue health kick might find themselves hitting the gym after - rather than before - their summer holiday. More than half of dieters are spurred on to embark on a weight loss mission after witnessing less than flattering holiday snaps, a new study finds. In fact, the holiday photo album has been named the number one motivation behind UK weight loss ahead of a relationship break-up and being unable to fit into clothes. Holiday photos are the top motivation behind UK weight loss (picture posed by model) Comments from a partner were the second . most common form of motivation, with unflattering photos from nights out . coming in third. Interestingly, those spurred on to diet after seeing their bikini snaps actually lost more weight than those motivated by any other reason. More than 2,100 British people took part in the online survey, all of whom were aged 18 and over and on a diet at the time of the poll. Initially, respondents were asked 'What first motivated you to lose weight?' and provided with a list of answers, with the opportunity to select as many answers as were relevant to their decision to embark on their diet. You're likely to be pictured in swimwear so there's no escaping any extra weight (posed by model) The survey . then asked respondents how much weight they had lost, on average, per . month during their diet, finding that an average dieting Briton loses around . 3lbs per month. 1.       Unflattering holiday photos – 51 per cent . 2.       Comments from partner – 46 per cent . 3.       Unflattering photos from nights out – 43 per cent . 4.       Being unable to fit into clothes – 41 per cent . 5.       A relationship break up – 38 per cent . 6.       Comments from general public – 32 per cent . 7.       Comments from friends & family – 29 per cent . 8.       Worried about embarrassing children / family – 24 per cent . 9.       Recommendation by doctor – 17 per cent . 10.   Realising you're unable to see certain body parts when naked – 15 per cent . A spokesperson for online pharmacy specialising in weight loss treatments, UKMedix.com, who commissioned the survey, said: 'I think most of us have seen pictures of ourselves at one point or another and cringed, perhaps at an outfit, a hairstyle or, possibly worst of all, a few extra pounds we'd gained without realising it. 'When you're on holiday, you're likely to be pictured in skimpier clothing and swimwear, so there's no escaping any extra weight.

"An Airforce general in charge of nuclear missiles was sacked because he got so drunk on a delegation to Russia that he bragged of the 'hot women' he had met, boasted of saving the world... and tried to 'fist bump' a guide during a tour of a monastery. Maj. Gen. Michael Carey was removed as chief of the 20th Air Force Global Strike Command, based in Wyoming and responsible for 450 ballistic missiles at three bases across the country, in October. And today it emerged he was relieved of his duties for a catalogue of misdemeanors while leading a U.S. delegation to a nuclear security training exercise in Russia in mid-July. Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey was fired  in response to an investigation into alleged personal misbehavior . It was the second sacking in a week of a senior commander of nuclear forces. An investigation into his behaviour said Carey was frequently rude to his Russian hosts and others, and that he associated with foreign national women whom he acknowledged were 'suspect.' During a stopover in . Switzerland, the report reveals, he bragged loudly about his position as . commander of a nuclear force, saying he 'saves the world from war every . day.' Upon his arrival in Moscow he and an unidentified man were seen visiting a nearby hotel to meet 'two foreign national women' not to return to his Marriott hotel room until the early hours of the next day. It meant he was 45 minutes late for in joining the delegation to the Moscow suburb of Sergiyev Posad. He blamed his lateness on jet lag, saying his body clock was out of sync. He then drank so heavily at an official lunch that afternoon that he began talking loudly about sensitive issues including NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the civil war in Syria. Russian diplomat were not amused. The former Soviet state earlier this year granted asylum to Snowden amid U.S. requests to extradite him home for trial. It is also an ally of the Syrian regime. Rude: Carey's antics unfolded during a U.S. delegation to Russia's capital Moscow where witnesses said he tried to perform with a live band at a Mexican restaurant and interrupted toasts (pictured: Moscow's St Basil's Cathedral) Lt. Gen. James M. Kowalski (left) fired Maj.Gen. Michael Carey and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Jack Weinstein (right) He also claimed he had 'met two hot women the night before,' and repeatedly butted in during a guided tour of a monastery. 'At . one point, he tried to give her (the guide) a fist bump,' the report . says, citing a witness. 'She had no idea what he was trying to do. It . was again, very, very embarrassing.' Established in 1944 to bolster forces fighting on the Pacific front of World War II, 20th Air Force has has a proud, if controversial, history. Operating initially from bases in India and staging though bases in China, 20 AF conducted strategic bombardment of the Japanese Islands. In August 1945, its 509th Composite Group conducted the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima (pictured) and Nagasaki, Japan, killing more than 200,000 Japanese citizens. It was inactivated between 1955 and 1991, when it was incorporated into the Strategic Air Command (SAC) becoming responsible for all land-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. That . evening, at a Mexican restaurant, he even tried to perform with the . live band - who, the report states, were not interested - before going . to sit at another table with the women he had met. The report also says he continually interrupted Russian toasts to make his own. The decision to sack him was made by Lt. Gen. James Kowalski, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command. Kowalski is in charge of all Air Force nuclear weapons, including bombers. The second-in-command at U.S. Strategic Command, Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, was relieved of command amid an investigation into alleged . gambling issues. Strategic Command is responsible for all Air Force and Navy nuclear forces.

The . worst recorded disaster on Everest was on May 11, 1996, when eight . climbers were killed in one day because of a snow storm near the summit. Six Nepalese guides were killed in an avalanche in 1970. Climbers . wanting to scale Mount Everest will be forced to bring back eight . kilograms of rubbish in a bid to clean-up the world's highest peak. The . rule, one of several new measures covering mountaineering in the . Himalayan nation, will apply to climbers ascending beyond Everest's base . camp from April onwards, said tourism ministry official Madhusudan . Burlakoti. Decades . of mountaineering has taken its toll on Everest which is strewn with . rubbish from past expeditions, including oxygen cylinders, human waste . and even climbers' bodies, which do not decompose in the extreme cold.","Guides were preparing route on Mount Everest when avalanche struck .

"A mother saved her six-month-old baby with her 'last breath,' sheltering the infant in the toilet after her boyfriend shot her in the head and turned the gun on himself. Jessica Arrendale, 33, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head along with Antoine Davis, 30, who police believe shot himself and Arrendale in a murder-suicide in an Atlanta suburb. Police had surrounded Arrendale's townhouse. When they finally entered the home, they found the baby safe inside and rushed her to the hospital to treat her for hypothermia. Hero mom: Jessica Arrendale, 33, reportedly sheltered six-month-old Cobie in the toilet bowl when her boyfriend Antoine Davis, 30, shot her in the head . Marine: Davis served as a marine in Iraq according to his ex-wife Tamaira Chesley, who also believed he battled with depression . Officers arrived at the home in Smyrna in the early morning hours Sunday, responding to a call that there was someone in the home armed with a gun. Arrendale's mother, Teresa Ionniello, told WSB Radio that Arrendale and Davis were together the night that Davis became 'belligerently drunk and abusive,' an episode that sadly had happened many times before in their relationship. Davis chased Arrendale up to the third floor of her home, where Arrendale picked up a baseball bat to defend herself, according to Ionniello, though Davis overpowered her and struck her with the bat. Arrendale then barricaded herself in the bathroom with their six-month-old, Cobie. Davis went to get his firearm, an assault rifle, from the closet, and it was around this time that police arrived at the home. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that police evacuated nearby homes as a precaution and attempted to make contact with the armed man inside. When officers made the decision to breach the doors around 1:30 p.m., they found the bodies of Arrendale and Davis, both killed by gunshot wounds to the head, Davis's reportedly self-inflicted. Cobie was found in the toilet bowl, covered by her mother's body but safe and alive. SWAT officers rushed her to the hospital to treat her for hypothermia. 'She had pure will. She wanted that baby to live,' Ionniello said of her daughter. 'Her last breath was saving the child.' Father: Davis's ex-wife Tamaira Chesley described Davis in kind terms, saying that lately he had been struggling with depression and mentioning a custody dispute he had with Arrendale . Defenseless: Cobie Davis was just six-months-old at the time of the killings, and survived safely for hours in the toilet bowl . Lost: A GoFundMe page was set up for Arrendale to provide for her two daughters after her death, saying Arrendale was the sole provider . She believes that Davis couldn't see the child in the bowl, and left the bathroom to go into his daughter's room, where he shot himself. In addition to the couple's five-month-old, Fox 5 reports that Davis's two daughters from a previous marriage, ages 9 and 10, were in the home. Their mother, Tamaira Chesley, described how one daughter later told her that Davis stared at her for a 'very long time' before she asked him, 'Daddy, what are you doing?' Chesley says Davis then went upstairs with a gun and the daughter heard Arrendale screaming and then a 'boom.' 'I'm not sure where his depression came from,' Chesley says, but says there was a custody battle over the six-month-old girl. Leslie Tidwell, a friend of Arrendale's, set up a GoFundMe page for her two children, writing on it that 'Jessica was the sole provider for her household.' Davis and Arrendale's six-month-old is still being treated at Children’s Health Care of Atlanta at Scottish Rite Hospital and plans are for Ionniello to take custody of her.","Police say Antoine Davis, 30, shot his girlfriend Jessica Arrendale, 33, before shooting himself .

"A man's plan to extract money from a female driver by pretending she had hit him with her car backfired spectacularly when the woman in question actually did run him over. The bizarre incident took place in Fuzhou, capital of southern China's Fujian province, and was captured by the dash cam of a nearby car. At the beginning of the clip, the man is seen walking towards a car, appearing to be trying to flag it down. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flagging down: A suspected con man attempts to get the attention of a female driver . Ploy: After she stops the man dramatically falls over, seemingly not having touched the car . Calamity: But then the driver of the car, apparently having been startled, moves forward and runs the suspected con artist over for real . The car, which is travelling at walking speed, comes to a halt – and the man dramatically falls over in front of it. He doesn’t appear to make any contact with the car. It is unknown if the woman driving the car failed to see him or simply became flustered when she was beeped from behind, but she suddenly steps on the accelerator and runs the man over for real. Hearing his screams she stops the car, which is still pinning the man to the ground, and gets out. Pinned down: The driver now has the man trapped underneath her car and screaming for help . How the scenario ends and the fates of the driver and the would-be con artist are unknown. The video follows news of a brand new car that destroyed a house after being driven into it by accident. The house belonged to the parents of the female driver, who just wanted to show the car off to them. Ye Chia, 29, arrived at the property in Gaoli village in the city of Wenzhou in east China’s Zhejiang province, with her husband and two daughters, and attempted to park her shiny new white car at the front. But she accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake and demolished not just her car, but part of her parents' house as well.","Suspected con man in Fujian province, China, tries to flag down driver .

"Guilty: Michael Scripps, 36, was charged with stealing $3.6million from his mother and mildly autistic uncle . A court in Philadelphia has heard details of how a family with a fortune from their inherited media company squandered away millions by buying dresses owned by Princess Diana, enough marijuana to supply a daily drug habit, and funding the college education of a porn star. Michael Scripps, 36, was found guilty for depleting his mother Melissa and autistic uncle David's fortunes with his lavish spending. Before she could point the finger at him, however, she had to admit that she spent millions on her own whims, paying to have her dogs flown to their second home in the Caribbean by private plane and treating relatives to world cruises. She also indulged on treats for herself, including two of Princess Diana's glamorous dresses, a Napoleonic tiara and teddy bears that cost thousands of dollars. Adding to her spending was her daily marijuana habit and the various legal bills that came from her four marriages. Her spending decisions are just the tip of the iceberg, however, as her son Michael allegedly tricked her into handing over control of the $11million she made when the Scripps media conglomerate was sold in the 1980s for more than $700million. James E. Scripps had founded The Detroit News and built the Evening News Association. After the sale, Melissa had control of both her $11million share and her older brother David's lot, which was undisclosed but was said to be more than hers. Melissa was granted control of David's finances because he is mildly autistic. Big spender: Melissa Scripps, Michael's mother, admitted that before he took control of her finances in 2002, she spent more than $1million on international trips, two of Princess Diana's dresses and a Napoleonic tiara . Lavish: Melissa admitted that she flew her dogs to the family's second home in St Maarten (pictured) by private jet, but she eventually gave her son control of her fortune because he embarrassed her with compromising pictures of her with an exotic dancer at an Atlanta strip club where they blew $90,000 in one night . Her son's defense attorney alleges that Melissa and David's combined wealth was significantly closer to $100million than she claims it is. The tensions arose in the family around 2002, when the prosecution alleges that Michael became concerned about his mother's spending habits. 'Michael thought his mom was spending too much money, she was spending his inheritance,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Linwood C. Wright said in court on Wednesday. The Philadelphia Inquirer says that throughout the ordeal, he was not left with nothing, as he had always had his own six-figure trust fund and received a $3,900 monthly stipend. At one point in 2002, Michael, Melissa, David and a friend had a champagne-filled night at an Atlanta strip club that ended up costing $90,000. Melissa was later questioned by her financial advisers about the bill, and Michael showed a picture of his mother in a compromising position with one of the exotic dancers at the club. Expensive taste: Michael's first wife Anna, who he met while she was a college student working as a stripper, testified that he lavished her with jewelry throughout their marriage (stock image) The Inquirer says that out of embarrassment about the incident, she agreed to Michael's request that he take over the control of her and David's finances. Michael then placed the reins in the hands of his college buddy, financial advisor Richard ‘Duke’ Gleeson, who was so eager to please Michael that he agreed to all of his demands when it came to spending the money in ways he wanted. Those ways included keeping his romantic interests happy. At first, it was a stripper named Anna who he met in the 1990s when she was stripping while going to college in New Orleans. She went on to marry him, and she told the Pennsylvania court how he gave her piles of jewels. Recipient: In 2003, Michael began dating porn star Jenna Bearden, whose stage name is Kiki Daire . Testimony: In court, Ms Bearden said that Michael paid for her college education, her apartment in Memphis, her breast enhancement surgery, a pair of diamond earrings and a matching bracelet . More than a decade later, he began dating porn star Jenna Bearden, whose stage name is Kiki Daire. During his courtship of Ms Bearden, Michael flew her to Las Vegas and the Kentucky Derby. He gave her diamond earrings and a matching bracelet. He also paid for her college tuition, her breast enhancement surgery and her apartment in Memphis. All told, he had Mr Gleeson make 500 transfers of Melissa and David’s funds into Michael’s accounts. Things came to a head in 2006 when Michael, stressed after his mother found out about the fund transfers, held a gun up to Ms Bearden’s head and told her to call Melissa. The high life: He also paid for trips for Ms Bearden, including Caribbean cruises, a wild time in Las Vegas and a trip to the Kentucky Derby (pictured here in 2012) It is unclear what happened at the end of the incident, but two years later, Melissa and David were forced to pay Merrill Lynch $5.8million in a settlement deal and tell the FBI that Michael had defrauded them. Michael never testified in the trial but his lawyer argued that the only reason they did so was in order to protect their stash of the fortune. ‘They had to make a criminal out of somebody to protect themselves,’ attorney Michael Dezsi said. The judge urged the jurors not to assign guilt based on the lavish lifestyles of those involved, but to focus on the legality of Michael Scripp’s handling of his mother and uncle’s money. Michael was found guilty and will be sentenced on July 15. He faces more than seven years in prison.","Heirs to the James E. Scripps media fortune revealed their lavish spending in court .

"Men from Stoke-on-Trent have the biggest manhoods in Britain, according to a revealing new survey. Those from Robbie Williams' home town order the largest sized condoms, followed by their neighbours in Leeds and Manchester. But when it comes to girth, it's Bristol chaps who claim the top prize, followed by those in Oxford, Leeds and Newcastle. Men from Stoke-on-Trent, such as Robbie Williams, have the longest manhoods in Britain, a survey has revealed . The survey, of 20,000 men by an online condom retailer,  found a staggering four inch difference in the circumference of the . smallest and largest men. The findings are said to be the most . accurate set of size data recorded, avoiding the 'brag factor', as men who . took part were buying custom-fit condoms. However the survey, from condom makers TheyFit, does suggest the average man on the street may be deluded when it comes to his size. It found the average British man is . only 5.1 inches long, rather than the often quoted average of six . inches, while the average girth (circumference) is 4.7 inches. In fact, 26 per cent of men are less than five inches when . erect, while 53 per cent are between five and six inches. Twenty one per . cent of men claim to be longer than six inches. Men from Stoke-on-Trent ordered the largest condoms from the company's . web store, which stocks 95 different sizes of prophylactic. Sizes range . from three to 9.5 inches long and fit girths of 3.5 inches up to 7.5. Fortunately . for chaps paranoid about their manhood, the size is marked on the . packet with a discreet code, rather than a measurement in inches. Joe . Nelson, founder of the website, said: 'Our anonymised data represents . the most accurate survey of penis sizes ever collected. 'Previous studies have relied on self-reported measurements from men, leading to an issue of ""size exaggeration"". 'But men buying our condoms are much . less likely to do this for two reasons - firstly because they are . parting with money for a custom fit condom and secondly because of our . size code system (rather than labels like small, medium and large), . there's simply less focus on whether someone is bigger or smaller - it's . all about getting a custom fit. The problem of fit with standard condoms has long been recognised - a study published in the Lancet in 1993 called for different sizing - while a study in 2010 reported 45 per cent of men complained that their condoms did not fit.","Men in the North West order the largest sized condoms, says online retailer .

"A battery that can convert your body heat into electricity could lead to mobile phones capable of charging themselves while in your pocket. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a button sized self-charging battery that can scavenge energy from low temperature sources of heat. The device can charge itself at temperatures between 20°C(68°F) and 60°C (140°F), far lower than other heat-harvesting technologies. The button sized battery designed by Dr Gang Chen and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a prototype for a new way of charging mobile devices from surrounding heat . Dr Gang Chen, head of the mechanical engineering department at MIT, who led the work, said the technology could lead to new mobile phone batteries that can be charged without needing to be plugged in. He said: ‘It is a self-powered device and may be attractive for places without electric grid. ‘To generate enough power for practical applications (such as in mobile phones), better material and system designs are needed, and we are working on it. ‘With further development, there is potential to use such batteries to convert low grade heat into electricity at an attractive cost for broader applications. It uses inexpensive materials. ‘It may have potential application for harvesting thermal energy from the environment, especially in remote areas.’ Engineers have tried to find all kinds of solutions to the world's energy problems, but perhaps the strangest is a device built by British engineers to capture the power of pee. They have created a fuel cell that uses bacteria to break down the liquid waste to generate electricity. They were then able to recharge a mobile phone by plugging it into the car battery sized device. Dr Ioannis Ieropoulos, an engineer at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory at the University of West England has been working with colleagues at Bristol University to develop the fuel cell. He grew bacteria on specially made carbon fibre anodes that were inserted inside ceramic cylinders to create a battery circuit. The bacteria then breaks down sugars and other chemicals in the urine as it passes through the cylinders to produce electrons that build up a small electrical charge, which is passed to a capacitor that stores the power. The two centimetre wide battery works by exploiting the relationship between temperature and voltage known as the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle. This cycle means that a battery charged at high temperatures can deliver more electricity at lower temperatures than has been used to charge it in the first place because of the energy absorbed as heat. Dr Chen and his colleagues found they use this to create a ‘heat engine’ to generate electricity purely from the heat surrounding the battery. Previously the team were able to show they could harvest heat to generate electricity at temperatures of between 60 degrees C (140F) and 100 degrees C (212F). These early batteries needed relatively high differences in temperature - of around 50 degrees C. However, by tuning the battery’s electrodes, which were made from lead and ionic iron, Dr Chen and his colleagues were able to produce a device that could achieve this at low temperatures. This they believe, would allow a phone to be charged by harvesting energy from body heat and then cooling down when it is removed from a pocket. However the charging would become less efficient in warm environments when the room temperature matched body temperature. Dr Chen believes it should be possible to convert heat to electricity with around 12 per cent efficiency at temperatures between 20 degrees C and 60 degrees C. Mobile phones may never need to be plugged into the wall again as the new battery technology would allow devices to be charged by putting them in a pocket close to the body and then letting them cool down again . The battery exploits the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle to charge up the battery using low levels of heat that could also find applications cars and industrial processes where excess heat is wasted . However, their prototype, details of which were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was only able to achieve a heat to electricity conversion efficiency of up to two per cent. Dr Chen believes this can be improved by improving the materials and tweaking the design further. He said: ‘Tremendous low-grade heat is stored in industrial processes and the environment. Efficient and low-cost utilization of the low-grade heat is critical to imminent energy and environmental challenges. ‘The upper limit of efficiency for harvesting heat is proportional to the temperature difference between hot source and cold source - room temperature. ‘For low temperature heat sources, this temperature difference is small, so that upper limit of efficiency is already low. ‘It takes some temperature difference to transfer heat into the heat engines, which further reduces the temperature range the heat engine works.’","Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers create device that converts the heat around it into electricty .

"A woman has become the first person in Britain to be jailed for trolling herself – after bombarding her own Facebook page with abuse. Michelle Chapman, 24, launched her bizarre online campaign after falling out with her father and new stepmother, a court heard. She created bogus Facebook accounts for the couple and other family members and sent herself hundreds of vile sexual taunts. Deception: Michelle Chapman set up fake Facebook accounts in her family's name and sent explicit sexual abuse to herself in a bid to frame them . Chapman then reported the abuse to police – claiming she had been trolled – to frame them. Officers arrested her stepmother and issued warnings to her father and other bewildered relatives. Chapman’s year-long vendetta was only rumbled when internet experts established the offending Facebook accounts had been set  up using the computer at her home in Par, Cornwall. Details of her plot were revealed at Truro Crown Court in Cornwall, where Chapman was jailed for 20 months. At an earlier hearing, she admitted carrying out actions tending or intended to pervert the course of justice by sending herself degrading emails between February 2011 and March 2012. Chapman was jailed for 20 months at Truro Crown Court . Judge Christopher Harvey Clark  confiscated her computer and gave her a restraining order against contacting her victims. He told her: ‘People have suffered a great deal of distress as a result of your wicked behaviour.’ Chapman . fell out with some  members of her family after attempting a reunion . with her father, Roy Jackson, whom she had not seen for 21 years. Mr . Jackson had decided to trace his daughter after marrying Louise Steen . in 2010, but when Chapman travelled to his home in the north of England . they quarrelled. Philip Lee, . prosecuting, said Chapman was upset and began her revenge plot by . creating a Facebook account for her new stepmother and using it to send . abusive messages to her father in an attempt to split them up. She . then set up more profiles for her relatives, complete with photos, and . spent the next year sending messages of a ‘very unpleasant sexual . nature’ to her own account. Mr Lee said Chapman made several complaints . to police and gave eight written statements between February and October . 2011. She had been . cautioned for a similar offence of sending a false message in 2009 and . yet police still took her allegations seriously. Two . members of her extended family, Angela Steen and Elaine Abrams, were . given police warnings. Mr Lee said she initially denied responsibility . but eventually admitted it in the face of ‘incontrovertible’ evidence. He said: ‘She said that she wanted revenge on her father for matters in . the past. She just wanted to make their life hell.’ The court heard the . trolling campaign sparked a breakdown in her father’s marriage. Martin Pearce, for the defence, said Chapman suffers from mental health problems. He said: ‘She says she wishes she had not done it and she says  she understands the impact on  the victims.’ Her . husband, Glyn Chapman, 57, said afterwards that he will be standing by . his wife: ‘She is the victim, she has mental health issues and it was a . cry for help. ‘She has not had the help she needs. This is what you do when you’re in desperate, desperate need of help – you scream out.’","Michelle Chapman hatched bizarre plot after argument with father .

"Chelsea Clinton has been dismissed from jury duty in New York after serving for just one day. The 34-year-old, who was not selected to serve on a trial, was all smiles as she left a Manhattan state courthouse on Tuesday afternoon, wearing a snug t-shirt that revealed her growing baby bump. The other jurors didn't even know she was among them until her name was called, Pix11 reporter James Ford told Reliable Source. Ford, who was also at the court for jury duty, was the first to reveal the low-key former first daughter was at the courthouse. 'So I'm on jury duty today,& just saw that part of my pool is @ChelseaClinton,' he tweeted to his 2,700 Twitter followers on Tuesday. 'And she seems nice. And she's really pregnant. #BestWishes.' Scroll down for video . Doing her duty: Chelsea Clinton is met by reporters as she leaves jury duty in Manhattan on Tuesday. Her fellow jurors did not even know she was there until her name was called, they said . Other reporters saw the tweet and swarmed the courthouse as Clinton left - but only after she stopped to pose for selfies with her fellow jurors, including Ford. '#ChelseaClinton was very agreeable about a selfie with me,' he wrote on Instagram beneath their picture. 'She seemed quite nice.' He also shared a photograph of her leaving the court smiling and dressed in a gray T-shirt, black leggings and black ballet flats. Ford said the group of 90 had arrived at the courthouse at 9am before being dismissed seven hours later. They were told that they had all been excused for six years. All smiles: Clinton, 24, agreed to take selfies with fellow jurors, including Pix11 reporter James Ford . As she exited the courthouse, the dutiful daughter of the former president and former secretary of state told the waiting reporters that she was happy to be there. 'I think it's important that everyone participate in jury duty, . just as it's important that people vote and pay their taxes,' she said. Fellow jurors said that Clinton spent most of the time listening to her iPhone and commended her for her appearance - especially because she's pregnant. Janice Montague, a juror, told the New York Post: 'I was impressed with the idea that she wasn't excused or exempt. I said if she couldn’t get off we should all be here because she has the pull.' Her appearance at the court comes just days after Madonna did a brief stint in jury duty at the same place - but with two bodyguards and with much fanfare. She was dismissed after two hours. Revealed: Pix11 reporter James Ford, who was also on jury duty, was the first to reveal that Clinton was there. After his tweet, reporters picked up the news and swarmed the courthouse . Chelsea, . who married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in July 2010, revealed they . were expecting their first child during a New York forum on April 17. She told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year... I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' Her appearance at court came after she revealed she commands as much as $75,000 per speech, just a fraction of the $200,000 her mother, Hillary Clinton, receives to speak. The family's finances have come under scrutiny after the former secretary of state said during her book tour that the family was 'dead broke' when husband Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001.","The former first daughter, 34, was dismissed from the Manhattan court after seven hours on Tuesday afternoon .

"Janay Rice has still not seen the surveillance footage showing her former NFL star husband knocking her out in an Atlantic City elevator, she revealed today. In an interview that aired on the Today show on Monday, Ray Rice's wife described how painful it was for her life to be scrutinized after her husband made a 'mistake' in February. She also slammed the Ravens for failing to support her family in the aftermath and revealed that she only issued a public apology for her part in the incident after the team suggested it. Ray Rice, a running back, was suspended from the team after footage emerged in September showing him punching his then-girlfriend in an elevator after a night of drinking. On Saturday, he was reinstated to the league after winning an appeal and is now eligible to sign for any team. Scroll down for videos . Painful: Janay Rice wipes away a tear on the Today show as she recounts how angry she was after a video emerged showing her now-husband Ray Rice knocking her out cold in an elevator in February . Speaking out: Her mother, pictured right, said she felt sick after she watched the video of the attack . Janay told Today that she has only seen the first video of the incident, which was taken outside the elevator and showed him dragging out her lifeless body and then walking away. 'There was no preparing us for that at all,' she said. 'When I saw that, it was horrible.' After she saw it, she asked him why he had left her on the floor, rather than comfort her. 'He said he was terrified,' she said. 'He was in such shock that this had just happened. He didn't know how to function at that point.' But she has not seen the second video, which was taken inside the elevator. 'I refuse,' she said. 'I'm not going to let the public bring me back there.' Her mother Candy Palmer, who joined her for the interview, said that she had watched the video because she needed to know what happened to her daughter. 'I was kind of sick,' she said. After the incident, she initially thought she was 'done' with the running back - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him because it was not like him. Questions: Ray Rice, center, will answer questions about the incident in an interview that will air on Tuesday . She told Today's Matt Lauer (left) that she was 'furious' with the former Baltimore Ravens player in the aftermath of the attack, however she knew her relationship would not be over . On the night of the attack, Janay said she was annoyed with her husband because it was Valentines Day, and she wanted to go out as a couple - but they ended up being with friends. She also said that she was drunk when Rice 'slapped' her in the elevator and her memory of the events is foggy. 'I was furious' afterwards, Janay told Lauer. 'We came home and we didn't talk the entire ride. I just knew he hit me, and I was done. I just didn't even want to entertain it. Any explanation.' But she added: 'Of course in the back of my mind and in my heart I knew that our relationship wouldn't be over because I know that this isn't us and it's not him.' Since then the pair have reconciled. They married a month after his arrest for aggravated assault. Janay insisted that Rice had never been violent with her before and has not been violent with her since. 'He knows what he would have to deal with,' she said. 'I'm not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me and - God forbid - in front of my child. No way.' Janay also became emotional about the aftermath of the videos. She slammed the media for their reports and the Ravens for failing to support her family. Back together: Janay, who insisted Rice has not hit her since, poses with her husband and her daughter . Standing by him: Janay believes her husband made a mistake and will not do it again . 'It brings back anger,' she said. 'I was so angry. I was hurt. Seeing that the man that I love - everything ripped up from under [us]. The support system that I thought we had in the Ravens - that made me angry. We have to pick up and move our child from where she's used to... it hurt.' She also revealed that she appeared at a press conference beside Rice in May after the Ravens suggested it. In front of the media, she apologized for her 'role that night'. She told the Today show that she apologized on the Ravens' suggestion and that the team gave the couple a loose script to base their comments on. 'I was ready to do anything that was going to help the situation,' she said. 'Help the way we looked in the media, help his image - I was fine with it.' But she also accused NFL commissioner Roger Goodell of lying about seeing a second video of the domestic video incident in order to save himself. 'I can't say he's telling the truth,' she said. 'I know for a fact that... Ray told the honest truth.' Initially, Rice was suspended by Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. Shocking: Rice was suspended by the NFL for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. CCTV captured the attack . However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. The day after Rice was released from his contract, Janay took to her Instagram to describe the 'horrible nightmare' she found herself in. Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team after his indefinite suspension from the NFL was dropped on appeal by a U.S. District Judge. Janay also said that she's confident that her husband - a three-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl champ - will once again wear an NFL uniform. 'He's proven himself as a football player for seven years,' she said. 'There's never been a question on what he can do on the field.' 'I can't say he's telling the truth,' Janey Rice told NBC's Today show about NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in footage due to air in the next couple of days . Newlyweds: The pair got married even after he was indicted on third degree aggravated assault charges . But she added that she know it will be 'hard' for people to look past the situation. The teams immediately mentioned as possibilities were the Denver Broncos, the Cleveland Browns and the Indianapolis Colts - a trio of likely playoff teams. There were also reports that the New Orleans Saints might be interested, but Fox reported that coaches were concerned it would alienate the female fan base. Ray Rice told NBC that he has not himself been in touch with any teams and that he's leaving it up to his agent. He added that he is working on staying in shape. During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer - who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome. Consequences: After security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract . In her decision on Friday, Judge Jones wrote: 'Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary. 'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.' The NFL did not immediately comment on Rice's verdict. See below for video .

"Nice guy image: Jamie Oliver closed two Recipease stores without giving employees any notice . Jamie Oliver has closed two of his cooking class shops - but failed to tell staff until they were abruptly cleared out of the premises during a shift. Customers with bookings were also not informed of the sudden decision, and many found out just days before their classes were meant to take place after ringing up to ask for directions or confirmation. The star chef shut down his Recipease branches in Clapham Junction and Brighton after five years of operation - with a spokesman claiming they were now 'focusing energies on their flagship Notting Hill branch'. But one customer, who called the business to complain about a cancelled booking, says a despondent former employee  temporarily posted to customer services admitted the stores were 'making no money'. Another former worker at the Brighton store has labelled the move 'heartless and shameful'. The part-time employee, a student who did not want to be named, claims a woman from head office came in to the store to close the place down - and customers and staff had to leave the premises immediately. He told MailOnline: 'They literally just came in at lunch, kicked out customers, shut the doors and hey presto. It was one lady from London head office. 'Our food champs were renowned for there incredible work and classes. 'To be just sacked off just like that. Shameful, as if he couldn't afford to keep us open a few more weeks so we could have a proper send off. 'I was offered one week's wages, woopey do! Very heartless thing to do considering our loyalty and hard work towards the company. 'The worst part is not even being able to thank regulars for their custom face to face. Instead having a ""poster in the window"" job.' Another member of staff, from the Clapham Junction store, claimed she turned up to work last Monday to find the doors locked and said workers were appalled by the last-minute decision. The Recipease stores were opened in 2009 to create ‘buzzing little community hubs where people can really get involved with food’. Classes at the shop can cost up to £65 for a two-hour session, teaching a range of varying cuisines from Mexican street food to Christmas mince pies. The chain has been inundated with angry and disappointed messages on Twitter from customers who have seen their plans ruined by the sudden closures. Cleared out: The former Recipease store on Western Road, Brighton, was pictured boarded up today . No notice: An employee from the store claims a woman from head office came into the shop during the day to close the place down without warning . Appalled: One worker from the branch in Clapham, pictured with windows boarded, says she she turned up for work to find the doors were locked . One, Nick Phipps, wrote: 'Email to say you're closed 4 days before my course isn't good enough! Hotel and time off work booked, now wasted...' Another, Cicely Milsom, posted: 'We were so excited for class nxt wknd! Disappointed at short notice cancelation and unapologetic customer service!' Aude Eberlin wrote: '@Recipease Brighton closed down with no notification for people who booked! Thanks for ruining 11 people's day! #fail #nothappy.' And Becky Jacques tweeted the celebrity chef directly saying: 'Cancelled cooking lesson @jamieoliver in Brighton this weekend = hen do disaster. Help a desperate bridesmaid out pls?! Private lesson?!' The Recipease website recently posted a message entitled ‘Goodbye Clapham and Brighton’. It reads: ‘We are sorry to say that we have decided to close our sites in both Clapham Junction and Brighton.' A spokesman for Jamie Oliver's company today confirmed that workers had not been given advance warning of the decision, saying: 'I'm told no-one turned up to find the doors closed but yes staff did find out on the day of closure.' 'Obviously it was a very difficult decision to close the stores. A consultation process has already begun with Recipease staff affected and we have found alternative employment within the business for many of them.' 'As for the customers affected, although there is understandable disappointment, all are in the process of being reimbursed or their classes moved to the flagship Notting Hill Recipease.' Goodbye note: This letter appeared in the boarded up window of the Recipease branch in Brighton . Despite the TV chef's previous successes and celebrity status, this is not the first time this year that Mr Oliver's multi-million-pound business empire has run into difficulties. Back in January, his company announced the closure of three out of his four 'Union Jacks' restaurants - which were aimed at 'bringing back nostalgic British classics' such as fish and chips, and bangers and mash. The firm cited the 'challenging climate' for the decision to close the restaurant branches in Holborn and Chiswick in London and Winchester in Hampshire with immediate effect. January's announcement followed the failure of his artisan food range, Jme, which folded amid poor sales and criticism over prices at the end of 2013. The TV chef is thought to be worth around £240million. After leaving school at 16 years old with just two GCSEs, Jamie Oliver has built a £240million business empire and is one of the most recognised chefs in the world. Here are some of his biggest hits, along with a few of his recent failures. TV PROGRAMMES AND BOOKS . The Naked Chef, 1999: He became a household name after launching the hit TV show in 1999.

"Welcome news: The Queen's popularity is at a 15-year high, according to a new survey for the pro-republican Guardian newspaper . Among all the gifts that will be presented to the Queen for her Diamond Jubilee, perhaps this will be most treasured. The monarch’s popularity is at its highest for at least 15 years, a poll has found, with affection for the Windsors rising following the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding last year, and ahead of the Jubilee. Sixty-nine per cent believe the country would be worse off without the Royal Family. Only 22 per cent think the opposite, that Britain would be better off without them. The 47-point margin between the two positions is the biggest recorded on any of the 12 occasions pollsters ICM have asked the question since 1997. The results are somewhat ironic given that the poll was commissioned by the traditionally pro-republican Guardian newspaper. Support for the Queen has risen even since last year. When the same question was asked shortly before the Royal Wedding, 63 per cent said we would be worse off without the Queen. In August 1997, around the time of Princess Diana’s death, that figure stood at 48 per cent. Despite solid support for the monarch across all ages and classes, the latest poll revealed that the public are anxious about what will happen when the Queen’s reign ends. Of those surveyed, 39 per cent said they want Prince Charles to be king. Reason to be cheerful: Affection for royals has risen since the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last year . At the time of Princess Diana's death in 1997, just 48 per cent said we would be worse off without the Queen, compared to 69 per cent now. Meanwhile, almost half want the crown to skip Prince Charles and pass straight to Prince William . The results of the ICM poll commissioned by The Guardian . Almost half want the crown to skip a generation and pass straight to Prince William. Only 10 per cent said Britain should become a republic with an elected head of state when the Queen dies or abdicates. ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,002 adults between May 18 and May 20 for the survey. It found that support for the monarchy is at its strongest among older, especially Conservative voters, 82 per cent of whom are in favour of the Royal Family. But across every age group and among Labour and Liberal Democrat voters alike, the monarchy is enjoying solid support. Although there is nothing to suggest Prince William would take the crown over his father, the poll reveals that if  he did so, he would have the support  of the younger, largely Labour-voting population. Surveys on the Royal Family’s popularity date back to the 1960s, and show that support for the Queen has remained remarkably steady. Even during difficult spells, such as the Queen’s infamous ‘annus horribilis’ in 1992, support for a republic has rarely risen much above 20 per cent.","Affection for monarch has risen since the royal wedding .

"To blame? An article in The Washington Times suggests it is Barack Obama's fault that staff at the Missile Defence Agency were able to breach security by looking at porn on Government computers . It was revealed this month that the Pentagon had ordered staff at its top-secret missile defence unit to stop watching porn on U.S. government computers. But rather than the porn-cruising culprits at the Missile Defence Agency coming under fire for the massive security breach, President Barack Obama is getting the blame. In an article for The Washington Times, Lori Handrahan linked the agency’s porn habits with the Secret Service’s Columbia prostitute scandal before relating both to a problem with Obama’s leadership. ‘The Colombia scandal was the president’s wake-up call. The White House needed to order an in-depth and urgent investigation into porn, child porn and prostitution in all government agencies. Mr. Obama did no such thing. ‘Now America’s Missile Defense Agency may be exposing the core of our national security,’ Handrahan, a professor at American University's School of International Service, wrote on Friday. The article traces the government’s ‘porn problem’ back to 2006 when a deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security was arrested for trying to seduce someone he thought was a teenage girl online. The piece then highlights a 2010 report by the Securities and Exchange Commission which found that 17 of 31 employees caught accessing porn at work since 2008 were senior staff. Handrahan also recalls 2010’s revelations that Pentagon staff were accessing child porn. ‘America’s most professional security officials […] seem eager to discredit themselves. Russians must be celebrating. During the Cold War, they had to train and deploy real female agents. Today, Americans come freely to honey pots directly from the Pentagon’s missile-defence system,’ he writes. The recent violation at the Missile Defence Agency came to light after fears were raised that viruses may have already been smuggled into the department's mainframe through x-rated sites. Security breach: The Pentagon's defence chiefs are understood to have been furious upon hearing that some staff members had accessed websites 'known to have had virus and malware issues' An internal probe then found that some staff had been downloading adult material on office computers and sharing them with each other via the internal network. It constitutes a massive security risk to one of America's most secretive agencies because porn sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to sneak snooping software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls. Not the job in hand: The Missile Defence Agency workers should have been developing rockets like this SM-3 rather than looking at pornography . In a bid to curb the abuse, the agency's executive director sent a stern memo warning staff that 'appropriate disciplinary action' would be dished out to anyone caught surfing the net for smut. 'There have been instances of employees and . contractors accessing websites, or transmitting messages, . containing pornographic or sexually explicit images,' John James Jr . wrote in the July 27 memo leaked to Bloomberg News. 'These actions are not only . unprofessional, they reflect time taken away from designated duties, are . in clear violation of federal and DoD and regulations, consume network . resources and can compromise the security of the network though the . introduction of malware or malicious code, he wrote.' He added that anyone caught misusing . the agency's network will face losing their security clearance and could be . suspended, even fired. Agency spokesman Rick Lehner told Bloomberg that the . memo was written after 'a few people' downloaded . material 'from some websites that were known to have had virus . and malware issues'. One . government cybersecurity expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said . criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies, such as Russia, embed . spyware deep within the coding of pornographic websites in a bid to . access and harvest confidential data from governments and corporations. Such sites contain high-quality images and videos that contain complex computer coding - the ideal place to hide viruses. The Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing, . fielding and upgrading the nation’s ground- and sea-based . missile defense programs. Inside the heart of defence: The revelation constitutes a massive security risk because pornographic sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to smuggle spying software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls (stock image) It works closely with countries including Japan and Israel as well as companies such as Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. In July last year, America vowed to retaliate with military . force against countries that sabotage its  computers in the . Pentagon’s first ever strategy on how to fight  escalating cyber . attacks. Anxious to contend . with growing internet incursions linked to Russia and China, U.S. military chiefs reportedly agreed that the most serious sabotage . attempts should constitute an act of war.

"A newly proposed bill could ban government workers from watching porn on their office computers in the wake of the revelation that thousands of pieces of pornographic content were downloaded to Environmental Protection Agency computers this May. The bill was introduced by Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a Republican, on the last day before Congress' fall recess. If the bill is passed it 'would require the Office of Management of Budget to issue guidelines to prohibit porn watching on federal computers.' A newly proposed bill could ban government workers from watching porn on their office computers . The Daily Dot reports that the Washington Post contacted an OMB spokesperson who said such a restriction has yet to be passed, though they were 'looking into it.' The Post noted that the bill is called the Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act. That the acronym is the same as the Environmental Protection Agency's is no accident. In May, an investigation found an EPA employee had downloaded and viewed over 7,000 pieces of pornography on government computers. The unidentified employee spent two to six hours a day watching porn at work on their computer, EPA Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Allan Williams told reporters. In May, an investigation found an EPA employee had downloaded and viewed over 7,000 pieces of pornography on government computers . In the public outcry over the investigation's findings, then-deputy EPA administrator Bob Perciasepe said the agency had 'taken steps to put measures in place to help ensure this type of fraud cannot be repeated.' Meadows said it was shocking that a bill would be necessary to stop this behavior. 'It's appalling that it requires an act of Congress to ensure that federal agencies block access to these sites at work,' he wrote.","Measure proposed after revelation EPA employee spent hours a day viewing thousands of pieces of pornography at work .

"Wanted: Leilani Novak-Garcia, pictured, who goes by the pseudonym 'Hitler' is on the run after allegedly stabbing a man multiple times at the annual Rainbow Family gathering that is taking place in a Utah national forest . A hippie who goes by the pseudonym 'Hitler' is on the run after allegedly stabbing a man multiple times at the annual Rainbow Family gathering that is taking place in a Utah national forest. Authorities in Wasatch County today released a photograph of Leilani Novak-Garcia, 32, who they claim screamed 'I'll kill you,' before pouncing on the unidentified man just before 1 a.m. this morning. Uinta National Forest rangers discovered the man who suffered two stab wounds. His age and current condition are not known. According to the Heber City Police Department's Facebook page, Novak-Garcia left the campsite before sheriff's deputies could arrive. They believe, however, she may still be in the Heber City area. She is described as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 170 pounds with hazel eyes and black hair, which she wears in dreadlocks. According to Novak-Garcia's own Facebook page, she lives in New Orleans. Police in the area had been bracing for nudity, drugs and general free-spiritedness during the counterculture gathering that began near Salt Lake City last week. The unorthodox crowds even compelled a pair of nearby Mormon church-owned girls' summer camps to move elsewhere. The first attendees began setting up camp at the annual Rainbow Family gathering, where attendance is expected to total about 10,000, on June 20. They have started building kitchens and setting up tents in advance of their July 4 celebration. Most visitors have come without incident through the closest town of Heber City, said Wasatch County Sheriff's Deputy Jared Rigby said last week. Angry: Novak-Garcia, 32, pictured, allegedly screamed 'I'll kill you,' before pouncing on the unidentified man just before 1 a.m. Monday . On the lam: According to the Heber City Police Department's Facebook page, Novak-Garcia, left and right, left the campsite before sheriff's deputies could arrive . Hanging around: Authorities believe, however, the suspect may still be in the Heber City area . But a few menaces had already rankled locals in the town of 12,000 prior to the frightening stabbing incident. The town is dotted with churches and bordered by vast fields and ranches. Some revelers last week crashed a nearby wedding reception in search of food. Police . also expect to find marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine in coming . weeks, but aren't saying whether the drugs have already turned up. They have doubled their force with help from the state in response to the expanding population. 'We don't deal with a lot of panhandling, people asking for handouts,' Rigby said. 'We don't have a lot of lewdness or public urination.' With . only about 200 participants, the gathering Sunday logged one death when . a 39-year-old New Hampshire woman was found on the site hunkered around . a bend in the Duchesne River, Rigby said. She apparently died in her sleep, he added. A total of around 10,000 people are expected to attend this years Rainbow Family festival in northern Utah, with attendees already starting to arrive for the July 4 celebrations. Here participants attend festival at Oscala National Forest in Florida in 2012 . The Rainbow Family are committed to peace and egalitarianism and have thrown annual events every year - almost always in out-of-the-way parks and forests - since the 1970s . The Rainbow Family has no formal structure or leaders. An informal council decides each year where the gathering will be held. For years, the decisions have sparked court battles with the Forest Service over the group's right to gather without a permit . For the most part, participants have cooperated with officials, asking how they can limit their toll on the land at the spot about 40 miles east of Salt Lake City, said Dave Whittekiend of the Forest Service. 'People have approached and asked, ''How can we be lighter on the ground; how can we minimize those impacts?'"" he said. They . have 'been very open' to requests of biologists, who barred the group . from setting up camp within 200 feet of the river, Whittekiend said. It's . the first year the annual event has come to Utah since 2003, when it . set up on the northern side of the same mountain range. It has convened every year since 1972. Last . year, the group chose Montana's Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, . where law enforcement costs related to the gathering totaled $575,000, . according to the Forest Service. Officers issued hundreds of citations but only arrested two people out of 10,000. Officials . there compiled a list of lessons learned, advising their counterparts . in other states to make clear where participants may camp, set up fires . and retrieve water. Flashback: The Rainbow Family gathering of 2006, which took place in Colorado. The festival is known for choosing a different state for each year, with members traveling from all over . Last year the Rainbow Family gathered in Montana¿s Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest . Video taken by attendees of the 2013 Rainbow Family Gathering show people arriving at but Montana¿s Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest . The Rainbow Family has no official leaders and no one website or member list. Its creed revolves around nonviolence, inclusiveness and praying for peace, according to a number of websites asserting ties to the group. The gatherings take the name 'rainbow' because they aim to incorporate a spectrum of people and cultures, says one website. Jan Olpin, co-owner of the Dairy Keen, spotted a group in recent days rummaging through the eatery's garbage, 'so I said, ''Here's your cheeseburger with some soup, fries and a drink''.' That's a one-off, she said: Police are urging against such donations. At a community meeting, officials said the festival would boost local business, quelling anxiety, Olpin said. Some pledged to welcome the visitors but also vowed to lock their cars. 'The whole audience kind of agreed we need to do what's best for Heber and make these people feel welcome,' Olpin said, 'yet be vigilant'.","Leilani Novak-Garcia, 32, allegedly screamed 'I'll kill you' before pouncing on an unidentified man just before 1 a.m. Monday .

"South Yorkshire Police are investing an assault on Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland  by a fan during the Yorkshire derby with Leeds United. Michael Tonge's equaliser for visitors Leeds saw a fan in the away section run from behind Kirkland’s goal and push him to the ground. Approaching from Kirkland’s left, the thug ran up to him and caught him unawares with a double-fisted blow . that floored Sheffield Wednesday keeper. Scroll down for video . Disgrace: The fan caught Sheffield Wednesday keeper Chris Kirkland flush in the face with a sickening assault . South Yorkshire Police issued a statement on Saturday morning which indicated they know the identity of the individual involved, who ran back into the stand after the assault and escaped arrest. Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Mark Monteiro said: 'With the public's assistance we have clearly identified the offender who ran onto the pitch during last night's game between Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United and who is suspected of assaulting the Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper. 'We are dealing with the complaint made by the player and are currently taking statements, collating evidence and making enquiries to locate and arrest the offender. 'We are also using CCTV footage from around the ground to identify suspects who may have been responsible for other offences before, during or after the match.' The suspect was widely named on social media sites last night, and if it proves to be him, he has previous convictions for football-related violence, and is currently serving a nationwide ban on visiting any football stadium in the country. Leeds manager Neil Warnock was furious after the match and said he was 'absolutely embarrassed' by the incident. 'I thought it was an absolute disgrace,' he said. 'I think they should get the guy and prosecute him and put him in prison . 'He (Kirkland) went down like a ton of bricks but that doesn't make a difference. Nobody should be on the pitch doing that. I hope we can make an absolute issue of it. He spoiled everything for everyone. I've not enjoyed that when I see a moron like that. 'I am not proud of being Leeds manager when I see that. I don't mind the rivalry between us - there was a great atmosphere. To see things like that on the field of play there is no place for it - I am absolutely embarrassed.' Vicious: The fan grimaces as he goes in to attack Kirkland . He continued: 'They had enough security. 'If they have got a person like him . with a five-year-old mentality they can't stop that. Sheffield Wednesday . can't do anything about. It just gives them more opportunity to have a . go. 'Dave (Jones, Wednesday manager) was . saying we shouldn't thank the crowd but our crowd were fantastic but . we've got one moron and I can't tolerate that. 'I've not seen anything like that . since my mate Paul Evans got something thrown at him at Burton Albion in . an FA Cup game many, many years ago. All of them apart from one moron were excellent tonight.' Furious Wednesday boss Jones described the Leeds fans as: ‘Vile . animals... an absolute disgrace,’ and said they should be banned from . every away ground. There were offensive chants from both . fans during the game, about . Jimmy Saville from travelling Leeds fans, with Sheffield Wednesday . supporters singing songs that referenced the two Leeds fans who were . killed in Turkey in 2000.

Kirkland did well not to retaliate #noplaceforthatinfootball . Minutes after the full-time whistle, Leeds United released a statement promising to work with the police to identify the man responsible for the sickening attack. South Yorkshire Police have confirmed in a statement they 'will be working with both clubs to identify and quickly bring to justice the personsresponsible'. In his post-match press conference, Warnock stood by his club's statement and called on the culprit to be jailed. 'It's just so sad and disappointing. If anything it stopped us winning the game. I thought at 1-1 we would get in the driving seat and that made everyone... for one moron,' he said. 'The club has made a statement and I'm pleased, we don't condone that. I hope the authorities and constabulary take the appropriate action.' A spokesman for Leeds United said: 'Leeds would like to apologise and condemn the actions of the fan who came into the pitch and attacked Chris Kirkland. The club will fully cooperate with both the police and the football authorities in identifying the individual concerned.' Having sensed a tense atmosphere in the first half, Warnock also claimed to have asked police if they wanted him to address Leeds' fans in order to calm tempers. 'There were some early on, they (the fans) went towards each other, the police said they didn't think it would be right. It looked to me.... I was disappointed in certain aspects of being manager tonight when things like that happen,' he said. 'I did say to the police, in the first half, did they want me to go over and calm them down but they said that might inflame it even more.' He did not agree with Jones' assessment that he was in the wrong to send his players to clap the travelling fans, though. He said: 'I disagree, Dave is disappointed with not winning the game. I understand his feelings being a manager, it's a pressure game, he felt they could have won it. 'Leeds United coming was the best thing that could have happened to him, if it was a lesser team coming, on the run that they're on, it would have been very difficult, but the crowd lifted them.' This incident will be an embarrassment . for the FA as it comes three days after their complaint about the . unruly and racist behaviour of Serbian fans, players and officials after . England’s Under 21 victory. As Kirkland lay flat out on his . goalline, seats that had been ripped out at the away end rained down on . to the Wednesday six-yard area. As the assailant clambered back over the . barriers and reclaimed his seat, team-mates and physios rushed to . Kirkland’s aid. When he finally climbed to his feet . and signalled he was able to continue, he turned to the travelling fans . and pointed an angry finger towards them. Pain: Kirkland holds his face after the incident . Tension between rival supporters had . threatened to boil over minutes earlier, but a flashpoint that involved a . shameful physical attack on a player is sure to land Leeds in trouble . with the authorities, who will launch an immediate enquiry into it. Jay Bothroyd had already made it an uncomfortable return to his native Sheffield for Neil Warnock. Bothroyd, a deadline-day loan signing . from one-time Sheffield United boss Warnock’s former club QPR, steered a . 44th-minute header past Paddy Kenny’s despairing dive to give Wednesday . a deserved lead. Wednesday boss Jones bemoaned his . side’s recent misfortune in his programme notes, and he had more . grounds for complaint as Wednesday dominated the first-half. Third from . bottom at the outset, Wednesday belied their lowly position with some . fluent passing that lacked only a finishing touch. Treatment: Leeds fans chant and jeer while Kirkland lies injured . How it went unrewarded for so long . took some explaining, though, after a remarkable 10th-minute escape for . ex-Sheffield United keeper Paddy Kenny and a glaring blunder by referee . Eddie Ilderton. Bothroyd’s 30-yard shot almost . embarrassed Kenny but the crossbar came to his rescue after he spilled . the striker’s strike. As Wednesday continued to press, they were denied a . clear penalty when Luciano Becchio dived full-length and palmed away a . Bothroyd corner with his right hand. Bothroyd finally made Wednesday . pressure pay, following a 44th-minute long throw from Michail Antonio. The striker rose highest, and though his header lacked venom, it was . directed well enough to defeat Kenny’s dive. Ripped down: A sign is torn from its berth at Hillsborough . As he celebrated the breakthrough, . Bothroyd appeared to be struck by a missile from the Leeds end. It was . not the only unsavoury note of a first half that often threatened to . boil over. Michael Brown was guilty . of overreacting after Miguel llera barged into him on the edge of the . area. The Leeds midfielder went down clutching his face, despite contact . appearing to be with his shoulder. Ilderton took no action, but may well . have punished Llera for another flashpoint, when the central defender . floored Becchio with what looked like a forearm smash. El Hadji Diouf was being barracked . more than any of the former Sheffield United players on view, and he . duly played up to the role of villain in a running verbal battle with . Ilderton over a series of decisions. But for all the aggression shown on . the pitch it is the actions of one crazed individual which will occupy . the football authorities as they investigate the end to a troubling . week.

"Kendra Wilkinson's husband Hank Baskett has been hit with claims he paid for a sexual encounter with a transsexual model, amid reports that his marriage is on the rocks. Now the transsexual model in question, Ava Sabrina London, has opened up about her alleged tryst with the former NFL star in a new interview with The National Enquirer. London claims that Baskett first contacted her in April to set up a meeting after watching her videos on YouTube. Scroll down for video... A family rocked by scandal: Hank Baskett, pictured with wife Kendra Wilkinson and son Hank Jr on May 16, has been accused by RadarOnline of cheating with a transsexual in late April - just weeks before this photo was taken . New girl: The woman Hank is accused of having an affair with is transsexual Ava Sabrina London - who also goes by the name Ava S Masaniai - pictured here in a Facebook shot . 'I met Hank Baskett probably around the 22nd or 23rd of April this year,' the model told the publication. 'He contacted me through a video I had posted on YouTube and we exchanged information.' She went on to describe how the former Minnesota Vikings wide receiver arrived unexpected one day, using a pseudonym (calling himself 'Steve') in an attempt to hide his identity.'Hank absolutely knew that I was a transsexual and he told me that I was the only transsexual he’s ever been with,' London stated. 'He thought I was beautiful.' The model then described in graphic . detail her sexual encounter with Baskett, which included many acts . but, she insists, never culminated in actual sex. She did, however, make . it clear that her client was 'very satisfied' after they both fondled . each other's penises. New details: Surveillance footage appears to show Baskett arriving to the transsexual's condo on June 4, pictured in Calabasas, California, last week . She likes a good photo: London showing off her assets in revealing bikini top shots she has posted to her social media pages . Suddenly famous?: The knockout has 60 videos on YouTube that will surely get a look at now that she has been linked to the Kendra On Top star . The former pro athlete took a shower to clean off after the '15-20 minute' session and paid London $500 before he left, according to London. RadarOnline also reports that London underwent a polygraph test with polygrapher Joseph Paolella prior to her interview with the National Enquirer, to bring legitimacy to her claims. Paolella concluded, according to Radar, there was 'no indication of deception during the polygraph examination' after she answered 'yes' to a barrage of questions - ranging from whether or not Baskett engaged in mutual masturbation, paid her for the session, knew that she was a transsexual, and paid her an additional sum on a second visit to her apartment to 'deny she ever met him'. Radar also has surveillance footage from the National Enquirer which they claim is Baskett's vehicle arriving at the transsexual's condo on June 4, to pay her over $2000 to keep quiet about their tryst in April. The video footage sees a truck that looks a lot like Baskett's arrive at the Los Angeles luxury condo through a second storey window. London's interview comes as . Kendra and Baskett have been weathering some negative reports lately . about their five year marriage that has resulted in two children: Hank . Jr, aged four, and Alijah, aged one month. They have so much going for them: The couple, with Hank Jr and new baby girl Alijah, have been together for five years and have yet to comment on new reports their marriage is in trouble . Not only did The National Enquirer . claim on Saturday that the 29-year-old Playboy cover girl kicked the . former football star out of their Los Angeles home, but on Monday RadarOnline accused the 31-year-old athlete of cheating with London. Hank reportedly paid the woman $2,500 to keep her mouth shut. This comes on the heels of claims that Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart also cheated with not one, but two transsexuals. Reps for Kendra did not return calls to MailOnline. The first time Hank met Ava, who goes under the YouTube handle Ava Masaniai, was 'around . April 22 in Sherman Oaks, California,' an insider told Radar. 'He called . her twice before they met in person. He said he’d seen her YouTube . videos online, and he couldn’t believe that her photos were real,' the source told Radar. At . the time Kendra, who came to fame on E!'s The Girls Next Door, was . eight months pregnant with their second child, Alijah, who was born in . May. The timing couldn't be any worse: the Kendra On Top stars are set to ring in their five year wedding anniversary on Friday. United: The family was seen in LA on Saturday afternoon, just hours after the National Enquirer reported the Playboy model kicked him out of their house, forcing him to check into a motel . Former playmate: Kendra used to be a pin up model before starting a family . Baskett tried his best to keep the alleged affair a secret. 'He used a fake name when organizing the encounter,' the source told Radar, 'and claimed he had never been with a transsexual before.' He met Ava - who has 60 YouTube videos - at her home. During their first encounter, 'they mutually masturbated' and he touched her 'breasts and penis.' 'The . entire encounter lasted probably about 15 to 20 minutes,' Radar's . insider claimed. 'Before leaving, he gave her almost $500 and told her . he wanted to stay in touch.' And in touch they kept. 'They spoke a couple times after their first sexual encounter. Hank always called from different numbers, and at least once from a pay phone,' Radar reported.'After the Casper Smart transsexual controversy, he started to get freaked out and paranoid she would say something, and called her six times in one day to plead with her not to spill.' Lopez broke up with Smart in early June after it was reported he romanced transsexuals Xristina Marie and Sofie Vissa. He denied being with either woman. The 44-year-old singer has since moved on to Dancing With The Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy. Hank used money to keep LA-based London (who studied at Modesto College) quiet, Radar claimed. 'He promised he would take care of her financially, and even left her $2,000 in a coffee cup at her house. 'He promised her $5,000 to keep her mouth shut, and even threatened to kill himself if the story got out!' Kendra, who was last seen with Hank on Saturday as the two ran errands with Alijah, wants to leave him, according to the site. Selfie obsessed: London has several self portraits from her bedroom, and in most of them she's showing off her toned figure that includes a flat stomach and toned legs . On Saturday The Enquirer reported that Hank was spotted speeding away from . their home on Friday and looked 'downtrodden' as he arrived at the motel with bags in hand. The . source told the publication: 'He went into the office of the motel and . then pulled the jeep around to the other side where the room was . located. Hank appeared disoriented and downtrodden. At one point, he . kicked the ground.' A new trend?: Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart, pictured in May, was also accused of seeing not one, but two transsexuals . The . Enquirer claimed Hank was joined by a woman wearing a 'medical type . uniform' and speculated it could be one of the children's nurses. The . insider said: 'He got out of the Jeep with a woman who appeared to . possibly be one of the couples’ baby nurses because she was wearing a . medical type uniform. 'An hour later, he emerged from the room but then returned back inside.' Hank spent most of Friday with his father Hank Sr at a Major League Gaming Competition in Anaheim. He tweeted: Mornin yall! @MrHankBaskettSr . & I are on our way down to the #MLGAnaheim championships. Small . road trip with pops=good times.' No idea what was coming! Kendra shared this upbeat tweet on Thursday . Family time: Hank spent the morning with his father before returning to the family home and quickly leaving for a local motel . He later wrote on Instagram: '#MLGAnaheim. The calm before the storm. Best of luck to mlg and all those playing this weekend!' However, after returning to the house, Hank abruptly left the property at 4pm for the motel. There was no sign of his father. The . allegations of marital discord come just one day after Kendra took to . Twitter to post an upbeat message, writing: 'Today will be a great day. I . know it. #CarpeDiem #smile #happiness #love #positivevibes.' And earlier on Friday she flashed a happy smile as she stepped out in baggy sweats that covered up her postpartum figure. Kendra and Hank married June 27, 2009 and welcomed Hank Jr in December of the same year. The blonde has spilled her family secrets on Kendra and Kendra On Top. It is not yet known if she could turn her new alleged marital woes into a reality spinoff much like Tori Spelling has done. No smiles here: The athlete and the model looked to be in a tense mood as they went out with daughter Alijah on Saturday afternoon .

"Territory: Dr Peng, 74 hired Nigella Lawson's divorce lawyer and wants the case to be heard in Malaysia, where his wife is likely to receive less of his fortune . The estranged wife of the billionaire chairman of Laura Ashley is divorcing her ‘very controlling’ husband – and wants a £500million settlement. Former beauty queen Pauline Chai claims Khoo Kay Peng, one of Malaysia’s richest men, made her feel ‘like a prisoner’ on their 1,000-acre country estate, and even rationed her food. She is seeking half his fortune at London’s High Court. Lawyers believe she could be awarded up to £500million – the largest divorce settlement ever seen in Britain. Miss Chai, 66, will claim in court that her husband would not let her leave the grounds without permission. The couple have five children from their 43-year marriage. According to Miss Chai, she and her husband have not spoken to each other for 12 months. Since their estrangement, she claims they have lived in separate mansions on their £30million estate, Rossway Park, near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. Bizarrely, each has their own team of Gurkha guards to protect their part of the estate – although it is unclear if this is for security reasons or to keep the other one at bay. Miss Chai lives in the main 15-bedroom house, while Dr Khoo, 74, occupies a five-bedroom manor house nearby. The main house is filled with Laura Ashley furniture, which Miss Chai insists is a reflection of her love for England, and not a tribute to her husband. The sprawling grounds include two custom-built lakes which cost £60,000 each and a collection of exotic animals including alpacas. Miss Chai claims she was not allowed to leave the house without her husband’s permission and once received an email from his staff saying she was allowed to spend only £50 a week on food. She explained: ‘It said fruits were allowed and vegetables were allowed but I wasn’t allowed to eat certain things that I wanted. ‘My daughter said to me that I was being treated like a servant. I think she nailed it.’ Miss Chai, who was crowned Miss Malaysia 1969, claims she had to rely on her bodyguards to buy make-up for her. She says she is now enjoying her freedom and has made new friends through her local church. She said: ‘I felt controlled and isolated. But now I feel happy. During our marriage he was very controlling but now I feel different. I feel very free.’ Dr Khoo, who is ranked the 36th richest man in Malaysia by US magazine Forbes, bought a 40 per cent stake in Laura Ashley in 1998. The clothing and interior firm now has sales of £286million a year. Trapped: Pauline Chai, pictured at home in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, said she was treated like a servant in her marriage. She claims he banned her from eating certain foods . He also runs a global investment company, Malaysian United Industries. Dr . Khoo wants the divorce case to be heard in Malaysia, where his wife . would be entitled to only a fraction of the settlement she could receive . in Britain. But Miss Chai is pushing for the case to be heard in England and will argue she has not been a Malaysian citizen for 30 years. She said: ‘I love England and everything English. I’ve been living here for years. I want English justice because it is fair. That’s all I’m asking for.’ The couple are believed to own multi-million-pound homes in Australia, Malaysia and Canada. They moved to Wentworth Park, Surrey, in 1995, before relocating to Rossway three years later. Miss Chai said the move meant that, ‘having lived in three [former] English colonies, I could finally live in the real thing – England’. The case will see a battle between two of  Britain’s top divorce lawyers. Ayesha Vardag, known as the ‘diva of divorce’, is representing Miss Chai, while Fiona Shackleton, who has been nicknamed the ‘steel magnolia’ for her charm and determination, is acting for Dr Khoo. Fortune: Dr Peng bought 40 per cent of Laura Ashley in 1998. His wife's mansion is filled with furniture from the company. She says this is a tribute to her love of England, not to her husband . Mrs Shackleton acted on behalf of Nigella Lawson during her recent ‘quickie’ divorce from Charles Saatchi. She also represented Prince Charles during his divorce from Diana, Princess of Wales. Ahead of forthcoming preliminary hearings, Miss Vardag said: ‘This is the husband trying desperately to forum-shop [find a court which would give him the best result] himself out of English courts into Malaysia where Pauline has not lived since her youth and of which she is not even a citizen. ‘The English courts would share out the assets this couple built up over more than 40 years of marriage with five children on the basis of fairness. The Malaysian courts would give Pauline much less.’ Miss Chai lodged a petition for divorce in London in February on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour.","Pauline Chai is seeking half her husband's fortune in what could be Britain's largest settlement .

"Illness: Lilian Kershaw, 84, developed the little-known disease bird fancier's lung after breathing in particles from her grandson's cockatiel Charlie, causing breathing problems . A grandmother died from a rare and deadly lung condition after almost ten years of being exposed to her grandson's pet cockatiel. Lilian Kershaw, 84, developed the little-known disease bird fancier's lung after breathing in particles from the bird's droppings and feathers when its cage was being cleaned out, . Despite never handling cockatiel Charlie, the retired cotton mill worker became increasingly breathless while exposed to the bird in her living room, an inquest heard. But unbeknown to her family the ill health was partly due to the bird, which was bought for grandson Lloyd in 2002. Mrs Kershaw's death was passed to the coroner over fears that her employment in the cotton mills could have resulted in an industrial type disease. But further inquiries into her death were prompted because of the presence of the cockatiel, with a doctor having previously diagnosed her with the condition. After a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, daughter Denise Bacchas, 56, said: 'I certainly regret buying Charlie, my son will be heartbroken. 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing and if we had known we would never have got Charlie. 'I'd never even heard of this before and it was not something that had crossed my mind, we just thought she was a little old lady with a lot of health problems.' The bird has since been handed over to a local RSPCA bird sanctuary to be rehoused. Mrs Bacchas added: 'Of course we were . attached to Charlie as you are with a pet but he had to go when we . found out he was affecting mum. There was no other option, by then it . just had to be done.' Inquest: Mrs Kershaw developed the condition after being exposed to particles in the cockatiel's droppings and feathers, an inquest heard (stock image) The . widow, who had six children and 13 grandchildren, lived with her . daughter and grandson Lloyd, 24, at their home In Failsworth, Oldham. She had become wheelchair-bound after developing arthritis. The . inquest heard that Mrs Kershaw had developed breathing problems in . later life, which were blamed on damp conditions in a previous house. Bird fancier's lung is a rare allergic reaction caused by inhaling dust from the feathers and droppings of certain birds. Birds linked with the disease include parrots, pigeons and budgerigars. It is one a group of conditions, known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, that relate to the breathing in of dust from organic materials. Symptoms usually develop four hours after exposure, including breathlessness and coughing. The symptoms, which can also include a high temperature and wheezing in extreme cases, usually disappear within three hours of exposure. The disease can become progressive, causing loss of weight, fatigue and breathing difficulty. Corticosteroids will relieve the symptoms, but preventing exposure to the dust is the easiest way of easing the symptoms. When cleaning the bird's cage, Mrs Bacchas would take the sandpaper-lined bottom from it, putting the bird's droppings in a bin bag. She added: 'My mother never handled him, nobody could because he was so vicious. He would peck you to death and he would draw blood. Whoever cleaned him would have to wear gloves.' She added that her mother rarely spent time in the loving room where the bird was kept but had to walk past it to get into other rooms. The inquest was told that Mrs Kershaw had been treated for lung disease and congestive heart failure. She also had panic attacks and became scared and frightened saying she couldn't breath and had to be taken into the fresh air for walks. Mrs Kershaw became reliant on oxygen for 18 months before her death and was referred to a chest physician at the Pennines Acute Hospital in 2010 because of the breathlessness. After breaking her collarbone, a . frail Mrs Kershaw was admitted to the Royal Oldham Hospital on November . 1 in 2011 where she rapidly deteriorated. She died on November 13 last . year. Dr Georges Ng Man Qwong, who diagnosed . her with the condition before her death, told the inquest that she had . had an allergic reaction in her lungs because of contact with the dust . and protein emitted from the bird. He . said: 'Bird fancier's lung is an uncommon condition and we do not see . it very often and a GP may only see a case once every 10 years. 'It . is caused by the exposure to a bird's protein in the feathers or . excrete. We do not know why people get it, but if they inhale the . protein there can be an allergic reaction in the lungs. Employment: It was initially thought that Mrs Kershaw's death may have been linked to her previous employment in Oldham's cotton mills, before the rare disease came to light . Deteriorated: Mrs Kershaw was admitted to the Royal Oldham Hospital in November 2011 after breaking her collarbone. Her health rapidly deteriorated and she died on November 13 last year . 'Contact with the protein and dust from the bird can happen when cleaning out the cage, the dust can become airborne and can be breathed in. 'If you are exposed it can cause illness even a few hours after cleaning the cage you can feel quite breathless. If you are exposed to the protein over time it can cause a reaction and it is seen as progressive breathlessness.' Dr Ng Man Qwong added that the diagnosis was supported by blood tests, CT scans and said that she was put on steroid therapy and exposure to the bird was to be reduced. Rochdale coroner Mr Simon Nelson said it was the first time in 10 years he had come across such an occurrence of Bird Fancier's Lung. He said: 'It was sadly and unbeknown to her at . the time of her exposure to dust and protein emulated by Charlie that . brought about her death. 'It would be an unnatural occurring . disease process, the only factor to bear in mind is whether she was . particularly susceptible, I do feel that her death was by reason of the . lung disease Bird Fancier's Lung.'","Lilian Kershaw, 84, became breathless after developing bird fancier's lung .

"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services kept its acting cyber security director on the government payroll for an astonishing eight months while he was in federal custody with child pornography charges  pending against him, MailOnline has learned. Timothy DeFoggi was convicted Tuesday of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiring to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with the intent to view child pornography. He will be sentenced in November. A federal grand jury indicted him on March 20, 2013. Eight months of pretrial motions followed before a trial date was set; court records show he was in federal custody by April 9 of last year. That wasn't enough to strip him of his sensitive job in the Obama administration. Sick: Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security for the U.S. Department of health and Human services, was convicted Tuesday on federal child pornography charges. He remained on HHS's payroll for nine months while charges pended against him . An HHS spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that DeFoggi joined the agency in September 2008, working in its Indian Health Service as a Supervisory IT Specialist. In March 2012 he was promoted to Lead IT Specialist in the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration, a job he held until January 2014. The Department of Justice said Tuesday in a statement that he was considered HHS's 'acting director of cyber security,' a role that gave him access to the inner workings of thousands of computers engaged in government work. DeFoggi's name appears on an HHS organizational chart in a planning document related to the agency's fiscal year 2014 budget request. The document describes him as being in charge of 'OS [operating system] IT Security Operations,' reporting directly to HHS Chief Information Security Officer Kevin Charest. The federal court docket in DeFoggi's criminal case shows that he petitioned the court for bail in July 2013, three months after he was remanded into custody, proposing home detention in a New Mexico house he owned. A federal magistrate judge denied the request four weeks later. His promotion at HHS came in the same month he registered on an underground website catering to pedophiles, according to federal prosecutors. He remained a member until December 2012, when federal investigators shut the site down. The HHS spokesman would not comment on why DeFoggi was employed for months while he was under indictment, and he had no response to questions about whether he was fired or allowed to retire. He also declined to say how much he was paid during that time and whether he will have to return the money. He referred MailOnline to the Justice Department, which did not respond to a request for comment. A Nebraska jury handed down seven separate guilty verdicts against DeFoggi on Tuesday, following a four-day trial in connection with child pornography websites operated by Aaron McGrath, who is serving a 20-year prison term. This chart, from the HHS fiscal 2014 'Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees' related to the 'Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund,' shows that during 2013 Timothy DeFoggi was in charge of operating-system security on all of HHS computers . Court records show that while DeFoggi was a resident of the Washington, D.C. bedroom community of Germantown, Maryland, he used the screen aliases 'F***Christ' and 'PTa**eater' to communicate with other people and trade images of children engaged in sexual conduct. The name of the website was often redacted from court filings, and MailOnline has opted not to print it. But federal prosecutors mentioned DeFoggi's screen names often in court. 'Through the website,' the Justice Department said Tuesday, 'DeFoggi accessed child pornography, solicited child pornography from other members, and exchanged private messages with other members where he expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children.' 'DeFoggi even suggested meeting one member in person,' the DOJ statement added, 'to fulfill their mutual fantasies to violently rape and murder children.' The grand jury's description of the crimes in their indictment was so graphic that a judge agreed to order the redaction – the blacking out – of entire pages on the government's publicly accessible computer servers. In one court filing, his lawyer conceded that 'In the ""About Me"" section of username ""f***christ's"" profile on ""Website A,"" it says: ""Have many perversions. Contact me for fantasy chat."" The attorney argued, unsuccessfully, that DeFoggi and his co-defendant, Zackary Austin, were engaging in harmless online fantasies. Kevin Charest (top C), chief information security officer for the Department of Health and Human Services Department, was DeFoggi's boss at HHS . Trouble: Sylvia Matthews Burwell, the newly minted HHS secretary, now has a new PR headache to add to her already heaving pile of Obamacare woes . McGrath, a Nebraska native, ran a trio of child-porn websites through TOR, 'the onion router,' an open network within the Internet that allows users to hide from network surveillance and surf online without leaving digital footprints. The FBI deployed a custom-made software program in a 2012 investigation it dubbed 'Operation Torpedo,' scouring every so-called '.onion' website it could find and determining which of them were related to illegal activity. McGrath operated two of his sites on the network server 'farm' where he worked by day, and operated a third from his home computer. Federal investigators found that he had left his administrator password blank on one of the child pornography sites. They quickly began collecting information that could identify the computers that were accessing it. One of the sites was a child-porn Facebook knockoff frequented by DeFoggi, 56, and another two dozen defendants the government identified. Other defendants snared by Operation Torpedo are named in court documents as Kirk Cottom, Vincent Diberardino, Jason Flanary, Michael Huyck, Brandon Moore, David William Peer, Russell Glenn Pierce, Kevin Pitman, Gary Reibert, John Sebes, Thomas Spencer and Joshua Welch. The FBI said Tuesday that DeFoggi was the sixth to be successfully prosecuted. When he ordered DeFoggi held without bail in  2013, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas D. Thalken noted that he appeared 'to have a mental condition which may affect whether the defendant will appear' if he were given bond. Attorney General Eric Holder helms the Justice Department, which announced DeFoggi's conviction on Tuesday in a four-day trial that involved seven criminal counts, all related to child pornography . It's not clear what that condition is, or whether it will have an impact on sentencing. John S. Berry Jr. and Justin B. Kalemkiarian, his two current attorneys in Lincoln, Nebraska, did not respond to requests for comment.","Timothy DeFoggi was found guilty Tuesday on seven child-porn criminal charges .

"A vicious brawl involving players, substitutes and riot police forced an Argentinian lower division match to be called off midway through the second half after 12 players were red carded. Deportivo Roca's match at home to Cipolletti in Group One of the Torneo Federal A, the  third tier in Argentina, erupted into chaos after two players were sent off following a seemingly innocuous clash. Following the melee, the referee handed out 12 red cards and the game was cancelled, Argentinian media reported. The fight broke out after two players were sent off following a seemingly innocuous clash . The situation escalated into a free for all brawl, with players from both teams throwing kicks and punches . Riot police also stormed the field in an attempt to quell the violence which broke out at the far end of the pitch . The fight erupted 22 minutes into the second half between players from Deportivo Roca and Cipolletti . Cipolletti defender Marcos Lamolla was initially given a yellow card for a foul on Fernando Fernandez, who protested and was sent off. This led to more protests, a scuffle and Lamolla was given another yellow and dismissed. Video footage of the game posted online showed the livid Lamolla running the entire length of the pitch to square up to Fernandez, who was already on his way to the dressing room, but then being intercepted by another player. The pair lashed out at each other which quickly led to a free-for-all in which players lunged at each other with flying kicks and punches, before Cipolletti players fled down the inflatable tunnel. Referee Facundo Espinosa told Argentinian media that he had sent off 10 further players in the chaos and they would be named in his official report. 'Both teams' players were disgraceful, they didn't behave like professionals,' said Deportivo Roca coach Diego Landeiro. 'It was a disgrace and it means lots of work down the drain. I'm very bitter.'

"Sarah Palin mocked President Barack Obama on Monday for his response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin's expansionist moves have been enabled by a White House that projects weakness. 'People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil,' the former Republican Governor of Alaska told Fox News host Sean Hannity. 'They look at our president as one who wears mom jeans.' Palin argued that economic and trade sanctions against Moscow would be useless against a Russian leader who's intent on rebuilding the Soviet Union one annexation at a time. 'Anyone who carries the commonsense gene would know that Putin doesn’t change his stripes,' she said. 'He wants to exert huge power and dominance, so he has to get to those border areas and he has to capture them.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VDEO .

Putin projects strength and machismo with bare-chested riding and bear-wrestling, Palin said . Palin grabbed the media spotlight with a 'told-ya-so' moment over the weekend by pointing out on Facebook that she had predicted Putin's Ukraine invasion six years ago. The one-time vice presidential candidate wrote a strongly worded post on Friday calling out her liberal critics for mocking her. 'Yes, . I could see this one from Alaska,' Palin wrote. 'I'm usually not one to . Told-Ya-So, but I did, despite my accurate prediction being derided as . “an extremely far-fetched scenario” by the “high-brow” Foreign Policy . magazine.'

"Four alleged members of rival gangs in the California prison system launched a hunger strike from solitary confinement that at one point in 2013 comprised 32,000 inmates - black, white and Latino - from 33 prisons, it has been revealed. The coordinated 59-day hunger-strike by opposing, racially aligned gangs resulted in a second legislative hearing into SHU conditions in Sacramento in February during which the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation unveiled a package of new regulations. From the Pelican Bay  State Prison's Security Housing Unit (SHU), Todd Ashker, allegedly a senior member of the Aryan Brotherhood (an affiliation he denies), Sitawa Jamaa, alleged minister of education for the Black Guerilla Family, Arturo Castellanos, allegedly a leader in the Mexican Mafia and Antonio Guillen, allegely one of three generals of Nuestra Familia spent years shouting through cell walls to form a political alliance and organize the strike. Unlikely allies: Todd Ashkar (left) an alleged member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Sitawa Jamaa (right), allegedly a member of the Black Guerilla Family . Hispanic gangs: Arturo Castellanos (left), allegedly a member of the Mexican Mafia, and Antonio Guillen (right), an alleged leader of Nuestra Familia . The strikers’ grievances centered on the solitary confinement policy that some experts consider the most oppressive in the country. The California prison system dictates that a confirmed gang member may be kept in the SHU indefinitely, with a review only once every six years - a policy more extreme than that for prisoners who kill another prisoner or guard. Some inmates have lived at the Pelican Bay SHU, where they are locked up 22 hours per day in seven by 10 cells, are not allowed phone calls and cannot have face-to-face contact with other humans, for four decades, reports the Mint Press News. The strict isolation policy is not devised as a punishment, but rather functions to isolate dangerous gang members from the rest of the prison population, curbing gang activity. Following a reorganization of the SHU to separate members of the same gangs in 2006, the most influential leaders of each gang came to be housed in a 'pod' together in a wing called the Short Corridor away from underlings who could be relied upon to do their bidding, reports New York Magazine. Behind bars: Gang members sent to the SHU could expect to languish for decades . Solitary cell: The men spend most of their time in a tiny, austere cell . Ashker, Jamaa, Castellanos and Guillen conducted a years-long conversation through drain pipes and holes in perforated doors, via secret notes and messages through lawyers, in which they became allies for the same cause and called themselves the Short Corridor Collective. Inspired by readings about prison protester Bobby Sands and philosophical works by Michel Foucault and Howard Zinn, the prisoners formulated their plan for a statewide hunger strike. For Ashker, the idea that they were all members of a single prisoner class and that racial segregation into gangs was encouraged by prisons to keep them divided resonated, reports New York Magazine. The men sent letters to an activist group explaining the strike and the reasoning behind it, and asking their fellow prisoners to join them. Letters to family and friends spread word of the action further. Despite years without seeing another person, the influence of the men in their respective gangs was still potent. Isolated: Pelican Bay State Prison SHU, in a lonely spot near the Oregon coast, is home to 1,100 inmates . Meals are delivered through a slot in the door and inmates have a court-mandated five hours of exercise per week in a concrete run . 'Castellanos is, if not the most influential Mexican Mafia member, right there at the top. Once you put his name on something with orders, the southern Hispanics are going to do it,' Lieutenant Jeremy Frisk of Pelican Bay's Institutional Gang Investigations told New York Magazine. A former Nuestra Familia member confirms his influence in the strike: 'It was Chuco Guillen, 100 per cent,' he said. By the time the hunger strikers were 40 days into their self-imposed starvation, 69 remained. The strike was finally broken on its 59th day after Jamaa convinced the others that a promise of a special hearing on conditions in the SHU was a victory. The state had already won permission to force-feed any inmate whose action put them close to death, reports New York Magazine. On September 5 2013, the Short Corridor 'suspended' its action. At the hearing in February, officials agreed that the SHU needs to change. 'We all agree that it is far too easy to get in and too hard to get out, and the stays in this environment have been far too long,' Martin Hoshino, an undersecretary of Corrections, testified. New methods to validate gang activity have been devised and Tom Ammiano, the chair of the Assembly’s Committee on Public Safety, has introduced bill capping the SHU confinement of a validated member or associate of a gang or security threat group at three years, reports Mint Press News.","A hunger strike in California prisons took place last year .

"[caption] . Facebook is heading for a catastrophic decline and could lose 80% of its users by 2015, researchers warned today. The team from Princeton claim the social networking site spread 'like an infectious diseases.' The predict its 'decline phase' has already begun - and will be swift. By treating Facebook's rapid adoption like the spread of an infectious disease, researchers at Princeton have devised a model that predicts Facebook will lose 80 per cent of its users in the next three years . Focus groups carried out as part of a recent Pew research found why teens are leaving Facebook. Female (age 19): 'Yeah, that's why we go on Twitter and Instagram [instead of Facebook]. My mom doesn't have that.' Female (age 15): 'If you are on Facebook, you see a lot of drama.' Female (age 14): 'OK, here's something I want to say. I think Facebook can be fun, but also it's drama central. On Facebook, people imply things and say things, even just by a like, that they wouldn't say in real life.' Male (age 18): 'It’s because [Facebook] it's where people post unnecessary pictures and they say unnecessary things, like saying he has a girlfriend, and a girl will go on and tag him in the picture like, me and him in the sun having fun. Why would you do that?' The researchers first analysed the rise and fall of MySpace to prove their theory could accurately predict the fall of a social network. They then analysed Google searches from Facebook, and say the results were very similar. 'Extrapolating the best ﬁt model into the future suggests that Facebook will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years, losing 80% of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017,' they said. 'The site has 'already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase.' To explain why social networks are like infectious diseases, the study pointed to similar research done with ideas. 'Ideas, like diseases, have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out, and have been successfully described with epidemiological model,' they say. 'Idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea, which can be thought of as the gain of “immunity” to the idea.' Researchers from Princeton used epidemiological models usually used to study disease - and say the 'decline phase' has already begun. Search queries for Facebook and Myspace: Researcher say the decline of Facebook has already begun - and will happen incredibly quickly, mirroring the death of MySpace . However, the researcher admit their study has not yet been peer-reviewed. Facebook, which currently boasts 874 million users worldwide, would certainly object to being compared to a viral epidemic. But the company itself admitted in October to losing teen users. Over 11m teenagers and college students have left Facebook since 2011, an analyst claimed earlier this week. Digital consultancy iStrategy Labs released a study it says uses data from Facebook’s own Social Advertising platform to come up with the shocking figures. Experts believe that young people are increasingly abandoning the site to turn to apps such as WhatsUp, Snapchat and others. the researchers analysed the rise and fall of MySpace to test their theory, looking at the number of search terms over time for the side to develop their model. According to iStrategy, Facebook has 4,292,080 fewer high-school aged users and 6,948,848 college-aged users than it did in 2011. Late last year Facebook shares went on a 24 hour rollercoaster after the company's chief financial officer admitted that teenagers are losing interest in the site. Shares in the social network soared around 15 per cent to $57.98 (£36.16) following the site's latest quarterly earnings announcement, before suddenly failing to $47.40. The dip was attributed to comments made by Facebook's chief financial officer David Ebersman about a decline in teenagers using the social network site. 'We did see a decrease in daily users, especially younger teens,' said Ebersman on a conference call with analysts, although added: 'Our best analysis of youth engagement in the U.S reveals that usage of Facebook among U.S teens overall was stable.' Facebook did not release official figures about the current number or users who are teenagers or how substantial this drop was. Another recent study found teenagers are turning away from Facebook because of oversharing friends and concerns over their parents knowing what they are up to. It found they are turning to Twitter and services like Snapchat in increasing numbers - where they are sharing more personal information about themselves than ever before. Researchers found a big increase in the number of 'selfies' being posted, along with information about their school, city and even their mobile phone number. Teens told researchers there were too many adults on Facebook and too much sharing of teenage angst and inane details like what a friend ate for dinner. 'The key is that there are fewer adults, fewer parents and just simply less complexity and less drama,' said Amanda Lenhart of the Pew Research Center, one of the study's authors. 'They still have their Facebook profiles, but they spend less time on them and move to places like Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.'","Report says social networking site spread 'like a disease'

"A Las Vegas woman is outraged after a police officer allegedly ran over her beloved dog, Freckles, with his two-ton cruiser on purpose then cited the family for having him unrestrained. Sarah Hecht, 22, said the cop told her he intentionally ran over the animal after it escaped from her backyard on May 21 and was running toward a group of children playing. She rushed the wounded pet to the vet but had to put down the 45-pound Australian shepherd hybrid because of the injuries he suffered. Scroll down for video . Angry: Sarah Hecht, 22, pictured, is furious after she claims police ran over her dog Freckles, pictured, killing it . FOX Carolina 21 . Freckles was a birthday gift Hecht received after getting straight As in high school. Devastated, the woman staged a rally at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday protesting canine killings by Las Vegas police. Around a dozen people showed up and shouted 'Justice for Freckles' as they called for enhanced training for officers dealing with animals. Hecht was overcome with emotion while speaking of Freckles who she claims was like a child to her. 'I don't have children. He was my son,' she said. Heartbroken: Hecht, pictured left and right with Freckles, said the dog was like her son . According to the Las Vegas Review Journal, an officer told Hecht he purposefully ran over the dog after he noticed it running towards the play area. The dog was dragged along the street by the police car, but survived. However, once at the vet, Hecht made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal. While she was there, her father was cited for having an unrestrained dog. Hecht claims Freckles escaped her backyard after he was taunted by neighborhood children and she insists the dog would never hurt anyone and had no history of biting humans. Rally: Hecht and about a dozen others held a protest on Thursday calling for police to be better trained in their handling of animals . Justice: The group held placards calling for 'Justice for Freckles' Following the protest on Thursday, Hecht wept before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron. She explained what had happened to the dog and said she was broke after forking out $1,000 to try and save her 'son's' life. Bennett-Haron and prosecutors quickly agreed to dismiss the charges, the Review Journal reported. The citation wasn't the first for the Hecht family regarding Freckles. The 22-year-old has been cited twice in the past for animal code violations, including not obtaining a permit or sterilizing her dogs. Court records show both matters were also dismissed. The police department refused to comment to the Review Journal on the matter because an investigation is still ongoing.

Shortly after the message was posted, parents of pupils at the school branded the message 'abusive' and demanded the teacher be sacked. It is not yet known how the teacher's Facebook post came to the attention of the parents. A spokeswoman for Birmingham City Council has now confirmed that the maths teacher resigned from his post as head of mathematics at Cardinal Wiseman Technology College yesterday morning.

Ofsted inspectors visited the 600-pupil mixed sex school more than a year ago and lowered its rating from 'satisfactory' to 'requires improvement'. While pupil behaviour was rated as 'good', Ofsted said teaching needed 'improving'.

"A green sea turtle was today enjoying a new lease of life thanks to the world's first dive belt built exclusively for endangered sea creatures. Ali has managed to dive properly for the first time in 11 years, since she was hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell, stopping her from submerging and causing her to float bottom up. The metre-long turtle, who weighs more than 10 stone, had  found herself stranded on the surface. Suited up: A team at Weymouth Sea Life Adventure Park in Dorset have created a pioneering belt with 2.5lbs of removable lead weights that works just like those used by scuba divers . Help: Ali's giant shell was split open by an engine propeller and she was left for dead after being hit by a boat in her native Palm Beach in Florida. Now a team at Weymouth Sea Life Adventure Park in Dorset have created a pioneering belt with 2.5lbs of removable lead weights that works just like those used by scuba divers. The new invention is believed to be the first of its kind - and means Ali, named after boxer Muhammad Ali, can dive again. Fiona Smith, curator at the Sea Life park, said: ‘The common thing to do is to stick weights to injured turtles' shells to allow them to dive. 'But where Ali's shell was in slightly worse condition because of her accident it wasn't that easy. ‘My team and I started thinking about how else we could attach the weights, and came up with the idea of a harness. ‘We took the idea to a nearby dive shop and they came back to us with a custom-built dive belt we could slip weights into. It needs a few tweaks but otherwise it is ideal. Special project: The new invention is believed to be the first of its kind - and means Ali can dive again . Ready to go: A protected endangered species, green turtles breathe oxygen but spend most of their lives under the water feeding and sleeping . ‘It will take a little time for Ali to get used to wearing her new jacket but eventually we see her wearing it all the time. Poor Ali used to float like a butterfly and swim like a bee. 'This new invention will make life so much better for her. If the belt is successful it could pave the way for the other turtles' Fiona Smith, Sea Life Adventure Park . ‘But this new invention will make life so much better for her. If the belt is successful it could pave the way for the other turtles.’ Ali's giant shell was split open by an engine propeller and she was left for dead after being hit by a boat in her native Palm Beach in Florida. Luckily she was rescued and nursed back to health at a special hospital for turtles - but when her injuries eventually healed an air pocket was left under the shell giving her unwanted buoyancy. She's back: Ali has managed to dive properly for the first time since 2001, when she was hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell, stopping her from submerging and causing her to float bottom up . Thought to be 15 to 20 years old, Ali was one of five hospitalised green turtles transferred to Weymouth to ease numbers. All five had weights glued to their shells to help them dive but her shell was so badly damaged the weights wouldn't stick, prompting work to start on the special belt. A protected endangered species, green turtles breathe oxygen but spend most of their lives under the water feeding and sleeping. They can dive for up to five minutes and sleep underwater for more than an hour. In the wild, green turtles – known as chelonia mydas - can live for more than 80 years.","Ali had been hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell .

"Scientists at University College London have hacked a pair of sandals which they claim will allow people to 'hear themselves happy' Forget meditation and self-help books, the key to a happy life could be down to the sounds you hear. Scientists in London have hacked a pair of sandals which they claim will allow people to 'hear themselves happy'. The sandals link to headphones which change the sound of each footstep to gradually make a person feel lighter. Volunteers who wore the sandals said they felt slimmer, with longer legs and looser knees. They also reported feeling happier and more energised. The shoes were created by Ana Tajadura-Jiminez at University College London's Hearing Body Project. 'It would give the same benefits as the sandals when walking or running, perhaps in the gym to feel lighter and more motivated,' Ms Tajadura-Jiminez said in an interview with New Scientist. 'We are finding that sound is affecting not just the perception of our body shape but our physical capabilities. Understand these sounds and we could change our feelings in a positive way.' The sandals exploit a phenomenon called 'predictive coding' in which the brain makes decisions based on past experience. Ms Tajadura-Jiminez explained that if the sensory feedback you get is not what you were expecting you update your predictions. Technology such as this could help people with as body dysmorphia, where a mental illness makes them unable to see themselves correctly. Scroll down to watch the video and try the experiment yourself . During the test, a participant was asked to run her finger across a strip of smooth plastic (pictured). As she moved her hand, headphones played the sound of a finger moving across different surfaces.  Experts believe that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain, and this creates a mismatch between the senses . 'Something that enhances runner's perception would be very popular,' Sports Engineer Steve Haake at Sheffield Hallam University told the Telegraph. In a separate experiment in particular, Ms Tajadura-Jiminez proved that sounds can trick the brain into thinking they're touching a variety of different surfaces. During the test, reported in New Scientist, a participant was asked to run her finger across a strip of smooth plastic. As she moved her hand, headphones played the sound of a finger moving across paper, sandpaper and velvet. When the sound of a finger moving across sandpaper (stock image left) and velvet (right) were played, the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt beneath her finger. Researchers want to study how  sounds can be manipulated to affect a person's mood and perception . The participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt beneath her finger after each sound. Dr AnaTajadura-Jiménez believes that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain, and creates a mismatch between the senses. This is a similar experience people get when viewing optical illusions. In the case of optical Illusions, colour, light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain. The information collected by the eye is processed by the brain. In the process of converting what it sees, the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns. This creates a perception that doesn't match the image, and confuses the brain. Similarly, in terms of audio changes, the information collected by the ear is processed by the brain, which then tries to make sense of the differences. As the brain tries to account for discrepancies, it produces a variety of sensations. As part of the project, Dr Tajadura-Jimenez also studies how auditory information generated by the human body affects how that person comes across, and how people see them. 'This mental representation we have of our bodies is essential for successful interaction with the environment,' explained Dr Tajadura-Jimenez. Previous studies have highlighted the role that sight, touch and a person's own perception - known as proprioception - play in representation. But, the effect sounds have on these senses and experiences haven't been investigated in depth. 'Interestingly, the sounds that accompany almost every bodily movement are highly rich in information about the body and the space immediately surrounding it,' continued Dr Tajadura-Jimenez. She used the example that the sounds produced when tapping on a surface tells people about the length and strength of their arm. Dr Tajadura-Jiménez believes that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain, and creates a mismatch between the senses. This is similar to the experience people have when viewing optical illusions. In the case of optical Illusions, colour, light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain.

"The warning was made by Amsterdam-based engineer, Nell Watson at a recent conference . Future generations could be exterminated by Terminator-style robots unless machines are taught the value of human life. This is the stark warning made by Amsterdam-based engineer Nell Watson, who believes droids could kill humans out of both malice and kindness. Teaching machines to be kind is not enough, she says, as robots could decide that the greatest compassion to humans as a race is to get rid of everyone to end suffering. 'The most important work of our lifetime is to ensure that machines are capable of understanding human value,' she said at the recent 'Conference by Media Evolution' in Sweden. 'It is those values that will ensure machines don't end up killing us out of kindness.' Ms Watson claims computer chips could soon have the same level of brain power as a bumblebee – allowing them to analyse social situations and their environment. 'Machines are going to be aware of the environments around them and, to a small extent, they're going to be aware of themselves,' said Ms Watson, who is also the chief executive of body scanning firm Poikos. 'We're starting to understand the secrets of the human brain,' she points out, while at the same time we're getting better at programming computers with deep learning. 'It's going to create a huge change in our society all around the world'. For instance, Google is already working on . self-driving cars that can automatically sense traffic and adjust their . speed and direction. Mr Musk has previously claimed that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. He is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. A still of the Terminator is pictured . Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans. One of its founders warned artificial intelligence is 'number 1 risk for this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent interview. Among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. Meanwhile, Japan is leading the way in creating home-help robots for the elderly and injured. While Ms Watson warning seems grim, she believes a robot uprising isn't necessarily a negative event. 'Machines can help us understand ourselves and gather self-knowledge,' she said. 'I can't help but look at these trends and imagine how then we shall live? When we start to see super-intelligent artificial intelligence are they going to be friendly or unfriendly?' The warning echoes similar comments earlier this month by Tesla-founder, Elon Musk who said artificial intelligence could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons. Musk referred to the book ‘Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies’, a work by Nick Bostrom that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers. Mr Bostrom has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation. In a later comment, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’ The 42-year-old is so worried, he is now investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. In March, Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher. Vicarious is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain’s neocortex. The neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals. It is around 3mm thick and has six layers, each involved with various functions. These include sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language in humans. According to the company’s website: ‘Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain. The warning echoes similar comments tweeted earlier this month by SpaceX founder, Elon Musk who said artificial intelligence could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons . High flier:  Elon Musk (pictured) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online. The billionaire entrepreneur is now exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against Google and Facebook . ‘Our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans. ‘Powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the Recursive Cortical Network.’ In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘reliably’ solves modern Captchas - the world’s most widely used test of a machine’s ability to act human. Captchas are used when filling in forms, for example, to make sure it’s not being completed by a bot. This prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets, for example. Professor Stephen Hawking has also warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Earlier this year, the renowned physicist discussed Jonny Depp's film Transcendence, which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans. Professor Hawking said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘worst mistake in history’. Stephen Hawking has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind. 'Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,' he said writing in the Independent. 'Unfortunately, it might also be the last'","The warning was made by Amsterdam-based engineer, Nell Watson .

"Victim: Zong Qinghou, chairman of drinks giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group, was injured in a knife attack near his home in Hangzhou, east China, last Friday . China's second richest man has been attacked by a knife-wielding labourer after refusing to offer him a job, it is claimed. Multi-billionaire tycoon Zong Qinghou, chairman of drinks giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group, has been left with severed tendons in his left hand following the 'revenge attack', according to state media. The 67-year-old, who was until recently considered China's richest man, was confronted near his home in the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, east China, last Friday. His attacker - identified as a 49-year-old migrant worker called Mr Yang - was arrested by police within hours of the assault. Earlier this year, Mr Yang had borrowed 30,000 yuan (£3,069) to travel to Zhejiang from the neighbouring province of Jiangsu in search of work, according to Xinhua News Agency. He sought out Mr Zong near his home after seeing him help impoverished migrant workers on a television programme and asked the self-made billionaire for a job. He is said to have launched a knife attack on Mr Zong after his request for work was rebuffed. The exact nature of the assault remains unclear - however, Mr Qinghou is reported to be recovering from his injuries. Mr Zong, a self-made billionaire, speaks to journalists at a press conference in Hangzhou following the attack . Mr . Zong, who fell to second place in China's rich list this year, has an . estimated total wealth of nearly $19billion (£11.9billion). He founded Wahaha in 1987 and built it into China's largest drinks manufacturer - maintaining a 60 per cent growth rate year on year. Today, Mr Zong, who is known for his daily hobbies of smoking cigarettes and drinking tea, oversees an empire of more than 150 consumer products. Despite his enormous wealth, he is reported to be a down-to-earth, no frills businessman who regularly makes a point of eating in his company's staff cafeteria.

"Dozens of demonstrators were faced with tear gas and water cannons by police in Istanbul today as they protested against the Turkish government's policy towards Syria. Two groups of protesters were marching to Besiktas district near the Dolmabahce Palace on the European side of the city when officers blocked their path, reports the state-run Anatolia News Agency. Some of the demonstrators, said to be mainly students, tried to climb barriers while police used water cannons and tear gas on the groups. Others took refuge in the historic Dolmabahce Mosque. Protesters in Istanbul clashed with riot police today during a protest against the Turkish government's foreign policy on Syria . Two groups had their paths blocked by police who unleashed water cannons and tear gas against them in the European side of the city . The crackdown followed similar scenes in Ankara yesterday, where clashes between students and security forces using cannons and gas saw 30 arrested and two injured. Crowds in Istanbul and Ankara were protesting against prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's funding and support for the Syrian rebels against President Bashar Assad. Syria has accused the Turkish government of facilitating the flow of arms, explosives, vehicles, fighters and money to rebels across the border. Turkey, a Nato member, has hosted opposition leaders, rebel commanders and thousands of refugees since the Syrian civil war began. At the weekend, two car bombs killed more than 50 people in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli, with deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc blaming Assad's regime for the blasts.Four suspects were formally arrested and remanded in custody yesterday over the bombings, Anatolian news agency said. It was not clear what charges they faced. They were among nine Turks, including the alleged mastermind of the attacks, detained soon after the bombings. Foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu has said the perpetrators were from an 'old Marxist terrorist organisation' with ties to Assad's government. Syria has denied any involvement. Turkey, which hosts about 400,000 Syrians, is struggling to manage the flow of Syrians across its border. The clashes happened near the Dolmabahce Palace, with some sheltering in the Dolmabahce mosque . The police action in Istanbul followed similar force against yesterday's protesters in Ankara . Only around half of those who have fled live in refugee camps while tens of thousands of others have settled in towns and cities along the 560mile border. The United Nations says the number of Syrian refugees in Turkey could climb to a million by the end of the year. Ankara has grown increasingly troubled by what it calls international inaction on the crisis, which has long divided the big powers. Erdogan, who has often voiced such frustrations, was meeting U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington today, with Syria expected to top the agenda. Like the U.S., Turkey has supported the opposition in the Syrian crisis, and Erdogan has been calling for more aggressive steps to topple Assad, including establishing a no-fly zone in Syria. The Obama administration remains reluctant to take the kind of action Turkey would like to see. While U.S. officials have said they are not excluding the possibility of arming some carefully vetted groups of rebels in the future, they remain reluctant of providing the opposition with heavier weapons for fear they could end up in the hands of radical Islamic groups that have become the most effective fighting force on the opposition side. The twin bombings in Reyhanli, among the bloodiest in Turkey's modern history, stoked unease among Turks along the border most affected by the turmoil in Syria. Several protests have erupted in Reyhanli and other nearby towns since the bombings, with many locals blaming security problems on Ankara's policy of supporting the Syrian opposition. While riots raged in Turkey, the prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Washington to meet President Obama . Protests against Turkey's support of the Syrian rebels have increased in the wake of a car bombing which killed 50 at the weekend . Others have taken out their frustration on the Syrians themselves. Thousands of Syrians have settled in Reyhanli because of its proximity to the border and because most of its people are Sunnis, like almost all the refugees. A Syrian doctor in Reyhanli who treats wounded Syrians at a rehabilitation centre said one of his nurses had been attacked on the street hours after the blasts. Others said their cars had been attacked and one said locals had seized him and handed him over to the police. While the incidents appear to be isolated and sporadic, the general sense of anger directed at the Syrians has made most of the refugees too afraid to venture out of their homes. Turkish president Abdullah Gul said any sudden population influx could allow those with 'bad intentions' to surface, but urged people in the area to be 'level-headed' and said the bomb perpetrators would be punished. Syria's crisis, which began in March . 2011 with pro-democracy protests and later turned into a civil war that . has killed an estimated 70,000 people, has taken on increasingly . sectarian overtones.","In Istanbul, protesters faced police force in the European side of the city .

"The British double agent who foiled the ‘underwear bomb plot’ could receive millions of dollars for carrying out his daring mission, a former top CIA official said last night. The man is likely to receive the cash from the American authorities for risking his life infiltrating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. His family will also be relocated to ensure their safety. Plotter? Senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot . Yesterday it emerged that MI6 gave the Saudi-born spy UK citizenship specifically for the mission. By holding a British passport, he . would have been a more attractive Al Qaeda recruit, as he would have . been able to travel to the US without a visa. Phil Mudd, a former deputy director of . the CIA’s counter- terrorism centre, said there was no doubt the spy . and his family would be financially secure for the rest of their lives. He said: ‘He’s going to get a pay cheque that you or I would want any day of the week. We’re talking millions.’ New terror alert: The feds say Al-Qaeda planned to strike on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death . According to reports from the US, the . CIA was involved in the operation so it is likely the money will come . from them, or possibly the FBI. It is unclear whether British intelligence services will also contribute to the pay-off. The agent’s extraordinary role was . revealed earlier this week when it emerged he had thwarted an alleged . plot to send an ‘undetectable’ bomb on a plane bound for America. The device would have been a more . advanced version of the one used by the ‘underpants bomber’ Umar Farouk . Abdulmutallab in the failed Christmas 2009 plot. Instead of boarding a jet and setting the device off, the double agent flew out of Yemen and gave it to his handlers. His pay-off reflects the extreme . personal danger he put himself through when he spent months undercover . in Yemen. The exact sum is unlikely to be disclosed, but could include . the reward for providing information which led to the US drone strike . which killed Al Qaeda commander Fahd al-Quso. The bounty for information leading to his capture was posted by the FBI at £3.1million. The agent is said to have been . recruited by MI6 for an operation to target Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, the . Al Qaeda master bombmaker. Bomber shorts: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab wore this underwear outfitted with explosives for three weeks before the failed bomb attempt on Christmas Day 2009 . Terror strike: Abdulmutallab, pictured in his 2009 mugshot, was sentenced to three life terms after pleading guilty . The spy had fallen in with jihadist . sympathisers and was ‘turned’ around a year ago in an operation that . involved Saudi intelligence agencies. He was sent to Yemen when it . emerged a definite plot was under way and he volunteered to blow himself . up on an America-bound jet. According to the American news channel . CNN, the device he was given was designed to be worn in a garment of . some kind that would go over his underwear. It used a chemical as a detonator that would have been undetectable by airport scans. MI6 officials have confirmed that the agent was given British nationality for the mission. The operation shows the close co-operation among the US, British and Saudi intelligence services. On Wednesday, the Mail revealed how . thousands of passengers flew to America from UK airports last week . unaware they were being guarded by US air marshals, after the latest . underwear bomb plot was smashed. Security officials in America said . hundreds of armed guards had been sent to Europe to accompany flights . following reports that Al Qaeda was planning a ‘spectacular’ to mark the . first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden by US special . forces in Pakistan. Dozens of transatlantic jets operated . by British and American airlines are understood to have had at least one . air marshal on board.

"A police force which helped patrol the streets of Ferguson during protests over the killing of Michael Brown is kitted out with grenade launchers and military-grade vehicles. The lethal arsenal of the St Louis Police Department, which sent forces to the Missouri city during fraught demonstrations this year, also includes mobile riot shields, Tasers and an extensive array of conventional firearms. Police officers armaments, often provided by the Federal government under a scheme to re-use old army equipment, have been under increased scrutiny after shocking images of heavily-armed officers emerged in the wake of Michael Brown's death in August. Kitted out: Heavily-armed police officers lined the streets of Ferguson in August. The arsenal of one of the departments involved has been revealed under freedom of information laws . Freeze: Conventional firearms populated most of the list, but more exotic weapons and vehicles also feature . The new list of equipment was revealed to BuzzFeed News under freedom of information laws, and details all significant equipment acquired by the police force since 2004. Worrying entries in the arsenal of the force, which is responsible for just over 300,000 people, include two PGL-65 multi-shot grenade launchers, from which one officer can fire six canisters in a matter of seconds without reloading. The pump-action weapons were seen on the streets of Ferguson firing tear gas rounds, but can also launch flash bangs, non-lethal foam rounds, and traditional 40mm explosive grenades. The police department also has access to a 1969 Hughes MH-6C helicopter, which can have mini-guns, rockets and anti-tank missile attached. It also has two other helicopters. A member of the St. Louis County Police tactical team fires rounds of tear gas into a crowd of people in response to a series of gun shots fired at the police during demonstrations along W. Florissant Road . Soundwaves: An acoustic launcher capable of firing deafening noises into crowds, like the one above, featured in the St Louis Police Department kitlist . Dozens of pistols and rifles were also included in the load-out - as was a powerful 'acoustic device' which can fire deafening noises into crowds. Defensive equipment for the police included dozens of thick riot shields and a BearCat armored personnel carrier which is strong enough to withstand a blast from a land mine. Proponents of the mass buy-up of lethal technology has said that a well-armed police force can help shut down potentially dangerous confrontations. Taking aim: Officers were given heavy weapons and an armored personnel carrier . However, critics say it creates an overly aggressive force which is more able - and likely - to inflict harm on the population. On August 20 in Ferguson a police officer, Ray Albers, was suspended after pointing an assault rifle at a Ferguson protester and reportedly threatening to kill.","Equipment form St Louis Police Department's stash was revealed .

"Thomas Muller is on his way to 'mullering' Gerd Muller and Miroslav Klose to become Germany’s greatest ever striker. If Muller nets against France on Friday he will become only the third player in World Cup history to hit five goals at two World Cups. It has previously been done by Peru’s Teofilo Cubillas in 1970 and 1978 and Klose in 2002 and 2006. High flyer: Thomas Muller fails with a spectacular bicycle kick in Germany's 1-0 win over USA . Heading to the top? Miroslav Klose need just one goal to become the outright leading World Cup scorer . Leading the way: Gerd Muller (centre) scores for West Germany against Australia at the 1974 World Cup . Indeed, at 24, Muller has possibly two World Cups left in him so could usurp Klose, who needs one goal to move clear of Brazil’s Ronaldo as the most prolific World Cup finals scorer with 16 goals. It will take a lot for the modern Muller to beat Gerd 'Der Bomber' Muller's achievement of 10 goals at the 1970 finals. He added four in 1974. Like Gerd, Thomas plays for Bayern Munich having come through the ranks and is not for sale. James Rodriguez was rejected by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson four years ago when he first started to emerge as a force in Argentina. United’s South American scouts identified 'James' as a future star but in the end Fergie opted for Javier Hernandez and Bebe instead. Fancy feet: Colombia's James Rodriguez is wanted by a host of clubs after an impressive World Cup . So Rodriguez moved from Argentinian club Banfield to Porto in Portugal before moving on to Monaco. He has been linked to a £40million move to United but, with injured fellow countryman Radamel Falcao being lined up by Real Madrid, he is set to stay for at least another season in France. Manchester United allowed Paul Pogba to leave their academy and join Juventus after a wage dispute and won't pay the £60m being quoted to bring him back. Chelsea are still considering a move for the 21-year-old Frenchman. But he is more likely to move to Real Madrid when Zinedine Zidane eventually takes over as boss - which may happen next year after he spends a year as boss of Real's feeder club Castilla. Middle man: Paul Pogba (centre) has impressed in central midfield for France at the World Cup . That is if Paris St Germain don’t push out the boat this summer to sign Pogba, who is known by his French team-mates as La Pioche - 'The Pickaxe'. If Brazil are to beat Columbia on Friday, then keeper Julio Cesar is likely to be as much their hero as Neymar. It seems incredible that at the start of last season Cesar couldn’t get a game in the Championship for QPR. Indeed he often didn’t make the bench behind much ridiculed former England keeper Rob Green. Hero: Julio Cesar saves Alexis Sanchez's penalty in Brazil's win over Chile in the last 16 . But it wasn’t because Harry Redknapp didn’t rate him, it was just about getting him off the books given his £90,000-a-week salary. Cesar is still technically a QPR player and the club are still paying around half his wages while he is on loan at MLS club Toronto. He could return to QPR next season but the club hope his displays at this World Cup will convince somebody to buy him. One to Watch: . It seemed when France axed Samir Nasri and then Frank Ribery was injured they would lack flair from the midfield or the flanks. But Mathieu Valbuena - be honest how many had heard of him before? - has come to the fore and France have flourished with goals. Creative spark: Mathieu Valbuena has been the driving force for France going forward . He has the been the main creative force of the team - and according to FIFA stats has teed up eleven chances . I-say: . German boss Joachim Low has said England will NEVER win the World Cup again. He may have a point but may well have led the FA to a solution. Who is the man who re-invented the German national team, helped Low on his way, then went over to the USA and turned their national team into a serious force? Jurgen Klinsman. A German as England boss. Warum nichts? Word Cup moment: . Tim Howard, according to the stat men, made 15 'saves' for the USA against Belgium - apparently a World Cup record since such things were first logged in 1966. The great wall of America: Tim Howard pulled off a record number of saves for the US against Belgium . Whichever way you want to look at it, Howard produced the best all-round keeper display at the finals. But Gordon Bank’s save from Pele’s header in 1970 surely remains the greatest single save. World Cup Bet . Brazil and Germany are odds-on favourites to progress but the odds could be turned on their head. Neymar insists he has the shoulders to carry the weight of the nation, but carrying the Brazil forward line - which he has done brilliantly so far - could well prove too much against this talented and spirited Columbia side. And in James Rodriguez, Columbia have a player who can unlock a well-drilled Brazil defence. A 1-1 draw at 90 minutes is 6-1. Columbia can then go on to win on penalties. France versus Germany, meanwhile, has the making of a modern classic. So stick your neck out and trust Karim Benzema to keep on scoring. A 3-2 France win in 90 minutes is 45-1.

"A koala which was hit by a car and scurried up a tree before falling from it unconscious, has been saved by a firefighter who performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on it. The koala, dubbed Sean, was caught in a blanket by quick-thinking firefighters who were placed underneath the tree in the event it fell. Rescue teams from Langwarrin, in Melbourne's outer southeast, and another from Wildlife Victoria rescued the animal on Thursday night after members of the public first spotted it stuck up a tree. Scroll down for video . The koala being attended to by firefighters after it was rescued when it fell from a a tree . The koala is resting up in hospital after it was given mouth to mouth by a firefighters . They called in the rescuers who said the koala had been hit by a car before climbing up the tree. A team from the state's Country Fire Authority (CFA) arrived in a truck with an extended ladder capable of reaching the animal, but before they got to him he lost consciousness and fell to the ground. The firefighters managed to catch him in an outstretched blanket before giving Sean mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, oxygen and chest compressions by wildlife officers. Langwarrin CFA Captain Sean Curtin told Fairfax Media's 3AW it was initially thought the koala was dead in the tree. 'We believe it died in the tree, just when we were trying to rescue it.' 'Then it fell out of the tree and the members caught it in a blanket,' Mr Curtin told Fairfax Media. 'Wildlife Victoria performed mouth-to-mouth and compressions and gave it some oxygen therapy as well.' Mr Curtin told 9NEWS that the CFA had a strong connection with koalas ever since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires which destroyed the animal's Victorian habitats. Rescue teams administer oxygen to the animal before it was taken to a Victorian animal hospital to recover . A red blanket was used to catch the koala which fell from the tree unconscious . A ladder was used to safely escort the 'Sean' out of the tree but it fell before rescuers could get to him . 'To be able to put it back in the community and have a fantastic result like that from a koala is absolutely brilliant,' Mr Curtin said. Kylie Juraschek, also of the CFA, said the crew were relieved that the animal was recovering after the ordeal and said the team had put a lot of work into his rescue. 'It is very rewarding because unfortunately we get called out to a lot of sad situations,' she said. 'It was just a very, very good feeling and pleasing to see.' The animal is receiving treatment for its injuries at a Victorian animal hospital. 'It's doing OK but it needs to assessed by a vet today. It doesn't have any visible injuries and seems to be in good shape,' a Wildlife Victoria spokeswoman said. The incident comes following the release of a koala back in to the wild after it clung for his life to the grille of a car for nearly 90kms. Nicknamed Blinky Grille, the koala arrived at the Australia Zoo Wildlife hospital four weeks ago after colliding with a car on the Bruce Highway, north of Brisbane. The animal was found at a service station near Gympie and taken into care before being released last week.","Victorian firefighters were called to rescue koala stuck up a tree .

'Ninjas proper no longer exist.' But Kawakami has decided to let the art die with him because ninjas 'just don't fit with modern day', adding: 'We can’t try out murder or poisons. Even if we can follow the instructions to make a poison, we can’t try it out.' An engineer by trade, Kawakami started practicing the art of Ninjutsu at the age of six before he began training under the gruelling regime of Buddhist master Masazo Ishida. To improve his concentration, he would spend hours staring into the flame of a candle until he felt he was inside it. Silent and deadly: Kawakami is trained to hear a needle drop in the next room, to disappear in a cloud of smoke and to cut a victim's throat from 20 paces with nothing but a three-inch death star . Tough training: As part of his training, Kawakami climbed walls, jumped from heights and learned how to mix chemicals to cause explosions and smoke and was also trained to withstand extreme heat and cold as well as go for days without food or water . To hone his hearing he would practice listening to a needle being dropped onto a wooden floor in the next room. Ninjas, also known as shinobi, have . been feared and revered throughout history for their talents as . assassins, scouts and spies. They are mainly noted for their use of stealth, their dark outfits usually covering everything but their eyes, leaving them virtually invisible in shadow, until they struck. But they were also known for their amazing powers of endurance. Ninjutsu can be translated as ‘Art of . Stealth' but also means ‘Art of Enduring'. The ninjas themselves . were noted for being able to walk long distances without stopping, jump . over seven feet and dislocate their joints to escape from small spaces. But they were not only ruthless killers as depicted in so many Hollywood movies. In fact, ninjas considered the art of espionage far greater than that of fighting which was always a last resort - ninjas were skilled in spying and defeating foes using intelligence, while swinging a sword was deemed . a lower art. And they were also skilled at making poisons as well as potions and medicines. He . climbed walls, jumped from heights and learned how to mix chemicals to . cause explosions and smoke. He was also trained to withstand extreme . heat and cold as well as go for days without food or water. 'The . training was all tough and painful. It wasn't fun but I didn't think . much why I was doing it. Training was made to be part of my life,' he . said. And at the age of 19, he inherited his master's title along with a cache of secret scrolls and ancient tools. But he . says the art of the ninja lies in the power of surprise, never brute . force or outward strength and is about exploiting weaknesses to outfox . larger, more powerful opponents while distracting their attention to get . the upper hand. And, he says, the ability to hide in the most unlikely of places is a ninja's greatest weapon. 'If you throw a toothpick, . people will look that way, giving you the chance to flee, he adds. 'We . also have a saying that it is possible to escape death by . perching on your enemy's eyelashes; it means you are so close that he . cannot see you.' Kawakami . now runs the Iga-ryu Ninja Museum, in Iga, 220 miles southwest of Tokyo . and recently began a research job at the state-run Mie University, . where he is studying the history of ninjas. He says he has decided not to take on an apprentice to pass on the legacy, making him the last in the line of Ban clan ninjas.

"Fish soup with tofu and rice, stir-fried pork with vegetables and baked chicken with stuffed grape leaves... these are just some of the exotic lunches school children from around the world tuck into. The widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently. But in stark contrast, the UK and US lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin. Scroll down for video . What children in other countries eat (clockwise from top left): Ukraine's version of sausage and mash; Brazil's plantains, rice and black beans; beetroot salad and pea soup in Finland and steak with beans and carrots in France . Unhealthy meal: Children in the US get fed popcorn chicken with ketchup, a spoonful of mashed potato, green peas, a fruit cup and a giant chocolate chip cookie for lunch . South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina . The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland. The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David, . Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the £2 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'. Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page. Mary's Meals  - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America. The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren. While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items. Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow. Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink . UK school dinner of frankfurters and beans, a baked potato, corn on the cob, slice of melon and a box drink . Lorna Driver-Davies, a nutritional therapist at NutriCentre said to FEMAIL: 'Looking at the lunches from across the world, it seems mixed in terms of how balanced the diets are. Looks can be deceiving, since while the Finnish lunch looks very healthy - the focus is on starchy carbohydrates, starchy vegetables and fruit. So for me it's lacking in adequate protein or green leafy vegetables. Ms Driver-Davis thinks the schoolchildren in France, Korea and Brazil have the best lunches. 'My favourite is the Korean meal since fermented foods are great for gut health and the children are given a starchy carbohydrate such as rice, but also green and colourful vegetables and fish – boosting protein levels,' she said. 'The French meal was also very good since they are leaning towards giving vegetables and meat rather than too much bread or pasta and the French cheese will give some protein, fat soluble nutrients and calcium. 'The Brazilian meal was as good as the Korean, since there is an emphasis on meat and plant proteins and vegetables. We still focus on starchy carbohydrates to fill us up but children cannot have a nutritionally balanced diet without adequate good fats, proteins and a wide and large variety of vegetables. 'The Cuban food looked a little devoid of vegetables. Greece and Spain also looked good - although Spain could have had more vegetables.' Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes . In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish . School lunch in Alba, Spain (left):  white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas . But she wasn't impressed with the UK or US school dinners. 'The healthier UK meal trumped the other UK meal comparison. The less healthy option gave the children very cheap looking sausages, a potato, watermelon and a corn on the cob. So quite low in good quality protein and almost non-existent vegetables. The US meal was very carbohydrate dense,' she continued. In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie. This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans. And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones  tucking into kiwi fruit and apples. South Korean children tuck into broccoli and peppers, fried rice with tofu, fermented cabbage and fish soup . Brie, green beans, carrot, rare steak and pudding of kiwi fruit and apples is served in French schools . A meal of traditional flavours: Brazil's rice and black beans, baked plantain, pork with peppers and coriander, green salad and a seeded roll . The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive. A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage. In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries. Rice, a chicken croquette, a piece of taro root and yellow pea soup is the school lunch in Old Havana, Cuba . In Japan, school children tuck into fried fish, dried seaweed, tomatoes, miso soup with potatoes, rice (in the metal container), and milk . A plump portion of lightly fried fish sits atop rocket salad in the Italian lunch tray. This is accompanied by a small portion of pasta, a simple caprese salad of tomatoes, mozzarella and basil, a crusy roll and a bunch of grapes. Most of the schools have kept to traditional foods for the school lunch. Children in Spain start their meal with cold tomato soup, gazpacho, served with shrimp and brown rice. This is served with a seeded roll, peppers with red cabbage and half an orange for dessert. Children in Greece have baked chicken with orzo, stuffed grape leave, cucumber and tomato salad, yoghurt with pomegranate seeds and oranges. Wholesome: Seeded roll, shrimp with brown rice, gazpacho and tri-colour peppers. Dessert is half an orange . A serving of borscht (beetroot soup) with pickled cabbage, sausages and mash. Dessert is a sweet pancake . Greek school lunches feature baked chicken with orzo, stuffed grape leaves, salad of cucumber and tomatoes, yogurt with pomegranate seeds and two oranges . Traditional South American food such as rice with black beans, baked plantains and pork with vegetables are on offer for Brazilian children. They also had a side serving of salad and bread with their meal. In Ukraine children feast on mashed potato, sausages, borscht, cabbage and syrniki, a type of dessert pancake. US school lunches feature fried popcorn chicken with ketchup, mashed potatoes, peas, a fruit cup and a chocolate chip cookie. Bowls of salad are ready to be served at Delcare Edu Center, a local kindergarten and child care center in the business district of Singapore . A healthier UK school dinner: Two trays at a primary school in London. The meal at right consists of pasta with broccoli and slices of bread, and fruit. At left are vegetable chili with rice and broccoli, sponge cake with custard, and a banana . In France, school lunch is an art form: hot, multi-course and involving vegetables.

"A French city which produced 14 English kings is demanding the Crown Jewels as compensation from the Queen for the murder of its last pretender to the throne. Angers, which is in the Loire Valley west of Paris, was once the capital of the Anjou province and the House of Plantagenet. It ruled England from 1154 until 1485, providing some of the greatest monarchs in British history, including Richard the Lionheart and Henry V. The French city of Angers, France, have said they want to be compensated for the 'murder' of Edward Plantagenet . They have claimed that the Crown Jewels would be a sufficient payment for the death of the Earl of Warwick . But when Edward Plantagenet, the Earl of Warwick, was murdered in the Tower of London in 1499 the house's legitimate male line came to an end. 'As redress for the execution of Edward, Angers today demands that the Crown Jewels of England be transferred to Angers,' reads a petition posted on the city's official website. Recalling 25-year-old Edward's 'unfair and horrible death' at the hands of henchmen working for Henry VII, England's first Tudor king, the city believes it is owed an apology – and 513 years' worth of compensation. This would amount to billions in today's currency, but Angers is prepared to accept the coronation jewels to cover it all. The petition, which has already been . signed by hundreds of so-called Angevins, as well as sympathisers around . France and other parts of the world, is directed at the Queen. End of an era: When Edward Plantagenet, pictured, who became the Earl of Warwick in 1475, . was murdered in the Tower of London in 1499 the house's legitimate male . line came to an end . It . describes a 'state crime' against a noble line which played a huge role . in making Britain great, and wants the jewels to be put on public . display at the Saint Aubin tower in Angers. The Queen, who speaks good French, will . be sent the official petition at the beginning of September, during the . Accroche-Cœurs, an annual cultural festival in Angers in which street . artists conjour up the city's rich history. The Queen will receive a petition from the town in September during a celebration of Angers' history . The fabled Plantagenet name was made popularly famous by William Shakespeare, but many remain unaware that many of those who ruled in its name were more French than English. Richard I, the iconic Lionheart who led the Third Crusade, was born near Oxford but barely spoke a word of English. Instead, he spent much of his life on his Aquitaine estates in south west France, where he died in 1199. Part of Richard's remains are in Fontevraud Abbey, near Angers, while particles of his heart are in Rouen Cathedral, in Brittany. Henry V, the hero of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, spent the latter part of his life trying to reunite his country's throne with France's before his death in the Château de Vincennes, in the Paris suburbs, in 1422. The current Crown Jewels, which are considered priceless, only date back to the coronation of Charles II – long after the Edward, the Plantagenet pretender, was killed. Originals coronation jewels which date back further were melted down by Oliver Cromwell following the execution of Charles I in 1649. A spokesman for Angers council admitted that the petition had 'little chance of success' but said the 'crime' against the Angevin monarchs was worth highlighting. He encouraged British people to visit Angers, which has medieval buildings including a magnificent castle which recall the glory days of the Plantagenets.","French city of Angers in Loire Valley provided some of the greatest monarchs in British history .

"A Florida High School is charging seniors to participate in the ceremony and is asking 10 times the amount from their parents who wish to reserve seats. Manatee High School in Brandenton asked seniors to fork out $20 in order to participate in the graduation ceremony and if family wants to reserve a row of 15 seats the cost is $200 or around $13 a seat. Ten rows near the end zone of Hawkins Stadium were made available for purchase on Tuesday morning and sold out in about four hours, reports the Brandenton Herald. All other seating is on a first come first serve basis. Ever since the school district reduced funding, Manatee has offered choice graduation seating to parents who are willing to pay $200 . High School Principal Don Sauer told reporters that the fees are an effort to cover the $12,000 graduation costs for the school after the school district pulled $3,400 from its annual contribution to cut costs. 'It's due to the district's financial situation that it stopped providing funding to Manatee HS for their graduation costs,' Valley told the Herald. This is the first time the school is charging seniors $20 to participate in the ceremony and it was announced in November in a letter to students and parents. The principal explained that if students and parents could not afford to pay the requested amount that the fee was waived. 'I am not here to make money off my kids,' Sauer said. This is the first time the school is charging seniors $20 to participate in the ceremony and it was announced in November in a letter to students and parents . The school district spokesman Steve Valley said that each Manatee County school charges a graduation fee but that the cost varies from school to school. Manatee's Graduation will be held on May 31 at the school's Hawkins Stadium and teh school expects to host between 5,000 and 6,000 guests for about 500 graduates. 'The ceremony isn't really for students, the ceremony is for the parents,' Principal sauer said. Sauer decided to offer parents an option of choice seating for more money so that they could fill in some of the financial losses. 'With the budget crunch, money has become tighter and tighter,' he said. Despite charging parents and students the school will still be $1,500 short. Bauer may introduce two more rows fro $200 but he has not yet made a final decision.","Manatee High School asked seniors to fork out $20 in order to participate in the graduation ceremony and asked parents for $200 if they wished to reserve seats .

"Waitrose has been voted the best supermarket in the UK, narrowly reclaiming the title from last year's winner Aldi. The upmarket grocer gained a customer score of 73 per cent in the survey of 7,000 shoppers by Which?, gaining top marks for service, store environment and its own-label and fresh products. The Co-operative has once again been named worst supermarket, winning a score of just 49 per cent and widening the gap on last year between the brand and its rivals. Scroll down for video . Best supermarket in the UK: Waitrose scored 73% in the Which? survey of 7,000 respondents . Waitrose has returned to the top of the Which? supermarkets survey - narrowly beating last year's winner, Aldi. Iceland, Lidl and M&S were also rated highly in the survey of 7,001 UK supermarket shoppers. It was the only supermarket to be rated as poor for pricing, and was 'shockingly far behind everyone else' on value for money, with just 35 per cent of customers thinking it is good or excellent in this regard, the watchdog said. It is also considered the worst supermarket for special offers, the poll revealed, and gained the worst rating for own-label products, with only frozen food specialist Iceland rated as poorly for fresh produce. Shoppers were asked to mark the supermarkets out of five in six categories: customer service; pricing; quality of own-label products; quality of fresh products;  store environment and filling your trolley. Waitrose scored five stars for customer service, quality of own-label products and store environment. It scored three stars for pricing and four stars respectively for quality of fresh products and filling your trolley. The Co-op was the only supermarket to be rated as poor for pricing, and was 'shockingly far behind everyone else,' Which? said . Aldi won an overall customer score of 72 per cent followed by Iceland, Lidl and Marks & Spencer with 69 per cent. Aldi scored four stars in three categories - pricing, quality of own label products and fresh products but was let down by customer service (two stars), store environment (two stars) and filling your trolley (three stars), . Morrisons and Sainsbury's managed a score of 63 per cent, followed by Asda on 62 per cent and Tesco on 60 per cent. Ocado came top of the online supermarket table for the fifth year running despite competition from more competitors in the form of Iceland and Morrisons. Consumers told the consumer group that value and good quality food products are the most important factors in choosing where to shop. Aldi and Lidl have seen significant increases in sales in the past year and Iceland posted a large increase in profit last year. Meanwhile, the big four supermarkets have stuttered, losing market share to their cheaper rivals as well as Waitrose. Aldi (left) won an overall score of 72% whilst Iceland (right) tied with Lidl and Marks & Spencer with 69% . Respondents were only asked about supermarkets they had shopped with, and each retailer's overall customer score was based on a combination of customer satisfaction and the likelihood they would recommend it to a friend. Customers described Waitrose staff as 'all polite, attentive and well-mannered' while the poll found shoppers praised the 'exceptionally tidy' stores as well as the trolleys, lack of queues and wide aisles which made for a 'relaxed feel and shopping experience'. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Waitrose has returned to the top of our supermarket league table, rated the best for customer satisfaction by the public and narrowly beating Aldi, last year's number one. 'Thousands of people told us that value and good quality food products are the most important factors in choosing where to shop.' Waitrose managing director Mark Price said: 'We're grateful to all the customers who voted for us. 'It's a great accolade and fantastic recognition for the energy and hard work our 61,000 partners put into creating the best possible experience for shoppers both in our shops and online.' An Aldi spokesperson said: 'In 2014 over half of the UK visited an Aldi store. We are pleased that customers continue to choose Aldi and this is further proof that people value our everyday low prices and high quality products.' Speaking about the report, Nigel Broadhurst,joint managing director of Iceland, commented: 'We're thrilled to have been rated so highly by real shoppers in this Which? report. 'Our excellent, value offering does not come at the expense of other aspects of our stores which are important to our customers, such as customer service, varied product ranges and a pleasant store environment. We work hard to achieve this balance. 'We're especially pleased to see our online offering rated so highly. This was launched nationally in October 2013, so it's fantastic to see it do so well in comparison to stores which have been online for a lot longer. 'It's clear that our great value, great service, and great choice model gives shoppers what they want, whether they prefer to shop online or in store.'","Waitrose 73% score only 1% higher than last year's winner Aldi .

"We've all been there after a big night out, or a lazy Sunday morning. Feeling a bit worse for wear and wanting the only thing can provide the cure - a great mound of fast-food delivered straight to the door. So news that fast food giant Burger King is starting a delivery service should please UK Whopper fans . Double Whopper to your door: Burger King is currently trialling a home delivery service in eight UK locations . Straight to your door: The fast food giant is is testing the home delivery service regionally before a wider national roll out later in the year . The trial service is currently only available in Romford, Truro, Hornchurch, Skegness, Hull, Northampton, Hayes, and Gants Hill. Deliveries are made within a two-mile radius of participating restaurants and a minimum value of £14 is required for orders. Customers in the eight locations are able to place orders over the phone or via the delivery website everyday between the hours of 12 noon to 3pm and 6 to 10pm. Matthew Bresnahan, Marketing Director of Burger King Northern Europe, Russia,and Africa said: 'Burger King is firmly committed to delivering great-tasting food at affordable prices to all of our customers. 'We are extremely excited about this Home Delivery service trial so customers can continue to enjoy the perfect combination of taste, at great value prices, now delivered straight to their homes.' The news was greeted with joy by fans of the chain. User @Skatronixxx tweeted Burger King delivery? Yes!! And there were some who had already taken advantage of the trial service. User @westonbrowne1 uploaded a picture of his meal, tweeting: 'God bless your delivery @BurgerKing' But there are some who have yet to be convinced. Laura Williams, who goes by the handle @amusedkerching on Twitter said: 'Burger King is offering delivery service in some areas. I don't trust it. Everyone knows it's impossible to drive without eating the fries.' Laura Williams thinks the delivery drivers might succumb to temptation and eat the fries . User Dr Frank Simon seems to disagree with the concept of a Burger King delivery service . Another user – Dr Frank Simon or @silverstar22b - was harsher in his condemnation of the fast-food giants, saying: 'Burger King have started a delivery service. Because their customers are now too f*cking fat to go out for it.' For decades burger restaurants have resisted introducing home-delivery services as the snacks don't travel well and tend to go soggy when warmed up in a microwave. But a few years ago Burger King claimed to have solved the problem by developing what it called 'proprietary thermal packaging technology,' which ensures the food won't arrive cold and congealed. This new trial is testing the home delivery service regionally before a wider national roll out later in the year.","Service is being trialled in eight locations including Romford and Truro .

"It might seem like an ordinary meal to most, composed of steak, sweet potato mash and four kinds of vegetables. But this particular dish has been dubbed the perfect meal for athletes by performance nutrition experts. Comprising an 8oz New York sirloin strip steak served with sweet potato mash, kale, samphire, mange tout and broccoli, the hearty offering has all right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. Scroll down for video . The perfect meal for athletes is an 8oz New York sirloin strip steak served with sweet potato mash, kale, samphire, mangetout and broccoli . Athletes need the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals in their meals . The meal was served by London chef and former Olympian Francis Agyepong at Christopher's restaurant in Covent Garden to Olympic gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu and world junior champion Dina Asher-Smith. Mr Agyepong, who competed in the Triple Jump for Great Britain at the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, has since developed his career as a head chef in London's West End. He said: 'In creating this ultimate athlete menu, I have focused on nutrition first and foremost. The dish is ideal for energy, recovery and tissue rebuilding. Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme. Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training. The green veg provides vitamins A and C which support the immune system to function normally, which is hampered with hard training. 'The quality of ingredients used and the resulting taste also has a positive effect on the mind and general wellbeing. 'Food and nutrition is a big part of everyone's lives but to an athlete it can mean the difference between having a short or long sustained career. 'The body has the ability to self-repair if the food you are putting in it is of premium quality.' The athlete turned head chef worked with worked with Sainsbury's and British Athletics' performance nutritionist Joseph Agu to create a perfect menu for Ms Ohuruogu and Ms Asher-Smith, as they prepare for the 2015 athletics season. The season will see Ms Ohuruogu bid to retain her world 400m title in Beijing, where she won Olympic gold in 2008. Mr Agu said: 'This is the perfect meal for an athlete, with the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. 'Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme.

The green veg provides vitamins A and C which support the immune system to function normally, which is hampered with hard training.' Dina Asher-Smith, who was crowned British 60m champion at the Sainsbury's Indoor British Championships last weekend and will compete at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham on Saturday, said: 'As a young athlete I'm always looking for ways to improve my performance, so good nutrition is key. 'Ahead of a big event it's important to eat properly, and as the experts have identified, this dish is perfect for an athlete.' Christine Ohuruogu said: 'Nutrition is a very important part of athletics, and it's great that Francis and Joseph have identified a dish which will help our training, but also taste great. 'Healthy eating is a big part of my life, so I'm really pleased to see Sainsbury's using their sponsorship of athletics to inspire others to live a healthy lifestyle.' Christine Ohuruogu (left), pictured at the World Athletic Championships in Moscow in 2013, tried the meal, along with sprinter Dina Asher-Smith (right) in the 60m heats at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in 2014 . Steak with vegetables and sweet potato mash . Ingredients: One 230g sirloin steak; mixed greens of samphire, kale, tenderstem broccoli, calvolo nero and peas; one medium-size sweet potato; 90ml agave syrup or maple syrup; coconut oil; salt and pepper . Method: Pre-heat oven to 180°C (fan oven). Place sweet potato in oven for approximately 25 mins. While potato is cooking season the steak with salt and cracked black pepper, drizzle a little olive or sunflower to coat the steak. Once potato is cooked, cut out the flesh and mash until smooth, adding 90ml agave syrup, then cover. Place steak on a hot grill or into a hot frying pan and cook for  three minutes on each side (remove from the heat and allow to rest for four minutes). Meanwhile drop your vegetables into medium size pot of salted boiling water for approximately 40 seconds. Drain the vegetables off before pouring into moderate hot pan with 10ml of coconut oil. Toss two or three times before finishing with some chopped tarragon, mint and parsley. Serve immediately.","Dish named the perfect meal by British Athletics' performance nutritionist .

"A supercomputer that was supposed to help Britain’s security service track terror suspects will not be ready in time for the Olympics. MI5 has sacked a firm of IT consultants after the company failed to meet deadlines to implement the new intelligence-checking system. The computer system is designed to help MI5 officers carry out secret searches on suspects, including those who may pose a threat at the Olympics. Posing a threat: The computer system is designed to help officers at MI5 (pictured) carry out secret searches on suspects . But spy chiefs have admitted that the software will not be ready in time to be safely trialled before the start of the Games later this month. The new ‘electronic records management’ system will bring together all MI5 intelligence material, so officers can carry out complete searches of old and current records. For example, it would alert officers more quickly to archived intelligence on a terror suspect who had been dormant or lying low for a number of years. The IT failure comes days after the Government announced that private security firm G4S had failed to hire enough guards for the Olympics. Ministers have been forced to call upon the Army to make up the shortfall. One security source said of the MI5 IT project: ‘Of course it would be better if this was up and running in time for the Olympics as it allows officers to search all their systems in one quick check. In a fast-moving investigation, with finite resources, delay can mean the difference between success and failure.’ The new search facility is understood to work in a similar way to the high-tech computers used in the BBC TV series Spooks, where spies match pictures, names and mobile phone numbers to identify suspects from their records. Last night, security sources declined to name the company at the centre of the IT controversy. Nor would they say exactly why the firm had its contract terminated. But it is understood that the project, which is estimated to have already cost up to £1 million, has been plagued by technical and commercial difficulties. Computer crisis: Spy chiefs have admitted that the software will not be ready in time to be safely trialled before the start of the Games . The decision to postpone implementation until after the Olympics leaves the taxpayer out of pocket while MI5 must find a replacement contractor. It has emerged that Jonathan Evans, director-general of the security service, has voiced concerns about a number of costly IT security contracts, including the one that has been terminated. In a report published on Thursday by MPs from the Intelligence and Security Committee, Mr Evans is quoted as saying: ‘I think it would be a fair criticism to say that we have had some cases where [our use of consultants and contractors] hasn’t been as controlled as it should, [but now] we have got a proper focus .  .  . ‘Post-Olympics, we intend to reduce [the] number of organisations and individuals we deal with and to manage those relationships more aggressively than we have done.’ A Whitehall security source said that the decision to postpone introducing the system until after the Olympics was ‘taken some time ago’ on the grounds that it would be too risky to introduce new software just before the Olympics. He said that while the delay would affect the service’s capability ‘nobody was saying we desperately need the new system immediately now’. It has also emerged that almost 500 officers from across MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have left the secret services in the past year at a cost of £47 million to the taxpayer. Many of the senior staff have been paid six-figure sums to take early retirement while others have been given big redundancy payoffs. The figures, in the report by the Intelligence and Security Committee, are: . The 24 MI6 staff were paid a total of £4 million to leave the service as part  of a drive to remove some of the most expensive spies from the payroll. At the Government’s secret listening post, GCHQ, 255 staff left under the Approved Early Retirement terms in 2010/11. The cost to the taxpayer of these exit packages was £23 million. But the director of GCHQ, Iain Lobban, told MPs he had been forced to offer early retirement to reduce staff numbers and stay within budget. He said: ‘We lost a number of more senior members of staff .  .  . As I shook hands with each of them, I felt a degree of regret, but we needed to get our figures down in order to hit our own Spending Review commitments.’ In the security service, 216 staff left under the service’s Living Within Our Means (LWOM) scheme in 2010/11. Of these, 103 staff left voluntarily and the remaining 113 were redundancies. The cost to the taxpayer was £20 million. Jonathan Evans told the committee that part of the reason for the redundancy programme was to ‘[change] the staff mix’, and that ‘in this sort of world where technologies come and go in a fortnight, some of the staff that we had .  .  . weren’t really the right people’. The MPs also said that all three agencies were struggling to retain staff as the private sector continued to offer Government-trained spies and cyber experts much bigger pay packets. Before the GS4 security fiasco, about 12,000 officers were due to be on duty at Olympic venues on peak days . Criminal trials are being delayed until after the Olympics because of the crisis over security. Police officers due to testify at hearings across the country are instead being called on to assist at the Games. It was not clear last night how many cases will be affected, but the figure may run into the hundreds. On average, about 40,000 criminal cases are heard in England and Wales every week. There is also concern that defendants will be kept in custody for longer than usual, at a cost to taxpayers of more than £100 a night. District judge Graham Wilkinson,  who was last week trying to arrange  a trial date for an assault case in Wolverhampton, said in court: ‘We can have no police officer cases during the Olympics.’ Before the GS4 security fiasco, about 12,000 officers were due to be on duty at Olympic venues on peak days. But hundreds more are now required to do the work of private guards in a further blow to the already over-stretched criminal justice system. Adding to the sense of justice being put on hold, courts in and around London will close during the two-week Games because of the transport chaos. The Old Bailey will lose half of its 18 courts, and some judges are understood to have been urged to go on holiday.","£1m device for tracking suspects will not be ready in time for the Games .

"Proving there is such a thing as a free lunch, for one day only a restaurant is offering diners the chance of a seafood feast for absolutely nothing. But instead of your meal being cooked by experienced chefs, there will be eight mini cooks in charge of the kitchen. The young chefs from Saucy’s School of Fish will take over the kitchens of Soho-based Stephen St Kitchen restaurant on Thursday 19 February to whip up four fish dishes. Eight youngsters including Emily Runacres-Grundstrom, five, (left) and her brother Daniel, seven, (right) will be cooking four fish dishes on Thursday 19 February . The free lunch takes place from noon to 3pm at Stephen St Kitchen in Soho, London . The idea comes from The Saucy Fish Co. which will be taking over Soho-based Stephen St Kitchen as part of its campaign to prove that cooking fish is child's play. The eight primary school youngsters - whose ages range from between five to eight years old - will be getting their hands dirty in the kitchen cooking various types of fish including salmon, seabass, squid, king prawns and haddock. Chefs on the day will include seven-year-old Daniel Runacres-Grundstrom and his sister Emily, five, from West Sussex who will make their their way to London to cook up a storm in the kitchen. And as young as they may be, the siblings know their way around the kitchen and are keen helpers when it comes to mealtimes. Practicing their kitchen moves: Daniel and Emily preparing for their chef debut . Salmon fillet with chilli, lime and ginger dressing, served with seasonal stir fried vegetables and noodles . Sea bass fillet with beurre blanc dressing, served with buttered new potatoes . Squid, king prawn and chorizo fused with a sherry and herb sauce, served with a crisp leaf salad, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and crusty bread . Smoked haddock with vintage cheddar cheese and chive sauce served with colcannon mash and petit pois . The siblings have been busy practising their meals before the big day, with Daniel claiming that the process wasn’t as difficult as he thought it would be. ‘It took me about five minutes. It was actually very easy. The only tricky bit was trying to separate the fish,’ he said. The confident chef-to-be also said he is‘ looking forwards’ to cooking on Thursday . ‘I want to be a chef,’ he said. ‘I like to cook and I like to help dad and mum do cooking.’ The fish fan counts sushi and fish and chips are his ‘first’ and ‘second’ favourite food’. Sister Emily, five, is equally as excited. But unlike her brother, she has no ambitions to be a chef. ‘I am hoping I am going to be waitress,’ she said. ‘I quite want to be a waitress. I just want to see the people.' Emily placing her fish dish in the oven (left) while Daniel watches nervously to make sure it doesn't burn .

"If bubbles start to appear in your non-sparkling wine and it whiffs of wet dog or cabbage, then it's time you tipped it down the sink. And if you have no room in your fridge to chill a bottle of white, then simply wrap a wet towel around it and pop it in the freezer for five minutes. From tricks such as opening a wine bottle without a corkscrew to simple recipes for wine desserts, the infographic details useful and practical tips to make your vino last longer. These are some of the 12 useful tips are revealed in an infographic by Nottingham-based kitchen appliance retailer Appliance City. Advice also includes making cheap wine taste expensive by aerating it in a blender for half a minute, and how to make your plonk last longer. The most useful tip is, of course, how to open a bottle of wine without a corkscrew - in six easy ways. The first three involve a picture hook, a thick screw or a nail, all which have to be screwed into the cork and pulled out with pliers. Or it suggests drilling a hole in the cork with a sharp object, then feeding through some string with a knot in the end before pulling. The other methods involve pushing a key into the cork at a 45 degree angle or using a tube from a bike pump to make the cork rise. The handy graphic also reveals how to make wine ice-cubes from left-over wine which can be used in cooking. And those who relish a cold glass of Sauvignon Blanc but don't approve of ice-cubes in wine will appreciate the next hint. Simply freeze some grapes then pop them into your glass the next time you fancy a truly chilled tipple. There's no fear of your wine being watered down. The guide also advises wine fans to 'blend'  cheap wine in a blender for 30 seconds to make it taste more expensive. Fancy a Bellini but run out of sparkling wine and fresh fruit? Simply mix equal parts white wine, sparkling water and fruit juice for a quick-fix solution. No room in your freezer? Then chill wine in five minutes by adding a big handful of salt to a bucket of icy water. And if you want to cool your bottle down quickly simply wrap it in a wet towel and freeze. To tell if your wine has gone off, simply take a good sniff of your glass. If the vino smells like wet dog, cardboard, a farmyard, vinegar, burnt rubber, or cooked cabbage, then you will need to tip it down the sink. The same goes when it looks browner than usual or if bubbles appear in a non-sparkling wine.","Nottingham-based kitchen retailer Appliance City commissioned graphic .

"It’s one of best forms of protein and can be used in a myriad ways, from a sandwich filling to a salad ingredient or even eaten as a snack on its own. But if there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it's the hassle of peeling it. More often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers, on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food. Scroll down for video . Placing his mouth on top of the funnel he has created with his fingers, he blows hard . The video, uploaded by Youtube user KeepItFire2, shows how to peel an egg in two seconds. Tapping the egg on both ends, he peels a small bit from the top of the egg and a larger chunk from the bottom . But one clever YouTube user has found what he calls the cool way to peel a hard-boiled egg. The user, who goes by the handle KeepItFire2, demonstrates his easy method in the video. He claims to have conducted exhaustive research online before deciding on this particular method. ‘Throw some ice into the pot before you do anything,’ he says in the video. Pointing to both ends of the egg, he then gentle cracks both the top and the bottom on a paper plate. ‘On the bottom part you’re going to want to take out a big chunk of the shell,’ he says, as he starts peeling the egg. ‘On the top you need to take out just a little bit,’ he says, holding the egg close to the camera. He then cups the egg with his fingers, with the larger end of the egg pointing outwards . The egg pops out if its shell easily and the home cook goes on to munch on his high protein snack . With both the top and bottom parts of the shell now removed, he cups the egg in his palm, circling his fingers around the top part of the egg. ‘Take it in your hand and cup it like that with the big end on the outside,’ he says, pointing to the egg in his palm. ‘Then just blow.’ Placing his mouth on the top part of his fingers, he blows the egg hard and holds out his left hand to catch the hard boiled egg as it pops out easily from its shell. ‘There you go, two seconds of peeling a hard-boiled egg and saving you a lot of headache,’ he ends as he bites into his snack.","YouTube user demonstrates his fuss-free fun method to peeling eggs .

"An Icelandic man who purchased the last-ever McDonald's meal sold before the chain closed down in the country in 2009 was stunned when he found it did not go mouldy. Hjortur Smarason, 28, waited until the end of the fast-food chain's last day to buy a cheeseburger together with a portion of fries. He then donated his purchase to the National Museum of Iceland, where it stayed on display for three years before it was returned to him. Scroll down for video . The McDonald's burger and fries bought by Hjortur Smarason in October 2009 - pictured in 2015 . The burger has not gone mouldy despite spending six years on display in the National Museum of Iceland . 'I realised it was a historic occasion and decided to buy the last burger on sale in October 2009, which I donated to the local museum,' Mr Smarason said. 'They had it on display until somebody complained and it was decided that a museum was not the appropriate place for food on display like this. 'So they asked me for permission to destroy it. 'But I regard it as a historical item now. I think it's incredible that it seems to show no signs of decomposition, although apparently the fact that there were fewer chips returned to me was because some museum visitors had eaten some of them.' The museum wanted to destroy the meal after visitors complained that it was an inappropriate exhibit . Fewer chips were returned to Mr Smarason because visitors had eaten some of them . The burger spent the first three years stored in a plastic bag when it did not change at all. In 2012, after he took it back from the museum, it went on display at the bar of his local hotel in the capital Reykjavik. 'We no longer have a McDonald's here, but we do have a McDonald's burger and it's probably the oldest in the world, so I reckon we shouldn't complain too much,' Mr Smarason said . Iceland is one of the only countries in the world that has no McDonald's. There used to be three branches of the fast food chain on the island until the 2009 financial crisis made it uneconomical to continue with the business. With only 300,000 people in the country and the fact that Iceland is a remote island location, the company said that the 2009 financial crisis had been the kiss of death.","Hjortur Smarason bought the burger on 31 October 2009 in Iceland .

"We’ve all been seduced by beautifully shot images of fast food. But those pictures of fat juicy burgers, succulent tomatoes and crisp lettuce encased in a perfectly toasted seeded bun are more a triumph of marketing and styling than they are of cooking and taste. These tricks of food styling are the subject of Sydney-based videographer Minhky Le's trio of short films, Real Food But Not Really. The videos offer insights into the glaring contrast between home-prepared foods versus foods primed by a food stylist. Mr Le, who is also a graphic designer, took a two-day food styling course by world renowned food stylist Denise Vivaldo before he started work on his videos. 'Through the use of food dyes, cotton-ball stuffing, imitation ice, and an array of other clever devices, these films explore the many trickeries we are ever presented with by commercial industries in our everyday lives,' he writes on his website, Whisk Films. Picture perfect: Sydney-based videographer Minhky Le's Real Food but Not Really series exposes the food styling tricks that industry insiders use to make food seem more appealing to would-be customers . A patty is touched to a sizzling pan, its sides caressed by the heat before swiftly being removed from the fire . Drawing pins hold together the salad (left) and ketchup is pumped with a syringe (right) Comprised of two segments, the first parts of the films are shot in black and white and show the conventional method of foods being cooked or assembled. The second segment - showcasing insider food styling tricks -  are shot in vivid colour. The first film, Something Savoury focuses on the perfect fast food - the burger. The film starts in black and white and shows how a burger cooked and assembled at home is made. The camera then moves to the food styling  and it’s a real eye opener. Lingering over each shot, the second segment starts with a perfect bun being carefully sliced length ways. A crinkled paper is placed on top of the bun so that the juices from the burger don’t seep into the bread and make it soggy. A combination of vanilla frosting and soft icing sugar make the perfect-looking 'ice-cream' Then a burger patty is touched to a sizzling pan and its sides caressed by the heat before swiftly being removed from the fire. Next rectangular skewer is heated with a blowtorch, which is then carefully pressed into the top of the burger, to make the all-important grill marks. The burger is then stroked with brush dipped in brown icing colour. This is done to make it appear more cooked than it actually is. Lettuce is gently placed on top of the lightly seared burger and held together with drawing pins so the leaves of the vegetable cascade attractively from the sides of the bun. Tomatoes are then artfully draped over the lettuce and also secured with drawing pins so that there are no unattractive bulges. Next come gherkins, sliced lengthways and layered on top of the tomatoes and lettuce. Cotton wool balls are placed behind the assembly of vegetables to present an illusion of height, before the top half of the sesame seed bun is finally placed on top. Masking tape on the glass (left) and fake ice-cubes (right) are used to create a flawless fizzy drink . Using a syringe, ketchup is then squirted in the crevices between the burger, buns and vegetables. A shot of the highly stylised product next to the home-cooked burger demonstrates the stark contrast between the first creation and the second. Pillar box red food colouring is added to soda water before the masking tape is peeled off the glass . The styled drink won't taste of anything other than soda water . The second video focuses on sweet and demonstrates the method behind a flawless ice-cream cone. Once again the first segment highlights the unstylised product. Ice-cream is unceremoniously scraped from the tub before being smooshed into a conventional cone. Strawberry sauce is drizzled on top of it before sprinkles are added to the sweet treat. In the food styling segment, it’s a whole different matter. A combination of vanilla frosting and soft icing sugar are folded together in a bowl to create faux 'ice-cream'. Then a scoop of the ice-cream' is moulded and shaped to the top of a  cone. Strawberry sauce is applied via a syringe to the top of the cone before a before a spill of sprinkles is applied on top of the sauce. The final video debunking advertised images goes even further. This time it’s sparkling drinks that get the treatment. In the stylised section, masking tape is wrapped around the top of a glass before a layer of strong hair gel is smeared on the surface of the glass. Glycerin is then sprayed from an angle; its drops resembling condensation on a glass. The glass is filled with fake ice cubes and soda water. Drops of pillar box red food colouring come next before the concoction is swirled to create a reddish drink. Finally the masking tape is removed from the top of the glass and a cocktail umbrella perched on an ice cube.","Trio of films reveal contrast between home prepared food and food styling .

"Finding grubs in your dinner won't be cause for complaint in a new Welsh restaurant. Chef Adam Holcroft's Grub Kitchen is set to open in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, this summer and it will serve dishes which feature  crickets, bugs and worms. The 37-year-old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the UK dedicated to serving insects as protein to show how bugs can help feed the booming global population. Adam Holcroft is opening the first insect restaurant in Britain, Grub Kitchen, this summer which will serve worm fudge ice cream and bug burgers to peckish customers . Satay sago worm Pad Thai: A stir-fry dish with baby sweetcorn, capsicum, courgettes and crickets . Mr Holcroft said the restaurant aims to 'normalise' eating creepy crawlies on a daily basis. He said: 'We're treating them as a normal food item, incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we're familiar with and everyday food items we recognise. 'We want to pioneer the movement to normalise the eating of bugs on a day-to-day basis.' Mr Holcroft and his team have found some interesting ways of incorporating insects into their cooking. The restaurant menu will include bug burritos and burgers, bamboo fudge worm ice cream and cricket kofta kebabs. Trio of grubs: The chef has incorporated bugs and insects into dishes . Creepy-crawly dinner: Mealworm, cricket and grasshopper burger served with polenta chips . Some of the bugs used in recipes include sago worms, meal worms, crickets and grubs . He said: 'As a chef you are always looking for ways to be creative. 'We've found that we can ground crickets up to make flour, which can be used in baking. We've also created cricket grapes served with bamboo worm fudge ice cream.' Mr Holcroft set up shop after a run of successful pop-up cafes serving grubs to intrigued diners across South Wales last year. He said that the new dishes and food creations come off the back of years of research into the principles of entomophagy - the practice of eating insects. Bug burritos being prepared . Entomophagy remains common in some parts of the world with at least two billion people worldwide eat insects, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation at the UN. Yellow jacket wasp larvae are popular in Japan, cicadas are treasured in Malawi, and weaver ants are devoured in Thailand. Termites, a food favourite in many African nations, can be fried, smoked, steamed, sun-dried or ground into a powder. The list of edible insect species is currently at 1,900 and growing. But he is keen not to put off squeamish customers - so if you don't fancy a bug-based dish you will be able to order something a bit more traditional. Adam said: 'I'm a firm believer that people aren't going to stop eating meat - that goes against biology - so bugs are also going to sit next to normal dishes on the menu. 'For example, we're serving both bug burgers and lamb kebabs.' Grub Kitchen will be based at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm - a science attraction run by Oxford University entomologist and television presenter Dr Sarah Beynon. Unconvinced? Consider British wine merchants Laithwaite's world's first insect and wine matching guide, created last year, which paired Chardonnay with tarantulas, sparkling rose to barbecued locusts, sherry to giant waterbugs and Shiraz with sago worms. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours. Mealworms - Match their nutty taste and light, crunchy texture with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness. Zebra Tarantula - Tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried, so think similar to fish and chips. A lively full bodied Chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula. Sago Worms - These worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour. McLaren Vale Shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice . BBQ Locusts - Locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the BBQ flavour you'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness. The Hacienda de Lluna Moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif. Chocolate dipped locusts - These locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds, but also have the sweetness from the chocolate. A rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours. Giant Waterbugs - The meat inside the water bug's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop, while the head has hints of anise, so you'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours. A dry sherry, and a Fino at that, is the only choice here. The crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours. Queen Weaver Ants - Their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon. They would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes. A Gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour. Crickets - The flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt. Nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full-bodied white wine like Albariño. Garlic Chapulines - Have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture, therefore we recommend a creamy dry Champagne that will match well with the earthy flavours (similar to matching with mushrooms) and crunch.","Grub Kitchen in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire to feature insects on menu .

"Arsenal and Germany defender Per Mertesacker believes the club’s recent success can inspire him to become a World Champion this summer. Speaking in an interview with German sport magazine 'kicker', the Arsenal man said the Gunners’ FA Cup win has put him in the mood for more silverware. Sliding in: Mertesacker celebrates scoring against England at Wembley in November . Silverware: Mertesacker has had a taste of success with Arsenal winning the FA Cup this month . 'Winning the FA Cup has given me a lot of confidence. It has set me up to get another highlight, something which I can definitely achieve' he said. Mertesacker sets off for Brazil with the German national team next week, and is expected to retain his role as a first choice centre back under coach Joachim Low. Despite a chaotic pre-tournament period for Germany, Mertesacker remains fixed on the title. 'We want to go further than we have been in previous competitions,' he said, 'those who have watched us know what that means. We don’t want to constantly only reach third place.' Many in Germany are more pessimistic about the team’s chances, with coach Low having to fight a plague of injuries as well as exceptional problems such as a car accident during a publicity event at Germany’s training camp. But Mertesacker said that he is 'not at all concerned' and cites his success at Arsenal as being at the root of his confidence. Getting loose: Bayern Munich forward Mario Gotze warms up before the real hard work at the Germany camp . 'The last season was definitely the best I have had since I joined Arsenal. I was injury free and was playing regularly. I now feel I have arrived in England, that I have made something of myself there.' The German’s time at Arsenal has not only seen him establish himself in the Premier League, but also in the national team. Prior to joining the North London club, Mertesacker was seen as having been usurped in the German defence by the likes of Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng. Since his rise at Arsenal, though, it is Hummels and Boateng who are fighting it out to play alongside Mertesacker. The centre back is not alone in his happiness at Arsenal, meanwhile. Fellow Arsenal and Germany star Lukas Podolski has also recently stated that 'Arsenal was absolutely the right step for me. It has been an amazing two years in London.'

"A man has smashed the  record for growing the hottest chillies in the UK - by shouting at them. Matt Simpson, 43, grew the super hot British peppers by stressing them throughout the whole growing process. He denied them water, pretended to be a predator by ripping bits off - as he believes the heat is a natural defence against being eaten - and even shouted at them. Scroll down for video . Matt Simpson grew the super-hot 1,590,000 Scoville-unit chilli in a poly-tunnel in Horningsham, Wiltshire . Mistreated chillies: Mr Simpson was tempted to get someone from the Army to shout at the plants but decided otherwise, saying 'that would have been embarrassing' The mouth-watering result, a variety of the chinensis family, named the Katie, measured a whopping 1,590,000 Scoville units compared to the previous record of 1,389,000. He also produced a 'baby sister' chilli called 'Lucy - which measured a staggering 1,359,284 on the scale. The hottest chillies from around the world measure at least a million on the scale. Mr Simpson, the co-founder of Simpson's Seeds and Plants, said: 'We used a form of stressing to make the chillies even hotter. 'No one has done tests but the BBC did a show about eight years ago where they spoiled and mistreated some chillies. The mistreated ones came out much hotter. 'We denied them water so they began to wither. In my opinion, they also produce heat to defend against animals so I pretended to be an animal too. 'I broke off bits to make the plant think it was being eaten. 'I tried shouting at them as well but I haven't got that strong a voice. I was tempted to get someone from the Army to shout at them but that would have been embarrassing.' The chillies are so hot that Mr Simpson had to wear two pairs of gloves and other protective clothing . Too hot to handle: The co-founder of Simpson's Seeds and Plants pretended to be an animal to make the chillies even hotter. Mr Simpson believes chillies produce heat to defend against predators . Developed by Mr Simpson's friend, the UK's hottest chilies were named Katie and Lucy . Mr Simpson grew the two varieties of chilli after they were developed by a friend. They were named 'Katie' and 'Lucy' after the developer's daughters. Grown in a poly-tunnel in Horningsham, Wiltshire, between the spring and autumn, the chillies are so hot he had to wear two pairs of gloves and other protective clothing. 'Katie' will now be made into a sauce, called KT-Extinction, and sold at festivals. Mr Simpson said: 'We grew both varieties this summer and sent pods off to be tested. We were a little disappointed that the Lucy, which was thought to be the hotter of the two, was a tiny bit under the record. 'We were, however, delighted when the results of a pod test came in later from the University of Bath for Katie. 'It smashed the British record and beat the old one by 200,000 Scovilles. 'After trying a tiny bit I knew they were hot but I am overwhelmed by the results. I think we can thank the Indian summer we had. Let's see if we can better it next year.' The Scoville scale is the measurement of the spicy heat (pungency) of chilli peppers or other spicy foods. Created by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912, the Scoville Organoleptic Test records Scoville heat units based on the concentration of capsaicin.","Matt Simpson grew the 1,590,000 Scoville-unit chilli in Wiltshire .

"Bacary Sagna confirms he is leaving Arsenal - click here to read . Another year gone, and another Arsenal first-team player has opted for pastures new. But unlike Robin van Persie two years ago, Bacary Sagna should not be subject to abuse. The right back announced on Thursday that it was a certainty he will be leaving this summer, declining the club's final three-year contract offer of £80,000-a-week. And even though Sagna looks to be joining a host of former Gunners at Manchester City, it's hard to blame a player who has been a loyal servant at the Emirates Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sagna show off impressive skills with French team-mate Sakho . Time to go: Bacary Sagna has confirmed he will leave Arsenal in the summer . Silver lining: Sagna ended his Arsenal career by winning the FA Cup . The France defender was signed for £7.5million in 2006, and has fought admirably during a eight-year stint which has provided little success. Signing on with the hope of joining Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires as Les Bleus who  lifted multiple trophies in north London, a fourth-place finish and limited European joy was the new realistic target. In the midst of the lowest lows, Sagna was always one who would roll his sleeves up, never give in and urge team-mates to pick themselves up. It's no wonder Arsene Wenger was so keen to break his 'no long contract for over-30s' rule to keep one of his most consistent performers. Sportsmail understands a £150,000-a-week deal with City has been lined up, leading to many Arsenal fans to criticise Sagna for 'showing no respect' and taking one final pay check. But after eight years of being heralded as one of the best full backs in the league with barely anything in the shape of trophies to back that up, is it not just one final challenge for a player still at his peak? Put simply, if it was about moving for silverware (as Samir Nasri justifies his move to Manchester City) right now is not the time to do it. Leaving under a cloud: Samir Nasri left Arsenal for Manchester City . All worth it: Nasri has won two Premier League titles since his move to City . 'Anything we win here will come from the . heart and that’s what I want. 'It’s my dream and I see no point in . speaking about other teams when I have these dreams. 'I think other . people know that about me; I’m just hungry to win with Arsenal and . that’s it.' Sagna's reaction at the end of that FA Cup final win, nine years after their last triumph, said it all. Success is all he wanted at a club he obviously loves, and now he's got that, why not let him respond to other club's advances? He, and the fans, have got what they wanted. After one of his finest seasons in an Arsenal shirt battling back from injury, it's the least Sagna deserves. This stance was not applicable to Robin van Persie, Nasri and Emmanuel Adebayor's exits, though. Van Persie, back in 2011, said: 'I’m sure I could win things at another team in another country, but would it feel like our trophy, my trophy? I’m not sure it would. 'Anything we win here will come from the heart and that’s what I want. It’s my dream and I see no point in speaking about other teams when I have these dreams. I think other people know that about me; I’m just hungry to win with Arsenal and that’s it.' Those quotes - along with the pictures of Van Persie surrounded by Arsenal bedsheets and posters as a youngster - were music to fans' ears at the time, but now seem fake and twisted. The club stuck by the Dutchman through countless seasons as he struggled with various knocks, but after one-and-a-half injury-free seasons scoring goals he had made his decision. A move to Manchester United followed, and Van Persie even went on to write an open letter to Arsenal criticising their ambition. The respect was long gone after that. Time to go: Robin van Persie left Arsenal after questioning their ambition . Landing the big one: Van Persie won the Premier League in his first season . Nasri had the chance to be the 'next Cesc Fabregas' after the Spaniard left for his boyhood club Barcelona (something he always admitted he was planning to do). Nasri could have been the hero of a side in need of one, he could have repaid Wenger for putting trust in him at such a young age. He has been accused of taking the 'easy way out' of Arsenal, quitting as soon as some sort of crisis became apparent, and as soon as a suitable club threw money at him. The departure of Adebayor - along with Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy - wasn't so critical on the pitch, but the Togolese angered fans with his attitude (and not least for sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate a goal for Manchester City against Arsenal back in 2009). He constantly flirted with AC Milan, and in fact Wenger was fortunate to pocket £25m for the striker. On his way: Emmanuel Adebayor left Arsenal to join Manchester City . Bad move: Adebayor celebrates scoring for City in front of the Arsenal fans . All this is in such contrast to Sagna, who was humble about his exit. Take his quotes in L'Equipe: 'It was an honour to grow in the shirt,' he said. 'Arsenal is a club that brought me a lot, both as a person and as a sportsman. Even though we had been criticised for quite some time due to the lack of trophies, I spent some magical moments (at Arsenal). If I had to do, I’d do it again.' Out of all that, his admission that he would do it again really stands out. At 31 years of age, the time is right for Sagna to bow out, and Arsenal can look for a younger, and perhaps cheaper alternative.

"A Dallas police officer who shot at an unarmed man 41 times has been indicted for manslaughter. Patrick Tuter, 33, a former Garland police officer, killed Michael Vincent Allen in August last year following a car chase. On Monday a Grand Jury took the decision to indict Tuter, who was fired from the force after he was deemed to have violated their use of force policy. Patrick Tuter, a former Garland police officer, has been indicted on a charge of manslaughter by a Grand Jury, the first time in 15 years that an officer has been charged over a fatal shooting . It is the first time in 15 years that an officer has been indicted for a fatal shooting while on duty. On August 31 Tuter spotted Allen's white GMC pickup and recognised it as having been involved in a chase with Sachse police. He tried to stop the vehicle, but Allen fled, leading to a half hour chase that only ended when Tuter opened fire. The former officer had tried to claim that Allen rammed into a police vehicle while cops were trying to box him in, however video footage taken from a dash camera has since revealed that officers actually rammed Allen. Tuter then opened fire, letting off 41 rounds and hitting Allen, from Wylie, three times which killed him. Tuter initially claimed he opened fire after Michael Vincent Allen rammed police vehicles while they tried to box him in. However footage shot from a dashboard camera showed police actually rammed Allen . According to witness reports from the time, Tuter reloaded his pistol at least once. Mitchell Wallace, who lived in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, told The Dallas Morning News last year that he was asleep when the gunshots began. He said: 'There was a pause in between the firing that made me believe he was reloading. From the time they yelled, ""Get out, get out,"" they didn’t give him three seconds to get out.' In a separate incident officer Cardan Spencer, another Dallas policeman, was fired from the force after shooting Bobby Bennett, a mentally ill man with a knife who had said he wanted police to kill him. Again video played an important role after authorities initially said that Bennett had aggressively come at the officers with the knife raised. However a neighbor’s surveillance video showed that Bennett was standing still with his arms at his sides.","Patrick Tuter, 33, a former police officer, indicted for manslaughter .

"Christmas has come and gone but one Starbucks in Connecticut is still very much in the holiday spirit. Customers at the location off the Berlin turnpike in Newington have been continuously paying for the person behind them in line since Christmas Eve. As of 10am Friday, the manager at the location told MailOnline that 900 customers in a row have paid for the customer behind them in line. By Friday afternoon, that number had grown to 1000 - which means they may have already set a new world record. Paying it forward: Since Christmas Eve, 900 customers at this Starbucks location in Newington, Connecticut have been paying for the order behind them in line . While this Starbucks location has noticed small streaks of generosity before, the number of customers usually simmers out at about 25. But when one customer paid for the person behind them in line out of the blue Tuesday morning, the pay-it-forward scheme took off and hasn't stopped yet. According to Consumerist, the last time something similar happened was last year at a Tim Hortons drive-thru in Canada,  but that frenzy only involved 228 orders over three hours. Generosity over cups of Joe: As of Friday morning, 900 customers in a row had continued the act of kindness with some people paying for orders as much as $20 . Workers at the Starbucks in Newington say they are surprised it has continued to go on for so long, and that people with modest orders are paying for the $20 dollar round of coffees behind them. 'I think it's awesome,' shift supervisor Nicole told ABC News. 'I love this company so much and I'm so proud to work for them. This is what our company embodies. We're all really excited about it.' Customers are just as excited about the unexpected treat, which explains why the simple act of kindness has continued its momentum. 'It feels so good,' customer Cathy Shemeth told NBC Connecticut.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk has ruled out recalling Michu to fill the gap which will be left by Wilfried Bony's participation in the Africa Cup of Nations finals. Bony's Ivory Coast qualified for the tournament to be held in Equatorial Guinea in January and February with a goalless draw against Cameroon, the game ending amid riotous scenes in Abidjan as supporters reacted angrily to both sides tamely settling for the draw which secured their finals place. Ivory Coast's qualification means Bony - who signed a one-year contract extension on Wednesday which will keep him at the Liberty Stadium until June 2018 - could be absent for as many as six Swansea games in the new year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Garry Monk speak about Bony's contract extension . Wilfried Bony could miss up to six games in January due to the Africa Cup of Nations finals . Bony has scored four goals in 13 games for Swansea this season . The 25-year-old could miss Barclays Premier League games against West Ham, Chelsea, Southampton, Sunderland and West Brom as well as a potential FA Cup fourth round tie, and Monk admitted Ivory Coast's qualification for the finals was 'bittersweet' for Swansea. Monk said while he was happy for the player reaching a major tournament for his country it meant Swansea had to seek striking cover, but he dismissed that being Spanish forward Michu who is currently on loan from the Welsh club at Napoli. Michu scored 22 goals in his first season at Swansea but made little impact in an injury-disrupted second campaign last term and the player's frustration has continued in Italy. The 28-year-old has made only five appearances for the Serie A club, has failed to play a full 90 minutes and has yet to score for Rafa Benitez's side - and Monk has ruled out a January return to Swansea for a player again blighted by injury this season. Spanish striker Michu is on a season-long loan in Italy with Serie A side Napoli . 'Michu is on loan at Napoli for the season,' Monk said. 'I'm not even thinking about that (Michu returning), I've not even checked the details of the loan. 'Obviously Ivory Coast's qualification dictates what you do in terms of January. We may have to go into the loan market or do something to cover it. 'We've already been looking at all the positions but now Bony has qualified a striker is the position we do now have to cover. 'We could promote from within, but it is likely to be a loan. It might be a loan with a view to a permanent (move) or to next season, or just for a month. We don't know but we will look at all the options.' Swansea boss Garry Monk has played down talk of a top-six finish this season . VIDEO We could finish in top 6 - Monk . Swansea have won two and drawn one of their last three Barclays Premier League games to climb into the top five and head to Manchester City on Saturday buoyed by their comeback victory over Arsenal before the international break. But Monk insists he is not looking too far ahead and dismisses talk of a possible top-six finish. 'We just focus on the next game because if you look too far ahead you lose track of what you're doing,' Monk said. 'We're just looking at Man City and giving that 100 per cent commitment. Who knows if we can stay in the top six. 'You obviously look at the tables but my focus is on attacking every game as best we can. Swansea's win against Arsenal last time out saw them leapfrog the Gunners into fifth in the table . 'We want to get the best performances and hopefully that will get us enough points to stay in the top half of the table and see where that takes us. 'We're realistic and teams below us are very powerful financially, but all I care is we compete against these teams and we're competing so far.' Swansea will be without Federico Fernandez at the Etihad Stadium with a calf injury preventing the Argentina central defender from marking his international team-mate Sergio Aguero. But Monk admits he is delighted to have welcomed Leon Britton back into his squad, the long-serving midfielder having finally ended his season-long absence from knee trouble with a late cameo appearance against Arsenal two weeks ago. Leon Britton is back to fitness after a season out with a serious knee injury . 'In my time Leon has been the most influential player at this club on and off the pitch,' Monk said. 'He's a quiet guy who just gets on with it, the kind of player young players should aspire to be. 'When he speaks everyone listens and it's then you know you've got someone special on your hands. 'But he has to earn his place just like the rest of them because, as much as I talk about how good he is, you don't spend three-and-a half months out and expect to just walk back into the side. 'Leon is realistic enough to know that. He's going to have to earn the right to play and force his way back into the team.'","Bony could miss up to six games due to Africa Cup of Nations in new year .

"An adult film producer was convicted on Friday of violating federal obscenity laws by selling movies depicting bestiality and extreme fetishes. The verdict ends a long-running legal saga that saw two mistrials, including one in which sexually explicit material was found on a personal website of the chief justice of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who was overseeing the case. Ira Isaacs, 60, was found guilty of five counts, including mailing obscene matter, his attorney Roger Diamond said. The jury at the Los Angeles trial took about two hours to reach its decision. Convicted: Ira Isaacs, left, with his attorney Roger Jon Diamond, poses outside the Federal Courthouse in Los Angeles on June 9, 2008 . Isaacs could face a sentence ranging from probation to 20 years in prison. He remained free on bond pending his August 6 sentencing hearing. Federal prosecutors did not have an immediate comment about the verdict. Diamond said he and his client were disappointed but relieved the case is finally at an end. 'The government sometimes can wear you down,' Diamond said. Controversy: Isaacs' 2008 trial was halted after . it was reported appellate court judge Alex Kozinski had sexually explicit material on a personal website . Isaacs was indicted as part of an effort by a Bush administration task force to crack down on smut in the United States. The unit has since been disbanded. In March, jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict, voting 10-2 in favor of a conviction on 10 counts. Isaacs' 2008 trial was halted after the Los Angeles Times reported Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, had sexually explicit material on a personal website. Among the questionable images was video of a man cavorting with a farm animal and a picture of nude women painted to look like cows. Kozinski recused himself and was admonished by a special committee of his colleagues for actions they deemed as poor judgment. He was presiding over the criminal case under a program in which appellate judges are assigned federal trials. At issue at the trial was whether the videos sold by Isaacs were obscene. The test hinged on a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that held that a work is not legally obscene if it has 'literary, artistic, political or scientific value.' Jurors also were asked to decide whether the videos, some of which depicted fetishes involving feces, violated standards of what is acceptable to the community at large. In all three trials, jurors had to watch a series of explicit videos in entirety. Isaacs has maintained his work is an extreme but constitutionally protected form of art, but he hasn't been supported by others in the porn industry. 'He was determined to fight the case to vindicate the First Amendment, but the regular adult industry doesn't consider him to be part of it because they claim his material goes well beyond what is mainstream porno in California,' Diamond said.","Ira Isaacs, 60, found guilty on five counts, including mailing obscene matter .

"Greeks angry at the fate of the euro are comparing the German government with the Nazis who occupied the country in the Second World War.

Attack: A street poster in Greece has depicted Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform with a swastika surrounded by the EU stars. The accompanying words describe her as a 'public nuisance' The backlash has been provoked by Germany’s role in driving through painful measures to stop Greece’s debt crisis from spiralling out of control. Greeks are furious at the deal, even . though it means the banks will write off 50 per cent of the country’s . debt and Socialist prime minister George Papandreou said Greece had . ‘avoided a mortal national danger’. Angela Merkel was wearing an amber necklace at the EU negotiations to bring her good luck. German media noted that the 11th hour deal was secured while she was wearing her favourite piece of jewellery, which, said Bild newspaper, she always wears to the big political occasions. Amber is said to bring good fortune to the wearer and to relieve a range of illnesses such as stomach problems. It also supposedly makes you more lucky and improves your decision making – qualities Mrs Merkel would have found rather handy. Opposition parties blasted the landmark agreement, with conservatives warning it condemned the country to ‘nine more years of collapse and poverty’. But it is the fury of ordinary Greeks which is raising eyebrows. Greek government officials who agreed to the belt-tightening moves have been portrayed in cartoons giving the Nazi ‘Sieg Heil’ salute. And German visitors flocking to ancient tourist sites are being met with a hostile welcome from some Greeks. Berlin’s interference has revived historical enmities and evoked comparisons to the massive destruction of Greece at the hands of Hitler’s Germany more than 65 years ago. Cartoons have sprung up depicting the European Union’s ‘troika’ as ferocious soldiers in Second World War uniforms. Satirical: Cartoons appearing in Greek newspapers have drawn comparisons with the Nazis . Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos is a regular target in the liberal daily Eleftherotypia and is often shown in cartoons making a Nazi salute. One shows a German soldier watching over Venizelos as he barks at a Greek citizen to pay more taxes.

"One's royal double: Ella Slack been acting as a loyal stand-in for the Queen for rehearsals for public events for 24 years . In 60 years, the Queen has never put a foot wrong in public. And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she’s had a secret weapon – the unassuming Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unbeknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen’s official stand-in at rehearsals for royal events. The 69-year-old from the Isle of Man has never accepted a penny for her loyal service, considering it ‘a pleasure and an honour’ to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the sovereign. ‘How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?’ she said. While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially, she has a similar build to the monarch, standing just shy of 5ft. The Queen is 5ft 2in. She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC’s sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal for Remembrance Day at the Cenotaph – and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament to the 50th anniversary of VE day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first. She has perfected her own version of the Queen’s wardrobe, including a black patent handbag she bought in a charity shop for £1, and even styles her hair like the Queen. Most recently, Miss Slack has been rehearsing for next weekend’s Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, braving the wind and rain on the royal barge. And she has won a coveted place in the flotilla on the day itself – in a boat named, appropriately enough, the Queen Elizabeth. Who's been sitting in my throne?

"Verizon and Comcast customers are struggling to use Netflix because their connection has become too slow, it has been claimed. Customers have taken to online forums to say the service in unusable for them, and claiming the firms may be prioritising their own streaming services. Netflix revealed the providers have slipped down its ISP rankings - despite their claims to offer high speed services. Comcast and Verizon customers have taken to online forums to complain Netflix has become unusable for them . There are 44 million Netflix members worldwide. Over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies are streamed from Netflix each month. During peak watching times, Netflix accounts for around a third of all downstream Internet traffic in the U.S. Comcast ranked among the slowest on the list, while Verizon FIOS dropped one spot, to seventh of 17, according to a Netflix analysis of data culled from its millions of subscribers. 'The Netflix ISP Speed Index is based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month,' wrote Joris Evers of Netflix. 'The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP's network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network. 'A faster network generally means a better picture quality, quicker start times and fewer interruptions.' However, consumers say speed is a major issue. Subscribers found other streaming sites such as Hulu worked perfectly - but Netflix was unusable . Netflix publishes its own ISP speed index . One Verizon customer wrote in January that Netflix had become 'pretty much unusable' over the previous month. 'During a movie or show, it will stop for buffering every minute or two and hang for about 30 seconds, then resume, then repeat. 'I am currently suspicious that Verizon has put in place new network policies that corrupt the Netflix streams since they have a competing service. 'Or, they just don't care about providing the level of service I am paying for.' A frustrated Comcast customer in Washington said 'Daytime is fine but the evenings suck bad.' Netflix speeds on both Verizon FiOS and Comcast, which have 6.1 million and 20.7 million respective subscribers, have been slowing for the past few months, according to the Netflix figures. The complaints come after last month's federal appeals court ruling that struck down Federal Communication Commission rules known as net neutrality. An ISP like Verizon or Comcast could charge a company like YouTube, Netflix or Facebook to deliver content faster to subscribers. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has spoken out about the move, telling investors: 'The motivation could be to get Netflix to pay fees to stop this degradation. 'Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some [Internet service provider], we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver.' However, Verizon told HuffPo ts treats all traffic equally. During peak watching times, Netflix accounts for around a third of all downstream Internet traffic in the U.S., according to Sandvine, a company that monitors networks. Netflix said Verizon is not slowing its traffic, and the streaming video company isn't concerned with the possibility that ISPs may throttle its service, according to an article on Re/Code. Some experts believe the problem is with network capacity, and the huge popularity of online streaming services.

"The captain of MH370 is now 'chief suspect' in Malaysia's official police investigation into the ongoing mystery of the Malaysia Airlines jet's disappearance - after investigators found suspicious evidence from a flight simulator in his home.

Suspicious: The captain of the missing airline MH370, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, has been dubbed the 'chief suspect' in Malaysia's official police investigation into the incident . The criminal inquiry cleared all the  intelligence checks completed for all the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur. The only individual arousing suspicion was Captian Shah . After more than . 170 interviews, detectives determined that Captain Shah was the most likely culprit if the plane - which went missing on March 8 . with 239 people on board - was lost due to human intervention, . according to The Sunday Times. The . criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on . board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur, but the only individual . arousing suspicion was Captain Zaharie. The father-of-three was found to have no social or work-related future plans, unlike the rest of the crew including his co-pilot, Fariq Hamid. The newspaper has also stated that police were told of rumours that the captain was experiencing tensions at home with his partner and family members, however this was denied by friends and family who continue to defend him. The father-of-three (left) had made no social or work-related plans for the future, unlike the rest of the crew. Malaysian police were also told of rumours that he was experiencing tensions with some family members . Investigators retrieve deleted files from captain Shah's home flight simulator which allegedly showed him rehearsing a landing on a small runway after flying above the southern Indian Ocean . The criminal inquiry, which is yet to rule out other reasons for the plane's disappearance including a mechanical failure and terrorism, has so far only released its results to foreign governments and their investigators. 'The police investigation is still ongoing. To date no conclusions can be made as to the contributor to the incident and it would be sub judice (a legal term referring to not commenting on ongoing cases) to say so,' Malaysian police were quoted a saying. 'Nevertheless, the police are still looking into all possible angles.' Captain Shah was said to be a 'fanatical' supporter of the country's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim - jailed for homosexuality just hours before the jet disappeared. Grieving: A Chinese woman whose son was on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, in Beijing earlier this month . He was described as was an ‘obsessive’ supporter of Ibrahim. And hours before the doomed flight left Kuala . Lumpur it is understood 53-year-old Shah attended a controversial trial . in which Ibrahim was jailed for five years. Campaigners say the politician, the key challenger to Malaysia’s ruling party, was the victim of a long-running smear campaign and had faced trumped-up charges. Police . sources have confirmed that Shah was a vocal political activist – and . fear that the court decision left him profoundly upset. It was against . this background that, seven hours later, he took control of a Boeing . 777-200 bound for Beijing and carrying 238 passengers and crew. The missing plane, considered history's worst aviation disaster, went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board . Probe: Months of searching the ocean floor using state-of-the-art equipment has so far yielded nothing . It's not the first time Captain Zaharie has been the centre of suspicion regarding the missing airline. Varying testimonials from his family members alluding to the pilot displaying erratic behaviour a few weeks before the missing flight, as well as rumours that he has been recently estranged from his wife and family, have been both revealed and later consistently denied. The search area where it is believed the plane crashed, has changed several times, but a group of countries are continuing to negotiate on how to fund the next phase of the sonar search, which will cover an area of 21,600 square miles.

"A 'master key' that could give hackers complete access to mobile phones and tablets running Google's Android software (logo pictured) has been revealed . A ‘master key’ that could give hackers complete access to mobile phones and tablets running Google’s Android software has been revealed. The bug could allow hackers to hijack phones, allowing them to steal data, listen in to calls or send junk email and text messages. Researchers say the loophole has been present since 2009, and claim around 900 million devices are at risk. Jeff Forristal of Bluebox, the firm which uncovered the key, said the implications of the discovery were ‘huge’. ‘It can essentially take over the normal functioning of the phone and control any function thereof,’ he wrote on the firm’s blog. Forristal said the firm made Google aware of its finding in February. However, the firm did not respond to MailOnline’s request for a comment. The bug takes advantage of the way Android handles cryptographic verification of the apps installed on the phone. Android uses the cryptographic signature as a way to check that an app or program is legitimate and to ensure it has not been tampered with. The Bluebox team found a way to bypass these checks, tricking Android so malicious changes to apps go unnoticed. Any app or program written to exploit the bug would enjoy the same access to a phone that the legitimate version of that application enjoyed. ‘Installation of a Trojan application from the device manufacturer can grant the application full access to Android system and all applications (and their data) currently installed,’ wrote Forristal. ‘The application then not only has the ability to read arbitrary application data on the device (email, SMS messages, documents, etc), retrieve all stored account & service passwords, it can essentially take over the normal functioning of the phone and control any function thereof (make arbitrary phone calls, send arbitrary SMS messages, turn on the camera, and record calls). ‘Finally, and most unsettling, is the potential for a hacker to take advantage of the always-on, always-connected, and always-moving (therefore hard-to-detect) nature of these “zombie” mobile devices to create a botnet.’ Researchers say the loophole has been present since 2009 and claim around 900 million devices are at risk. One third party device, the Samsung Galaxy S4 (pictured right), already has a fix for the flaw, but that Google’s own Nexus handset (left) does not . Forristal is planning to reveal more information about the problem at the Black Hat hacker conference being held in August this year, and said the bug could have huge implications for firms who allow people to connect their Android phones and tablet to secure company networks. He confirmed that one third party device, the Samsung Galaxy S4, already has a fix for the flaw, but that Google’s own Nexus handset did not. However, experts say that there is currently no evidence that the flaw has been exploited. ‘I imagine that Google would move quickly to add some logic to look for such attacks,’ Dan Wallach, a professor specializing in Android security in the computer science department of Rice University, told the Ars Technica website. ‘Without that available to an attacker, this is likely to only be relevant for Android users who use third-party app stores (which have lots of other problems).’ McAfee Mobile Security has identified a new Android Trojan embedded in a pirated copy of an exclusive app from rapper Jay Z . On the surface, the malware app functions identically to the legitimate app. However, in the background, the malware sends info about the infected device to an external server every time the phone restarts . The malware then attempts to download and install additional packages . The only visible indication that a user is infected comes via a time-based trigger that is set to activate on 4th July, Independence Day in the US . On that day, the malware will replace the wallpaper on the infected device with an altered image of President Obama that comments on recent events in the US . The security company thinks that there is a hacktivist agenda behind the Trojan but has not ruled out the possibility that additional malware may target financial transactions or other data . A new Android Trojan embedded in a pirated copy of an app (pictured) from rapper Jay Z has been identified. On the surface it works like the real app but is actually trying to install additional packages to an individual's phone.

The massive salaries are 113 times the national average of £24,000 for a worker in the private sector, where salaries have risen just three per cent in the last year. Anger: David Cameron, in Perth, Australia today for the Commonwealth Heads of . Government Meeting, considers the news about fat cat pay from the UK . Speaking from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the Prime Minister said: 'There needs to be . responsibility. Boards have got to think when they are making pay . awards, is this the responsible thing to do? 'We need all these figures published and known so that we can compare and contrast, so shareholders know what they are paying for. 'We need accountability to strengthen the hands of shareholders so that they feel they are taking responsibility for remuneration in the boardroom. 'This is a concerning report, particularly at a time when household budgets are very tight and people have difficult circumstances.' The City of London: Fat cat bosses and bankers can expect bumper bonuses despite the rest of Britain feeling the squeeze . He called for 'transparency, accountability, responsibility' in boardroom pay, urging that all awards must be justifiable. 'Everyone, whether they are in public life, whether they are in private enterprise, they all need to be able to justify the decisions they make about pay,' he added. The extravagant pay packages enjoyed by every member of the boardroom, from the chief executive down to far less high-profile roles, were revealed in research by Incomes Data Services (IDS). In fact according to the report, chief executives and finance directors – usually considered the number two at a firm – did not do as well as more junior staff. The average chief executive saw their total payout increase by 43.5 per cent to £3,855,172, while the rise for a finance director was up 34.1 per cent to £2,001,515. Other directors enjoyed the largest rise, as they took home 66.5 per cent more in pay and perks, to the tune of £2,260,033 on average. Backlash: The Occupy London protest continues in the square at St Paul's Cathedral, with many very angry about capitalist Britain . The bonus element of the average executive pay packet increased by 23 per cent, from £737,624 in 2010 to £906,044. Former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said: ‘These greedy bosses sit on each others’ remuneration committees and wave through each others’ offensive pay rises. An average rise of 49 per cent includes vast rewards for failure while employees, shareholders and customers suffer. Fury: Lord Oakeshott says a minority are getting 'vast rewards for failure while employees, shareholders and customers suffer' ‘Many FTSE bosses then have the brass neck to whine about paying 50 per cent tax. 'It’s high time they showed leadership and restraint.’ The revelation on corporate pay comes as Shell reported bumper profits of £4.4billion in just three months, after reaping the benefit of the high oil prices hitting motorists at the petrol pumps. In a further insult to struggling families, a separate survey revealed City firms will pay out £4.2billion this year in bonuses alone. The sum, revealed by City think tank the Centre for Economics and Business Research will be handed out despite pledges by successive governments to crack down on the culture of corporate excess. Meanwhile, ordinary households are an average of £15 a week worse off than a year ago, thanks to spiralling bills and pay squeezes. Earlier this week the governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King said workers in Britain had been hit by the biggest fall in living standards ‘in living memory’. The Income Data Services report on fat cat pay used information from the latest available published accounts of FTSE100 companies, for the financial year ending between February 2010 and April 2011. Author Steve Tatton said the companies would find it hard to explain why executives were being so handsomely rewarded while their employees struggle to get by. ‘The pay gap between the boardroom and the shop floor does not yet show any signs of closing,’ he said. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, added that the boardroom increases amounted to a ‘brazen stitch-up’. He said: ‘With the FTSE 100 down on last year and most staff getting pay rises of less than two per cent, these bumper settlements prove that CEO pay bears no resemblance to performance or economic reality.’ One of the key factors behind the inflation squeeze on household finances has been the high price of oil, which has been above $100 per barrel all year. But high fuel costs – exacerbated by the unrest in the Middle East – spelled good news for Shell. The oil giant made £4.4billion in the third quarter of the year, the equivalent of around £48million per day. Petrol prices are up almost 18 per cent since last September, according to data collected by Asda, adding to the pressure on incomes. The £4.2billion bonus pool shared out in London’s financial district is actually 38 per cent down on the previous year and a long way below the £11.6billion paid out in 2007/08, just before the credit crunch ravaged the global economy.","City firms to pay out £4.2billion this year in bonuses .

"The scout who recruited Brown Ideye and then left West Bromwich Albion ‘by mutual consent’ last month amid concerns that the club’s record signing had proved something of a flop, was feeling more than a little vindicated on Saturday. ‘Ahem,’ tweeted Stuart White — and understandably so, seeing as the Nigerian has now scored four goals in three games. Clearly, all Ideye needed was a manager capable of utilising the talent that persuaded West Brom to pay £10million for him in the first place. And while Tony Pulis admits a decent enough offer might well have led to Ideye’s departure had Carlton Cole been signed in the last transfer window, the fact that the striker is now performing as effectively as he is amounts to a triumph for both player and manager. Ideye marked his second of this FA Cup tie with a celebratory somersault, having demonstrated his athleticism with the power he generated from the header moments earlier. West Brom striker Brown Ideye celebrates his opener for the Baggies after 20 minutes against West Ham at the Hawthorns . Craig Dawson's cross is met by Ideye, who tapped in his third goal in as many games as the home side took the lead on Saturday . West Brom midfielder James Morrison pumps his fist in celebration having scored a scorcher from long range at the Hawthorns . Nigerian striker Ideye made it 3-0 early in the second-half with this header, which was his fourth goal in three games for the Baggies . England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino runs away to celebrate having fired in West Brom's fourth goal on Saturday in the FA Cup . WEST BROM (4-4-2):Foster 7; Dawson 7, McAuley 7, Lescott 7.5, Brunt 7.5; Sessegnon 7 (McManaman 78, 6), Yacob 7, Morrison 8, Gardner 7.5 (Gamboa 90); Ideye 8.5 (Baird 86), Berahino 7.5 . Subs not used: Wisdom, Olsson, Myhill, Pocognoli . Scorers: Ideye 20 and 57, Morrison 42, Berahino 72 . Manager: Tony Pulis 8 . WEST HAM (4-4-2): Adrian 6; Jenkinson 5, Tomkins 5, Kouyate 5, Cresswell 5; Song 4 (O’Brien 68, 5), Noble 5.5, Nolan 4 (Amalfitano 60, 1), Downing 5; Valencia 4, Sakho 5 (Cole 68, 5) Subs not used: Demel, Jaaskelainen, Henry, Lee . Booked: Amalfitano red card . Manager: Sam Allardyce 5 . Referee: Martin Atkinson 7 . MOTM: Ideye . Compared to a quite stunning first-half goal from James Morrison, not to mention a fine finish from Saido Berahino after the break, Ideye’s 20th-minute strike was not much to look at. It was a poacher’s goal that owed far more to Craig Dawson and the quality of his cross as well as his success in winning an aerial challenge with Aaron Cresswell. Indeed, Ideye might have been a fraction offside when he diverted Dawson’s delivery past Adrian from close range. The assistant referee saw nothing wrong with it but Sam Allardyce did — and complained. In fairness to a side now boasting just one defeat in nine since Pulis took charge, it was no less than West Brom deserved. Set up to be aggressive by their manager, they attacked West Ham with real vigour to produce arguably their finest performance of the season. The travelling fans would probably rate this as West Ham’s worst. They booed their captain Kevin Nolan and they hurled abuse at Allardyce, not for the first time telling him to ‘**** off’. Exactly why they display such animosity towards a manager who, for the most part, has done a good job at Upton Park is baffling. But this was a rough afternoon for Allardyce, made all the more uncomfortable by the dismissal of Morgan Amalfitano and the reaction of West Ham’s owners. While David Sullivan is said to have left early, David Gold took to Twitter to express his sympathy for the fans. Allardyce also said they were entitled to feel frustrated when this competition was one they hoped to advance further in. But he also defended his players ‘to the hilt’, arguing that fatigue undermined their hopes of progressing after three games in six days. Not to mention that final spell against Southampton on Wednesday with nine men. ‘It’s a game too far for us,’ he said. ‘The fixture list didn’t give us the right opportunity to come here and play better. The players were dead on their feet.’ Asked specifically about the personal abuse, he said: ‘I can’t afford to get disappointed on things like that. It’s not professional.’ Further weakened by the loss of Andy Carroll to injury, Allardyce’s side offered little in response to West Brom’s ambition; not a single effort on target in an opening half and not much of note in the second other than the dismissal.

Carl Jenkinson of West Ham clears the ball under pressure from West Brom forward Stephane Sessegnon in their FA Cup clash . Craig Gardner's first-half strike clattered off the post as the hosts dominated proceedings to lead 2-0 at the break . Amalfitano had been on the pitch as a replacement for Nolan for less than 10 minutes when a nasty challenge on Chris Brunt invited Martin Atkinson to show him a yellow card, before a shove in the face of the West Brom captain prompted a straight red. Allardyce said: ‘It’s unprofessional, isn’t it? ‘The punishment is laid down in our code of conduct in terms of hands and getting sent off for something like that. That will be dealt with, as always, internally and we move on. But we’re so short of bodies it’s the last thing we need.’ West Brom, by contrast, were both composed and excellent here. Well organised, obviously. This is a Pulis team, after all. But they were dynamic, determined, every inch a team desperate to secure a place in the quarter-finals. They too were playing their third game in six days but there were no heavy legs in the home side. Ideye displayed that sharpness to open the scoring and Morrison did well to ride a challenge from Mark Noble before beating Adrian with a terrific 25-yard strike just before half-time. Ideye’s second came in the 57th minute when he produced a tremendous amount of power from a deflected Stephane Sessegnon cross. And to compound West Ham’s misery, a 72nd-minute goal from Berahino would then follow, beating Adrian at his near post. As thrilled as Pulis was, he stressed the need to remain focused on Premier League points. And Ideye? ‘The difference is confidence,’ he said. And a new manager.

"It is considerably more showy than the kind of runabout most of us might pop to the supermarket in. But perhaps this metallic red £200,000, gullwinged Mercedes SLS AMG supercar is just what Rowan Atkinson needs to lift his spirits after rumours that his marriage is in trouble. Even so, the 59-year-old millionaire actor needed his torso to be as flexible as his famously rubbery face as he lowered himself into the gleaming two-seater after nipping out for some groceries at Waitrose. Scroll down for video . Clumsy: The 59-year-old actor negotiated his way out of the flashy red SLS's unusual doors . Mr Bendy: He twisted artfully on to the street in Chelsea, London, to grab some groceries from Waitrose . If getting in to the driver’s seat made him look as ungraceful as his bumbling comic creation Mr Bean, no one could argue that the SLS - which has a top speed of 199mph and does 0 to 62mph in 3.7 seconds - is far more impressive than that other recent addition to his car collection, a Skoda. Last year the Blackadder star was seen going out for a spot of shopping in a relatively modest £18,000 Skoda Superb, a brand once the butt of countless jokes about poor performance. It is in stark contrast to the SLS - and the 240mph McLaren F1, for which he paid £634,500 in 1997 and which has since soared in value to £3 million. It is a far cry from his appearance last year in a Skoda, a brand once the butt of jokes about poor performance . He emerged in the latest addition to his sports car fleet after rumours arose that his 23-year marriage is troubled . The actor, thought to be worth £71million, also owns a vintage Ford Falcon, an Aston Martin and a BMW . Last year Atkinson successfully claimed £910,000 from his insurers to fix the McLaren - the highest repair bill ever recorded in Britain - after crashing it into a tree in 2011, leading to speculation that he had plumped for the Skoda because he wanted something a little more conservative. The state of his 23-year marriage to wife Sunetra was called into question recently when he failed to turn up for his nephew Christopher’s wedding. The couple, who have two children, have not been seen in public together for some months. He has not been seen publicly with wife Sunetra months ago, and recently missed his nephew's wedding .

Symptoms . include fever, severe joint pain, swelling, rashes, and a feeling . similar to arthritis for years, according to the Herald. News of this new infection surfaces only days after two cases were reported in Florida. State health officials confirmed a Miami-Dade County female and a male in Palm Beach County have become the first two people to contract chikungya in the United States. Dozens of infections have previously been reported in Florida alone, according to the Tampa Bay Times, but these are the first two to have been contracted in the States. Not contagious among humans: Chikungunya is transmitted through mosquito bites . The Miami-Dade woman, 41. started complaining of symptoms June 10, according to the Miami Herald, and the 50-year-old male from Palm Beach County first reported his symptoms on July 1. Neither had travelled outside the country, sources told the Herald. Previous cases of the disease were the result of travelers having been bitten by infected mosquitoes in the Caribbean, where it is highly-prevalent. It was only a matter of time until it made the jump to Florida. ‘We expected this. Now the question is what are the cases to follow and can Mosquito Control itself do something to mitigate whatever those numbers might be?’ Walter Tabachnick, director of the University of Florida's Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, told the Herald. Preventive measures: Officials are stepping up the spraying of mosquito-prone areas to reduce their populations . ‘It’s not clear yet, how many more cases are there to follow in addition to these initial cases,’ he explained . Another official told the paper counties will now be spraying more often for mosquitoes. ‘We’re trying to put in our plan on how to be a little more proactive with our spraying,’ Miami-Dade County’s Road, Bridge, Canal and Mosquito Control Division chief Manuel Garcia said. ‘We don’t want to set a concrete plan; we have to come up with an adjustable plan based on the mosquitoes, and adjust the plan routinely.’ Authorities expect more people who became sick from an infected mosquito to eventually come forward, but do not expect a full-on outbreak or epidemic like it has become in some parts of the Caribbean. Reports say thousands of cases have been reported in the Dominican Republic. It has been declared an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where 121 cases have been confirmed, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Property owners in Florida are being encouraged to drain standing water, seal screens and windows, and cover up while outside since the infected insects can bite during both the day and night. The only treatment for chikungunya is acetaminophen and water. Taking aspirin is specifically discouraged because the disease does not react well to it.","Massachusetts health officials confirmed one unidentified person contracted the virus with a July 15th lab test .

"A breakthrough in sustainable energy and car design has enabled a team of engineers to build the world's first solar powered family car. The Dutch team have created the world's first 'energy positive' car, which means it produces more energy than it uses. It also has enough room to seat a family of four. A breakthrough in sustainable energy and car design has enabled a team of engineers to build the world's first solar powered family car . Using large solar panels that are placed on the roof of the car, 'Stella' can travel 250 miles without sunshine and on a sunny day, when fully charged, it can drive up to 420 miles. This is nearly twice as far as a standard electric car can travel before it needs to be charged up.

"CLICK HERE for Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone from Sunderland's draw with Chelsea . Sunderland could not quite put the Black Cats among the pigeons in the title race by defeating Chelsea, who emerged from this stalemate still top of the Premier League, unbeaten and on course to be ‘Invincible’ this season. But the hosts did, with great resilience, show that the London club are not unstoppable and, in doing so, gave a glimmer of hope to challengers that the season is not blue all over just yet. Sunderland’s manager Gus Poyet pulled no punches in his programme notes about the disparity in quality between the teams. ‘Everybody knows that Chelsea are better than us technically, physically and mentally,’ he wrote.

Booked: Costa, Matic . Referee: Kevin Friend . Attendance: 45,232 . Player ratings from Craig Hope at the Stadium of Light . He added that, ‘you need to compensate for that with the team performance’. And he knows what he is talking about. Sunderland beat Mourinho’s Chelsea in the clubs’ last two meetings. They inflicted Chelsea’s last defeat, at Stamford Bridge in the league in April and Sunderland also won the meeting before, a home game in the League Cup last December. The visitors poured forward from the first whistle and it was clear that Poyet’s game-plan was rooted in containment and counter-attacks. The first six minutes exemplified this with Chelsea pressure then a break ending in Seb Larsson setting up Connor Wickham, whose shot was blocked. Cue the next period of pressure, with the three-man line of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard playing behind Costa and revolving their chances. A Willian cross came pinging in. Santiago Vergini side-footed it out. Hazard shot over the bar. Oscar crossed, low and to the centre, Sunderland cleared. Oscar then shot low from the D, the ball deflected and Costel Pantilimon dived to save. Costa ran the ball into the box and worked it to Willian, whose right-foot shot hit the post. Occasionally Sunderland got away, Wickham smacking over the bar, Jack Rodwell shooting from distance. And then the blue waves came again. The sturdy home defending should not have been such a shock. Take away the 8-0 drubbing by Southampton and, before Saturday, Sunderland had conceded just 11 goals - the second-lowest tally in the division. John O’Shea’s perfectly timed tackle on Costa to cut off the clear and present danger from a beautiful through ball from Cesc Fabregas was symbolic of the defiance and application. Again Chelsea pressed. The pre-match talk was about whether Chelsea can be invincible all season, as only Preston in 1888-89 and Arsenal in 2003-04 have ever been in England’s top division. They certainly have match-winners in all areas. Sunderland striker Connor Wickham (centre) is tackled by Chelsea right-back Branislav Ivanovic while Gary Cahill of Chelsea watches on .

As the intensity of the occasion reached the sidelines, referee Kevin Friend sent Poyet’s assistant Mauricio Taricco to the stands. Play resumed with Chelsea right-back Branislav Ivanovic having a shot blocked by Pantilimon. And then Sunderland came the closest either side came to scoring in the first half. Lee Cattermole fed Vergini, whose chip from inside the area clipped the bar and tipped over the top. With the home fans urging them on, Sunderland pushed on again. The longer Chelsea went without scoring, the more Costa became frustrated and tetchy. Late in the first half, after a tangle with O’Shea, he kicked out. That he missed his target is irrelevant and he was fortunate not to be booked. He did, however, receive a yellow card in the 55th minute for knocking Wes Brown in the face with his trailing arm while jumping. The chances continued to be created by Chelsea and thwarted. Hazard: blocked. Fabregas: saved. Costa: blocked. Poyet then made a double substitution to inject fresh legs into his tiring team, Jozy Altidore replacing Steve Fletcher and Jordi Gomez on for Rodwell. Sunderland pushed forward, Wickham’s shot in testing Thibaut Courtois. Altidore also proved a handful, running at Chelsea late on and having a shot deflected into Adam Johnson’s path with six minutes left. Johnson could only hit his own effort wide of the target.

"Loss of life: The body of 5-year-old Janaya Thompson was found Thursday morning in an abandoned mobile home less than half a mile from her parent's apartment, 12 hours after she disappeared . Police in Gulfport, Mississippi have called off the search for a missing 5-year-old girl after finding her body in an abandoned mobile home this morning. Little Janaya Thompson was first reported missing Wednesday night, and was last seen around 8:30pm in a parking lot just outside her family's apartment on Klein Road. She was found 12 hours later in a vacant trailer home less than half a mile from the apartment complex. Police have released few details on Janaya's case, but say foul play is suspected. The girl's father Jarmal Thompson told the Sun Herald that he believes a man who volunteered to search for his daughter is involved in the death. Mr Thompson says the volunteer drove himself and other family members around in a car during the search, but kept disappearing. He claims authorities found a barrette in the volunteer's car that belonged to his daughter. 'They showed it to me but I didn't want to tamper with evidence,' Mr Thompson said. Family gathered and grieved outside of the mobile home Wednesday afternoon, when Janaya's body was moved. Janaya's mother has since been taken to the hospital. 'One of us has to be strong,' Mr Thompsons said. Janaya's aunt Greta Hinton described her neice as a sweet and talkative girl who was looking forward to starting kindergarten in the fall.

"The world's first printable gun has been deemed a serious safety and security concern after a gun printed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exploded before it was even fired. This danger is matched by the problem with fully-functioning 3-D printed guns - they work all too well. The blueprint for the 3-D gun known as the Liberator was made available online six months ago by the group Defense Distributed with the aim of enabling anyone to print a gun with a 3-D printer six months ago. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No toy: The first gun printed on a 3-D printer, the Liberator, has been tested by the ATF . New technology: An Ultimaker 3-D printer . The State Department demanded the design be taken offline but not before it was downloaded more than 100,000 times. The ATF used the blueprints to print the plastic gun on a 3-D printer. The bureau released the results of its tests on the Liberator on Wednesday, posting a series of videos on the tests to YouTube. The weapon was found to have the power to penetrate several inches of flesh as well as a human skull. 'The bottom line is, the penetration results demonstrated that the Liberator is a lethal weapon,' Earl Griffith, chief of ATF's firearms technology branch told the Huffington Post. 'The .380 bullets fired from the Liberator penetrate sufficiently to reach vital organs and perforate the skull.' The ATF printed several versions of the gun using different materials. The gun printed in a plastic material called Visijet exploded during the test. Explosive: The Liberator made from Visijet exploded during testing . A gun rendered in a stronger plastic known as ABS shot eight rounds without any problems. '[The testers] quit after eight rounds, but there was no issue with the firearm at that point,' ATF spokesperson Tim Graden told Forbes. Authorities say the guns are a particular concern because they're made of plastic which is undetectable, meaning they could be brought into areas where weapons would normally be banned such as airports, schools and courts. Depending on the metal detector, a bullet might not be enough to set it off, and the only way the gun itself could be detected would be with an X-ray machine, which aren't used in many facilities. Undetectable: Authorities are concerned that plastic 3-D guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors wouldn't find them . New threat: A Liberator pistol next to the 3D printer on which its components were made. The single-shot handgun is the first firearm that can be made entirely with plastic components forged with a 3D printer . The gun manages to bypass the Undetectable Firearms Act by including a metal block in its make-up. However, the metal part of the gun doesn't play any part in its function and could be removed. The Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 expires early next month, and there is a push to have the law updated to account for printed plastic guns. New York Congressman Steve Israel told the Washington Post that he's making a 'last-ditch effort' to renew and update the law. 'It would be unfathomable to me if we are not able to renew thiws law right now,' he said. ATF spokesperson Tim Graden outlined the bureau's concerns to Forbes: 'One, they do work. Two, they’re not reliable, and three, they’re undetectable,' says Graden. 'And that’s a safety and security issue because they can make their way into secure facilities.'","The Liberator is the first 3-D printed gun .

"Surgery tourists: Almost a third of Brits having cosmetic surgery are opting to go under the knife abroad . A third of Brits who opt for cosmetic surgery such as boob jobs and face lifts now travel abroad to get it done on the cheap, according to a new study. The research suggests we have become a nation of cosmetic surgery tourists, with many seeking lower-cost elective procedures in Eastern Europe. But, worryingly, more than half are unhappy with the results and one in five had to have further treatment back in Britain to correct problems. The Czech Republic is the country of choice for breast enlargements with 19 per cent of women choosing to go there. Meanwhile, almost one in five lip fillers and nose jobs are also carried out in the country. Others travel even further afield with the research by Confused.com finding Thailand is extremely popular among Brits seeking teeth-whitening procedures. More than a quarter of those getting their teeth done abroad (28 per cent) head for the south-east Asian country. Switzerland was found to be the top destination for face-lifts (29 per cent), botox (28 per cent) and liposuction (14 per cent). The price comparison website discovered 30 per cent who have had cosmetic procedures travelled abroad. The main factor is the cheaper cost of surgery in other countries. Treatment abroad: Switzerland is the country of choice for those wishing to undergo liposuction . A quarter (25 per cent) said they went overseas because they couldn’t afford to have the procedure done in the UK. Others claim they opted for surgery abroad so they could combine it with a holiday at the same time (20 per cent). But it seems it may be a false economy with a greater risk of botched operations. Less than half were pleased with the results (46 per cent), and only 15 per cent would recommend others do the same. One in five who opted for a foreign cosmetic procedure (19 per cent) had to have further treatments to correct a problem, compared to just 6 per cent who stayed in the UK. It seems other complications are more likely to affect those who go under the knife abroad, according to the survey of 1,559 cosmetic surgery patients. Under the knife: The Czech Republic is the country of choice for breast enlargements with 19 per cent of women choosing to go there . A third claim to have caught an infection (33 per cent), whereas only 9 per cent say this happened after a procedure in the UK. Many flock to overseas clinics they know have been visited by celebrities. The study found one in ten (10 per cent) chose a clinic or surgeon because it had been used by a star. Not satisfied: Less than half of people having surgery abroad are unhappy with the results . A similar number (11 per cent) opted to use somewhere recommended by friends or family. Despite the apparently heightened risks of heading abroad for procedures, only 14 per cent notified their doctor before travelling. Confused.com advise those travelling abroad for medical treatment should ensure they are adequately protected should the worst happen. Yet only a third (33 per cent) took out travel insurance, with even fewer notifying their existing insurer (29 per cent) of their plans. Mhairi Edwards, Head of Travel Insurance at Confused.com said: 'Our research suggests cosmetic surgery tourism is now a popular trend among Brits. 'If consumers are tempted by a nip and tuck or a brighter smile at a smaller cost, we urge them to do their homework so their bargain treatment does not prove to be a costly mistake. 'Potential patients go overseas where prices are lower and procedures are more readily accessible. 'However, it is clear there are increased risks associated with travelling abroad for cosmetic procedures. 'Those considering surgery or procedures abroad should ensure they are fully protected, because they could be left in the lurch if things go wrong. 'Notifying your doctor and ensuring you have adequate travel insurance is a must. 'Travellers should also be aware normal travel insurance might not cover them for all procedures abroad, so they need to be thorough when choosing the right policy for them.'","Worryingly, more than half are unhappy with the surgical results .

"Smiling and looking relaxed in each other’s company, Tony Blair and the autocratic ruler of Kazakhstan met yesterday for the first time since an £8million consultancy deal was revealed. The former prime minister held discussions with Nursultan Nazarbayev at the president’s Akorda Palace. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that Mr Blair had secured a deal to act as consultant to the former Communist Party apparatchik, who has been widely criticised in the West for human rights abuses and election malpractice. Plenty to discuss: Tony Blair and Nursultan Nazarbayev during their meeting at the Kazakh president's palace yesterday . Mr Blair now runs an advisory firm and the project in the oil and gas-rich central Asian state is believed to include some of his former Downing Street aides. The former Labour leader’s office has disputed that the year-long deal is worth £8million, and stated that he is ‘not personally making a profit’ from the arrangement. His team is providing advice on improving Kazakhstan’s chequered international reputation and forging business links across Europe. Officials said that during their meeting yesterday Mr Blair and 71-year-old Nazarbayev ‘discussed working out a large-scale programme to modernise the economy of Kazakhstan, as well as a wide range of international issues, in particular, the situation in the European Union and the Middle East’. It was Mr Blair’s third visit to the Kazakh capital, Astana, in nine months. His wife Cherie has also visited Kazakhstan, in May. Critics claim Mr Blair’s role gives a mask of respectability to a regime condemned in leaked U.S. diplomatic cables for ‘pervasive corruption’ and using torture.","Blair to act as .

"A giant panda at Zoo Atlanta gave birth to the first twins born to the species in an American zoo since 1987. The 15-year-old Lun Lun went into labor Monday afternoon and gave birth to the first cub at 6:21 and the second two minutes later. Zookeepers who had been anticipating only one cub based on a recent ultrasound were surprised by the first-ever twin panda births at Zoo Atlanta. ‘We have twins!’ Zoo Atlanta announced on its website. Scroll down for video . Surprise! 15-year-old Lun Lun was to be a mom for the fourth time, but ended up birthing a set of twins Monday to the surprise and joy of Zoo Atlanta staff . An ultrasound on June 30 determined that Lun Lun was pregnant with her fourth cub. Zoo spokesperson Keisha Hines says zookeepers weren't expecting the tiny duo, however. The twin cubs are the first giant pandas to be born in the United States in 2013, Hines added.Zoo officials are working with animal care workers from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, where Lun Lun and her 15-year-old partner, Yang Yang, were born. There was no immediate report on the size or weight of the cubs at birth, nor the condition of the offspring and mother. But zoo officials were in a celebratory mood. ‘This is a success we share with all of our fellow zoological organizations working to understand and protect this iconic species, and we share our joy with our local community and with our colleagues in China,’ said Raymond B. King, Zoo Atlanta's president and CEO. ‘Twins are an entirely new scenario for Lun Lun, Zoo Atlanta and our animal care teams, who will no doubt be extremely busy over the next few months,’ his statement added. Lun Lun had been artificially inseminated in March and has been under 24-hour observation by a camera providing a live video feed from her den. Officials said the newborns' father is 15-year-old Yang Yang. Zookeepers weren't immediately sure of the genders of the cubs. In the pink: The twins when they were just days old . Zookeepers said Lun Lun is caring for one of the cubs while animal management and veterinary teams from the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation Giant Panda Center care for the other in a nursery center. Officials said they will likely rotate the cubs between the nursery and Lun Lun's care to ensure they each get enough maternal nurturing without overexerting the 15-year-old giant panda. Giant pandas typically only care for one cub when twins are born in the wild - which usually leads to only one of the twins surviving, Hines noted. Giant panda twins have survived in zoos by officials rotating the cubs with the mother during their first few months of life. Hines said giant pandas have a high mortality rate in the first few months after birth, and the risk is greater when twins are born. Visitors to Zoo Atlanta will likely be able to visit the cubs later this year, Hines said. She added that Yang Yang and the cubs' older brothers - Xi Lan, 4, and Po, 2 - remain on exhibit and will not be housed with Lun Lun or the cubs. The separation is normal and occurs naturally in the wild, Hines said. Less than 1,600 giant pandas are believed to be living in the wild, Hines said. Zoo Atlanta was awarded the International Conservation Award from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 2012 for its work to preserve the species.","Twin pandas have not been born in an American zoo since 1987 .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has caused yet another storm by committing the world football body to the multi-million-pound funding of a film that is regarded as little more than a giant vanity project. United Passions, which was launched with Blatter in attendance at the Cannes film festival  yesterday, tells the history of FIFA through founder Jules Rimet, played by Gerard Depardieu, Joao Havelange and Blatter himself — who is depicted by Tim Roth. It is understood the film, which has received a lukewarm reaction, cost £19million to make, of which FIFA paid £16million, although a Zurich source claimed it was only half that amount — but still a huge investment. Red carpet: FIFA president Sepp Blatter (second from left) attends the premiere of the The Homesman with actor Gerard Depardieu (second from right) and director Frederic Auburtin (right) There is great angst within FIFA that Blatter made the personal decision to commit to such a vast spend after being strongly advised to steer well clear of the proposed film — brought to his attention by Algeria’s FIFA executive member Mohamed Raouraoua. It is North African sources who are adamant that Blatter has bankrolled at least  85 per cent of the movie, which is expected to be a box-office flop. Once involved, Blatter was very hands-on in the production. Having seen an original draft back in March, the FIFA president demanded a number of changes, including him lecturing the FIFA marketing department, as opposed to the FIFA executive, on rooting out corruption after his first election in 1998. Blatter is expected to be unopposed when he stands for a fifth term at the annual Congress in Sao Paulo at the start of June.

"German prosecutors have started proceedings against a former Auschwitz death camp guard in a last ditch bid to bring 50 former SS men to trial before they die peacefully of old age. Hans Lipschis, 93, is expected to be the first person brought to court after investigations were launched by German officials several weeks ago into the Auschwitz guards who escaped scot free after WW2. Prosecutors in Stuttgart this week confirmed the criminal probe launched against him. Lipschis, who was born in Lithuania in 1919 and was granted 'ethnic German' status in 1943, is accused of working at Auschwitz-Birkenau as a member of the S.S. from 1941 to 1945. He is suspected of participating in murder and genocide. Lipschis’ name was added a few weeks ago to a list of wanted Nazi criminals published by Dr Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's office in Israel. 'Work Makes You Free': The 'Arbeit Mact Frei' sign still hangs above Auschwitz concentration camp in a haunting reminder of the atrocities that were carried out there. It is now a museum . Chilling: Hans Lipschis was born in Lithuania in 1919 and was granted 'ethnic German' status in 1943. This is his ID Card from Auschwitz . Nice life for guards: An accordionist leads a sing-along for SS officers at their retreat at Solahutte outside Auschwitz in 1944. Not far away, Jews were being murdered in their thousands . Over 1.2 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland during the war. A German newspaper tracked Lipschis down to a retirement home near Stuttgart where he denied the charges, claimed he knew nothing about the horrors committed at the extermination camp and said he was a 'cook for the entire time I was there.' But paperwork has surfaced that shows he was a member of the SS–Totenkopf Sturmbann, or Death’s Head Battalion, which guarded the camp. These were the men who also supervised the unloading of the trains which brought the doomed victims from all over Europe to Auschwitz. In the past German prosecutors have relied on eyewitness testimony or paperwork when bringing murder charges against suspected war criminals. But the conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk in 2011 in Munich set a new precedent whereby it was enough for people to have served at a site of mass extermination without specific acts being proved. In 1956 Lipschis fled to the United States and lived in Chicago for 26 years, but was deported to Germany in 1983 after being identified by the U.S. as a Nazi war criminal.

Haunting: A handful of haunting photographs taken during the camp's liberation are haunting reminders of the unimaginable horror that faced prisoners inside Auschwitz . Convicted: The conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk in 2011 set a new precedent whereby it was enough for people to have served at a site of mass extermination without specific acts being proved . Because of the precedent set in the Demjanjuk case, prosecutors are planning to put him on trial without any specific knowledge of what he did during his time there. 'It is almost certain that he will be the first to be brought to court,' stated the German newspaper Die Welt. Kurt Schrimm, who heads the German office for investigating Nazi crimes, said the investigations had already led to information about numerous suspects, all of whom reside in Germany and are about 90 years old.","Hans Lipschis, 93, is accused of working at Auschwitz from 1941 to 1945 .

"Forensic staff could not find any conclusive evidence of Mr Assange¿s DNA on a torn condom given to Swedish police by one of the alleged  victims . Lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange have revealed that a key piece of evidence does not contain his DNA. A torn condom given to Swedish police by one of the alleged  victims was examined by staff at two forensic laboratories but they could not find any conclusive evidence of Mr Assange’s DNA on it. The same forensic teams found DNA thought to belong to the WikiLeaks boss on another condom, which was submitted by the second alleged victim. The revelation is contained in a 100-page police report that was written after witnesses were  interviewed and forensic evidence had been examined. The report, which has been seen by Mr Assange’s lawyers, has led to the Swedish authorities requesting his extradition from Britain to stand trial, though he is yet to be charged with any offence. Mr Assange, who denies allegations of rape and sexual molestation, has been fighting extradition to Sweden for the past two years. He claims it is a ruse to send him to the United States where he could face trial for espionage. The 41-year-old is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after being granted asylum by the country’s president, Rafael Correa. In the report, the first alleged . victim, now 33, claims she was sexually molested by Mr Assange at her . flat in Stockholm on  several occasions. She . also claims that Mr Assange deliberately ripped a condom before . wearing  it so that he could have unprotected sex with her against her . will. Julian Assange is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after being granted asylum by the country's president, Rafael Correa.

The report also appears to cast doubt on the claim made by the second alleged victim, who told police that she was ‘raped’ by  Mr Assange when she was asleep. But during a police interview,  the woman, now 29, apparently suggests that she did not mind  him having unprotected sex  with her. The Swedish prosecutor’s office refused to comment on the report but said the case was ongoing.","But its thought another condom, submitted by the second alleged victim, does.

Company president Derek Williams told motherjones.com: 'I can't go into exact sales numbers, but basically we tripled our sales volume of backpacks that we typically do in a month - in one week.' Mr Williams also admitted that he would be looking to actively promote the products while the events in Connecticut remained high in the public consciousness.

Amendment II also sells cheaper bullet-proof inserts which can be used into any backpack but Mr Williams said he would recommend spending the extra money as children could easily take these out. He explained: 'With kids, you never know when they're gonna take something out of their backpack and not put it back in.' Last resort: Instructions show how the bags can be used from the front as shield .

"Passengers who had been warned of lengthy delays at Heathrow due to striking workers today said border controls were 'better than usual'. As Border Agency bosses were forced to take on regular airport workers to man passport control, delighted passengers said queues had been shorter than normal. The situation was echoed at Dover too as passengers faced apparently normal travel conditions with ferry services 'running . well and to time' this morning. Meanwhile, millions of children have stayed at home as more than half of England's 21,700 state schools closed. Thousands of NHS operations and appointments have also been cancelled. 'Better than usual': Terminal 3 at Heathrow as arrivals and departures were largely unaffected by today's strike, with just a few cancellations of inbound transatlantic flights . Back at Heathrow airport chiefs had even laid on free food and water, expecting passengers to be delayed by hours. Debbie Arnell, a 42-year-old apprenticeship assessor from Bournemouth who had flown back to Heathrow's terminal five after a holiday in Philadelphia, said there appeared to be 'more staff than usual' at passport control. She said: 'I've used this terminal seven times before and today was better than usual. 'They were even giving out free fruit and water, which they don't usually do. It's almost like they have over-compensated.' Richard Bunkham, a 45-year-old human . resources consultant from London, also said queues at Heathrow's . passport control had been 'negligible'. Mr . Bunkham said: 'I use iris recognition so don't usually get held up . anyway, but you could see that today it was much better than usual.' Asked what he thought about the . strike, Mr Bunkham said: 'I think the private sector should also be . taking action. I would ask for private sector pensions to be upgraded . rather than public sector pensions downgraded.'. Noel . West, 58, from Brighton, who came into Terminal three from Miami, said: . 'It proves that we do not need half of these people if you can go . through as quickly as I did when there is as strike on. 'It was the fastest I have ever come . through passport control. They were really prepared and there were lines . showing you where to go depending on what passport holder you are way . before there usually is. 'But . they did look like they were preparing for long queues later in the day . - they had spare chairs, special invalid chairs, water and biscuits to . eat.' Daily Mail showbiz editor Sara Nathan . added: 'Heathrow is as dead as a zombie. No queues at immigration at . all - but they've laid out water, apples and Kit-Kats just in case.'

Terminal 3 immigration are being manned by mix of home office staff and . police officers who have been trained, the BBC said. Five non EU desks are open as airport sources suggest immigration controls are at two thirds of normal staffing levels. A British Airways spokesman said: 'We've had a positive start to the day and queues are pretty much as normal. 'There are reports that around two-thirds of the Border Agency staff are working at Heathrow.' A BAA spokesman said: 'Due to the . effective contingency plans we have put in place with the airlines and . the UKBA over recent days, immigration queues are currently at normal . levels. However, there still remains a possibility of delays for . arriving passengers later in the day. Protesters gather with banners and placards in Manchester this morning in opposition over the pension reforms . 'As a result of the whole airport community working together over the . past few days, we have more immigration officers on duty and fewer . passengers arriving than would otherwise be the case. That puts us in a . better place to avoid the serious delays and widespread disruption at . Heathrow that were projected last week.' A spokesman for Gatwick said the airport . was expecting delays today for incoming passengers through passport . control, but no hold ups had occurred yet this morning. The Port of Dover in Kent said all services with P&O Ferries to Calais and DFDS Seaways sailings to Dunkirk were 'running well and to time' this morning with space available. There were no queues on roads leading into the port. Freight and car traffic boarding cross-Channel ferries were told not to expect delays on their outbound journeys but could face disruption on their return to Dover. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said it believed border controls were being manned by a 'hastily gathered' group of police officers, private contractors and volunteers with little training. Meanwhile millions of children have stayed at home today as teachers and heads take to the picket lines, affecting three in four schools, according to early Government figures. However, it is feared this number could rise. The Department for Education (DfE) said it believed that more than half of England's 21,700 state schools - 58 per cent - are closed, with a further 13 per cent partially shut. About 13 per cent are open, the DfE said, while the rest are unknown. Unite members strike outside the Liverpool entrance to the Birkenhead Tunnel which has been closed for the day . Schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also expected to be affected. Thousands of NHS operations and appointments have been cancelled and rescheduled too as a result of today's strike. NHS trusts across the country have written to patients informing them not to come in, although they are still providing emergency and critical care. The picture varies across the UK, with some trusts expecting major disruption and others working as close to normal as possible. In England, the Government estimates around 60,000 non-urgent operations, out-patient appointments, tests and follow-up appointments have been postponed while in Scotland at least 3,000 operations and thousands more hospital appointments are affected.","'It was the fastest I have ever come .

"Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has been admitted to a New York hospital after the discovery of a blood clot stemming from the concussion she sustained earlier this month. Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said her doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam on Sunday. Mr Reines said Clinton is being treated with anti-coagulants - but he would not indicate where the blood clot is located. Health scare: Hillary Clinton's doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam on Sunday . Clinton was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital so doctors can monitor the medication over the next 48 hours. Dr. Larry Goldstein, a neurologist who is director of Duke University's stroke center, said blood can pool on the surface of the brain or in other areas of the brain after a concussion, but those would not be treated with blood thinners, as Clinton's aide described. Aides and doctors say Clinton contracted a stomach virus in early December and became dehydrated, then fainted, fell and hit her head on December 9. She was diagnosed with a concussion on December 13 and hasn't been seen in public since. Political force: Clinton is known as President Obama's most popular cabinet members - and among the names mentioned for a possible 2016 presidential run . Medical care: Clinton was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital so doctors could monitor her medication . The seriousness of a blood clot 'depends . on where it is,' said Dr Gholam Motamedi, a neurologist at Georgetown . University Medical Center who was not involved in Clinton's care. Clots in the legs are a common risk after someone has been bedridden, as Clinton may have been for a time after her concussion. Blood clots like the one that Hillary Clinton is being treated for following her recent concussion can occur for a host of reasons. How serious a clot is depends on where it is and why it formed, doctors say. A Clinton aide would not say where hers is located. WHAT THEY ARE: Blood pools and thickens into a clot after an injury or because of a heart problem, clogged arteries or other condition. Clots also can break off and travel to another part of the body. WHERE THEY OCCUR: In leg veins (called deep vein thrombosis) or in blood vessels in the neck, brain or lungs. Leg clots are a common risk after someone has been bedridden. Clots are most dangerous when they travel to the lungs, a potentially life-threatening situation, or to the brain, where they can cause a stroke. RISK FACTORS: High blood pressure, diabetes, birth control pills, pregnancy, stroke, recent surgery, prolonged sitting, circulation problems and heart problems — especially an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation — raise the chances of developing a blood clot. TREATMENT: Sometimes a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin) is prescribed to allow the clot to dissolve by itself over time and prevent new ones from forming. The new health scare may bring back . some painful memories for the former first lady, who suffered a large . blood clot in her leg back in 1998. In a 2007 interview with the New York Daily News, Clinton called the 1998 clot 'the most significant health scare I've ever had.' Those are 'no big deal' and are . treated with six months of blood thinners to allow them to dissolve on . their own and to prevent further clots from forming, he said. A clot in a lung or the brain is more . serious. Lung clots, called pulmonary embolisms, can be deadly, and a . clot in the brain can cause a stroke, Motamedi said. Clinton's illness led her to cancel an . overseas trip and scheduled testimony before Congress about the attack . on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. When her absence was reported, several pundits and newspapers accused Clinton of making her illness seem worse than it was to dodge questions from lawmakers over the consulate attack, which claimed the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The New York Post called her concussion a 'head fake.' Florida Rep Allan West said Clinton had a case of the 'Benghazi flu,' while Fox News contributer Charles Krauthammer dubbed it an 'acute Benghazi allergy.' Reines said doctors will continue to assess Clinton's condition, 'including other issues associated with her concussion.' Earlier this week, The National Enquirer . reported that brain cancer was behind Mrs Clinton's health problems and . that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the . diagnosis. But a spokesman for the 65-year-old Democrat labelled the claims 'absolute nonsense' and insisted Clinton was recovering well from the fall and subsequent concussion. Only days before her concussion Clinton had said she was in excellent health during an interview with Barbara Walters. At 65, detractors have claimed Clinton's advancing age and health make her too old to realistically serve as a two-term president were she elected in 2016. First family: Mrs Clinton is pictured with daughter Chelsea Clinton and husband Bill during the closing Plenary session of the seventh Annual Meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2011 . 'I am, thankfully, knock on wood, not only healthy, but have incredible stamina and energy,' Clinton told Barbara Walters. Clinton has a history of fainting, having experienced a brief spell in in 2005 during an appearance before a women's group in Buffalo. The former first lady is expected to step down from her role as Secretary of State in the beginning of 2013 when President Obama begins his second term. At a State Department press conference in January 2012, she announced that she would be stepping down from the 'high wire of American politics' after 20 years as first lady, a senator from New York, and finally U.S. Secretary of State. She told reporters at the press conference that 'it would be a good idea to find out how tired I really am.' 'Stamina:' At 65 years old, Clinton bragged to Barbara Walters just days before fainting in early December that she is healthy and has plenty of energy and stamina .","Secretary of state hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian hospital after follow-up exam found the clot .

"'He should get out a bit more': Homosexual actor Rupert Everett (pictured) has drawn criticism from gay rights campaigners after rubbishing the idea of single-sex parents . He was seen as a champion for gay actors when he decided to come out of the closet two decades ago. Now Rupert Everett finds himself in a somewhat less enviable position. The 53-year-old actor has been rounded on by gay rights groups after saying: ‘I can’t think of anything worse that being brought up by two gay dads.’ Everett’s comments are likely to offend celebrity parents such as Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish. The couple have a 21-month-old son Zachary, born to a surrogate mother. Ben Summerskill, chief executive of the gay rights group Stonewall, said: ‘Rupert should get out  a little bit more to see the facts  for himself. ‘There is absolutely no evidence that the kids of gay parents suffer in the way they are being brought up or in how they develop.’ In a provocative interview, Everett – who played a gay father opposite Madonna in 2000 comedy  The Next Best Thing – said his mother Sara, 77, wishes he had a wife and children. ‘She has met my boyfriend, but I’d imagine she still wishes I had a wife and kids,’ he said. ‘She thinks children need a father and a mother and I agree with her. ‘Some people might not agree with that. Fine! That’s just my opinion. Controversial views: Everett, who came out of the closet 20 years ago, starred as a gay man who makes Madonna pregnant after a one-night stand in the film The Next Best Thing (above) Strong views: Everett, an army major's son, has in the past rubbished the idea of homosexuals having children through a surrogate . The wife of a businessman who became a sperm donor for a lesbian couple has spoken of the heart-breaking consequences of conceiving a ‘baby to order’.The woman said she initially supported her husband’s decision to help the gay couple have a child through a surrogate mother.But when it later emerged that the lesbian couple were not legally the baby’s parents, she and her husband launched a court battle to help them formally adopt the child.At one stage, she and the husband of the surrogate mother were left holding the baby at the High Court while a judge ruled the lesbians could become its legal guardians.‘To hold your husband’s child, that isn’t yours, in your arms, felt like a kick,’ said the 45-year-old. ‘It is not something you can ever recover from.‘I knew my husband was a sperm donor and supported him in this but when I knew a child had been conceived my heart broke. It is like your husband having an affair. No one ever thinks of the wives.’She said partners of sperm donors should receive consultation and counselling and criticised the determination of the middle-aged lesbian couple to have a baby.She added: ‘One thing I have learnt about couples who want to have children at any cost is that they are ultimately selfish and the only thing they think about is their need for a child.’ ‘I’m not speaking on behalf of the gay community. ‘In . fact, I don’t feel like I’m part of any “community”. The only community . I belong to is humanity and we’ve got too many children on the planet, . so it’s good not to have more.’ In the same interview, Mrs Everett said she wished her son – who came out in 1989 – was not homosexual. In the past I have said that I wish . Rupert was straight and I probably still feel that,’ she said. ‘I’d like . him to have children. He’s so good with children. ‘He’d make a wonderful father. But I also think a child needs a mummy and a daddy. ‘I’ve told him that and he takes it very well.’ She added: ‘From what I’m told, Rupert . can be a little outspoken, but I don’t think he tries to upset anyone . on purpose. He just says what’s on his mind and doesn’t suffer fools . gladly.’ In 2009, Everett advised young gay . actors not to come out because it would damage their careers. ‘It just . doesn’t work and you’re going to hit a brick wall at some point,’ he . warned. Shortlisted for dad of the year: Sir Elton John and David Furnish, pictured with son Zachary, have not yet responded to Everett's remarks . ‘You’re going to manage to make it . roll for a certain amount of time, but at the first sign of failure, . they’ll cut you right off. ‘The fact of the matter is, and I don’t care who disagrees, it doesn’t work if you’re gay.’","Angry gay rights campaigners say 53-year-old 'should get out a bit more'

But United have had to pay the 28-year-old around £280,000 a week to persuade him to leave the tax haven. Falcao, who will wear the No 9 shirt at Old Trafford this season, was initially offered to English clubs over the weekend for personal terms of £345,000 a week, and while City officials held talks with Monaco and Falcao’s representatives, they were put off by the size of the deal, which also deterred Arsenal. That left the door open for United to make their move on Sunday night, just four days after agreeing a British record fee of £59.7m with Real Madrid for Angel di Maria. United wanted another striker because they have concerns that Robin van Persie still has problems from the knee injury he suffered near the end of last season and could yet need surgery. Summer time: Falcao spent time in Miami with his family after missing the World Cup through injury . Relaxing: Falcao watched on from the sidelines as Colombia reached the quarter-finals before losing to Brazil . Main man: Falcao has established himself as one of the most potent strikers in Europe .

It is understood United persuaded Falcao to accept the same sum they are paying the Argentina midfielder, which is slightly less than the £300,000 a week earned by captain Wayne Rooney. United also tied up the £14m signing of Ajax midfielder Daley Blind, who joins Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo at Old Trafford after a summer that has seen them spend around £160million. Blind, 24, said: ‘It is a real honour to sign for Manchester United. Louis van Gaal is a tremendously talented coach, I have worked with him at Ajax and also for Holland and I cannot wait to work with him at the biggest club in the world.’ Starting out: Falcao joined River Plate after leaving Colombia in 2005 and went on to spend four years there .

Van Gaal welcomed a player he used on the left side of Holland’s defence at the World Cup but is more likely to deploy as a holding midfielder at United. ‘I am delighted Daley has signed for the club,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He is a very intelligent and versatile footballer who can play in many positions. Daley is a great reader of the game and he has played under my philosophy over a number of years.’ Falcao’s arrival meant striker Danny Welbeck was allowed to join rivals Arsenal in a £16m deal, while Javier Hernandez went to Real Madrid on a season-long loan, with an option for a £16m permanent move.","Manchester United have won the race to sign Radamel Falcao .

"Little chef: Theo Carnie with a cake he made but will not be able to eat because has a rare condition which means he has to be fed through a tube . For most, the best part of baking a cake is rushing to taste it after it comes out of the oven. But this pint-sized master chef has never been able to taste one of his own creations because he is unable to eat them. Due to a rare disorder, Theo Carnie cannot eat normal foods and relies on being fed a nutritious formula directly into his small bowel through a tube. However, last week on his fifth birthday he was treated to two cakes – a real one which he gave to his friends and family as well as a replica model which he can keep to remind him of his special day. Theo's mother Verity Carnie, 37, said: 'Just because he can’t eat cake doesn’t mean we shouldn’t celebrate in the same way. It’s still important to have a ritual. 'We all sang for him and he blew out his candles. He loves to bake and he’s not bothered about other people eating around him.' Theo, from Outlane, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had to stop eating like most people when he was three years old because he kept vomiting every time he tried to digest food. He underwent surgery at Leeds General Infirmary in September 2009 which wrapped the upper part of his stomach around the lower end of the oesophagus and stitched it into place preventing him from digesting food normally. Theo Carnie with his food replacement formula and pump which feeds him directly into his small bowel . Support: Theo Carnie with his parents Verity and Nathan who had to teach the five-year-old how to take his food through a tube . This meant Mrs Carnie and Theo’s dad Nathan, 39, had to teach the youngster to take in his food through tubes leading to a backpack which feeds him. Mrs Carnie, a former children’s nurse, said: 'It is his lifeline, and provides him with all of his nourishment, and his medicine, and he has a hypoallergenic milk. 'He carries a little back-pack around with him which contains his special food and his pump and he just gets on with it. 'Truthfully, he was so young when he had the operation that he’s never looked back and we find ways round the food.' Little baker: Theo loves to spend his time in the kitchen baking cakes for his family and friends . Due to a rare disorder, Theo Carnie cannot to eat normal foods and relies on being fed with a nutritious formula directly into his small bowel . Getting ready to bake: Theo places his cake mix into the over and can't wait to see the end result . Mr and Mrs Carnie don’t hide food from him and amazingly, Theo loves to cook, despite being unable to eat the results. 'His favourite chef is Jamie Oliver,' said Verity. 'He loves to cook and he’s always baking or helping me make meals. 'Theo is perfectly happy to be around others when they are eating, and food is still part of his life - we don’t hide away from him when we’re eating. The good mixer: Theo Carnie with his mother Verity at their family home in Huddersfield . 'We do go out for meals and don’t hide away. He comes with us and we take lots of things in a bag so he can sit and play – it’s just part of life. 'Even when we spend time in hospital they cook with him.' Theo still has to attend Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital (GOSH) to have treatment. General practitioner Nathan said: 'The staff at GOSH are fantastic and they make his visits very relaxed for him. Theo Carnie looks delighted with his cake after it has came out of the over but sadly he won't be able to try it . 'He just carries on and smiles, and it’s the best place for him to be because of all the research they do. 'We have been through a massive amount which I would not wish on anyone but it has to be worked out what is best for him, and that’s what they are fantastic at doing. 'We are lucky that we are in the best hospital in the country.' Mrs Carnie added: 'Theo is so amazing because he just gets on with it and he has such a massive zest for life and loves his friends and family. 'He doesn’t get upset and he doesn’t make a big deal out of it. He’s an incredible little boy.","Theo Carnie cannot eat normal foods and is fed through a tube daily .

"A school's 'therapy' dog has died after being left in a hot car for six hours because of a 'staff mix-up'. Ruby the labrador was used to help lower-ability pupils at Sittingbourne Community College in Kent. The much loved dog's owner Dave Carden, 53, a PE teacher, would drive her in and leave her in his car for another teacher to collect and take into class. A 'therapy' dog has died after being left in a hot car for six hours because of a 'staff mix-up' at Sittingbourne College in Kent . But on Tuesday - the hottest day of the year so far - she was not collected. It has been reported she remained in the car between 8am and 2.35pm while outside temperatures rose to the 20C mark. Ruby (not pictured) remained in the car between 8am and 2.35pm while outside temperatures rose to the 20C mark . By the time Mr Carden spotted her, five year-old Ruby was dead, and despite rushing with his pet to the vets, there was nothing they could do to save her. Ruby had been used at the school up to three times a week since 2010 -  to provide additional support in lessons for lower-ability pupils. Jon Whitcombe, principal of Swale Academy Trust which runs the college, said many pupils had been devastated by the ""tragic accident"". He said: 'Ruby was a much-loved member of the school community and died in what can only be described as a tragic accident. 'We've got a number of very upset pupils and staff and we're trying our best to provide the necessary support to those concerned.' The RSPCA has launched an investigation and a spokeswoman said: 'We received calls about this incident - from members of the public rather than the police. 'We are currently looking into the matter, so cannot say more about the specific incident at present.' Ruby was presented with a young carers' community award in 2011.","Dog used to help pupils at Sittingbourne Community College, in Kent .

"Marco Reus scored one goal and set up another as Borussia Dortmund recovered from going a goal behind in 53 seconds to beat Mainz and climb out of the Bundesliga drop zone. Germany international midfielder Reus was cheered by home fans for signing a new deal on Tuesday, but the celebrations were cut short when Elkin Soto opened the scoring in the first minute. Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller failed to clear and Soto lobbed the ball into an empty net from the edge of the box. Under pressure Jurgen Klopp celebrates on the touchline as Dortmund secure much-needed victory on Friday night . Borussia Dortmund moved up to 14th in the Bundesliga after victory . Reus almost equalised a minute later in a furious start to the game but his powerful shot rattled the post. Mainz's reserve keeper Stefanos Kapino, making his first Bundesliga start, did well to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but Neven Subotic levelled five minutes after the restart. The Serbian defender beat his marker to head in a corner and spark wild celebrations among the home fans who had whistled the team off at halftime. Dortmund, who take on Juventus in the Champions League last 16 later this month, then turned the game around with Reus charging through to beat Kapino after Kevin Kampl's fine assist.

Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc added: 'It was difficult after going behind in the first minute to a goal that belongs in a comedy routine.

"Atlanta fire rescue department chief Kelvin Cochran has been suspended for 30 days over a controversial book on Christian values, in which he claims homosexuality is a form of perversion. The book authored by Cochran denounces same-sex relationships, at one point equating homosexuality to bestiality and calling it 'vile, vulgar and inappropriate'. Mayor Kasim Reed's spokesperson Anne Torres said the administration did not know about 'Who Told You That You Are Naked?' until complaints were made by employees last week. Atlanta fire rescue department chief Kelvin Cochran has been suspended for 30 days over his book . Reed's office has now suspended Cochran for one month without pay and opened an investigation to determine whether the chief discriminated against employees, WSB-TV reported. The mayor said he was 'deeply disturbed' by the sentiments Cochran expressed in his book and said he will 'not tolerate discrimination of any kind' in his administration. 'I want to be clear that the material in Chief Cochran's book is not representative of my personal beliefs, and is inconsistent with the administration's work to make Atlanta a more welcoming city for all of her citizens - regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race and religious beliefs,' he said in a statement. The book denounces same-sex relationships, calling them 'vile, vulgar and inappropriate' In the 162-page book, Cochran identifies himself as Atlanta's fire chief and says his first priority in that role is to run the department 'to cultivate its culture to the glory of God'. A copy of the book obtained by WSB-TV showed included a passage reading, 'since God made sex for procreation, he only intended it to be between a man and a woman'. Cochran continued by  saying that those who live without God's purpose 'pursue sexual fulfillment through multiple partners, with the opposite sex, same sex and sex outside of marriage and many other vile, vulgar and inappropriate ways'. He later defined terms such as 'uncleanness' as: 'whatever is opposite of purity; including sodomy, homosexuality, lesbianism, pederasty, bestiality, and all other forms of sexual perversion'. 'One of the most alarming things is that we did not know about the book when it was published,' Ms Torres added. 'We understand that he was distributing the book to other employees. We are still not sure what the circumstances surrounding them are.' In the 162-page book, Cochran identifies himself as Atlanta's fire chief and says his first priority in that role is to run the department 'to cultivate its culture to the glory of God' The fire chief has since been ordered to undergo sensitivity training and barred from distributing copies of the book on city property, after a number of employees said they received them in the workplace. District 6 Council member Alex Wan, who is openly gay, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that while Cochran is free to express his personal views, they should be left outside the office as they could create a hostile environment. He said: 'First and foremost, I respect each individual's right to have their own thoughts, beliefs and opinions, but when you're a city employee, and those thoughts, beliefs and opinions are different from the city's, you have to check them at the door.'

"A green-fingered grandfather spent 25 years creating a beautiful garden on a 'borrowed' patch of barren wasteland. Des Churchill, 88, has plowed more than £10,000 into the L-shaped piece of land which belongs to a housing association, because his first floor flat in Llantrisant, Wales, does not have a garden. Fortunately RCT Homes, the housing association which owns the property and garden in partnership with Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, approves of the pensioner’s efforts. Scroll down for video . Hard at work: Des Churchill, 88, spent 25 years turning the piece of wasteland by his flat into a spectacular garden because the first floor property did not come with a garden . Mr Churchill has spent more than £10,000 on colourful flowers for garden by his flat in Llantrisant, Wales . Grandfather Des Churchill beside just some of the flowers he has planted on a patch of wasteland next to his first floor flat, which is owned by a housing association. Fortunately they have praised the pensioner's efforts . Mr Churchill said: ‘They like what I have done - everyone has been behind me all the way.’ ‘My neighbours love the garden and say it really brightens up the flats.’ When retired coal miner Mr Churchill moved into the flat in 1988 the land was an uncared for patch of grass. He said: ‘When I moved into the flat there were no plants and flowers, just a scruffy bit of grass.’ Mr Churchill set to work immediately and planted a golden privet hedge and ornamental maple tree. Mr Churchill, a former coal miner, started off by planting a hedge (left) and then turned his attentions to flowers . He said: ‘Everything you see growing I bought and planted. ‘Green fingers run in the family - my brother was a farmer and we’ve always had a garden to look after.’ And his efforts have paid off because his gardening skills have bagged him prizes in local gardening competitions such as the annual Rhondda Cynon Taff garden contest. After transforming the wasteland into a beautiful garden, Des Churchill has won local horticultural contests . Having spent 35 years working in the mines, Mr Churchill likes to spend as much time as possible outdoors . Mr Churchill, who lives with wife Olive, 86, also grows fruit and vegetables on the plot which he shares with his neighbours who have been happy to lend a hand too. He said: ‘Everyone seems to enjoy it. When my petrol mower conked out the neighbours clubbed together to by me a new one.’ Mr Churchill, who spent 30 years underground as a miner in the Welsh valleys, now prefers the great outdoors. He said: ‘I have to be outside. I am out here for at least two or three hours every day - if it’s raining I go in the shed and tidy up. Even when it's raining Mr Churchill goes outside to his garden shed to potter around and tend to the plants . ‘I can’t bend on my knees so I have tools that mean I can garden while standing up. ‘The biggest challenges I have are the weather and selecting the right plants to grow.’Olive, his wife of 66 years, said: ‘I’m very proud of what Des has created. ‘He’s out there all the time, but I don’t mind - sometimes if he’s under my feet I send him back out.’ Neighbour Shirley Corlea, who has contributed plants and a bench for the garden, added: ‘It’s a pleasure to see all his hard work come out in bloom at this time of year.’ Neighbourhood Officer Allyson Whiston from RCT Homes said she looked forward to seeing the garden grow over the coming years. She said: 'I don’t think I’ve ever seen such beautiful and well-cared for communal gardens. 'The neighbours take so much pleasure out of this wonderful garden that Des has created. 'Everyone comments on how beautiful it is and how it is having such a positive impact on their lives.'","Des Churchill was disappointed he didn't have a garden when he moved in .

"Fans of the iPhone have apparently been given a sneak peak at the latest model after images of the mobile's packaging was leaked online. While it may not look all that different from the iPhone5, Apple's latest offering appears to have a thin silver ring around the home button. The images appear to confirm rumours that the new model has an embedded fingerprint sensor in the home button and will be called the iPhone5S. This image was leaked earlier in the week by Chinese website C Technology. It was believed to be Apple's new iPhone 5S and appears to show a thin silver ring around the home button believed to be a fingerprint reader . They were leaked by Chinese site C Technology ahead of the phones' official launch on September 10. The high-end handset's sensor is said to be able to identify the owner by his or her fingerprints - making them a lot more secure than at present. Code uncovered describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'. It is believed the silver metal around the home button may form part of the censor. Fox News anchor Clayton Morris has previously claimed that the upcoming iPhone 5S would 'have a silver ring around it'. He also claimed the new phone could be up to 31 per cent faster than the iPhone5. Mr Morris said the iPhone 5S will include a fast A7 processor to make the phone noticeably faster than the latest model currently available. He tweeted: 'Sources are telling me the new iPhone's A7 chip is running at about 31% faster than A6. I’m hearing it’s very fast.' In another interview he added: 'I’ve also heard there’s a separate chip devoted to motion tracking. Should be an interesting camera upgrade.' According to 9to5Mac Apple is testing 64-bit A7 processors in its prototypes, which would give the phone much better performance per watt and let it handle animated graphics more smoothly. If the company can deliver a faster smartphone, it will once again put them on a level pegging with Samsung's popular high-end smartphones. Experts have speculated that the same processor will probably be included in the nextiPad. Apple's eagerly anticipated new smartphone, the iPhone 5S could be 31 percent faster than the current iPhone 5 model, according to rumours .","Images of the 'new iPhone 5S' were leaked on Chinese site C Technology .

"Liz Cheney has confirmed she is dropping out of the Senate primary after her upstart bid to unseat Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi ignited a war within the Republican Party and caused a feud with her lesbian sister. Ms Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, confirmed her decision to quit in a statement released this morning, blaming family 'health issues'. She said: 'Serious health issues have recently arisen in our family, and under the circumstances, I have decided to discontinue my campaign. 'My children and their futures were the motivation for our campaign and their health and well-being will always be my overriding priority.' Out: Liz Cheney, pictured in July, is dropping out of the Senate primary after her upstart bid to unseat Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi ignited a war within the Republican Party and caused a feud with her lesbian sister . She did not specify what health issues have come up or which of her five children- three girls and two boys- have been affected. The last time they were seen publicly was when Ms Cheney posted a picture of the whole family on Christmas Eve. 'Phil and I want to thank the . thousands of people in Wyoming and all across the country who have . supported my campaign,' she said in the statement. 'As a mother and a patriot, I know that the work of defending freedom and protecting liberty must continue for each generation. Though this campaign stops today, my commitment to keep fighting with you and your families for the fundamental values that have made this nation and Wyoming great will never stop.' Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, a longtime friend of the Cheney family, spoke to Liz Cheney this morning (Mon) and said she sounded 'very calm, very deliberate'. He said that the Cheney family had meeting over Christmas and Liz's sister Mary was there too despite their past differences. During the get-together was when Mrs Cheney made up her mind.Mr Simpson said: 'She told me they were talking about family and friends and that's what this is all about. 'She said: 'For me, it's a mum thing, it's about having five beautiful children. They need me and I need them'. Mr Simpson did not know the exact cause of the medical emergency. He added that Mrs Cheney's candidacy had led to things being 'tense' between the two of them and he hoped they could become close once again - Mr Simpson has known her since she was eight. Ms Cheney's campaign has been fraught from the moment she entered the race with an announcement on YouTube in the summer. Family first: Cheney's last Tweet, posted on Christmas Eve, featured a picture of she and her husband with their five children . Her decision to challenge Mr Enzi, a popular Senator with a basically blemish-free conservative voting record, angered the party. One of the biggest criticisms of Ms Cheney came as she was painted as a carpetbagger after only moving to the state in 2012 from Virginia. Problems first arose in August after local media revealed that Ms Cheney managed to obtain a fishing license despite having not lived in the state for at least a year, as the law stipulates. In spite of the logistical location issues, her very public spat with her sister, Mary, was the focus point. Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne said in a statement that they were 'pained' over the public dispute in November between their two daughters over their differing views on gay marriage. A week earlier, Ms Cheney had reaffirmed her disapproval . of gay marriage on Fox News despite having a legally-married lesbian . sister. Daughter: Ms Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, left, had begun telling associates of her decision over the weekend, CNN reported late Sunday . 'This is an issue we have dealt with . privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,' Dick Cheney and his wife said in a joint statement. Mary Cheney and her . wife Heather Poe, who she married in 2012, both took to social media on to blast the candidate. 'Liz - this isn't just an issue on which . we disagree - you're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history,' Mary Cheney wrote. In a separate Facebook post, Heather Poe called her sister-in-law's comments 'offensive.' 'Liz . has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with . our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 - she didn't . hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us,' Poe wrote on the social . media site. 'To have her now say she doesn't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.' Sisters at war: The Wyoming candidate for senate Liz Cheney, left, announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage angering her gay married sister, Mary Cheney, right . The statement from the former vice president and his wife also appeared to be an attempt to bolster Ms Cheney's run for the Wyoming Senate seat. 'One thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She . has also always treated her sister and her sister's family with love and . respect, exactly as she should have done,' said the couple. Liz Cheney was asked on Fox News if she was flip-flopping on her gay marriage stance. Host Chris Wallace pointed out that while she had opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, she had also supporting the State Department's plan to offer benefits to same-sex employees and their partners. 'It's not, and I stand by both of those positions,' Ms Cheney said. 'I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. 'If people are in a same-sex . relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health . benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance, . there's no reason we shouldn't do that. Pained: In November, Dick Cheney, right, and his wife Lynne, center, said in a statement that they were 'pained' over the public dispute between their two daughters over their differing views on gay marriage . Not backing down: Liz Cheney reasserted her stance against gay marriage in November despite having a legally-married lesbian sister . 'I also don't support amending the Constitution on this issue. I do believe it's an issue that's got to be left up to the states. I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage,' Ms Cheney added. In September her sister Mary Cheney, who legally married her longtime partner Heather Poe in Washington in 2012 and has two daughters, wrote on Facebook saying her sister's stance on gay marriage was 'dead wrong'. 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.' Liz Cheney responded to that message soon after, saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue 'on which we disagree'. Ms Cheney's strong stance on the issue of gay marriage may have had something to do with her bid to win the senate race in ultra-conservative Wyoming. Partner: Mary Cheney wed her longtime partner Heather Poe, left, in 2012. They are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks . 'I am not pro-gay marriage,' Ms Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign. 'I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.' This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile father. Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance. 'Lynne . and I have a gay daughter, so it's an issue our family is very familiar . with,' Mr Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while . stumping in Iowa in 2004. 'With . the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is . freedom means freedom for everyone.

"Britain will need millions more immigrants to cope with an ageing population, the official economic watchdog warned today. The Office for Budget Responsibility said that opening the doors to an extra 140,000 every year for five decades would boost employment and bolster the public finances. It also warned that pressure on the UK’s healthcare system caring for older people means an extra £19 billion of spending cuts or tax hikes will be needed. Open door policy: Without high levels of migration to Britain, public debt will balloon to become larger than the entire economy, the Office for Budget Responsibility said . Urgent action is needed or the gains made by George Osborne’s spending cuts will be wiped out by increased spending on the elderly, the OBR said. Health, pension and social care costs are already equivalent to 14 per cent of Britain’s economy but by 2062-63 it will rise to almost 20 per cent. The OBR argues that allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into Britain each year – totalling 7million over 50 years – would fill jobs and raise taxes for Treasury coffers. ‘Our sensitivity analysis shows that overall migration has a positive impact on the sustainability of the public finances over our 50 year horizon,’ the OBR said. It said that if there is a steady flow of immigrants into Britain, government borrowing would rise to 99 per cent of GDP. But if there is a bar on immigration, borrowing would hit 174 per cent. ‘These results are driven by the assumed age structure of net migration, which tends to be more concentrated in the working age group and hence reduces the dependency ratio throughout the projection period.’ Warning: Gains made by George Osborne's spending cuts could be wiped out by increased pressure on the public finances from Britain's ageing population . However, David Cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ and last year the number of immigrants fell by 89,000 to 153,00. Without action to address the burden of an ageing population, the UK will be left with a £65 billion hole in its finances, according to the OBR. In its annual fiscal sustainability report, it said: ‘It is clear that longer-term spending pressures, if unaddressed, would put the public finances on an unsustainable path.’ ‘Public sector net debt would approach 100 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and still be rising,’ it added. The OBR said the move to a single-tier state pension had slightly eased the pressure on public sector debt, but added that spending on healthcare was the biggest spending pressure over the next 50 years. The OBR said the cost of the state pension was predicted to rise from 5.8 per cent of GDP to 8.4 per cent of GDP as the population ages, even with the introduction of the new flat rate payment system and increase in retirement age to 67 taken into account. Healthcare spending is expected to increase from 7 per cent of GDP to 8.8 per cent of GDP, while long-term social care costs are set to rise from 1.3 per cent of GDP to 2.4 per cent of GDP. The OBR also warned that declining North Sea oil reserves will take its toll, with oil and gas revenues expected to plunge from 0.4 per cent of GDP now to almost negligible levels - at 0.03 per cent of GDP by 2040. But action taken so far by the Government, including an extra year of spending cuts to 2017-18 and the single tier state pension, is helping to offset some of the pressures, the report added. The Office for Budget Responsibility's Robert Chote warned of 'huge uncertainties around the scale of the challenge' of dealing with the costs of more elderly people . Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR, said on presenting the report: ‘Since last year, the underlying deficit and debt path look less favourable. ‘But this and the costs of long-term care reform are likely to be offset by the Government's announcement of additional spending cuts in 2017-18 and savings from the single tier pension. ‘That said, there are huge uncertainties around the scale of the challenge and the UK is certainly not alone in confronting it.’ He added that the extra £19 billion needed to get borrowing back on track could be spread over the next 50 years rather than action taken in one go. In a written statement, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the OBR's report shows that without the steps taken over the past year, public borrowing would be around 50 per cent of GDP higher in 50 years' time. He added that the report identifies the extra spending cuts as ‘one of the key factors in containing the growth of spending over the long-term, demonstrating the importance of the Government's programme of fiscal consolidation for the long-term health of the public finances’.","140,000 extra immigrants to the UK are needed every year until 2063 .

"Freedom of movement: Royal Horticultural Society has agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the Chelsea Flower Show . It is a controversial and flagrant display of discrimination that has plagued one of Britain’s most august institutions for decades. But now the 208-year-old Royal Horticultural Society has caved in to public pressure – and finally agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the Chelsea Flower Show. Officials had previously been accused of taking a snobbish attitude to the ornaments, which many deride as ‘tacky’. But this year, on the 100th anniversary of the show, gnomes are not only to be allowed into the grounds – but will be positively celebrated. Celebrities will be invited to decorate the diminutive gentlemen... and a parade of 150 of them will be lined up for official inspection by the Queen. The U-turn marks a victory for green-fingered rebels who had taken to smuggling gnomes into their displays at the prestigious event. RHS director-general Sue Biggs admitted ‘there were a few raised eyebrows’ when the rules were overturned last month, explaining: ‘We are a learned society and a purveyor of excellence in horticulture.’ But she said that the society’s 17-member ruling council was unanimous in voting through the change, adding: ‘It is important for people to realise we have got a sense of humour and we don’t take ourselves too seriously. There was not one gnomophobe on the council.’ Previous years have seen placard-bearing protesters at the gates of the flower show, demanding ‘equal rights for gnomes’. The . most high-profile dissident was Jekka McVicar, a 13-time Chelsea gold . medallist who was rebuked for sneaking her 8in lucky mascot, Borage, . into her display in 2009, defying the ban on ‘brightly coloured . creatures’. Once unloved: Gnome protestors outside the Royal Hospital after being denied access to the 2005 Chelsea Flower Show . On hearing the rule had been overturned, a delighted Mrs McVicar said: ‘It’s great news. I am so excited I’m going to give Borage a new jacket. It’s beige at the moment but it’s going to be bright green with pink spots. There’s no need for camouflage any more. ‘It really shows how far the RHS has evolved. When Borage was spotted in my garden, it caused a real stir and I was met with a lot of stony silences from colleagues. But it really is harmless fun. At last the RHS has grown up and recognised that garden gnomes are for all.’ Ann Atkin, who owns 2,000 gnomes at her Gnome Reserve in Devon, added: ‘It’s about time Chelsea allowed them. I’ve seen plastic  windmills at Chelsea, so why not gnomes? They’re much nicer.  Some people are so snobbish about gnomes.’ RHS officials were previously branded ‘stuffy old gits’ for the ban. The official explanation was that the ornaments might distract from the horticultural displays – although the suspicion was always that they were considered too tacky. Gnome celebration: On the Chelsea Flower Show's 100th anniversary of the show gnomes will be positively celebrated . However, gnomes were not always held in such low regard. When first introduced to Britain they were expensive collectors’ items. They are believed to have been brought to Britain in 1867, when gardener Sir Charles Isham brought 21 earthenware figurines from Germany for the grounds of Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Sir Charles was a spiritualist who believed they had protective powers. But gnomes lost their cachet when they were made from plastic. Although the RHS has relaxed its ‘no gnomes’ rule for this year’s flower show – which runs from May 21 to 25 – other items will remain on its prohibited list, including fairies and pixies, balloons and flags. Stars decorating gnomes at the show include Downton Abbey writer Lord Fellowes. They will be sold in aid of the RHS campaign to install more gardens in schools.","Royal Horticultural Society has lifted the ban on show's centenary year .

Team news: Germany defender Mats Hummels is expected to be available for selection despite missing the second half against Brazil as a precaution because of tendonitis. Argentina winger Angel Di Maria is a doubt after pulling out of training on Saturday with a suspected thigh injury. Striker Sergio Aguero has fully recovered from a muscle strain and could replace Ezequiel Lavezzi or Gonzalo Higuain. Left-back Marcos Rojo did not complete training on Friday due to a sore ankle but he should be fine for the final. Key clash: Toni Kroos (Germany) v Javier Mascherano (Argentina) Two Golden Ball nominees come face-to-face here and Mascherano must ensure Kroos cannot keep Germany ticking. This game could be decided by just one goal with La Albiceleste’s talisman Lionel Messi unlikely to get much space - so Argentina’s defence, which has not conceded since the group stage, will be vital. VIDEO Team Profile: Germany highlights . Key battle: Golden Ball nominees Toni Kroos (left) and Javier Mascherano come face-to-face on Sunday . One to watch: Manuel Neuer (Germany) The giant Bayern Munich ‘keeper has been in fine form so far at the World Cup and another good performance will likely win him the Golden Gloves award.

They have won just one of their last four appearances in the World Cup final (1990 v Argentina). Record breaker: Germany's Miroslav Klose has scored more World Cup goals than any other player in history . Star man: Argentina's Lionel Messi (centre) controls the ball as he prepares for the World Cup final . The last time Germany scored in a World Cup match and lost was the 1994 quarter final defeat to Bulgaria (1-2). Germany are unbeaten in 17 internationals (W12, D5). Argentina haven't been trailing in any of their six games at the 2014 World Cup, Germany just eight minutes (v Ghana). Argentina have won four out of five penalty shootouts at the World Cup, Germany won four out of four (including the one against Argentina in 2006). Miroslav Klose has scored more World Cup goals than any other player in history and as many as the entire current Argentinian squad (16). Only Lothar Matthäus (25) has played more World Cup games than Klose (23, as many as Paolo Maldini). Klose is the only player in both squads who has already played in a World Cup final (2002, 0-2 v Brazil). Argentina's Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo lead the way in terms of crosses attempted from open play, with Rojo's haul of 25 so far bettered only by team-mate di Maria (32). Thomas Müller has played a hand in 16 World Cup goals in 12 appearances at the finals (10 goals and six assists). Müller (2010 and 2014) and Klose (2002 and 2006) are the only players in history to score 5+ goals at consecutive World Cup tournaments. Eye on the ball: Germany's Thomas Muller trains at Estadio Vasco da Gama on Saturday . Müller is the first-ever Golden Boot winner to reproduce his number of goals at the following World Cup (five goals in 2010, five in 2014). Müller could also become the first player ever to win the Golden Boot at successive World Cups. Lionel Messi has been the most creative player at World Cup 2014, setting up a tournament-high 21 goal-scoring chances for team-mates. Messi has embarked on a tournament-high 65 dribbles so far, completing (another-high) 39 of them. No German player has created more chances for their teammates in the 2014 World Cup than Mesut Özil (15). Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano has attempted a competition-high 509 passes so far. Mascherano has also made the most tackles so far - 28. Andre Schürrle has scored three times in just 156 minutes of action so far at this World Cup. Only Tim Howard (27) has made more saves in the competition than Manuel Neuer (23). Lionel Messi has scored five World Cup goals to date, but none of them in the knockout stages. Angel di Maria or Sami Khedira will become the 10th player to win both the Champions League and the World Cup in the same season. Seven of the previous nine have been German (Bayern Munich 1974) along with Christian Karembeu in 1998 and Roberto Carlos in 2002.

"Junk food firms should be banned from running TV commercials before 9pm, say health experts . Junk food firms should be banned from running TV commercials before 9pm to help prevent parents from being hounded by their children, say health experts. The call comes from the British Heart Foundation, which says current controls are weak with the result parents are under pressure to give youngsters unhealthy food and sugary drinks. Seven in ten parents with children aged four to 16 have been pestered by their children to buy junk food they have seen advertised on TV, according to a new survey by the charity. The move to ban commercials for products high in fat, sugar and salt before 9pm has support of doctors and the Labour party, which is expected to put the plan into its General Election manifesto. Almost one in three children are overweight or obese with children from poorer households almost twice as likely to fall into this category as those from the most affluent families. The BHF said obese children are more likely to become obese adults, putting them at greater risk of a coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers in later life. The TV regulator Ofcom introduced restrictions on junk food advertising during programmes specifically targeted at children in 2007. However, it subsequently found that that this only reduced exposure to advertising of unhealthy food for children by 37per cent, and for older children (10-15 year olds) by just 22per cent. The same research found television advertising can impact on children’s food preferences, consumption and behaviour, and that younger children in particular cannot distinguish advertising from entertainment. The BHF poll found more than two fifths – 43per cent - of parents with children aged 4 to 16 say they are badgered by their children at least once a week. Almost one in three children are overweight or obese with children from poorer households almost twice as likely to fall into this category as those from the most affluent families . Almost two fifths said they think junk food adverts on TV make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet. The BHF believes that this survey highlights the urgent need to close legal loopholes in the UK’s regulatory system which mean companies are free to promote unhealthy food and drink products to children both online and on TV during popular family TV shows. The group’s director of policy, Mike Hobday, said: ‘Regulations for TV and online advertising in the UK are weak. Loopholes in the system mean that every day millions of children are exposed to sophisticated marketing techniques specifically designed to lure them into unhealthy eating habits. ‘This evidence shows that junk food ads are having a detrimental impact on children’s behaviour and are hindering parents’ efforts to get their children to eat healthily. ‘We cannot allow companies to continue exploiting holes in the system at the expense of our children’s health. The Government must act now to help give children a stronger chance at fending off future heart disease.’ The idea of a ban before the 9pm TV watershed has been condemned by the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (above), who said that ‘banning and legislation not always the answer’ The policy is also supported by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which said: ‘Only a ban on advertising before the 9pm watershed would prevent children from viewing unhealthy content during family orientated programming. ‘Children of all ages are still exposed to a large amount of unhealthy food and drink advertising via popular all-ages programmes, such as soaps or reality shows. ‘While parents and those that care for children have a role to play in the food that their children consume, the food manufacturing industry have a major influence in terms of marketing and pricing.’ The idea of a ban before the 9pm TV watershed has been condemned by the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said that ‘banning and legislation not always the answer’ and that ‘backing families to make better choices brings lasting change’. The trade body which speaks for advertising companies, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, said there is no such thing as junk food, only junk diets. Spokesman, Ian Twinn, said: ‘There is room for concern about childhood and adult obesity and levels of people being overweight. Sadly the debate then breaks down for two simple reasons. First, campaigners seem convinced that foods can be called ‘junk’, very few foods are. ‘Secondly, the prescribed solutions, usually ad bans or exiling ads to late night, are placebos, which if taken seriously will not make people thin. ‘We need to continue educating children and parents on the issues of a healthy and responsible diet. The advertising industry is committed to this, but are the campaigners?’ Nick Court, of the Food & Drink Federation, said: ‘In the UK we have one of the strictest advertising regulatory regimes in the world concerning the foods that can be advertised to children on TV. ‘These rules are comprehensively adhered to and enforced. Many companies go even further, developing their own responsible marketing guidelines and making voluntary commitments.’","Seven in ten parents with children aged four to 16 face pressure from kids .

"Player of the Year: Luis Suarez (Liverpool).Young Player of the Year: Eden Hazard (Chelsea).Women's Player of the Year: Lucy Bronze (Liverpool Ladies).Women's Young Player of the Year: Martha Harris (Liverpool Ladies). Luis Suarez was named PFA Player of the Year on Sunday night in recognition of his astonishing 30 Premier League goals this season, which have helped catapult Liverpool into the title race. The award caps a remarkable turnaround for the striker, who was banned for 10 games at the end of the last campaign after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. However, having missed the first six matches of this season, Suarez returned to the Liverpool side at the end of September and formed an incredible partnership with Daniel Sturridge - the pair have hit 50 Premier League goals so far.

Suarez, who played as Liverpool lost 2-0 to Chelsea at Anfield hours before the ceremony, said: 'The Premier League is full of really . great players and so it is a great honour when these players recognise . your work on the pitch. 'I always try my best for the team and it is nice . to get awards but really this is for my team-mates and the staff at Liverpool because without their help I wouldn't have this prize.' Chelsea forward Eden Hazard, who scooped . the Young Player of the Year award, came second in the main vote, . while Manchester City talisman Yaya Toure came third.

'He . is a brilliant talent. I think the supporters have seen him mature over . the course of the last season,' Rodgers said of Suarez on Friday. 'I . think he was in a real low moment after that game (against Chelsea last . year) but he has gone away and probably looked in the mirror and . reflected on himself because he is not that type of guy and it probably . just spilled over. 'He is a really intelligent man who fits the values of this club, which is all about humility, class and he has all of that.

"At least 14 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded after a powerful car bomb ripped through a southern suburb of the capital of Lebanon. Dozens of others were trapped in burning cars and buildings following the blast in Beirut. The violence is being linked to the conflict in neighbouring Syria, officials have said. The blast was the second such explosion in just over a month in southern Beirut, which is an overwhelmingly Shia area controlled by Hezbollah. Lebanese emergency workers attempt to tackle the flames at the site of a car bomb in southern Beirut . At least 14 have been killed and more than 200 injured in the explosion . Dozens of ambulances rushed to the scene of the explosion and firefighters were seen using ladders trying to evacuate residents from burning buildings . It is the deadliest attack in decades against the neighbourhoods which are considered bastions of support for Hezbollah. Groups opposed to Syria's President Bashar Assad have threatened to retaliate against Hezbollah for intervening on behalf of his regime in the conflict. Lebanese TV showed raging fires and thick black smoke from the blast, which set cars and buildings on fire. Dozens of ambulances rushed to the scene of the explosion and firefighters were seen using ladders in an attempt to evacuate residents from burning buildings. Dozens of people were trapped in burning cars and buildings following the blast in Beirut, it has been reported . The violence is being linked to the conflict in neighbouring Syria, officials have said . The state-run National News Agency said at least 14 died and 212 were wounded. The army, in a statement, said the explosion was caused by a car blast. It called on residents to cooperate with security forces trying to evacuate people trapped in their homes. The explosion occurred on a commercial and residential street in the Rweiss district, close to the Sayyed al-Shuhada complex where Hezbollah holds rallies. Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has lived in hiding since his group's 2006 month-long war with Israel, made a rare public appearance at the complex on August 2, where he addressed hundreds of supporters. Lebanese soldiers and residents gather at the site of the explosion . The blast, the second such explosion in just over a month in southern Beirut, set cars and buildings on fire . A car bomb exploded in the nearby Beir al-Abed district last month, wounding more than 50 people. Today's attack was the worst explosion in southern Beirut since a 1985 truck bomb assassination attempt targeting top Shia cleric Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah. That blast in Beir al-Abed left 80 people dead. An Associated Press photographer saw at least two bodies and many wounded people at the scene of the explosion today. Panicked Hezbollah fighters fired in the air to clear the area. Sunni-Shia tensions have risen sharply in Lebanon, particularly since Hezbollah raised its profile by openly fighting alongside Assad's forces. Burned-out cars and shops are seen at the site of a car bomb explosion in southern Beirut . Lebanese Sunnis support the rebels fighting to topple Assad, a member of a Shia offshoot sect. Syria-based rebels and militant Islamist groups have threatened to target Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for its increasingly overt role in Syria. The group's fighters played a key role in a recent regime victory in the town of Qusair near the Lebanese border, and Syrian activists say they are now aiding a regime offensive in the besieged city of Homs. Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Ammar called it a 'terrorist' attack and called for restraint among the group's supporters. He suggested the group's political rivals in Lebanon were responsible for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such attacks. Lebanon is sharply split along sectarian lines and among supporters and opponents of Assad's regime. Politicians within Lebanon's Western-backed coalition have slammed the group for its involvement in Syria and called for its disarmament. The explosion is the deadliest attack in decades against the neighbourhoods which are considered bastions of support for Hezbollah .","More than 200 injured and dozens were trapped in cars and buildings .

"AC Milan have renewed their interest in Adel Taarabt after being priced out of a move for Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa. Taarabt spent the second half of last season on loan at the San Siro and was hoping to seal a permanent move to Serie A. However, his dreams appeared to be dashed after the Rossoneri were put off by his £65,000-per-week wage packet. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Harry Redknapp on Loic Remy's failed move to Liverpool .

Milan turned their attention to Ben Arfa instead, but have baulked at United's £12million asking price. And now the Italians have reignited their interest in Taarabt, who has been offered a lifeline at QPR despite being slammed by boss Harry Redknapp over his poor fitness levels. The former Spurs youngster was included in the 20-man squad that travelled to Dublin on Thursday afternoon. But Jack Collison's hopes of earning a deal at Loftus Road look slim after the former West Ham midfielder was omitted from the group that face friendlies against Shamrock Rovers and Athlone Town. Uncertain future: Jack Collison was left out of the 20-man squad . Meanwhile, Republic of Ireland defender Richard Dunne has announced his retirement from international football. The 34-year-old QPR player made his debut for his country in 2000, going on to win 80 caps, the last of which came against Kazakhstan last October. Dunne told his club's official website: 'Retiring from international football has been an extremely difficult decision for me to make. 'I have represented Ireland since I was 15 years of age, and have thoroughly enjoyed all the highs and lows that have come with playing for my country.

"Two guard dogs that protected Prince William as he worked for the RAF have been destroyed within days of his final shift. Brus, a Belgian shepherd, and Blade, a German shepherd, were put down after the prince left his role as a search and rescue pilot in North Wales.

Protected: Prince William's two RAF guard dogs, Belgium shepherd Brus, pictured right, and German shepherd Blade were destroyed on Friday just a few days after he left the service .

The Duke of Cambridge finished his last shift at the RAF Valley in Anglesey last Tuesday. It is believed that the two dogs were put down on Friday – but last night the MoD said the timing was ‘entirely coincidental’. A spokesman stressed that the prince did not work with the dogs, which were used to provide extra security at the base. ‘The department’s policy is to re-home all military working dogs at the end of their  service life wherever practicable,’ he said. ‘Regrettably, however, there are occasions when they have to be put down. 'This action is only ever taken as a last resort. Unfortunately in this case the dogs were unsuitable for re-homing or alternative  duties and so sadly, for the animal’s welfare, they had to be put down.’ An RAF source said: ‘To be clear they were RAF Valley security patrol dogs, not sole protection for Prince William. The timing of their sad demise is purely coincidental. 'These dogs had played an invaluable role offering security to our personnel over many years and were much loved by their handlers, who had an extremely strong bond with them. ‘Sadly these dogs had a record of veterinary and behavioural issues which meant that they could not be reassigned to other duties and they were too aggressive to be kept at home.’ A spokesman for the prince declined to comment.

"The wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has caused outrage after posting happy snaps of her charity work on Instagram. British-born Asma al-Assad is seen preparing and serving food to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers. In what appeared to be a bid to win back favour across the clone, al-Assad opened the Instagram account in July, but it did not take long before it backfired. Backfire: Syrian first-lady Asma posted pictures of herself volunteering at a mobile kitchen, serving refugees which were not kindly received . Eyes closed: Asma al-Assad's Instagram posts have been seen as an act of ignorance of the sufferings of the Syrian people . The Syrian president waves to crowds in pictures posted to Instagram, despite the horrific war sweeping the country . Although some users comment on Mrs al-Assad's 'beautiful soul' a majority of the comments are less forgiving. 'I love ur designer clothes and shoes ... paid for by the blood of your people! Seriously, u make Marie Antoinette look like an angel compared to you!,' wrote one Instagram user. Others comment on the 'hypocrisy' of Mrs al-Assad being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year Syrian war. To this date, more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the conflict since it started in 2011.

Nadim Houry, deputy director for Human . Rights Watch in the Middle East and East Africa, said Al-Assad's .

"She doesn’t seem to like the ubiquitous children’s entertainment company’s notion of beauty, but an artist recently used her impressive drawing skills to illustrate everything that goes into creating a Disney princess. Say hello to the Disney Girls Tutorial, a step-by-step guide to building the perfect Disney princess. Posted to deviantART by user Oceanstarlet, the guide, as it were, opens with question. Who's the fairest? deviantART user oceanstarlet, AKA Meridith Viguet, posted a tongue-in-cheek but highly educational tutorial on drawing Disney princesses . ‘Ever wanted to draw a Disney-style chick, but she ended up looking like a deformed Paris Hilton bobblehead?’ If so, Oceanstarlet can solve your problems. In what may or may not be a jab at Disney’s uncommonly perfect and anatomically unattainable take on a young woman’s bodily and facial proportions, the artist uses her tutorial to guide the viewer through each and every facet of the Disney princess’s person that she believes makes them too good to be true all while showing exactly how bring them to life . Figured it out: Tips include not giving your princess hips or muscles of any kind. And the result is highly believable . First on Oceanstarlet’s check list is the Disney princess body type. In a comparison with what she calls a regular woman’s figure, the Disney example of Jasmine—the princess from Aladdin—looks toothpick thin and waistless with feet that are ‘absolute-positive-lutely TINY.’ Agelessness is also part of being in the Disney Princess Universe, and according to Oceanstarlet, Ariel has timeless beauty down to a science. ‘Want to see their idea of a matured woman,’ she writes beside a picture of a childlike empress. ‘Look at Ariel, thirteen years after having her first kid, and at LEAST thirty. Lookin’ good, Queen Ariel.’ After bodies, Oceanstarlet moves on to faces and starts with what she calls the ‘Sugar Cookie Style’ girls. Eurocentric: Caucasian princesses are distinct from the 'exotic' ones, and Viguet says most notably that the white girls all basically look the same . ‘“Sugar cookie"" is definitely not an official Disney term,’ Oceanstarlet writes on her deviantART page. ‘It's my name for all the European Disney princesses. They ARE a lot like sugar cookies: sparkly, white, and too sweet for their own good.’ The Sugar Cookie girls, most notably, seem to have ‘bulbous’ eyes pupils and full, womanly lips regardless of age. ‘The reason for the ginormous eyes,’ she writes, ‘is that it makes them look more child-like…the concept here is a little girl head on a teenager’s body with adult height (FREAKY!)’ Picasso gals: Meanwhile, Viguet shows how face, eye, and nose shape are all the differences needed to make the perfect 'Exotic' princess . Oceanstarlet then moves one to the ‘Exotic Style’ girls, which she says began in 1992 ‘when Disney discovered that there were more stories to be told outside England, Denmark, France, and Germany.’ These ‘exotic beauties’ include ‘East Asia Disney,’ ‘Native American Disney,’ ‘Romani Disney,’ all with detailed drawing how-tos. By the end of the tutorial, Oceanstarlet accomplishes the impressive task of simultaneously educating her reader about Disney’s unrealistic beauty standards and exactly how to achieve them. At least on paper.","deviantART user Oceanstarlet AKA Meridith Viguet has figured out the key creating the perfect princess face and body .

"A mother who shrunk from a size 18 to a size six in just six months by dramatically changing her lifestyle has developed such a passion for keep-fit that she has become a fitness instructor. Lisa Rennison, 40, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, has kept six stone off for 12 years by dedicating herself to a strict diet and gruelling exercise regime, and over the past four months has succeeded in her next challenge: to develop an impressive six-pack. Speaking to MailOnline, Lisa explained how she decided at Christmas that she would like to turn her flat stomach into a super-toned six-pack and embark on her new career. Lisa has kept six stone off for 12 years, since she was a size 18, left, and has now worked on developing her six-pack, right . Lisa now teaches ab-crunching, spin, body combat and circuit classes in three different gyms near her home . She said: 'Basically I just love exercising so much ever since I've lost the weight, and I wanted a new . career, something I was passionate about. 'I worked for the council as a customer service rep, but always hated working in an office. Friends kept telling me I should do something to do with keeping fit but I didn't have the confidence. It was last September, when I was 39, that I was really unhappy in my job and decided to do something about it.' Lisa now teaches ab-toning, spin, body combat, circuit training and body conditioning classes at three different gyms near her home. She cycles to and from work (a total of one hour every day, 70 miles per week) and runs two back-to-back hour-long classes at the gym, five or six days a week. 'When I was big I didn't do any exercise at all,' she said. 'And eight years ago I ran and cycled but wasn't keeping fit to anything like the extent I do now. Then in 2010 I joined a gym and didn't look back.' It was towards the end of 2012 that Lisa also decided she wanted to work on toning her already flat stomach, right, into something more defined, left . Lisa cycles for an hour a day and runs two back-to-back hour-long gym classes five or six times a week . It was also towards the end of 2012 that she also decided she wanted to work on toning her already flat stomach into something more defined: 'There was a definition there because of all my cardio . work, but just before Christmas I told my instructor i wanted six-pack, so I decided to look at my diet and do more weights. 'I completely cut out alcohol and began to eat more protein - I really like chickpeas, fat-free yoghurt and Quorn - and within six weeks I saw a big difference. 'I started doing body-pump workouts - sort of weight training to music - and really working my upper body. Other people started noticing a big difference in my body, too. 'The great thing is that the exercises you do don't have to be done for a massive length of time - just a few minutes a day. And they really work. It took about six weeks to notice a difference and three months for my six-pack to arrive.' Diet tips: 'I completely cut out alcohol and began . to eat more protein - I really like chickpeas, fat-free yoghurt and . Quorn - and within six weeks I saw a big difference' Lisa said: 'I completely cut out alcohol and began to eat more protein - I really like chickpeas, fat-free yoghurt and Quorn - and within six weeks I saw a big difference' 'My body combat class is sort of weight training to music - it's all areas of the body . using weights, a bit . like boxercise and martial arts together,' she said. 'I do spin classes three times a week . and I'm also a big advocate of my circuit training classes beacuase . they work all the muscle groups - it's a big cardio workout that has . lots to do with toning.' Lisa is also a big believer in the . Tabata work-out: short, sharp bursts of high-intensity sprints and . training that keep your heat rate high and are said to improve fitness . and help you burn more calories. Lisa, pictured before her weight loss, dieted by cutting out bread and . chocolate and lost a stone in a month and followed it by stopping greasy . takeaways and fast food . Alongside her fitness routine, Lisa's super-healthy diet is also strictly regimented. Her daily menu consists of oats and water for breakfast, fruit snacks, wholewheat grains and plenty of salad for lunch and Quorn and vegetables for dinner. She also drinks lots of water and says apples, carrots and celery are the best foods to make yourself feel full. 'I never get bored of it and I do feel slightly panicky if I have to go out to a restaurant and always like to look at the menu first to see if there's something I can eat. 'I have the occasional treat but usually just cocoa powder in yoghurt - junk food doesn't interest me and i don't really get cravings for rubbish anymore.' Breakfast: I always eat the same breakfast, a bowl of oats mixed with water and chopped fruit like strawberries, blueberries and bananas, plus two tablespoons of fat-free yoghurt and decaff tea . Snack: I drink lots of water, and if I have to snack I eat fruit, especially bananas which are good for energy, or apples celery and carrots which make you feel full . Lunch: . A wholemeal pitta or roll with Quorn - I don't eat a lot of meat - plus spices like chillies which speed up metabolism. I always eat loads of salad, vegetables and fruit, especially beetroot and chickpeas, plus a tiny bit of extra extra light mayonnaise or yoghurt . Dinner: Quorn meatballs with my own tomato sauce and vegetables. I also have wholewheat pasta - I don't eat any white food. For dessert I'll eat fruit. Special treat: If I'm in the mood for something sweet I mix cocoa powder with yoghurt to make it really chocolatey and delicious. Lisa's workouts include plenty of floor exercises which strengthen her core muscles and build abs . Overweight as a child and called 'fat a***' by bullies at school, a . lifetime of unhealthy eating had seen Lisa's weight soar to 12st, which at . 5ft 2in put her in the dangerously overweight category. Lisa's weight spiralled out of control after she had her son Ben, now 15 . But it was after the birth of . her son Ben, now 15, that her weight really spiralled out of control. She eventually decided to do something about it, taking a photo of herself at her heaviest and carrying it around with her for 'thinspiration'. She dieted by cutting out bread and . chocolate and lost a stone in a month and followed it by stopping greasy . takeaways and fast food. The . mother-of-one added: 'I didn't use Slimming World, or Weight Watchers . or muscle in on any fad diets. I literally stopped eating the rubbish. 'I stopped eating the chocolate and the cakes. I looked at my portion sizes and got rid of the takeaway meals.' In just six months Lisa managed to drop to a healthy 7st, dropping from a size 18 to a size six. She says her next goal is to work on her body strength: 'I'm happy with weight, I don't want to lose any more. Now it's more about developing strength and muscle which I'll do by lifting heavy weights. I don't want to become a . body builder, I just want to be as fit as I can be.

"Margaret Thatcher would have rejected and confronted the ‘pessimism’ of Ukip, George Osborne said last night. The Chancellor sought to seize the mantle of the late prime minister for today’s Conservatives, saying they should project an optimistic vision of Britain’s future and address the country’s self-doubt. He likened Lady Thatcher’s mission to drag the country out of the malaise of the 1970s to that now facing the Government, and said the success in turning the economy round over the past five years showed Britain’s best days still lie ahead. George Osborne has said Margaret Thatcher would have rejected and confronted the 'pessimism' of Ukip . Addressing the first Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, Mr Osborne said Labour was represented by ‘pessimists’ who ‘don’t trust human instincts’ and want to ‘control and suppress them with a more powerful state’. But in a clear reference to the rise of Ukip, which topped the polls in last month’s European elections, he added: ‘There’s also a pessimistic tendency that can emerge on the populist right. The tendency to bemoan the present day, and put the past on a pedestal. ‘It sees life as better in 1954 or even 1854, than 2014. It is a tendency that says Britain’s best days are behind it – when I believe our country’s brightest days lie ahead. Margaret Thatcher confronted and overcame the same pessimism in Britain in the 1970s. She was always talking the country up, not down. We must do the same.’ Former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken, Lady Thatcher’s unofficial biographer, has said she would not have voted Ukip but might have been ‘secretly cheering them on’. Questioning: Mr Osborne suggested she would have dismissed the pessimistic prospectus of Nigel Farage's party . But Mr Osborne suggested she would have dismissed Ukip’s pessimistic prospectus. ‘She believed Britain could be a strong economy again; that militant trade unions could be overcome; that the Cold War could be won,’ he told delegates at London’s Guildhall. ‘It is difficult to appreciate today how completely outside the consensus her confidence in Britain and its capabilities was. ‘Not just on the Left, but the Right too, a deep malaise had crept in. Managed decline had been the mantra until she arrived. ‘As optimistic Conservatives who believe in the power of ideas like freedom and aspiration, our generation’s mission is to confront and overcome this latest bout of western self-doubt. Our free market economy can be the most prosperous.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove undermined Mr Osborne’s message by telling the same conference that ‘living in the 18th century ... for many of us would be a very attractive thing to do’.","Chancellor says Tories should project optimistic vision of Britain's future .

It wasn't until September 3, when Morris didn't turn up to work, that police were alerted to the case by her employer. Police released surveillance footage showing her entering The Shops at Legacy parking garage around 4am Saturday with a male friend.

On numerous fieldwork trips, The University of Arizona entomologist would find himself digging up living colonies of creatures, who in turn were not happy with this destructive human scooping them into bags - and promptly sank their fangs, stingers or pincers into him. Still, no pain, no gain, and Schmidt turned his experiences into the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, ranking 78 species in a list which, while subjective, was put together by the man who must surely know best, ranking their pain on a scale of 1 to 4. RATING: 1.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Light, ephemeral, almost fruity. A tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm. RATING: 1.2 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Sharp, mildly alarming. Like walking across a shag carpet and reaching for the light switch. RATING: 1.8 . SCHMIDT SAYS: A rare, piercing, elevated sort of pain. Someone has fired a staple into your cheek. RATING: 2.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Rich, hearty, slightly crunchy. Similar to getting your hand mashed in a revolving door. RATING: 2.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue. RATING: 2.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: The sensation is like a matchhead that flips off and burns on your skin. RATING: 3.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Bold and unrelenting. Somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail. RATING: 3.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Distinctly bitter aftertaste. Like spilling a beaker of hydrochloric acid on a paper cut. RATING: 4.0 . SCHMIDT SAYS: Blinding, shockingly electric. A running hair drier has been dropped into your bubble bath. RATING: 4+ . SCHMIDT SAYS: Like fire-walking over flaming charcoal with a 3-inch rusty nail grinding into your heel. He also gave un-scientific-sounding but apt descriptions for each pain, for instance the sting of the yellowjacket wasp felt 'hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue.'. According to io9, entomologist May Berenbaum described Schmidt's char as: 'A scale from 0 to 4, in which 0 was defined as the sensation of being stung by an insect that cannot penetrate human skin to 2, a familiar intermediate pain (honey bee), to 4, an intensely painful sting.' The bullet ant, otherwise known as 'paraponera' or the 'giant hunting ant', has a powerful sting that can last for 24 hours. Some victims have likened the pain to 'being shot with a bullet'. Luckily for most readers, the ant colonies can only be found in the rainforests of Central America, between Nicaragua and Paraguay. The locals there sometimes use the bites as part of their initiation rites. It gets worse - the locals weave the ants, which can grow to be an inch long, into clothes made out of leaves, and initiates have to wear the jackets for ten minutes. The locals will get stung hundreds of times - and reportedly have to repeat the act 20 times. If you think you can handle the all stings in the world, Schmidt made two other findings that might change your views. FIrstly, Schmidt said that the more painful a sting felt, the more aggressive the species tended to be. And, adding further insult injury, some creatures would also release a pheromone with their sting - telling other insects to join in the fun and give more stings to the victim. If that has still not put you off a sting, io9 reported how the stingers affected our bodies. 'First, enzymes soften, then burst open cellular membranes. Some of these cells, inevitably, will be nerve cells. Wrecking these cells screws up all the electrochemical signaling that nerve cells do, so they end up firing off signals more or less at random. 'Other chemicals restrict blood flow, keeping the pain-causing stuff undiluted and in one place.' Luckily, most of us will hopefully go through life with little more than the odd sting from a passing wasp or defensive bee - but spare a thought for Schmidt, who is bravely sacrificing his body in the name of science.",Justin Schmidt's colourful descriptions include how the sting of a yellowjacket wasp is like 'W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue'
"Earl Grey tea, much favoured in Downton Abbey, contains extracts of a fruit called bergamot which scientists believe is a superfood for the heart . A cup of Earl Grey tea can lower cholesterol and reduce the chances of heart disease, according to scientists. The beverage, much favoured in Downton Abbey, contains extracts of a fruit called bergamot which scientists believe is a superfood for the heart. And it could even be as effective as statins, the controversial wonder drugs used to control cholesterol but which can have side effects in patients. The bergamot is a Mediterranean citrus fruit which gives Earl Grey the distinct taste and smell that has traditionally made it popular with the upper and middle classes. Now new research claims it contains enzymes known as HMGF (hydroxy methyl glutaryl flavonones) which can treat heart diseases as effectively as statins. Researchers from Italy’s University of Calabria for the Journal of Functional Foods used concentrations of HMGF on the proteins which cause heart disease and ‘bad’ cholesterol. They then compared the effects with that of statins used to treat the same proteins and found the bergomot extract with HMGF worked just as well. Not only did it reduce levels of LDL - so-called ‘bad cholesterol’ which leads to heart disease - but also increased HDL, which doctors call ‘good cholesterol’. Citrus foods have long been part of the famed ‘Mediterranean diet’ which has been hailed as one of the best ways to avoid heart disease - the biggest killer in the Western world. The journal’s report said: “High cholesterol is a common health concern for us all and often statins are given to help treat the condition. The bergamot is a Mediterranean citrus fruit which gives Earl Grey the distinct taste and smell that has traditionally made it popular with the upper and middle classes . “Extract from bergamot - most commonly used in Earl Grey tea - reduced total cholesterol, and LDL levels but there was an increase in HDL levels (good cholesterol). “Therefore a daily supplement of bergamot fruit extract could be very effective for the treatment of high cholesterol.” Bergamot has long been used in traditional ‘folk’ medicines in the Mediterranean not only as a protection for the heart but also to treat wounds, inflammation and as an antiseptic. The extracts have even been used in jams, ice cream and perfumes in the region, said the researchers. Superfood: The bergamot flower.

"Women using donor sperm may be more likely to get pregnant if the man is aged 40 and older rather than younger, say British scientists. The first major study to investigate the effect of male age on fertility treatment using donor sperm found no difference in the rate of live babies born whether the man was in his 40s or 20s. In fact, women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a middle-aged man, probably because he’s already proved his fertility by having a family of his own. Current UK guidelines suggest men should not be accepted as donors over the age of 40, but experts say it may be time for a re-think to ease the growing shortage of sperm donors. The first major study to investigate the effect of male age on fertility at the Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life found it is sperm quality rather than a donor's age that matters when it comes to conception . At least one-quarter of donor sperm used in British fertility clinics comes from abroad, much of it from Denmark. The results of the study are to be reported tomorrow at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich. The study looked at 40,000 treatment cycles involving donor sperm between 1991 and 2012 from the database held by the UK fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The findings showed no significant differences in the rate of live babies born relative to the age of the sperm donor. For sperm donors aged under 20, the birth rate using IVF techniques was 28.3 per cent – rising to 30.4 per cent when the donors was aged 41-45 years. In donor insemination patients, the birth rate was 9.7 per cent with a donor aged under 20 and 12 per cent with a donor aged 41-45. Dr Meenakshi Choudhary, from the Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, led the study with colleague Dr Navdeep Ghuman. Dr Choudhary said ‘No decline in live births was observed with the increasing age of men, that’s the take home message from a large national database. ‘It’s sperm quality rather than male age that matters. ‘Our study shows that we are good at selecting the right sperm donors with the right sperm quality – and that’s why we found no difference in live birth rate despite the increasing age of sperm donors.’ Although the figures reveal a trend of women being slightly less likely to get pregnant using sperm from younger donors, this could be explained by the fact that they may not have proven fertility, she said. Older men wanting to donate sperm probably already have a family, said Dr Choudhary, a consultant in reproductive medicine and gynaecology. Researchers found women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a middle-aged man, probably because he¿s already proved his fertility by having a family of his own . UK experts are concerned about acute shortages of donor sperm and eggs for couples desperate to start a family. A change in UK law in 2005 requiring donors to reveal their identities to any children born as a result when they reach 18 is blamed by some for long waiting lists. Demand for sperm has been fuelled by single women and women delaying motherhood, according to the HFEA. The HFEA’s code of practice recommends clinics don’t use sperm donors over 45, but guidelines for doctors suggest 40 as the cut-off point. The study included older men because the data goes back in time beyond recent guidelines. Dr Choudhary said the average age of sperm donors at her unit had risen from 26 years to 34 years since the lifting of anonymity. This meant worried women were asking whether their chances of getting pregnant would be harmed by using sperm from older donors, she said, but ‘it may be better’. 'No decline in live births was . observed with the increasing age of men, that’s the take home message . from a large national database. It’s sperm quality rather than male age that matters' - Dr Meenakshi Choudhary, from the Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life . It was her job to produce the data, and the HFEA as policy-maker could decide whether it should lead to a relaxation of the age limit, she added. However, Sarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, said ‘Given the need for more sperm donors in the UK, perhaps it is time for the guidelines on sperm donation to be reviewed in light of this study, to consider extending the upper age limit.’ There are doubts about using sperm from older donors because it has been linked to greater risk of miscarriage, pregnancy loss and birth defects. ‘Advanced paternal age has also been associated with long-term disorders in offspring. But the available evidence is limited’ said Dr Choudhary. Professor Allan Pacey, chair of the British Fertility Society, said the rise in such disorders is ‘very small but detectable’. ‘The study shows success rates from donor sperm up to the age of 45 are unaffected by age, but it does not answer the question about the health of the children’ he added. Prof Pacey, senior lecturer in reproduction and developmental medicine at the University of Sheffield, said ‘I think I would be worried about raising the age limit for sperm donors to 45 because of the possible effects on the health of children.’ He said that for every 100 men who apply to be sperm donors, only about five are accepted. A quarter of all donated sperm used in clinics was imported from outside the UK.","First major study to investigate the effect of male age on fertility conducted .

"Cult leader Warren Jeffs has spent the past six years behind bars after being arrested and later convicted of sexual abuse of young girls, but that has not stopped him from continuing to exude complete control over his polygamous community. A Friday expose on ABC’s 20/20 has revealed the insulated world of The Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church where Jeffs’ 8,000 followers continue to believe that he is a prophet and God who has been wrongly imprisoned. ‘Anybody who thinks that Warren Jeffs' incarceration ended his rule in this community has no idea what they're talking about,’ said reporter Mike Watkiss. ‘He is in many ways more powerful because now he's martyred.’ Innocent victims: Children living in Warren Jeffs' compound are taught that the self-proclaimed prophet convicted of child sex abuse is the U.S. president . A 2008 raid on Jeffs' FLDS stronghold in . Eldorado, Texas, revealed the polygamous community which included . pregnant child brides in pastel prairie dresses with elaborate braided . hairdos. The FLDS holds polygamy as a fundamental belief and its men take multiple wives in what are termed 'celestial marriages' each performed in a ceremony called a 'sealing'. The Utah-based church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and arranged marriages  sometimes involve underage girls. More than a year after his conviction of . child sex abuse, it appears that little has changed in the remote . Yearning for Zion compound in Colorado City housing the Fundamentalist . Latter Day Saints, a radical wing of the Mormon Church. Religious studies: Children in the local schoolhouse are taught Jeffs' proverbs in place of science or history . Oppressed: In the male-dominated community, the women live in polygamous marriages where each man has at least three sister wives . Styling tips: Fundamentalist Latter Day Saint women are not allowed to cut their hair because it is believed that they will need it to wash men's feet in heaven . Like in the past, Jeffs decides where people live, whom they marry and even what they eat and how they dress. Children of cult members receive little . more than a grade school education where science and history are ignored . in favour of religious studies with an emphasis on Jeffs’ proverbs, and . where every school book must be personally approved by the leader. Totalitarian leader: Jeffs was convicted last year of molesting two teenage girls and sentenced to life in prison, but he continues to have control over his sect . One proverb reads: 'When you disobey there must and will always be a punishment.' Children in the local schoolhouse are also taught that Jeffs was the president of the United States and that God led Neil Armstrong away from the moon during the Apollo 11. When questioned by an ABC reporter about . their general level of knowledge, a trio of girls who escaped the cult . several months earlier along with their mother said that they had never . heard of Ronald Reagan, Santa Claus or AIDS. The women are always covered from neck to ankle because they believe their bodies are sacred. Town dressmaker Lizzie Jeffs said: 'We believe in being modest. 'The Lord teaches us that if we can dress properly, it is easier to see each other as a whole person inside and out.' Women must never cut their hair because it is believed that they will need it to wash men's feet in heaven. They all live in polygamous marriages where each man has at least three sister wives. The FLDS organization is protected by Utah’s homeschooling law, which means that state officials have no say about the content of the curriculum taught on the grounds of the secured compound. In August 2011, Jeffs, 56, was found guilty of molesting two girls ages 12 and 15 whom he took as brides in 'spiritual marriages’. Handpicked fathers: FLDS children bath in a river in their clothes for modesty in the cult where 15 men have been handpicked by Jeffs to father all the children. Married couples are banned from having sex . Banished: Jeffs ordered 500-600 men and women expelled from FLDS, among them Carling Steed (pictured with third wife Suzette) Modesty is sacred: The women are always covered from neck to ankle because they believe their bodies are sacred. Town dressmaker Lizzie Jeffs (pictured) said the dresses 'make it easier to see each other as a whole person inside and out' Apostates: Carling Steed's third wife, Suzette, second left, and their six daughters, left the community and the church in search of a normal life . Grim prediction: FLDS apostate Willie Steed said that as long as Jeffs lives, his community will remain loyal to him . Eleven other FLDS men were charged with . crimes including sexual assault and bigamy. So far, all seven, who have . been prosecuted, have been convicted - receiving prison sentences of . between six and 75 years. In recent months, it appears that the . all-powerful self-proclaimed prophet has begun unraveling, issuing ever . more bizarre edicts to the members of his community such as a ban on . children’s toys and the consumption of corn. More importantly, Jeffs has ordered married couples in his community to stop having sex or even touching one another. Instead, he selected 15 men from among his trusted followers to father all the future FLDS children. Now, if a woman wants to have a baby, she has to approach one of the men handpicked for the task by Jeffs. The sexual act must be witnessed by two other men from the group. In a tragic twist, the jailed cult leader ordered that 500-600 men and women be banished without any explanation from the compound, which for many of them had been the only home they had ever known. The effect of this decree issued from behind bars has been devastating to many families that were torn apart. So absolute is Jeffs’ control over his flock that those members who were ordered to leave, severed all ties with their loved ones still living on the compound for fear of retribution. Willie Steed, 18, who left the group along with his mother, Suzette, and six sisters after their father Carling was banished, said that as long as Jeffs is alive, his spell over the insular community of Colorado City will not be broken. ‘He is their idol, and they worship him,’ he said.","Cult leader Warren Jeffs is in jail, convicted of sexual abuse of young girls .

"The average billionaire is worth £1.79 billion, has four luxury homes and more than £350 million cash in the bank, research revealed yesterday. There are 2,170 billionaires around the world with a combined worth of £3.88 trillion - double the figure from five years ago. And London is the number one chosen destination in Western Europe for the super-rich - with 67 of these people living in the capital. Billionaire's playground: Russian billionaire and owner of Chelsea soccer club Roman Abramovich in London . Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich bought three flats in Knightsbridge in 2006 for a total of £7.8 million, adding to three he already owned there worth £10 million . Paris boasts 25 billionaires while tax haven Geneva has just 18 residents with assets running into ten-figures. Of these, 60 per cent are self-made billionaires, 20 per cent have inherited wealth with 20 per cent having part-inherited, part-made fortunes. The likes of Roman Abramovich and Lakshmi Mittal will typically own four homes around the world. Incredibly, they will never spend less than £10 million on a house in London unless it is for a servant. And it's traditional family homes, which they choose for their number one residence. This is according to the Ultra Prime Barometer Survey, which yesterday revealed the average billionaire has at least £50 million of homes. The research, by Beauchamp Estates and Dataloft, looks into the property portfolios of ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWI) across Western Europe. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has taken up residence in London . This house in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London, was bought by multi-billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal in 2004. He paid a record £70 million for the 12 bedroom mansion . In London, the elite buy mansions in the 'platinum triangle' of Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia but also look for palatial residences in St Johns Wood and Regents Park. It costs a staggering £250,000 a year to maintain each of these London properties with huge amounts spent on insurance, security and utility bills. On top of London, billionaires also need a European beachside home in their property portfolio, with the French Riviera, Tel Aviv, Tuscany and Greek islands the most popular locations. These people are typically worth £1.79 billion and 86 per cent of them are married. They are family people with 2.1 children. On average, they hold 42 per cent of their wealth (£760m) in private holdings, 35 per cent (£630m) in publicly held companies, 18 per cent (£350m) in cash, three per cent (£50m) in property and two per cent (£35m) in luxury assets such as artwork, yachts and private jet travel. Three-quarters have a home in a city which is crucial to their financial, banking and business interest. This helps boost London’s position as the number one Western European destination of the super-rich. And it is all about the 'S' word with the wealthy buyers wanting a select location, size, space, security and a high specification. The average London ultra prime residence, which the billionaires battle it out to own, has six bedroom suites and four reception rooms. Most (96 per cent) have an outside garden, 39 per cent have a private swimming pool, 43 per cent have a cinema and 43 per cent have a gated driveway. Beauchamp Estate believe it is a 'badge of billionaire membership' to have a London mansion in the 'platinum triangle' or St Johns Wood and Regents Park. Gary Hersham, director of Beauchamp Estates, said: 'We advise UHNWI buying homes in London and around the Mediterranean to set aside budgets of typically £50 million to acquire the right properties. 'Most UHNWI buying in Western Europe see having an ultra prime home in Prime Central London and on the French Riviera as 'must have' badges. 'Others then decide they also want a Tuscan estate or residence on the Greek islands which adds another £10 million.'","Researchers find 2,170 billionaires around the world worth £3.88tn .

"An Oxford professor who was found dead at a fellow academic's home had suffered a mental breakdown in the last year, it was revealed. Colleagues of eminent astrophysicist Steven Rawlings said he had been struggling with mental health problems since summer last year. They have become so bad that Professor Rawlings, 50, had stepped down from his role in overseeing the team building the world's largest radio telescope. Professor Rawlings had played a huge part in developing the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) - which will be able to look 13 billion years back in time to the beginnings of the universe. Speaking out: Professor Rawlings' widow Linda (left) yesterday said she believes the death of her husband (right) was a 'tragic accident' But he was unable to complete his project and also dropped out of his academic work at Oxford University's St Peter's College. Best friend Dr Devinder Sivia was yesterday released on bail as police downgraded the investigation into the academic's death. Mathematician Dr Sivia, 49, had shared dinner at a local pub with Professor Rawlings on Wednesday night and became increasingly concerned about his friend's behaviour. Staff at the Bear hotel in Wantage, Oxfordshire, said frequent visitor Professor Rawlings was unusually subdued. Former Nasa worker Dr Sivia invited him to stay at his bungalow in Southmoor, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, but when they got to his home his friend apparently became increasingly agitated and apparently attacked Dr Sivia. In the altercation that followed, the professor collapsed on the floor from a suspected heart attack. Dr Sivia dialed 999 and alerted neighbours, but despite their efforts to resuscitate him he died at the scene. Professor Phil Diamond, who had worked closely with Professor Rawlings on the SKA scheme, told the newspaper: 'He became very withdrawn and dropped out of both his academic work and the SKA. 'I was told he suffered some mental problems but I don't know what caused them. 'I thought he was suffering from depression but he had shown no symptoms before, nor at this meeting in Rome.' Held: Dr Devinder Sivia has been bailed following the death of his colleague and best friend Steven Rawlings, who was found dead at the maths lecturer's home . Three decades ago: The friends circled in their first year at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1981 . Professor Rawlings distraught widow said last night her husband's death was not murder. Linda Rawlings said: 'Steve and Devinder were best friends since college and I believe this is a tragic accident. 'I do not believe that Steve's death is murder and I do not believe Devinder should be tarnished in this way.' Dr Sivia's brother Gurdip insisted the death could only have been an unfortunate tragedy. He said of Dr Sivia: 'There is just no anger in him, ever. 'He would have walked away from any confrontation. He would never say boo to a goose. Even if someone attacked him, I cannot believe he would fight back.' The maths lecturer was arrested on suspicion of murder but police now believe there may have been no criminal offence committed. Lecturer: Dr Sivia worked in the maths department at St John's college in Oxford . Guard: A police officer stands outside the home of Dr Sivia after the force launched a murder investigation into the death of Professor Rawlings . Dr Sivia, who teaches 'maths with natural sciences' to chemistry and physics students at St John's College in Oxford, is apparently 'absolutely beside himself' at the death of his best friend. The mathematician's family said the two men had been close since meeting as young undergraduates at St John's College in Cambridge more than 30 years ago. His father, Gurbakhsh Sivia, 80, said his son rang him from a police station after his arrest to say: 'Dad, there's been a tragedy and I'm in police custody under suspicion. It's being investigated but I'm hoping it will be sorted out.' Professor Rawlings and Dr  Sivia co-wrote a book titled Foundations    Of Science Mathematics, which was printed in paperback in 1999. Part of the Oxford Chemistry Primers series, it provides explanations of mathematical principles for undergraduates  studying for a wide range of  science degrees. The book, available for £13.99, covers topics ‘from basic  arithmetic and algebra to calculus’ and was praised by reviewers on the internet, one of whom described it as ‘brilliant’. The reviewer added: ‘I have found it so useful, as I am a physics undergraduate, for my course. ‘It covers everything I need and will be useful to look back at  maths I have done in the past, for future reference. Mr Sivia, a retired maths teacher from Gravesend, Kent, said the whole family was shocked. 'They were very, very good friends, inseparable friends. They were like brothers. My son is a good son and a dedicated teacher. He has very simple habits – he never drinks, he never smokes. It's unimaginable. 'They've been friends ever since they studied at Cambridge University together. I've known him for 20 years. When my son was ill, Steven would bring flowers and food to his house to help out.' After hearing his son had been released, Mr Sivia said: 'Although this is some ray of good news, it is still a tragedy as Steven is not with us any more.' The Sivia family moved from Punjab, India, when Devinder was five. He was educated in England and studied science at Cambridge, completing a first degree and PhD before going to the United States to work for Nasa at their space centre for three years. His brother Gurdip, a warehouse worker from Winson Green, Birmingham, said the British and Australian governments both wanted him to work for them after Nasa, adding: 'Eventually the British government got him back and set him up in a laboratory at Oxford.' He said Dr Sivia was a former colleague of Dr David Kelly, the government weapons inspector found dead in woods near his Southmoor home after he was named as the source of a report that Tony Blair's government 'sexed up' its Iraq weapons dossier. 'He worked with David Kelly and knew him well,' said Gurdip, 59. 'They worked together I think and lived very near each other.' He said his brother had never been in a serious relationship as he was 'married to his work'. Professor Rawlings, a lead scientist in the world's largest radio telescope project, lived with his wife in Letcombe Regis, near Wantage, Oxfordshire. In a statement issued by Thames Valley Police, Mrs Rawlings said: 'Steve was a well-loved, caring, intelligent, sensitive man. Steve is a man of integrity, kindness and a very accessible person. 'Steve was the love of my life and we have known each other all of these years and he has never changed, even though he has achieved so much and has all these qualities. I will miss him more  than anything else in the world.' Police say a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and further tests will be carried out over the coming weeks. Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, from the force's major crime unit, said: 'We can confirm that the two individuals involved have been friends for over 30 years. 'I would emphasise that the police are investigating all potential circumstances that could have led to his death. 'We are mindful that ultimately the death may be a matter for a coroner's inquest rather than a criminal court and I would ask for patience from both the media and the public while we continue our investigation.'

The military will not disclose . what OTV-2 was doing during its 15 months in orbit, but a third mission . already is on the calendar for launch this fall. OTV-2 blasted off . aboard an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . on March 5, 2011. At . launch, the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits, . leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board. Boeing Phantom Works built two of the robotic space planes, which resemble diminutive space shuttle orbiters, as test vehicles. The military, which took over the . program from NASA, says it is using them to learn how to quickly and . inexpensively refurbish reusable spaceships for flight. However, the ultimate purpose of the mission has largely remained a mystery. Questions: The unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the U.S. Air Force - but its purpose has never fully been explained . Finishing touches: Scientists in protective suits inspect the solar-powered craft prior to its mission . The top-secret robot plane is expected to land Saturday - weather and technical issues permitting . The X-37Bs also . serve as orbital test beds for instruments that could be incorporated . into future satellites. It is not known if it carried anything in its cargo bay, which is about the size of a pickup truck bed. The vehicles look like miniature . versions of NASA's now-retired space shuttle orbiters, with a similar . shape and a payload bay for cargo and experiments. They are 8.9 metres . long, compared to the shuttle's 37-metre length, and have a . wingspan of 4.5 metres, compared to the shuttle's wingspan of 23.7 meters. The solar-operated vehicles were designed to . stay in orbit for up to 270 days. OTV-2 surpassed that milestone by 199 . days.

"Bill and Hillary Clinton have been using a legal but dodgy tax loophole to evade the so-called 'death tax' that they both worked to raise, according to news reports published on Tuesday. Despite Hillary's frequent insistence that she has middle-class roots and identifies with ordinary Americans, she and her husband the former president have amassed a fortune likely valued in the tens of millions of dollars. In order to shield that wealth from the federal government's rapacious tax collectors at the IRS, they are using a financial planning strategy to shift ownership of their houses to a private trust, and then to their daughter Chelsea. This leaves the power couple free to reap the tax advantage of making such a generous gift before they die, while they rent the property back from her at a bargain price. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . The former secretary of state is promoting her book 'Hard Choices' while trying to construct an image that resonates with middle-class Americans: news of her net worth and tax-avoidance techniques will be bad 'optics' Tax-dodge road map for the 1 per cent: Hillary Clinton now a new impediment to her handlers' goal of positioning her as an everywoman in advance of the 2016 presidential campaign . The scheme, now common among America's famed '1 per cent,' will put any increases in the properties' value – so-called capital gains – outside of their estates, and therefore out of the IRS's reach when they die. It will also exclude most of the homes' values from the IRS's calculation that will determine how much of their estates is taxable. Bloomberg News examined the Clintons' financial disclosure statements and reported Tuesday that the couple made the move in 2010. In their political lives, both Clintons have advocated for narrowing the loophole that they are now leveraging. In August 2000, shortly before he left office, Bill Clinton vetoed a congressional bill that would have eliminated the estate tax. He insisted that Congress should 'proceed on grounds of fiscal responsibility and fairness' instead. Hillary has been more direct, arguing during the 2008 presidential campaign season for a change in federal law that would expose more of wealthy Americans' estates to the tax man. Bloomberg . TV's Al Hunt rapped the quasi-populist Clintons on Tuesday – not for . dodging taxes, but for being tone deaf to the image it projects to . ordinary Americans. 'Voters . may have a problem with a potential presidential candidate who spends a . lot of time talking about the problems of the middle class while . hobnobbing with the ""rich and privileged"",' Hunt said. 'It's . part of a larger problem that I think she has. ... I don't think . there's any ethical problem here. I think the optics are terrible, . though.' 'I . think once you put that together with Hillary giving speeches for . $200,000 to Goldman-Sachs, people start to say, ""Wait a minute: Is she . one of us or not?""' Beneficiary: Chelsea Clinton and her children will become ultra-wealthy and pay little in estate tax when her parents are deceased, thanks to a loophole that Bill and Hillary fought to eliminate . Man of the people: Former President Bill Clinton and his wife are worth between $5 and $50 million -- the exact amount is unclear because the federal government allows politicians to disclose their finances in broad ranges of dollar amounts . Federal estate taxes currently apply only to amounts over $5.34 million. Mrs. Clinton proposed lowering that cap to $3.5 million. She also argued that the top tax rate, paid only by the super-wealthy, should increase from 40 to 45 per cent. President Obama has acquiesced to Congress, however, increasing the exemption amount to its current level and leaving rates alone. Hillary Clinton's 2007 position, that a high estate tax keeps America from becoming 'dominated by inherited wealth,' is ringing hollow in 2014, however. After a guffaw-inducing gaffe in which she claimed she and President Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House, her finances have been thrust into the national spotlight. They both have raked in $200,000 or more per paid speech, and Hillary received a reported $14 million book-advance deal for her recent tome 'Hard Choices,' which has sold poorly. The power couple have a net worth between $5 and $50 million. The exact amount is unclear because the federal government allows politicians to disclose their finances in broad ranges of dollar amounts. The Republican Party is running a 30-second ad Tuesday on CNN during a broadcast town hall with Hillary Clinton. The ad focuses on her wealth.","The Clinton employed a common tax-avoidance strategy in 2010 to shield their homes from the IRS when they die .

"Dirty teacher: Martina Stanley, pictured, was sentenced Monday to 15 days' jail for having sex with a 17-year-old boy at her school . An Ohio sports coach and mother-of-four has been sentenced to 15 days' jail for having sex with a 17-year-old boy at her school. Martina Stanley, 35, admitted having an affair with the teen while she was coaching cross country and track at Elgin High School in Marion County. The defense argued the boy, who attended the school but wasn't a student of Stanley's, initiated the sex and wasn't harmed. In a sentencing memorandum, defense attorney Todd Anderson said the teen bragged about the sex to friends. 'The victim joked about the incident when interviewed...and stated he ""was fine"" and ""she is every school boy's dream,""' Anderson said according to 10tv.com. 'This is not to shift blame, but he was very aggressively pursuing Mrs Stanley to escalate the relationship.' But in court Monday, Stanley apologized to her victim and claimed responsibility for her actions. 'I'd like to say with all of my heart and as humble as I possibly can, that I'm sorry,' she said. 'I take this very seriously. This has been the hardest part of my life I've had to deal with because it rests on my shoulders, and I accept that.' Stanley was first charged with sexual battery.

"Cancer is as old as the earliest life on earth and may never be completely wiped out, scientists have warned. Despite billions being invested in countless research projects across the globe, a new study has reached the sobering conclusion: the disease is here to stay. The discovery means the disease will be more difficult to cure or treat, because of its highly evolved structure. Scientists in Germany and Croatia say the war on cancer, proclaimed in the 1970s, may never be won, as they discover the disease is more evolved that previously thought, Cancer cells, pictured . It suggests our cells' ability to develop cancer is 'an intrinsic property', that has evolved over millions of years. But researchers, at Germany's Kiel University and the Catholic University of Croatia, say 'knowing the enemy' will give scientists the best possible chance to fight it. The evolutionary biologists have found the first evidence of naturally occurring tumours in two species of hydra - simple freshwater animals. They say the existence of the disease in the tiny, coral-like polyps that first emerged hundreds of millions of years ago, suggests cancer is an inherent part of our evolution. Professor Thomas Bosch, who lead the research team, said: 'Cancer is as old as multi-cellular life on earth and will probably never be completely eradicated.' While searching for the origin of the cancer gene - the cause of all tumours - the team stumbled upon the discovery in hydras, said scientist Tomislav Domazet-Lošo. He said: 'Our data predicted that the first multi-cellular animals already had most of the genes, which can cause cancer in humans.' The team of researchers found cancer tumours growing in two species of hydra, pictured, simple freshwater animals . But they wanted to establish the evidence that these animals can actually suffer tumours. The team now believe they have achieved an impressive understanding of the roots of cancer. Professor . Bosch said: 'Now we have discovered tumour-bearing polyps in two . different species of hydra, an organism very similar to corals. 'This provides proof that tumours indeed exist in primitive and evolutionary old animals.' A further discovery was that the invasive nature of the disease also dates back millions of years. Cancer is set to overtake heart disease and stroke as Britain's biggest killer, experts said this week. The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of Europe, scientists have found. And . a 'tipping point' is approaching when deaths from stroke and heart . disease will be outnumbered by fatalities due to cancer - especially . among men. The report's . co-author Dr Nick Townsend, a senior researcher at the British Heart . Foundation, said: 'The reason why cancer has overtaken cardiovascular . disease as the main cause of death in these countries is due to the fact . that fewer people develop cardiovascular disease and, in those who do, . fewer die from it. 'This is . probably due to improvements in the behavioural risk factors associated . with CVD, such as decreases in the number of people smoking tobacco, . along with better treatments, including preventive ones, such as the . increasing use of statins.' If tumour cells are introduced into a healthy organism, they can trigger tumour growth in the hydras, the team found. Professor Bosch added: 'The invasive characteristic of cancer cells is also an evolutionary old feature.' In the U.S. alone it is estimated more than $500 billion was invested in cancer research by 2012. The worldwide research has led to improved preventative, diagnostic and treatment methods, which have been proven to yield successes. But every second person affected by cancer still succumbs to the disease today. Professor Bosch concluded: 'Our study makes it unlikely that the War On Cancer proclaimed in the 1970s can ever be won. 'Cancer cells have deep evolutionary roots. Any crucial cell in your body can make a mistake. You carry a time bomb in your body when you're born. 'It can explode early in life, or middle age or later. That doesn't mean that, with a patient who develops cancer, there's nothing you can do. 'Medical technology will allow us at early time points... at least in some cases, to successfully treat and clean a patient completely and forever of troublemaking cells. 'Knowing your enemy from its origins is the best way to fight it, and win many battles,' he added. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.","Evolutionary biologists in Germany and Croatia found the disease is more evolved than previously thought .

"Senator Al Franken has sent a letter to Apple’s chief executive highlighting ‘substantial’ security concerns about fingerprint recognition technology on its iPhone 5S. The iPhone 5S, which went on sale today, includes a fingerprint sensor that lets users touch the phone's home button with their finger to unlock it, rather than enter a passcode. Apple claims its scanner, known as Touch ID, is ‘one of the best passwords in the world.’ But Senator Franken said that while a password can be kept a secret and changed if it's hacked, fingerprints are permanent and left on everything a person touches. Scroll down for video... Senator Al Franken (left) has sent a letter to Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, (right) highlighting what he believes to be 'substantial' security concerns about fingerprint recognition technology on the iPhone 5S . In a letter to Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, the Minnesota Democrat asked for more clarity on security questions. ‘If someone hacks your password, you can change it – as many times as you want,’ said Senator Franken, in his letter. ‘You can’t change your fingerprints. You have only ten of them. And you leave them on everything you touch; they are definitely not a secret.’ Apple claims this kind of technology boosts security for users. It added that the fingerprint data is stored on the phone in a place that's inaccessible to other apps and to Apple's remote servers. Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now' Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. Users can 'train' their iPhone to . read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home . button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire . crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 . detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is . encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Senator Franken said that, unlike a string of numbers, a fingerprint uniquely identifies its owner. ‘Let me put it this way,’ he said. ‘If hackers get a hold of your thumbprint, they could use it to identify and impersonate you for the rest of your life.’ Apple is yet to issue an official response to Senator Franken, but it has published a support document on its website outlining the security features of Touch ID. ‘Touch ID does not store any images of your fingerprint. It stores only a mathematical representation of your fingerprint,’ it said. ‘It isn’t possible for your actual fingerprint image to be reverse-engineered from this mathematical representation.’ ‘Your fingerprint data is never accessed by iOS or other apps, never stored on Apple servers, and never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else,’ it added. Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire-based materials. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its iPhone 5S, pictured, and to protect the cameras on its latest models. Rumours now claim Apple could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens . Apple's Phil Schiller, pictured, explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip, and not online. Yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere . Even before the new iPhone 5S was released, a group of hackers pooled their funds to offer a bounty of over £10,000, bottles of booze and other prizes, for the first person that can crack the iPhone 5S’s Touch ID fingerprint sensors. IsTouchIDhackedyet.com, the creation of security researcher Nick DePetrillo, said it is hoping to help Apple identify bugs that it may have missed. Security engineer Charlie Miller said it could take fewer than two weeks for a smart hacker to get around the new lock. Among those getting ready for the hacking contest is David Kennedy, a former U.S. Marine Corps cyber-intelligence analyst who did two tours in Iraq and now runs his own consulting firm, TrustedSec LLC. Kennedy said he needs to examine the new iPhone to figure out how to best attempt an attack. He said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data, or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom-built device that would impersonate Apple's fingerprint reader. He added that it might be possible to lift a user's fingerprint from elsewhere on the device and somehow make a clone of it. The Touch ID sensor is built into the premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or PIN. Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said: 'Half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords. [Touch ID] is an easier and more fun alternative. 'It uses key you have with you everywhere you go. Your finger.' It works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. A user can 'train' their iPhone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

'Whoever did this took a very intentional shot at very close range. 'I think they must have been aiming at the back of the head and Ziggy must have moved at just the right distance right at the last minute.

"Nicky Morgan, the new education secretary, who will announce that toddlers are to be taught 'fundamental British values' Children as young as two are at risk of religious extremism and must be taught 'fundamental British values' to combat radicalism, the new Education Secretary will warn today. Nicky Morgan will urge local authorities to  use new powers to strip funding from nurseries found to promote extremist views. Also under the proposed rules, nurseries that teach creationism – the rejection of evolutionary theory – as scientific fact will also have their taxpayer funding cut. Mrs Morgan, who replaced Michael Gove as Education  Secretary in last month’s Cabinet reshuffle, will say: ‘One of the most important roles of the education system is that it should prepare young people for life in modern Britain. ‘I am clear that public money should not be used to support any school or early years provider that does not support this aim because it seeks to promote ideas and teachings than run counter to fundamental British values. ‘There can be no place for extremist views anywhere in the education system. The changes we are making today will ensure all early years providers and schools are aligned with the need to protect children from views that are considered extreme.’ It is understood the teaching of British values is likely to include ‘challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes’. Children will also be taught how to take turns and share and the difference between right and wrong. The announcement comes in the wake of the recent ‘Trojan Horse’ scandal, a hardline Muslim plot to take over primary and secondary state schools in Birmingham. Mrs Morgan hopes the rules will come into effect in the New Year following a consultation in September. Ofsted will inspect early years providers on promoting of fundamental  British values. The proposals are designed to bring nurseries into line with similar tough measures in schools. It is the first time the Government has warned that toddlers could be at risk from extremist views. Mrs Morgan is said to be worried about the risks of nurseries linked to radical mosques run by Islamic hardliners. There are also concerns within Government that councils need more power to respond if there are allegations of extremist views. The announcement follows a consultation on local authority early years funding arrangements. Operation Trojan Horse, was an apparent plot by Muslim fundamentalists to take over schools in the Birmingham City Council, pictured, area . There are currently no explicit rules that allow local authorities, which provide funding to nurseries that meet Ofsted requirements, to stop funding churches or mosques with extremist views. However, it is understood there is no concrete intelligence of any individual nurseries needing immediate action. A mysterious letter which described ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ – an apparent plot by Muslim fundamentalists to take over Birmingham’s schools – sparked a series of school inspections in the city. It was passed to the council, head teachers, unions and media outlets, sparking four separate investigations. Purportedly written as a guide for fellow hardliners in Bradford, the unsigned and undated letter itself is now viewed as an elaborate hoax. However, Ofsted found evidence of an ‘organised campaign’ to change the character of some schools, while calling for further investigation of others. It inspected 21 schools in the city, concluding a ‘culture of intimidation’ had developed in some. Five schools were placed in special measures: Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy – all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET), as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. A sixth, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Takeover plot: Park View School in Birmingham was at the centre of the allegations . The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year. Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered. It allegedly outlined a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. Whistleblowers at Park View have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school. The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. Police, the Government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in March. The DfE has also appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation. Yesterday, six schools at the centre of an alleged Islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even  closure after being officially judged as failing, it emerged last night. A three-month inquiry has found the Birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated. One of the six, Golden Hillock, was rated ‘inadequate’ in every criteria. A leaked copy of its Ofsted report says ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly. However, three were today given 'outstanding' or 'good' results by the education watchdog.","Nicky Morgan will warn toddlers must be protected from extremists .

"Tragic shooting: Adrian Broadway lost her life in a shooting on Saturday morning after being struck in the head by a bullet outside the home of Willie Noble . A mischievous prank turned deadly on Saturday after a 15-year-old girl was allegedly shot dead by an irate Arkansas homeowner who is now facing first-degree murder charges. Adrian Broadway was allegedly hit in the head by Willie Noble, 48, after the teenage girl and five other friends covered Noble's car with leaves, eggs and mayonnaise just before 1am on Saturday morning. It was the second prank Broadway and her friends had played on Noble that evening - causing him to burst out of his home in Little Rock firing his gun at the car containing the teen and her friends. The panicked teens managed to race away from Noble's home and made it as far as the local Kum & Go gas station where they phoned an ambulance for Broadway. She was raced to Arkansas Children's Hospital but sadly died from her injuries. Noble was arrested by police and charged with one count of first degree murder, one count of a terroristic act and five counts of aggravated assault - for firing on the other passengers of the white Hyundai Sonata. Lieutenant Sidney Allen said this was all the result of a prank that happened three months ago. 'Apparently Mr. Noble's teenage son had . done a prank on some of the kids that were inside the vehicle on . Halloween Night. As a result they were doing a retaliation prank and it . ultimately had deadly results,' Allen explained. Scroll Down for Video .

"We are led to believe that taking exercise and eating our greens are the secret to longevity. But it seems other, more enjoyable, pursuits might also contribute. The world’s oldest person, Misao Okawa, says the key to a long life is eating sushi and getting at least eight hours sleep a night. Misao Okawa, 115, will turn 116 on Wednesday and she is the world's oldest person . Mrs Okawa, from Osaka in Japan, will turn 116 on Wednesday - she was born in 1898. When she was born, Queen Victoria was on the throne and the Spanish American War was raging, The Telegraph reports. She told the paper: ‘Eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax.’ Mrs Okawa, whose husband, Yukio Okawa, died in June 1931 – 83 years ago, has been the world’s oldest person since the death of 116-year-old Jireomon Kimura in June 2013. He remains the world’s oldest ever man. ‘Mrs Okawa eats three large meals a day and makes sure that she sleeps eight hours a night,’ Tomohito Okada, the head of the Kurenai retirement home where she lives, told The Telegraph. He added: ‘She insists that her favourite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice, and she has it at least once every month.’ Mrs Okawa (pictured on her 115th birthday) says the key to a long life is eating well and getting lots of sleep . Mrs Okawa is also known to have made every attempt to stay active for as long as possible. When she was 102 she was found doing leg squats ‘to keep her body in shape’. Mrs Okawa says that the happiest moments of her life were her wedding and the birth of her three children – she still has a surviving son and daughter who are now 94 and 92. Her children have also given her four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She says the saddest moment of her life was the death of her husband. Experts say it is no surprise that both of the last two oldest people have been Japanese. Mrs Okawa recommends that people eat sushi, learn to relax and that they sleep for at least eight hours a night . They say it is down to an excellent healthcare system, encouragement to stay active in old age and a healthy diet made up of fish, rice and fruit. The life expectancy for a Japanese woman is almost 86 years while the average for a Japanese man is 79.6 years. The average life expectancy in the UK is about 80. The oldest authenticated person ever was Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who died at the age of 122 years and 164 days. However, plenty of others have claimed to be even older – their claims have just been unverifiable.","Misao Okawa, from Osaka in Japan, will turn 116 on Wednesday .

"Apple have opened the doors to their Chinese 'sweatshop' factories where employees are paid as little as £1.12 an hour. Many of the staff perform monotonous tasks like wiping down screens or shaving aluminium from the edge of the Apple logo for ten tedious hours at a time. And now the conditions inside the factory in Shenzhen - where 18 employees have killed themselves - can be seen, after ABC TV network were given exclusive access. Monotonous tasks: Workers, paid as little as £1.12 an hour, work on the production line at Foxconn factory . Workforce: Wages have risen at the factory in recent weeks and staff were happy a probe found - although bored by the work . The broadcaster revealed that the entry-level salary of just £180 . per month is so low that it would take more than two months salary to . pay for the cheapest iPad. Even if the lowest earners do the maximum available overtime of 80 hours per month, they still do not earn enough to pay tax. Previous reports have claimed that some of the workers were doing 24 hours at a time, while others were forced to stand for their entire shifts. While the Nightline documentary knocks down those suggestions, it does show the suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths. Managers ordered asked for the nets to . be put up two years ago after nine workers committed suicide in the . space of three months. Suicide nets: This netting was installed at the Chinese factory two years ago after a spate of suicides . Finishing touches: An employee works on an Apple product at one factory. Pay is so low that an iPad would be more than two months wages for the lowest paid . Apple - the world's most valuable . technology company - have faced claims that their contractors are forcing staff to do overtime involuntarily and . employing underage workers at the factory. It was in response to these attacks that Apple threw open their doors at the Foxconn City plant in Shenzhen, China. Foxconn City is a unit of Taiwan’s Hon . Hai Precision Industry Company which employs up to 1.1million people in a . series of huge factory complexes in China. Liang Juan, 26, told ABC News that management is 'strict'. Wearing a white boiler-suit in the spotless factory, it is her job to flip over camera lenses with a tiny pair of tweezers. Asked what she thinks about when performing the dull task, she said: 'I don't think much about other things because the management is strict and we're busy working and have no time to think about other things.' Queue: Chinese people line-up for jobs at the factory. Most of the employees are aged between 16 and their mid 20s . Despite the boring jobs unemployed young Chinese workers queue up for work - and employees say that working conditions are much better than at other factories. An estimated 3,000 people were queuing at the gates to find work on one day when ABC News were there. Workers are charged around £11 per month to share a dormitory with seven other people and pay around 50 pence for a rice dish in the cafeteria. Apple have also allowed independent examiners from the Washington-based Fair Labour Association in to carry out inspections. Hard at work: Staff typically do long shifts for low pay at the factory in China . July 2009: A Foxconn employee fell from apartment building after losing iPhone prototype. 18 more workers try to commit suicide over next two years. 2010: 137 workers at Suzhou facility, owned by Apple suppliers Wintek, injured by poisonous chemical, n-hexane, used to clean iPhone screens because it dried faster. May 2011: Four workers dead and 18  injured in dust explosion at Foxconn factory in Chengdu, which produces iPad parts. December 2011: 61 workers injured in gas explosion at Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory in Shanghai, which was trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels. The Foxconn City complex of factories, run by Foxconn Technology Group, employ 235,000 workers and Microsoft, Dell and Hewlett Packard projects are also built on the site. In 2009, a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype. Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers were linked to attempted suicides. Despite claims to the contrary, the abuses appear to have continued. With demand for the firm's products . soaring the factory is forced to churn out products in growing numbers. Last year they sold 93million iPhones, 40million iPads, 38million iPods . and 17million computers. The ABC journalists given unrestricted access to the site and freedom to talk to anyone found that staff were paid above the minimum wage - and no-one worked there below the age of 16. Apple said 60,000 workers have been sent on college courses for free and they have informed one million staff of their legal rights. Insight: It was the first time that Apple had allowed camera crews inside their factory . Chief-executive Tim Cook said that they were working hard to improve conditions for workers. 'No one in our industry is doing more' to improve the live of employees,' he said, PC Mag reported. He added: 'We are constantly auditing facilities, going deep into the supply chain, looking for problems, finding problems, and fixing problems, and we report everything because we believe that transparency is so very important in this area.' However, concerns about the factory remain - and ABC News suggested that managers were warned in advance of their visit.

"Taking a break from another punishing work out, 'Human Barbie' Valeria Lukyanova has shared some more snaps of herself looking fresh-faced and cosmetic-free. The 28-year-old Ukrainian model, who . prides herself on having similar features and proportions to the plastic Mattel . doll, has shared a series of Facebook photos that show her wearing little to no make-up and going without her doll-like contact lenses. Earlier this month Valeria . revealed what she looks like under her heavy layers of make-up for the first time, in a . series of candid selfies. Scroll down for video . Gym snap: Showing off her thin frame, Valeria's hair is scraped back from her face in a high ponytail while wearing a bright pink crop top . Gym break: Valeria's hair was styled in a cute bun and was wearing a cropped black exercise top with a plunging cleavage . On Wednesday she was at it again, uploaded two pictures of a gym visit only hours apart, and seemingly taking the time for an outfit change in between shots. Showing off the extremely thin frame that she puts down to her 'breatharian' lifestyle, Valeria's hair is scraped back . from her face in a high ponytail while wearing a bright pink crop top. Breatharianism, is a cult that believes food - and possibly water - are not necessary for life. Breatharians claim they can exist on 'cosmic micro-food'. 'In recent weeks I have not been hungry at all; I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on air and light alone,' she claimed in an interview in February. The practice has been criticised as potentially lethal pseudoscience, and several practitioners have reportedly died of starvation. None have submitted themselves for comprehensive medical testing. Somehow, in spite of her claims that she lives on air and light alone, Valeria has managed to find the energy to work out frequently. Earlier in the day, she posed looking unflustered next to an exercise bench which had a towel laid out across it - suggesting she had been working out using the equipment. At this point, her hair was styled in a neat bun and she was wearing a cropped black exercise top with a plunging cleavage. It's harder to tell how much make-up she is wearing in these photos as they are taken further away than her last, more intimate photos. But, her gym-wear and make-up (if she's wearing any at all!) is starkly different to her normal  ensemble. An hour before she uploaded her first gym picture, Valeria appeared to be topping up her tan while getting in the mood for exercise by wearing a sporty visor. Sunny days: Valeria appeared to be topping up her tan while getting in the mood for exercise by wearing a sporty visor . Uncovered: 'Human Barbie' Valeria Lukyanova has finally revealed what she looks like under her heavy layers of make-up in new candid selfies . In one of the photos taken earlier this month, Valeria strikes a pose in a bathroom in a printed crop top and tiny denim shorts. Her platinum blonde hair falls to one side, and while she is perhaps wearing a little bit of make-up, she looks uncharacteristically natural. Her incredibly slender waist and protruding ribs, however, are a cause for concern. Worrying: The self-professed Breatharian's very slender waist and protruding ribs are a cause for concern . Her drastically slimmed down figure is apparent as well in another selfie she posted, this time wearing a hot pink bra and underwear. In the photo, Valeria is turned to the side, and her stomach appears concave. Below the image, she posted a link to a work-out video starring Instagram sensation Jennifer Selter, who is known for her pert derriere and passion for fitness. Valeria recently courted controversy . for claiming that interracial couples are the reason behind an increase in cosmetic surgery because they are 'making the human race uglier'. Workout look: The 28-year-old looks pensive in a selfie in which she wears a black sports bra and earphones . Questionable views: Valeria (pictured in another relatively natural photo) recently courted controversy for claiming that 'racial mixing' is the reason behind an increased interest in cosmetic surgery . ‘Remember how many beautiful women there were in the 1950s and 1960s, without any surgery?' she said in an interview with GQ. 'And now, thanks to degeneration, we have this. A Russian marries an Armenian, they have a kid, a cute girl, but she has her dad's nose. She goes and files it down a little, and it's all good.' Her comments sparked a furious . outrage among readers, but Valeria looks none the wiser in another . selfie she posted in which she wears a black and white sports bra. All dolled up: Valeria's mother Irina apparently inspired her daughter (pictured) to lead the 'astral' life that has made her so famous worldwide . The blonde looks pensively downward, with earphones in her ears and minimal make-up on her face. She strikes a similar pose in another photo posted yesterday, which sees her sitting in a car with a grey sweater on. With her eyes looking down, it's difficult to see whether she's wearing her Barbie-inspired contacts, but her make-up looks considerably less caked-on than usual.","Valeria Lukyanova is a 28-year-old Ukrainian model .

"The oldest continuously operating farm in the United States – dating back almost 400 years – has been sold. The 132-acre farm in Dover, NH, sold last month to Massachusetts farmer Matt Kozazcki for just over $1million after being on sale for three years. It was in the Tuttle family since 1632. Originally listed for over $3.35 million, according to Fox News, the farm sold for much less than the Tuttles expected. Life as it was: This 1925 photo shows a simpler time at the former Tuttle Farm . Mr Kozazcki plans to restore the farm, renamed Tendercrisp Farms,  to its colonial glory, he told the Foster’s Daily Democrat. ‘It’s a lot of heritage,’ he told the paper. ‘We’re trying to make it as much of a farm as possible.’ Mr Kozazcki has installed a fence made from hand cut and split New Hampshire cedar, removed flood lights in the parking lot and painted the barn since assuming the historic plot, he told the newspaper. What once was a fruit and vegetable farm until the Tuttles, according to Fox News, will soon sell meat, fruits, vegetables and eventually have an orchard, said Mr Kozazcki. Centuries old: The farm was in the Tuttle family for almost 400 years . Pick your own: The farm survived for decades as a pick-your-own fruit farm, but will now sell many new items . The farm will eventually have about 20 cows but meat will come from another farm he owns in Newbury, MA., he told the paper, . Mr . Kozazcki expects the farm’s store to open in December, he said, adding . that he will install a memorial plaque in honor of the Tuttle’s near the . entrance. Farming since 1986, the old hand wants to help keep the industry alive as best he can. Hard at work: Mr Kozazcki works on building new fences and posts at Tendercrisp Farm . Steeped in tradition: New owner Matt Kozazcki rests on the handmade cedar fence in front of the old red barn . ‘It’s sad that farms keep going out of business,’ he told the Daily Democrat, ‘I know what it’s like to start with zero.’ According to the New York Times, the farm was started when there were no more than 10,000 colonists in America. It is this longevity, and the history brought with it, that has seen the farm’s 125 acres put under a conservation easement – which protects it from being developed, according to the Daily Democrat.","The farm was in the Tuttle family since 1632 .

"Dating can be a nerve-wracking occasion for any new couple, but it seems the President of the United States managed to impress the First Lady from the first date. Barack Obama took Michelle for lunch at the Art Institute of Chicago in Michigan, before a leisurely stroll to the movies to watch a 1989 Spike Lee film which had just been released. The Obamas gave an interview recalling the first time they went out for dinner as a promotion for a competition the president's campaign is running, offering winners the chance to dine with him and his wife. Scroll down for video . Smooth operator: A clip from the video showing the couple laughing - in the video they told how Barack Obama took Michelle for lunch at the Art Institute of Chicago in Michigan . The 1minute 40 video clip posted online begins with Michelle Obama recalling: 'It was a cool date, we spent the whole day together, he was showing me all facets of his character. We went to the Art Institute.' At which point Barack Obama, wearing a white shirt and striped tie, nods enthusiastically, points his finger at the camera and says: 'Art - guys out there, it impresses people.' Mrs Obama then says that the couple, who married in 1992, 'took a nice long walk down Michigan Avenue' and again Mr Obama smiles and gives a knowing nod to camera saying 'romantic.' Impressive beau: 'It was a cool date, we spent the whole day together, he was showing me all facets of his character. We went to the Art Institute' said Mrs Obama . Dating guru: At the end of the clip Mr Obama grins, shrugs his shoulders, looks at the camera and says 'Take tips gentleman' before winking . The First Lady, who is wearing her trademark pearls and a patterned sheer top, then asks Mr Obama 'Did we go to the movie first?' He thinks for a second and then replies: 'Uh we didn't have dinner we actually had lunch at the Art Institute, there was a little courtyard, with a little fountain.' Mrs Obama smiles and says 'Yeah that was nice' and Mr Obama agrees: 'Yeah it was very nice.' Winning formula: Their first date progressed into further dates and the couple married in October 1992 . The president continues: 'Then we went to see Do The Right Thing' And Mrs Obama nods saying 'Spike Lee - it had just come out. ' 'He showed all the sides - he was hip, cutting edge, cultural, sensitive. The fountain - nice touch,' she continues. Promotion: Mr Obama's campaign have launched a competition for a winner to have 'dinner with President Obama, along with a guest of your choice and four other supporters' 'The walk - patient,' she adds. Mr Obama grins, shrugs his shoulders, looks at the camera and says 'Take tips gentleman' before winking. The interview coincides with a competition his Obama For America campaign have launched which offers winners the opportunity to have 'dinner with President Obama, along with a guest of your choice and four other supporters.' The winners will each receive round-trip tickets for them and a guest from within the fifty U.S. States, DC, or Puerto Rico to a destination to be determined by the sponsor. They will stay in a hotel and have dinner with the president and his wife at an undisclosed location  - the competition states that the package is worth about $4,800. It is not the first time Mr Obama has offered to have dinner with competition winners - earlier this year he dined with a competition winner and George Clooney at the film star's Los Angeles mansion to raise funds for his 2012 re-election campaign. A seat at the A-list dinner, which took place on May 10, was also available without entry into the competition for a reported $40,000 a head.","Made comments to promote competition to win a dinner with Barack Obama .

"Action: The neighbourhood watch group in Josephine County, Oregon, patrol with guns and respond to calls around the clock . Outraged residents in rural Oregon have formed amateur armed patrol groups to replace the budget-stricken police department. The unusual move comes after Josephine County sheriff announced officials will now only respond to life-threatening situations after losing necessary government grants. But county governors, fearful of anarchy, have condemned the organisation, urging citizens to hike their taxes instead. The conflict arose after the national government stopped paying the county's federal timber subsidies - reimbursment for working on the forest - and proposed a tax hike instead. However, when residents opposed the bill the state-funded departments were forced to make radical changes. With 70 per cent of the town made up of woodland, the grant was essential. Prisoners being released from jail and crimes operations were limited to weekdays, 9am-3.30pm. Finally, the Sheriff's Office released a statement urging residents to move if they didn't feel safe as a new policy to only respond to the most serious incidents was unveiled. The statement read: 'The Sheriff's Office regretfully advises that if you know you are in a potentially volatile situation (for example, you are a protected person in a restraining order that you believe the respondent may violate), you may want to consider relocating to an area with adequate law enforcement services.' Defiant, retired law enforcement officer Ken Selig united with the neighbourhood watch group to make up for the shortfall. Armed . with guns, the 12-strong response team have vowed to respond to any . situation, even non-life-threatening, around the clock. The Sheriff urged people who do not feel safe to move to somewhere with a fully-functioned crime department . They are part of a 100-strong community group which meets once a month to discuss crime in the area and debate how to tackle it. Mr Selig has blasted suggestions that the group should concede to raised taxes in a country still coming to terms with the George Zimmerman trial. He also insists the firearms are merely a deterrent to criminals, not meant for practical use. He told Fox News: 'We believe responsible citizens doing responsible things make it hard for criminals to do irresponsible things,' he said. 'The county coffers are at the bottom of the barrel.'","12-strong 'response team' armed with guns will operate around the clock .

"JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, 57, has been branded ‘tone deaf’ after releasing a decadent Christmas card in which he hits tennis balls around his palatial home. The millionaire chief executive of JPMorgan sent out the photo which critics said was like he was saying: ‘Hey, we’re so rich we can destroy our own stuff’. In the photo Dimon, of New York, gleefully swings his tennis racket as his wife Judy, their three daughters and their dog laugh and look relaxed in the background. Jamie Dimon's Christmas card has been branded 'tone deaf' and implies 'hey, we're so rich we can destroy our own stuff' They seem unconcerned that in the room are expensive ornaments, vases, glass and a Jackson Pollock painting which could easily be ruined if a tennis ball went flying through it. Critics said that the card was tasteless in a time of economic hardship as Dimon earns $18.7m a year, making him one of the best compensated bosses in America . JPMorgan has also paid out more than $13billion in fines in the past 12 months for a series of damning financial scandals. The card was sent out to JPMorgan employees in an attempt to generate some festive goodwill at the investment bank. It is a panorama that looks like a Ralph Lauren advert and features Dimon and his wife more than once, along with son-in-law Joey who is leaping into the air. After it was leaked onto the Internet, it quickly became an object of ridicule which some said showed how out of touch Dimon was. In the photo Dimon gleefully swings his tennis racket as his wife Judy, their three daughters and their dog laugh and look relaxed . MSNBC host Chris Hayes said it was as if the Dimon family were saying: ‘Hey, we’re so rich we can destroy our own stuff’, whilst The Atlantic magazine said it was ‘braggy and opulent’ Time magazine said it was ‘maddeningly tone-deaf’ and comedian Stephen Colbert joked that Dimon committed a basic error and that his ‘Christmas card should have been him weeping alone on a pile of money clutching a sled’. Writing on Salon, David Dayen said the message seemed to be: ‘We play tennis in the house because we’re transgressive and also we have billions of dollars and no accountability.’ In terms of his professional life, Dimon would appear to have little to celebrate in 2013. In October JPMorgan agreed a $13billion deal with the US government to end investigations into its selling of mortgage investments in the 2008 financial crisis. Chariman and CEO of JP Morgan Jamie Dimon (pictured) earns $18.7 million a year . During the negotiations Dimon personally met with US Attorney General Eric Holder to thrash out a deal, under which the company admitted to making serious misrepresentations to the public. The fine is the biggest civil settlement with any single company in US history. Only the month before JPMorgan agreed to pay $920million to four US government agencies to settle an investigation into the ‘London Whale’ scandal. Being head of the company during this time has meant that Dimon has become something of a hate figure for unions and left-wing critics. Alan Towers, a senior adviser at Water & Wall Group, a reputation-management firm, told Marketwatch that he thought that Dimon’s Christmas card was designed to show him as a family man. He said: ‘The photo shows a surprising side of Dimon many people would respect: creative, unconcerned with formality in his private life and able to enjoy his family even when under intense public scrutiny. ‘This doesn’t look like a ruthless CEO. Instead, it depicts a very human father and husband letting his hair down.’ The Dimon family put out a Christmas card every year but none so far have been so hubristic as the 2013 version. JPMorgan has paid out more than $13billion in fines in the past 12 months for a series of damning financial scandals (headquarters in New York pictured)","Jamie Dimon has been branded 'tone deaf'
Critics say his card implies: 'Hey, we're so rich we can destroy our own stuff'"
"Your iPhone guzzles more energy than your refrigerator. iPhones burn through significantly more energy than a new mid-sized refrigerator, according to a new study. The average new mid-sized refrigerator uses about 322 kilowatt hours a year while your iPhone uses about 361 kilowatt hours annually. The majority of that energy isn’t used to charge your battery, it’s used to power data centers responsible for the wireless connections and data streaming that bring your device to life. This revelation was made in ‘The Cloud Begins with Coal: Big Data, Big networks, Big Infrastructure and Big Power,’ a paper published by the technology investment advisory Digital Power Group. Energy guzzler: A customer shows her new iPhone 5 at the Apple store in Hong Kong . The world’s communications systems use 1,500 terawatt hours – 10 per cent of global energy and as much as Germany and Japan combined, according to the paper. The usage is equal to total global electricity usage in 1985. Just one terawatt hour is enough to power roughly 90,000 homes for an entire year. With more and more devices being ‘smart’ or ‘connected’ each day, hourly internet traffic is expected to exceed annual internet traffic in the year 2000, the paper says. A lot of energy is needed to power the world’s communications backbone, and a lot more is going to be needed in the future as more and more server farms are fired up to stream Netflix to whatever is in your pocket, backpack or purse. More efficient than an iPhone: This refrigerator uses less energy than an iPhone . By 2035, only slightly less energy will be needed to power ‘the cloud’ than for lights, the paper estimates. It takes more energy to stream a few episodes of Breaking Bad to your iPhone than it does to stamp them onto a DVD and ship them to you, according to the paper. One of the world’s largest consumers of cloud data, not surprisingly, is Apple, and it takes a lot of juice to handle all those iPhones and iPads. Unfortunately, the bulk of this energy comes from coal, over 55 percent in Apple’s case, according to Greenpeace. The SUV of phones: iPhones use more energy than refrigerators . ‘Coal’s dominance arises from the importance of keeping costs down while providing ever-greater quantities of energy to the growing economies, and as the IEA recently noted, the absence of cost-effective alternatives at the scales the world needs,’ says the paper. As long as coal continues to be the world’s cheapest source of energy, it likely will also be the most used, further contributing to global warming. Since global data usage isn’t going to drop, Apple might have the answer. Apple is working towards using 100 per cent renewable energy, and is already 75 per cent of the way there, according to its website. Using solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal power sources, Apple has its sights on becoming as close to carbon neutral as possible – other companies should take note.","The majority of the energy is used for cloud services, not charging the iPhone .
The majority of the energy used to power the cloud comes from coal .
In the next two decades, servers will require almost as much energy as lights ."
"More armed police will patrol Britain’s streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria, David Cameron announced yesterday. He warned that the return of hundreds of murderous extremists posed a greater threat to our security than Al Qaeda or the IRA ever did. His comments came as Theresa May announced the official terror threat level had been raised to ‘severe’ – the second-highest state – for the first time in three years. Scroll down for video . David Cameron today warned that Islamist terrorists cannot be 'appeased' and need to be faced down . Mr Cameron said ISIS was more dangerous than the Taliban and al Qaeda because it was trying to set up its own 'terrorist state' Mr Cameron said the public could expect to see an increase in high-profile police patrols, including the greater use of armed officers, particularly at airports and major railway stations. He called for the public to be vigilant but added they should not panic, saying Britain had shown ‘resolve’ in the face of terror before. He also pledged to introduce ‘uncompromising’ new laws to plug ‘gaps in our armoury’ in dealing with the threat posed by Islamic State extremists, including enhanced powers to remove the passports of radicalised Muslims seeking to join the fighting in the Middle East. Proposals to remove the passports of extremists who have already gone abroad are also being examined. The Home Secretary said the intelligence services now believe a terror attack in Britain is ‘highly likely’, although she stressed there was no information about any specific plot. ‘The increase in the threat level is related to developments in Syria and Iraq where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the West,’ Mrs May said. ‘Some of those plots are likely to involve foreign fighters who have travelled there from the UK and Europe to take part in those conflicts.’ British intelligence officers believe at least 500 British citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to wage jihad, of which about half have returned to this country. Some experts believe the true figure may be far higher. Mr Cameron gave few details of the planned crackdown to combat this threat, which will be revealed to MPs on Monday. Nick Clegg was under intense pressure last night to cease his opposition to new terror laws. Liberal Democrat sources  insisted Mr Clegg had not ruled out beefing up powers to keep the public safe. But they warned he would not allow ‘civil liberties’ to be trampled on. A . source said: ‘Nick takes the terror threat very seriously. He welcomes . the Prime Minister’s rejection of a knee-jerk response and will look . calmly at any new proposals.’ The . two men are said to have discussed the outline of the proposals and . will try to thrash out the details this weekend, before unveiling them . when parliament returns on Monday. There . was speculation at Westminster that Mr Cameron’s dramatic statement . yesterday was designed partly to bounce Mr Clegg into dropping his . opposition. Mr Clegg has repeatedly acted as a roadblock to the introduction of tough new measures designed to keep the public safe. He has argued that many of the measures supported by the security services are illiberal and disproportionate. The . Lib Dem leader has boasted of blocking the so-called ‘Snoopers’ Charter’, which would allow the security services to gather details of . every email and phone call. That is despite warnings from the police and . intelligence services that it is needed to keep track of suspects. Mr Cameron's statement today came after the Home Secretary Theresa May said an attack on the UK was 'highly likely' Critical - an attack is expected imminently . Severe - an attack is highly likely . Substantial - an attack is a strong possibility . Moderate - an attack is possible but not likely . Low - an attack is unlikely . He insisted he would not introduce . ‘knee-jerk’ measures in response to the threat. But he said existing . powers to strip radicalised Muslims of their passports will be beefed . up, to prevent more travelling to the region to fight. Rules introduced . last year have so far resulted in the removal of just 23 passports. The Prime Minister said he also wanted to . see more action to prevent extremists returning from the region. However, he gave few details, saying only that police needed powers to . deal ‘decisively’ with those who have returned. Experts speculated . that this will mean strengthening Terrorism Prevention and Investigation . Measures (Tpims), designed to make it easier for police to keep tabs on . terror suspects. Critics say the measures, introduced after draconian . control orders were thrown out by the courts, are too weak to be . effective. Mr Cameron is considering whether to add a requirement for . suspects to remain at a known address. Tpim subjects could even be . ordered to attend de-radicalisation sessions. Ministers are also . examining whether to revive plans for the so-called Snoopers’ Charter, . which would allow the intelligence services to log details of every . phone call and email, despite opposition from civil liberties . campaigners and Nick Clegg. Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe earlier this week claimed the 'drum beat' of terror had increased . In addition, Mr Cameron is pushing for new . EU laws to require countries to share air passenger data, to make it . easier to track and intercept suspected extremists heading for Syria. The . Prime Minister told a press conference in Downing Street that Britain . is facing a ‘generational battle’ against ‘poisonous’ Islamist . extremists which is likely to last for decades. He said IS was unlike . any previous terrorist threat because it had effectively established a . state from which it could eventually mount attacks on the West. ‘In . Afghanistan the Taliban were prepared to play host to Al Qaeda, the . terrorist organisation. With [IS] we are facing a terrorist organisation . not being hosted in a country but seeking to establish and then . violently expand its own terrorist state. ‘With designs on expanding . up to the Turkish border, we could be facing a terrorist state on the . shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a Nato member.’ Despite this warning, he played down the prospect of joining the US in direct military action. The British Government brought in a new warning system to alert the public to the threat posed by al Qaida and other terror groups in the wake of the July 7 terror atrocity. When it was first published on August 1, 2006, the threat stood at severe - the second highest level. But just over a week later, on August 10, the threat was raised to critical after police exposed a plot to manufacture and smuggle parts of explosives on to passenger jets flying between the UK and the US, and detonate them on board. Counter terrorism police smashed the terror ring, arresting its members in a raid codenamed Operation Overt, and on August 13 the threat level was lowered to severe, where it stayed for around a year. Britain was plunged into a fresh state of heightened alert and the terror threat was raised to critical on June 30, 2007, after a blazing car loaded with propane canisters was driven into a crowded Glasgow Airport. The attack came just one day after two bombs were discovered in cars in London's Park Lane and Piccadilly - among the capital's busiest tourist spots. Police quickly arrested Muslim extremist Bilal Abdullah, a man behind the two attempted attacks. And on July 4 2007 the threat level was lowered to severe, where it stood for two years before being lowered again on July 20 2009 to substantial. But the perils of terrorism came to the forefront again when on Christmas Day 2009 the now-notorious underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up a jumbo jet as it flew to Detroit in the US. Tragedy was only averted when brave passengers overpowered the Nigerian, and terror chiefs decided to raise the British threat level on January 22, 2010, to severe. It stood at severe for 18 months before being lowered on July 11 2011 to substantial, where it stood for three years. Today Home Secretary Teresa May announced the terror threat is again being raised to severe in the wake of warnings of the deadly threat posed by British jihadists radicalised fighting for Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq. The level is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre and the Security Service, which operates out of MI5.","The 'terrorist state' is more dangerous  than al Qaeda, Mr Cameron said .
PM announced new laws will be introduced to remove extremists' passports .
Threat level raised amid fears over UK jihadis returning from Iraq and Syria .
But Theresa May says no evidence to suggest that an attack is imminent .
White House says it is unlikely that the US terror threat will be increased .
Up to 600 British extremists have travelled to the Middle East to join ISIS .
Around 300 UK-linked terrorists are thought to have returned to Britain ."
"A daring aviator today began the world's first ever attempt to cross the Atlantic ocean dangling precariously from a massive cluster of helium-filled balloons. Jonathan Trappe, 39, did not allow heavy fog to put him off his nail-biting journey on Thursday morning and achieved lift-off at 6.20am from Caribou, Maine. Like a fairytale from the Disney movie 'Up', the North Carolina man will attempt to make the 2,500-mile solo trip to Europe relying on 370 colorful balloons filled with helium. It is a feat that has never been attempted before, but Mr Trappe has not allowed that - or the fact that five people have died trying to cross the Atlantic in conventional hot air balloons - to deter him. Jonathan Trappe set off this morning on a 2,500 mile journey across the Atlantic Ocean relying on 370 helium balloons to fly him safely to Europe . Jonathan Trappe is pictured next to the lifeboat which hangs from the balloons ahead of taking off this morning from Caribou, Maine . 'I'm just as afraid of dying as anyone,' he said. 'But I go forward in the spirit of adventure, doing something nobody has achieved before, and to live an interesting life.' A successful crossing will see Trappe . fly into the history books as the first person ever to scale the ocean . in a flight of this type. Incredibly, . winds could see him land anywhere between Iceland and Morocco after a . journey expected to take between three and five days. Trappe . is relying on state-of-the-art weather data from the meteorologist who . advised Felix Baumgartner on his record-breaking skydive from the . stratosphere last year. The latest weather reports before the launch suggested winds would take Trappe to western Europe. Crowds gather to wave the IT specialist off in Caribou, Maine, this morning as he begins his attempt to become the first man to successfully cross the Atlantic in this way . The IT specialist took off at 6.20am this morning in front of volunteers and supporters. His team of meteorologists will monitor his progress using a satellite phone . Though admitting weather was the most dangerous aspect of the journey Mr Trappe was not put off by the thick fog he faced this morning as he hovered above Caribou, Maine . 'Weather . is absolutely the most dangerous factor,' said Trappe speaking . immediately before launch. 'But it's a double-edged sword. It's the only . thing that will carry me across, but bad conditions could also ruin the . attempt or endanger my life.' Trappe and his team had faced an . agonising wait of more than 100 days in Caribou for weather conditions good . enough to carry him across the 'Pond', typical for this time of year. Global . weather systems being monitored by the project meteorologists stared . lining up on Monday, but local storms around Maine threatened to destroy . the cluster balloon system and forced Trappe to stay grounded. Trappe, . an IT technical project manager from Raleigh, North Carolina, said: 'It . was nail biting waiting for a weather window that would allow me to get . up into the air and catch those transatlantic winds we'd been seeing. The latest weather reports suggested winds would take Trappe to western Europe but unpredictable conditions could see him land anywhere between Morocco and Iceland . The IT technical project manager and his team have been waiting almost 100 days for good enough weather conditions to begin the journey which is expected to last between three and five days . Trappe already holds the record for the longest-ever cluster balloon flight after crossing the English Channel in 2012 and the Alps in 2011 when he suspended an office chair from similar helium balloons to those used in this journey . 'I need to get on them and ride them across like a conveyor belt.' During the crossing, Trappe faces climbing as high as 25,000ft to ride the winds that will propel him towards Europe. To ascend he'll drop ballast and will . pop balloons or release them into the air if he needs to fly lower . because favourable winds are at lower altitudes. Trappe already holds the record for the longest ever cluster balloon flight of 14 hours, but said: 'This is far greater than anything achieved before, I'm looking at 62 hours or longer.' Volunteers help inflate the 370 balloons which Trappe will gradually deflate to control his descent once above dry land in several days time . Five people have died in the past trying to make the 2,500 mile journey in conventional hot air balloons or single gas balloons as the result of unexpected winds and storms . 12 previous attempts have been made to traverse the Atlantic Ocean using balloons though none has been successful. In 2008 A Brazilian priest died trying to make the journey using helium filled birthday balloons . Trappe is relying on state-of-the-art weather data from the meteorologist who advised Felix Baumgartner on his record-breaking skydive from the stratosphere last year . The 370 balloons have been attached to a lifeboat which will save Mr Trappe's life if he drops into water at any point in the dangerous journey . Volunteers clutch on to seven helium balloons ahead of Trappe's take off this morning after the journey was put on hold for months due to poor weather conditions . He became the only person to have crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon in May 2010, and the Alps in September 2011. Previous flights have seen him travel . in a simple office chair suspended by the balloons. This time he's . elected to dangle inside a small yellow life boat in case he ditches . into the ocean. 'If I touch . down on water then the attempt will be over as it will be impossible to . take off again, but the boat will keep me alive.' It . will be incredibly dangerous as I could be several days away from any . rescue crew and it will mean surviving rough seas for a long time, . alone.' Colonel Joe Kittinger, 84, who acted as Capsule Communicator during Felix Baumgartner's skydive from space, has aided with preparations for the dangerous journey . Mr Trappe's partner Nidia Ramirez was there to wave him off this morning as he prepares to embark on the 2,500 mile flight which could see him reach altitudes of 25,000ft . Mr Trappe said though he was aware how dangerous the feat is, he wants to live an interesting life and 'go forward in the spirit of adventure' Life imitates art: In the Pixar film, Carl Fredricksen strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the U.S. to South America . While Trappe is the first ever to attempt an Atlantic cluster balloon crossing, five people have died trying to cross the ocean in 12 total attempts using hot-air balloons or more conventional single gas balloons. In 2008, Brazilian priest Adelir Antônio de Carli died after he drifted out to sea while trying to set a record for a flight using helium-filled party balloons. Father Adelir Antonio de Carli began his flight suspended in a harness-like seat from 1,000 balloons in the southern port of Paranagua. He had intended to fly 20 hours due west, but unexpected winds carried the 42-year-old out over the south Atlantic on a southeasterly course. Also advising on the project is aviation hero Colonel Joseph Kittinger. Kittinger, 84, acted as Capsule Communicator during Felix Baumgartner's skydive from space and was the first person to make a solo Atlantic crossing by gas balloon, in 1984. 'I accepted the role of advisor on this project because I want to help a young man achieve his dream, to reach his goal,' said Kittinger. 'Like me, Trappe wants to be remembered for achieving something that nobody has achieved before him. I'm here because I believe he can do it. His planning has been meticulous and if anyone can make this, he can.' The latest update on the IT specialist's blog said he was travelling at 39mph, approximately 70 miles out over the Atlantic from the New Brunswick Coast. Trappe will keep in touch with his team on land via satellite phone. He sent his first message shortly after taking off this morning to Chief Meteorologist, Don Day. It . read: 'DON OK W SPEED & HEAD? I KNOW I AM HIGH. COMING DOWN,' checking the team was happy with the speed the balloons were travelling . at.

"Lucie Blackman's family today said they still do not know how she died, 13 years after her body was found in Japan . The family of Lucie Blackman said today they still do not know how she died 13 years after she was killed in Tokyo by a millionaire Japanese property developer. Lucie was 21 when she disappeared in the Japanese capital where she had been working as a bar hostess in 2000. Her dismembered body was discovered buried in a seaside cave near an apartment owned by Joji Obara, 61, who could not be charged with murder as Lucie’s body was so badly decomposed. He was cleared of manslaughter due to a . lack of evidence but later found guilty of her abduction, dismemberment . and the disposing of her body in 2008 after the Blackman family . appealed. An inquest at Croydon Coroner’s Court today recorded an open verdict into her death. After the hearing Lucie’s father Tim, 60, . said: 'I really hoped they could have gone through it all and came up . with some suggestion of how Lucie died.' Obara is now serving life imprisonment . for what happened to Lucie, as well as the rape and murder of Australian . nightclub hostess Carita Ridgway, who died in Tokyo in 1992, and a . string of rapes on other women. Mr Blackman added he felt ‘let down’ by the Japanese court system, where verdicts are determined by three judges rather than a jury. He . said: 'It is simply not geared up to deal with a case and trial of the . nature of Lucie’s. They depend so heavily on confessionals over there. 'I . can’t imagine if it had been in a British court and such evidence had . been presented to a jury of 12 people they would have originally . directed there was no case to answer. 'The Japanese police were very slow and needed a push to get going but it is the court system that let us down really.' Lucie's father Tim Blackman (left) and sister Sophie listened as the coroner recorded an open verdict today . Japanese police believe Obara, who filmed sex attacks on his drugged victims, could be responsible for up to 900 rapes. Lucie's sister Sophie, who was 19 when she died, said today’s verdict made no difference as ‘Lucie’s still gone.’ She said: 'Today is just a formality for us, the last thing. It’s over in a way, but it will never be closure for us. We still have to live with what happened. 'I think Lucie’s death just reinforces how tragic it is that a 21-year-old girl can go on holiday with her best friend and end up murdered and here we are 13 years later in a dingy coroners court. 'The value of life is so important but it’s family and friends that are left behind who end up living with the sadness of it all. “If it wasn’t for Lucie, a man who had 900 videos of him raping women and killed an Australian girl could still be out there. 'Lucie’s death brought those cases into the public domain and put this serial rapist in prison for the rest of his life.' Recalling the last time she saw her older sister, Sophie, now 33, said: 'It was the night before she flew to Japan. I remember that night I slept with her in her bed. Joji Obara (left) is serving life imprisonment for the abduction of Lucie (right) and dismembering and disposing of her body. He has also been convicted of the murder of Australian Carita Ridgeway . 'It was such a long time ago. But life goes on, we have to move forward and just cope with things as best we can.' She said the hardest times were family occasions, Christmas and Lucie’s birthday. On September 1 this year she would have turned 35. Her dad Tim added: 'The thing I find hardest is the life we would have had with Lucie. 'Many of her friends are now married and have children. Having her future taken away from us and not being able to share it with her is what is most difficult to deal with.' Earlier the inquest heard several post mortems were performed in Japan and the UK which revealed traces of sedatives and the ‘date-rape’ drug Rohypnol were found in her body. An unidentified black substance was also found in her mouth. Coroner Dr Roy Palmer said: 'It’s been an awful long time I know. I think it is the longest case that I can think of without being concluded. Even now we don’t have all the answers we’d like.' Sophie Blackman, pictured with her sister, said the family will never have 'closure' over her death . Croydon Coroners' Court coroner Dr Roy Palmer recorded an open verdict and admitted the family were not given 'answers that would in any way satisfy you' He told Lucie’s family: 'I’m so very, very sorry you lost Lucie in such sad circumstances and that no one’s been able to give the answers that would in any way satisfy you.' The inquest heard former British Airways air hostess Lucie had only been in Japan with her friend Louise Phillips, also 21, two months before she went missing on July 1, 2000. That night she had been working at the Casablanca hostess club and is believed to have gone back to Obara’s apartment. When she failed to return the next day her friend reported her missing. Lucie’s parents made several visits to Japan and spent thousands of pounds trying to find her. But her remains were found on a beach 60miles from Tokyo, near Obara’s apartment, in February 2001. She was identified by DNA but the coroner said without a cause of death he must record an open verdict. Lucie’s family have since set up the Lucie Blackman Trust to help other families cope with the deaths of their relatives abroad and provide assistance to them.","Inquest into Lucie Blackman's death in Japan recorded open verdict .

"Hillary Clinton's fellow Democrats smell blood in the water after her recent gaffes over her considerable wealth and they began pouncing on the presidential hopeful on Monday. Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina, framed his insult in terms the fictional aristocratic Crawley family and their servants could understand. 'I don't know whether it’s just that she’s been ""Madam Secretary"" for so long, but she’s generating an imperial image,' Harpootlian told The Washington Post. 'She’s been living 30, going on 40 years with somebody bringing your coffee to you every morning. Is it more Downton Abbey than it is America?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Hard fall: Hillary Clinton has been on a downward slide since launching her book last week, fending off tough questions about her immense wealth . Woman of the people: Clinton mingled and signed books on Monday with fans at the Tattered Cover, a trendy, upscale bookstore in Denver . Not 'truly well off': Clinton is having a nightmare of a PR week after self-inflicted wounds about her $200,000 speeches and her multiple mansions . Lady Hillary? Her silver-spoon lifestyle is opening up the former first lady and secretary of state to charges that she's living a 'Downton Abbey' lifestyle that Americans won't recognize in 2016 . Harpootlian, like more than half of the Democratic establishment, backed President Barack Obama in his epic battle with Hillary for the 2008 presidential nomination. He's also an ally of Vice President Joe Biden, who took his cue Monday morning and asked the audience at the White House's 'Working Families Summit' to cut him some slack because his personal wealth falls short of the Clintons'. 'Don't hold it against me that I don't own a single stock or bond,' Biden said. 'Don't hold it – I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension and I get a good salary.' He declared himself 'the poorest man in Congress.' As vice president, Biden officially presides over the U.S. Senate and can cast tie-breaking votes. Biden's financial disclosures suggest a net worth of around $800,000, enough to put him in America's often derided '1 per cent.' But Bill and Hillary Clinton's balance sheet has been estimated at between $50 and $100 million. The former first lady and secretary of state told the Guardian this weekend that she is 'unlike a lot of people who are truly well off.' And last week she tripped over her wallet during what was supposed to be a political coming-back-out party in conjunction with a book release, explaining how she and the former president had struggled to afford mortgages on their estates. 'Their estates – more than one,' CNN anchor Alison Kosik giggled Monday morning while reporting the story. 'I don’t know what to do with my millions,” co-host Miguel Marquez jabbed back. 'It’s very tough.' Bill and Hillary Clinton outside their home in upstate Chappaqua, New York. It was worth an estimated $1.7 million in 2001 . The Clintons own several homes, including this three-storey house in Washington DC. The average home in the neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia . Clinton's handlers have done a substandard job of managing her image this year, setting up ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer with a tour of her $5 million Washington, D.C. home and its lush, Edwardian interiors. 'Swimming pools and Ming vases are just not going to resonate with working stiffs,' an Obama White House insider told MailOnline on Monday. 'Unless half the voters hit the lottery next year, they're just not going to be excited about her.' Another told the Post that wealth is 'going to be a massive issue for her. When you're somebody like the secretary of state or president of the United States or first lady, you’re totally cut off [from normal activity], so your perception of the middle-class reality gets frozen in a time warp.' Asked what Democrats should do, the adviser said: 'Panic.' Obama's inner circle, like Joe Biden, is feeling in the dark for levers of power to move after Obama leaves office. And given the president's legendary feuds with the Clintons, Hillary represents a door slammed on them in the future. 'I hate that man Obama more than any man I've ever met, more than any man who ever lived,' Bill Clinton once said of Obama after he suggested in 2008 that the former president was a racist, according to a new book. And Obama angered Bill Clinton by suggesting that Michelle Obama would make just as appealing a presidential candidate as Hillary Clinton. With their party's most enduring marriage of convenience falling apart, the Obamas are free to cut the Clintons loose – and Hillary is left to defend herself. It takes a village: Clinton is on a nationwide tour to boost flagging sales of her hardcover memoir . Former South Carolina Democratic Chairman Dick Harpootlian (L) is a close ally of Vice President Joe Biden, which may explain his pot-shot at Hillary . 'Whoever thinks she has lost touch is clearly not in touch with her or her long-held beliefs,' Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Post. 'If they were, they’d know that reducing inequality and increasing upward mobility has been an uninterrupted pursuit of hers through every job she’s held and continues to this day in her work at the Clinton Foundation.' She hasn't, however, driven a car in 18 years, bringing to mind the media-created 1992 frenzy when then-President George H.W. Bush seemed disconnected from ordinary Americans when he saw a demonstration of a new kind of grocery scanner technology. 'Every time that she tries to talk in some populist voice, it’s completely inauthentic,' former George W. Bush strategist Matthew Dowd told the Post. 'At a time when the country is anti-Washington and anti-Wall Street, she represents both.'","'She's generating an imperial image,' warned a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman .

"Hate: Bill Clinton allegedly hates Barack Obama and this animosity stems from accusations of racism against the former president during Obama's 2008 defeat of Hillary Clinton . The simmering cauldron of hatred that exists between the Obamas and the Clintons threatens to explode in a volcanic eruption that could threaten all Democrat chances in 2016, says a sensational new book. Despite their much-vaunted public truce, journalist Edward Klein claims in 'Blood Feud' that Bill Clinton despises President Obama and that Michelle refers to Hillary behind closed doors as the 'Hildebeest'. The animosity between the Democratic Party's two power couples has reached such intensity that Klein says the president is willing to renege on his promise to endorse Hillary for 2016 and has teased the Clintons with suggestions that Michelle would be a strong candidate for the Oval Office. Dating back to then Senator Obama's defeat of Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination they believed was theirs, Bill has never forgiven Obama for allegations he made during that bitter campaign. 'I hate that man Obama more than any man I've ever met, more than any man who ever lived,' said Bill Clinton to a friend after Obama suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to Klein's book, excerpts of which appear in The New York Post. Indeed, despite President Obama bringing Hillary into his cabinet as Secretary of State after his storming victory in 2008, her presence only proved to antagonize relations between the two couples. Scroll down for video . Gossip and teasing: According to Edward Klein, Michelle Obama likes to make fun of Hillary Clinton over a glass of wine at the end of the day . No love lost; Despite having her in his cabinet as Secretary of State, President Clinton is wavering over his endorsement of Hillary Clinton (both seen here in 2011) for the 2016 nomination . According to an account of Klein's explosive allegations in The New York Post, Michelle Obama would sit in the evenings with her trusted adviser, Valerie Jarrett to gossip and make fun of Hillary over a bottle of Chardonnay. They nicknamed Hillary the 'Hildebeest', in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the Serengeti. In the run up to the 2012 election, President Obama's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure-touch of Bill Clinton if he wanted to secure a second term. Controversial: Edward Klein's new book lays bare the anger and hatred at the heart of the relationship between the Clintons and the Obamas . Loathe to do this, President Obama finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in September 2011, to ask for his help. 'I’m not going to enjoy this,' Bill told Hillary according to Klein. 'I’ve had two successors since I left the White House — Bush and Obama — and I’ve heard more from Bush, asking for my advice, than I’ve heard from Obama. I have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever,' Clinton said. 'I really can’t stand the way Obama ­always seems to be hectoring when he talks to me. 'Sometimes we just stare at each other. It’s pretty damn awkward. Now we both have favors to ask each other, and it’s going to be very unpleasant. But I’ve got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side.' The golf game was petty, tetchy and not without incident. President Clinton . immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding Obama that he . presided over an economic golden age, while Obama was struggling to . affect any change during the Great Recession. Hammering . home his point, Bill Clinton told President Obama that obviously he and Hillary . would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be 'the . most qualified, most experienced candidate, perhaps in history.' This rankled with President Obama, acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the White House. 'And . so Bill continued to talk about Hillary’s qualifications . . . and the . coming campaign in 2016,' writes Klein as featured in The New York Post. Deal: According to Edward Klein, Bill Clinton agreed to fully campaign for Barack Obama on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016 . 'But . Barack didn’t bite. He changed the subject several times. Then . suddenly, Barack said something that took Bill by complete surprise. He . said, ‘You know, Michelle would make a great presidential candidate, . too.’ 'Bill was speechless. Was Barack comparing Michelle’s qualifications to Hillary’s? 'Bill . said that if he hadn’t been on a mission to strike a deal with Barack, . he might have stormed off the golf course then and there.' A deal was struck nonetheless. Bill delivered a barnstorming speech to the Democratic National Convention, which threatened to upstage the president himself. However, the Clintons both felt that the president was wavering in his commitment to endorse Hillary for 2016 as his side of the bargain. In an effort to smooth over the rising tensions, the Obamas hosted the Clintons on March 1, 2013 at a dinner - the day that the $85billion 'sequester' budget cuts went into effect. The meal could go down as the moment that all bets were off in the two couple's political marriage of necessity. According to Klein, who spoke to those with knowledge of the dinner, Bill couldn't help hectoring the president about his handling of the economy. Hillary, attempting to change the subject asked Michelle if it was true she might copy her and run as a Senator, in Illinois, after her husband left office. Michelle demurred to answer and allegedly Bill was stunned that Hillary would have shown her hand so openly. The back-and-forth between the four grew steadily more icy. Tetchy: The two Democrats endure an icy relationship which is not helped by their enduring animosity towards each other . Bill suggested that the president turn over his much-vaunted social media enabled campaign know-how to the Democratic party at large. 'You have to use your organization to aid the candidate in 2016,' Bill pressed Obama. 'Really?' replied a sarcastic Obama, according to Klein. Things deteriorated as President Clinton continued to lecture the table as the president began to ignore his guests and check his Blackberry. According to Klein, Hillary tried to change the subject again and asked if Barack Obama was happy he wouldn't have to campaign again, especially because he didn't seem to like it. 'For a guy who doesn’t like it,' Obama replied, 'I’ve done pretty well.' Marriage of necessity: The Clintons fear that the Obamas will renege on their promise to support Hillary in 2016 . 'Well,' Bill said according to Klein in The New York Post, 'I was glad to pitch in and help get you re-elected.' The after-effects of that meal are still being felt. The Clintons have become convinced that Obama will not back Hillary for 2016 and that he is seeking to endorse Vice-President Joe Biden or a new, young politician, just like he was. 'He’s convinced himself he’s been a brilliant president, and wants to clone himself — to find his Mini-Me,' says Bill Clinton to Chelsea according to Klein. 'He’s hunting for someone to succeed him, and he believes the American people don’t want to vote for someone who’s been around for a long time. He thinks that your mother and I are what he calls ""so 20th century"". He’s looking for ­another Barack Obama.'","New book, 'Blood Feud' alleges that Bill Clinton hates Barack Obama for accusing him of being racist .

"Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna, and has recently entered a new eruptive phase.

Mount Etna stands almost 11,000ft (3.4km) above sea level, looming over the whole Italian island of Sicily. It has been active for thousands of years, although its first eruption of modern times was thought to be in 475 BC. In 1669, a series of blasts killed 20,000 people and destroyed Catania. But farmers stayed in the area because the constant eruptions made the ground fertile. Smoke rises from Mount Etna on the southern Italian island of Sicily near Catania on August 13, 2014 . In 1992, Etna posed another serious threat when lava streams headed towards Zafferana, a town of 7,000 people, but they Italian and U.S soldiers managed to control the explosions and divert the flow. Volcanic ash clouds can pose problems for aircraft. The immense ash clouds that erupted from Iceland’s Eyjafjallajoekull volcano in 2010 caused chaos for the airline industry.

"The hospital where one man died of Ebola and two nurses treating him contracted the deadly virus has seen a steep and sharp decline in patients. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, has become a 'ghost town,' with patients cancelling previously scheduled appointments for procedures and surgeries and others going out of their way to travel to other facilities even in emergency situations. This after the hospital took in a patient infected with Ebola on September 30, Thomas Eric Duncan, who later died at the facility on October 8. Scroll down for video .

First case: Thomas Eric Duncan (above), was admitted to the hospital on September 30 with Ebola and died on October 8 . A few days later, on October 12, Nina Pham, a nurse who cared for Duncan, was confirmed to have contracted the deadly disease. Then, on October 15, another nurse who cared for Duncan, Amber Vinson, also tested positive for Ebola. Pham, who is currently being treated at the National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, was recently downgraded from good to fair condition, while Vinson, who is being treated at Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, has been in stable condition since being admitted. There are also fears that a third woman who handled some of Duncan's specimens may have been exposed to the virus, and she has been quarantined aboard a Carnival cruise ship during the possible incubation period for the virus.

"Bernie Madoff is said to be in an ‘alternate reality’ where he does not feel he is to blame for losing more than $50billion of other people's money. A reporter claimed the former Wall St titan believes he is as much a victim as the thousands of people who lost their life savings in his Ponzi scheme. The fraudster, serving a 150 year prison sentence, is also considering his first TV interview from behind bars, said Fox reporter Charlie Gasparino. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Fraudster Bernie Madoff is said to be in an 'alternate reality' where he does not feel he is to blame for losing over $50billion of other people's money . The Today show is said to have filmed at the Butner, North Carolina, prison where Madoff is serving his sentence. Madoff admitted to reporter Charlie Gasparino that he is considering his first sit down TV interview to give his side of the story. He said he had made one commitment to a network and an interview could be ‘weeks away.’ Mr Gasparino revealed the prospect of the interview following a series of telephone and email conversations with the fraudster. He said Madoff sounded on the phone like a kindly uncle rather than a master criminal. ‘His voice is the most amazing, soothing voice,’ Mr Gasparino told ‘Good Morning America’ Talks: Madoff told Fox Business Network reporter Charlie Gasparino that he is considering his first sit down TV interview to give his side of the story . ‘You really feel like you're talking to your uncle, your nice, rich uncle who's a nice guy and, you know, you don't feel like you're talking to an arch-criminal.’ ‘His voice is the most amazing, soothing voice.

You know, I was part of a racket, which is Wall Street. And by the way, my clients all knew I was ripping people off. ‘“They were forcing me to do this because they had such high expectations.

"Lerner offered a defensive opening statement during a May 22 House Oversight Committee hearing, and then refused to answer questions. Republcians argued that she waived her Fifth Amendment rights . Lois Lerner, the IRS official who presided over a partisan program that targeted conservative organizations because of their political beliefs, will retire on Monday with a full pension package, a source at the Department of Treasury told MailOnline. Lerner, 62, has been a federal government employee since at least 1981, making her eligible for the most robust retirement package the federal government offers career employees. In May Lerner herself launched the scandal that would eventually claim her job, by answering a planted question about how the IRS handled politically oriented groups that applied for tax-exempt status. In less than a day, tea party groups were complaining loudly that their applications had been stalled, in some cases for more than three years. Less than two weeks later, Lerner refused to testify in a congressional hearing about the IRS's conduct, invoking her Fifth Amendment right  against self-incrimination. But by making an opening statement defending herself, House Republicans said, she waived that right. Congressional staff told reporters . that an internal IRS review board had concluded Lerner was guilty of . neglecting her duties, and was about to propose that she should be . fired. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The IRS scandal has had the opposite effect on tea party groups from what Lerner may have intended, galvanizing them against what they see as an intrusive government. Tea Party Patriots held an 'Audit the IRS' rally on June 19 in Washington . Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, told The Washington Times that while an Accountability Review Board was set to recommend Lerner's ouster, it found no evidence of political bias. Lerner . is still subject to subpoena and may return to testify in either the . House Ways and Means or Oversight committee. That investigation could . have resulted in her termination. Initially, . she claimed that the IRS's politically skewed targeting of conservative . groups was driven by a handful of rogue employees in the Cincinnati, . Ohio office where she worked. But documents later surfaced, including some of her own emails, which contradicted that claim and appeared to point to senior managers in Washington, D.C. along with Lerner herself. The House Ways and Means Committee released some of those emails last week, including one that showed Lerner singled out tax-exempt applications from organizations that described themselves as 'tea party' groups, and ordered that the requests should be held in limbo. Until Monday, Lerner was on administrative leave, collecting her full salary. 'Just because Lois Lerner is retiring from the IRS does not mean the investigation is over. Far from it,” Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a statement. 'In fact, there are many serious, unanswered questions that must be addressed so we can get to the truth.' Hatch is the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the IRS. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reminded reporters in May that President Obama had sought the resignation of the acting IRS commissioner, just days after the tea party scandal erupted. But the West Wing has been silent on Lerner's departure . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman David Camp, a Michigan Republican, released previously secret emails last week showing the Lerner knew early on what the IRS was up to . Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican whose House committee has been a consistent thorn in IRS's side since the scandal broke, said Monday that Lerner's departure 'does not alter the Oversight Committee’s interest in understanding why applicants for tax exempt status were targeted and inappropriately treated because of their political beliefs.' 'We still don’t know why Lois Lerner, as a senior IRS official, had such a personal interest in directing scrutiny and why she denied improper conduct to Congress. Her departure does not answer these questions or diminish the Committee’s interest in hearing her testimony.' The IRS said Monday that it 'has taken decisive actions to correct failures in exempt organizations management, replacing top leadership throughout the chain of command.' 'Our goal is to restore the public's faith and trust in the tax system,' the statement added. 'We have sent nearly 400,000 pages of documents to Congress and facilitated dozens of employee interviews. We look forward to continuing to cooperate with Congress and other investigations.' The White House, which trumpeted its May . demand for the resignation of former Acting IRS Commissioner Steven . Miller, has not commented on Lerner's departure. House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R) and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (L) have crossed swords over claims that the IRS systematically delayed and unfairly scrutinized tax-exempt status applications from right-wing groups . The Office of Personnel Management provides 1.1 per cent of a retiree's salary for every year worked, provided he or she is a 20-year veteran who is at least 62. Lerner's base pension would be be calculated based on what she earned, on average, during the past 36 months. According to the Federal Election Commission, Lerner joined its General Counsel’s Office in 1981, and was appointed in 1986 to head the agency's Enforcement Division. 'Prior to joining the FEC, she was a staff attorney in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice,' the FEC said in a 2000 news release. It's not clear when she first came to work at the DOJ, or what her annual salary was. But if she were in the middle of the senioer-level 'GS-15' earning scale and worked just one year in the DOJ as a staff attorney before joining the FEC, she would collect 1.1 per cent of $140,259 for each of 33 years -- for a total of more than $50,900 per year in taxpayer dollars. If Lerner's position as a top IRS enforcer were to place her in a special 'law enforcement officer' retirement category, that amount would jump to over $61,700. In 2010 the U.S. median personal income was just over $29,000. Lerner will receive 50 percent credit for any unused sick leave she has accrued, according to an attorney at the Office of Personnel Management. She could also seek other full-time employment in a law firm or an advocacy group, and still keep her government pension as a secondary source of income.","The notorious former chief of tax-exempt groups at the IRS has been on paid leave for more than three months .

"A North Dakota couple was joyfully reunited with their 3-year-old little boy in the early morning Tuesday after several frantic hours of search and it's all thanks to their farm dog Cooper. Carson Urness had been playing outside in the chilly early spring all day Monday when his mother Courtney went to bring him in for dinner. But when the toddler was nowhere to be found, it kicked off an hours-long manhunt that ended like the most heartwarming of Lassie tales. Panic: Carson Urness disappeared from his North Dakota front yard Monday and a 200-person manhunt ensued...but his rescue came down to just a single dog . Vanished: Carson had been playing outside all day. But when his mom went out to take him in for dinner, he was gone . 'I lost it I guess you could say,' Courtney Urness told WDAY from her expansive family farm in Cooperstown. Though it was May, it was sure to get cold at night in rural North Dakota. The only thing keeping the young mom remotely calm was the knowledge her dog was missing along with little Carson. 'You think of the worst, but then I knew Cooper was gone.

I just didn't realize that he would actually be keeping him warm and protecting him,' Courtney said. Her husband agreed: 'I was really proud of him.'

But on Tuesday the focus was on Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's new relationship, rather than her policies. By her side at the Melbourne Cup Carnival was businessman David Panton, and the pair are said to have been dating for around six months, the Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video .

Mr Panton also has a son Matt (left) and recently relocated to the Sydney beachside suburb of Manly . Fairfax poll found Ms Bishop (left) and Tony Abbott (right) both have 20 percent support from voters in preferred leadership stakes . As Australia's first female Foreign Minister and the Liberal Party's first female Deputy Leader, Ms Bishop's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months. A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop is now level with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the preferred leadership stakes, who both have 20 per cent of support. This has been attributed to her strong showing on the international stage - particularly throughout the MH17 crisis in Ukraine - and her calm handling of government affairs in Australia. After the figures were released on Tuesday - Melbourne Cup day - she attended Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne with her new love, confirming to the Daily Telegraph the pair had been dating for six months. But it appears Ms Bishop has no plans of taking the country's top job as she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she is: 'Living the dream and loving the job'.

When Ms Bishop met Bono during her time as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition . 'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said. 'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.' Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent in June to 20 percent. But both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister fall into second place behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who remains the overall choice with 35 percent support. The Fairfax poll of 1,401 voters, carried out between Thursday and Sunday, found female voters heavily favoured Mr Turnbull or Ms Bishop. The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security in recent months, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine. The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies. Ms Bishop also created close ties with US Secretary of State John Kerry as they signed a Force Posture Agreement during the AUSMIN talks at Admiralty House in Sydney in August this year. She has also met with powerful figures including US President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Bono - the frontman of music group U2 - during her time in politics.

Ms Bishop is pictured in 1996, about the time when she was inspired to enter federal politics after attending Harvard Business School in Boston . Ms Bishop grew up on a cherry farm in Adelaide Hills, east of Adelaide, as she attended the prestigious St Peter's Collegiate Girls School where she later graduated as head prefect in 1973. She was also class captain and debating champion, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ms Bishop went on to study law at Adelaide University and graduated in 1978. Whilst completing an eight-week advanced management program at Harvard Business School in Boston in 1996, she was inspired to enter politics. Two years later, Ms Bishop won pre-selection for the Liberal Party for the seat of Curtin, Western Australia. Since then, she's gained a number of titles having served as a Cabinet Minister in the Howard Government as Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues and the Minister for Ageing. Ms Bishop married Perth property developer Neil Gillam in 1983 but divorced in 1988. Afterwards the Foreign Minister dated former Lord Mayor of Perth Dr Peter Nattrass for at least 12 years before stepping out with her new man yesterday.

"A father was shot by terrorists as he bravely shielded a four-year-old child from gunfire when the Nairobi mall came under attack. Simon Belcher, who was privately educated in Britain, was hiding under a car with his wife and the child, who was not related to them, when the Kenyan military began returning fire on the Al Shabaab militants. As the terrorists ducked to avoid the gunfire, they spotted the group and shot Mr Belcher. The bullet went through his shoulder and chest, but miraculously missed his vital organs.

"Earth is 365 million miles (588 million km) away from Jupiter and 830 million miles (1.3 billion km) from Saturn. But these heavyweights of our solar system have a huge influence on what goes on in our planet, and could be to thank for humanity's existence. The orbits of these planets are keeping our world moving in a circular path at just the right distance from the sun for life to flourish. Moving Saturn's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out Earth's orbit by tens of millions of miles. This view is looking towards the sunlit side of Saturn’s rings from about 25 degrees above the ringplane . Moving Saturn's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out Earth's orbit by tens of millions of miles. This is according to Elke Pilat-Lohinger of the University of Vienna, Austria, who has developed computer models to understand how Jupiter and Saturn affected the shape of other planets' orbits. Using a simple model that did not include other inner planets, Professor Pilat-Lohinger found that the greater the tilt, the more the elongation in Earth's orbit, according to a report by Jeff Hecht in the New Scientist. Jupiter's gravity, which is 2.5 times stronger than that of Earth's, is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own. When Mars and Venus were added to the model, the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly, but Saturn's tilt still had a major influence on Earth . When Mars and Venus were added to the model, the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly, but Saturn's tilt still had a major influence on Earth. It is known as the 'Death Star' due to a crater making it look like the Star Wars weapon. However, astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about Saturn's moon Mimas. The moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water. It has a tell-tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular, solid structure. Mimas is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 246 miles (396km). The researchers offer two explanations for the wobble: either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface, or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball. Apart from these gentle 'librations', Mimas otherwise presents the same face to Saturn throughout its orbit. The model found that 20-degree tilt of Saturn would bring the Earth's orbit closer to the sun than Venus. It would also cause Mars to leave the solar system entirely. In a similar study earlier this year, the University of New South Wales and Royal Holloway University of London, ran various computer models of our solar system. With each iteration, the planets in the solar system remained in their place while Jupiter moved around in different obits, ranging from circular to elliptical. The scientists also moved the entire orbit of Jupiter inwards and outwards to test what would have happened if the planet had formed closer to the sun, or further away. Each simulation was taken through a million year time frame, recording where Earth would have been every 100 years as a result of Jupiter's position. 'The default assumption is this is something that is important,' said Jonti Horner, an astronomer and astrobiologist at the University of Southern Queensland. 'There's a lot of flexibility where Jupiter will be, and you would assume that you'd have a very smooth, very gentle variation in how the Earth's orbit behaves over time.' While Jupiter's locations resulted in little change in Earth's orbit and tilt, the effect on Earth's climate remained unclear. Jupiter's gravity, which is 2.5 times stronger than that of Earth's, is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own .","Bringing Saturn's orbit 10 per cent closer to sun creates a tug on Earth .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un executed his uncle by having him stripped naked and eaten alive by starving dogs while he watched, a report claimed yesterday. Jang Song-Thaek was said to have been thrown into a cage with his five closest aides, after which 120 hounds which had been starved for three days were released, eating the men until there was nothing left. The horrifying details emerged in a report in Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper, which said the gruesome act was known as ‘quan jue’, or ‘execution by dogs’. Brutal: Jang Song-Thaek, in blue suit and handcuffs being escorted in court on December 12, was executed by wild dogs, according to reports coming from China . In previous executions, political . prisoners were killed by firing squads with machine guns, although one . aide was tied to a post and a mortar round was fired at him. The . report said the ‘quan jue’ lasted an hour, and Kim was said to have . watched the stomach-churning ‘show’ along with 300 senior officials. Analysts . said the tyrant had probably invited the officials to the death . ceremony as a warning that they should not step out of line and remain . faithful not only to him but also to the Stalinist regime. Kim had . described his 67-year-old uncle – who was married to his father’s sister . – as a traitor, a womaniser and a ‘despicable human scum – worse than a . dog’. It was previously thought he had been executed by firing squad. Family: Kim Jong-Un (right) applauds at a show as his uncle, Jang Song-Thaek (left), looks on .

Singapore paper was quoting China’s official newspaper, Wen Wei Po, . which was published in Hong Kong on December 12, although details . emerged only yesterday. The . savage death of Kim’s uncle sent shockwaves through the authoritarian . state, showing no one was safe – even family members. Kim’s 19-year-old . nephew fled his university campus in Paris after the execution and has . gone into hiding. North Korean justice: The tribunal in the capital Pyongyang which apparently ordered Jang Song Thaek's death . Family: Shown with his powerful nephew during a military parade in February last year, Jang Song Thaek (left) was once the second most powerful man in North Korea. Some say he was seen as a threat . The . tyrant’s ruthless streak was documented last year when it was claimed he . had a former lover executed because she appeared in a porn film. South . Korean newspapers said singer Hyon Song-wol and 11 others were arrested . in August for violating North Korea’s laws against pornography and were . executed, possibly by firing squad, three days later. The . condemned, all members of the performing groups Unhasu Orchestra and . Wangjaesan Light Music Band, were accused of making videos of . themselves  having sex and selling the videos for distribution in China. Other band members as well as the families of the victims were made to . watch the mass execution. Revelations: Kim Jong-un used his New Year's speech to defend the recent execution for treason of Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and North Korean second most powerful man of the past decades . Authoritarian: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (seventh from the right) visits the mausoleum of his father Kim Jong-il, late North Korean leader, at Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang on New Year's Day . The . Straits Times said the report of the ‘quan jue’ vividly depicted the . brutality of the young North Korean leader and the fact that it appeared . in a Beijing-controlled newspaper showed that China no longer cared . about its relations with the Kim regime. Two . days after the initial newspaper report, The Global Times, which is . associated with the People’s Daily, a Chinese Communist Party outlet, . published an editorial saying that the abrupt political change in North . Korea epitomised the backwardness of the country’s political system. And . it warned its own government not to cosy up to North Korea any longer, . claiming that the majority of the Chinese people were ‘disgusted’ with . the Kim regime. Writing in . the Straits Times, analyst Ching Cheong said the story, along with the . stern editorial, provided a measure of the extent of Beijing’s loathing. ‘In purging a top official . known for his close ties with Beijing in such a brutal manner, . Pyongyang (the North Korean capital) did not hide its antagonism towards . China,’ he wrote. Kim Jong-Un is no stranger to ordering brutal crackdowns on anyone even suspected of posing a political threat - no matter how close the relationship. The dictator had his former lover singer Hyon Song-wol, pictured right, executed by machine gun amid claims that she had been appearing in pornographic videos. Hyon was among a dozen singers, musicians and dancers from two pop groups who were machine-gunned to death on August 20, last year. The savage death of Kim's uncle sent shock waves through the authoritarian state, showing no one was safe - even family members. Kim's teenage nephew fled to a university campus in Paris after the execution of Jang Song-Thaek. The 19-year-old's name was removed from the postbox at prestigious social science university Sciences-Po, which saw South Korean media report that he was hiding for fear of his safety. Fears also mounted last month that Kim's wife Ri Sol-Ju had fallen out of favour with the tempestuous leader. She had not been seen publicly for weeks and was not present in an official photograph, provoking speculation . But these were largely eased when a video was released showing her with Kim Jong-Un at a memorial service to mark the second anniversary of his father's death.","A pack of 120 starving dogs were set on Jang Song Thaek and five aides .

"On a morning the stock market was sailing to a record high and a chilly storm was blowing into Silicon Valley, Wendy Carle stuck her head out of the tent she calls home to find city workers duct taping an eviction notice to her flimsy, flapping shelter walls. 'I have no idea where I'm going to go,' she said, tugging on her black sweatshirt over her brown curls and scooping up Hero, an albino dog. She glanced at the glimmering windows on a cluster of high-tech office buildings just blocks away and shook her head. Kicked out: Wendy Clarke, left, holds her neighbor's dog Hero as she is handed an eviction notice by San Jose city worker Rita Tabaldo as city worker Mark Ruffing, center, attaches a notice to a Clarke's tent at a tent city in San Jose, California . 'Did you know Google shares hit $840 each this morning?' she asked. 'I just heard that on the radio.' Carle, who did not want to give her age, used to manage apartments. Today she lives on a Supplemental Security Income disability payment of $826 a month due to back and joint problems. The Silicon Valley is adding jobs faster than it has in more than a decade as the tech industry roars back. Stocks are soaring and fortunes are once again on the rise. But a bleaker record is also being set this year: Food stamp participation just hit a 10-year high, homelessness rose 20 percent in two years, and the average income for Hispanics, who make up one in four Silicon Valley residents, fell to a new low of about $19,000 a year. This capped a steady 14 percent drop . over the past five years, according to the annual Silicon Valley Index . released by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, representing businesses, and . the philanthropic Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Simply put, while the ultra-rich are getting even richer, record numbers of Silicon Valley residents are slipping into poverty. 'Cleanup': An eviction notice posted by San Jose city workers is shown on a tree at a tent city in San Jose, last Tuesday . 'In the midst of a national economic recovery led by Silicon Valley's resurgence, as measured by corporate profits and record stock prices, something strange is going on in the Valley itself. Most people are getting poorer,' said Cindy Chavez, executive director of San Jose-based Working Partnerships USA, a nonprofit advocating for affordable housing, higher minimum wages and access to health care. Nowhere is this growing disparity more obvious than this sprawling and trash-strewn 28-acre tent city that authorities are trying to clean out. Beneath the sweeping shadow and roar of jets soaring in and out of nearby San Jose's international airport, residents here say times are so tight they have nowhere else to turn. 'This is the most ridiculous place ever,' said Kristina Erbenich, 38, clambering onto her bike, a heavy pack on her back. The former chef said she spent $14,000 on hotel rooms before her savings ran out. 'If everyone around here is so rich, why can't they do something to help?' Aid: Kathy Jackson, CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank, gives a tour of the supply area at Second Harvest Food Bank. Record numbers of Silicon Valley residents are slipping into poverty . United Way Silicon Valley CEO Carole Leigh Hutton wonders the same thing. 'How is it that in an area so very rich, we have so many people so very poor? Why can't we break that cycle? 'With all the brain power in the Silicon Valley, we should be able to solve these problems. But what we need is the collective will.' The causes for the growing disparity are complex, but largely come down to one thing: a very high cost of living. The median home price is $550,000, and rents average just under $2,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in this region that is home to many of the nation's wealthiest companies including Facebook, Apple Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Google. For a family of four, just covering basic needs like rent, food, childcare and transportation comes to almost $90,000 a year, according to the nonprofit Insight Center for Community Economic Development. 'The fact is that we have an economy now that's working well only for those at the very top,' said Lawrence Mishel at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington D.C. 'Unless we adopt a new approach to economic policy, we're going to continue going down this path, which means growth that does not really benefit the great majority of people in this country.' Nationally, Mishel says the declining value of the federal minimum wage is a major factor driving inequality. On Monday, in an effort to address this, minimum hourly wages will rise from $8 per hour to a new minimum of $10 per hour, the nation's largest minimum wage increase approved by voters last fall. While it's a dramatic shift for tens of thousands of workers, it's a minuscule fraction of the increases top earners in the region enjoyed last year. Going: San Jose city workers Mark Ruffing, left, and Rita Tabaldo attach eviction notices to a tent at a tent city in San Jose . Silicon Valley's top tech magnates inched up the Forbes annual list of the richest people on the planet released this week. Oracle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison had a reported net worth of $43 billion, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had about $23 billion each, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, was worth an estimated $13.3 billion, and Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, had an estimated worth of $10.7 billion. 'The wealth numbers are staggering, they are absolutely staggering,' said Alf Nucifora, who chairs the Luxury Marketing Council of San Francisco . One in five ultra-wealthy Americans, defined by having a net worth above $30 million, lives in California, stoked by the 'wealth-generating cluster' of the Silicon Valley, according to WealthX, a company that tracks the super-rich. Stanford University, in Palo Alto, boasts 1,173 alumni with a net worth of more than $30 million - only Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania have more. 'The Silicon Valley is an ecosystem of human capital, venture capital, risk, an educational infrastructure,' says WealthX president David Friedman. 'All of those things combine into this glorious cocktail of prosperity.' But many residents, even those with college educations, are finding it tougher than ever to make it in the Silicon Valley. Disparity: Kristina Erbenich, right, is handed an eviction notice at a tent city in San Jose. Meanwhile Silicon Valley's top tech magnates inched up the Forbes annual list of the richest people on the planet released this week . Before the Great Recession, about 10 percent of people seeking food had at least some college education. Today, one in four who line up at food pantries for bags of free food have been to college. Last year the share of households in Silicon Valley earning less than $35,000 rose two percentage points to 20 percent, according to the 2013 Silicon Valley Index. 'There are millionaires, even billionaires, who sit in their sunrooms watching me work in their gardens and they have no clue what's going on,' said Sherri Bohan, a credentialed horticulturist who ran a landscape gardening firm for 30 years and raised two sons as a single mom. Today, retired and disabled, she picks up a free bag of groceries every week at her local food bank. Without the food she says she would go hungry. Silicon Valley's rich do give, and often significantly, but the money mostly leaves the area. Facebook's Zuckerberg gave $100 million to Newark N.J., public schools in 2010; his $500 million gift to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation last year has yet to be designated. The Google Foundation donated about $11 million in 2011, according to its tax forms, largely to global environmental and health projects. Poverty: Median incomes fell throughout the Silicon Valley. The tent city in San Jose is being removed . 'Many people come here to work, but they have no idea what's really going on,' said Lisa Sobrato Sonsini, whose Sobrato Family Foundation - funded by profits gained as a leading real estate and development firm in the region - is the single largest contributor to local charities in the region. 'The companies are generous, but they don't see the need directly in front of them, they want to send their money away.' Phyllis Kizer, a long time high-tech business analyst, is disturbed by the challenges people in her community face. 'Looking at myself, I'm very well paid for what I do, I have no complaints,' she said. Once a week, Kizer heads to a low income school where she sits with children, including recent immigrants, helping them learn to read. 'I love books, and I love teaching,' she said. 'I wanted to pass that on. Some of these children, they can really go far, but we need to help.'","Huge disparities on show in the Silicon Valley .

While no animals were harmed during the actual filming, wranglers claim the production company is still responsible for the deaths because the animals were kept at a nearby farm filled with bluffs, sinkholes and other 'death traps.' Four wranglers working with the animals claim they repeatedly raised concerns about the farm peppered with bluffs, sinkholes and broken-down fencing with their superiors and the production company, owned by Warner Bros., but it continued to be used.

"The majority of the rumours about Apple’s upcoming devices have centred on what the iPhone 6 will look like - but the tech giant is also expected to launch a new iPad at an event in September. Mock-up images of what this next-generation iPad Air casing may look like have appeared on Chinese site Weibo. Despite a number of small tweaks to the volume controls and microphone, the case looks almost identical to the current super-thin model that went on sale in November last year. The mockup images (pictured) were posted to Chinese site Weibo and claim to show a next-generation iPad Air case. In this image, the camera lens is pictured in the top left-hand corner with a small hole next to it. This hole, purported to be for the rear microphone, is similar to those seen on the rear of the iPhone 5S and 5C . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). It is not known whether the images are of a real iPad or whether they are just a designer's musing on what Apple's next offering will be. Two images show what the casing may look like from a distance, while a close-up image reveals the case’s depth. In the image that shows the exterior of the rear case, the camera lens is pictured in the top left-hand corner with a small hole next to it. This hole, purported to be for the rear microphone, is similar to those seen on the rear of the iPhone 5S and 5C. By comparison, the current microphone on the iPad Air is positioned in the centre, at the top of the rear case. On the leaked image of the case's interior, two holes along the top right-hand side of the case are believed to be where the volume controls will sit. The controls on the current iPad Air are raised, but these holes suggest the next-generation controls will be built flush with the case. Aside from these minor tweaks, the size and thickness of the case appears to be the same.

"If you cheat you’re likely to have attended a handful of colleges - at least according to the world's largest adultery website. An Ashley Madison survey out this week has revealed that people who have attended certain colleges are far more likely to cheat than those who haven’t. And the University of Minnesota comes out top with Arizona State and SUNY Buffalo close behind. ‘It’s apparent from our survey that certain campuses offer a climate that's more conducive to would-be adulterers, typically someone more adventurous and looking to have new experiences,’ founder & CEO Noel Biderman said. Top dog: The University of Minnesota has the most cheaters on Ashley Madison . The top ten cheaters’s schools were revealed when the adultery site polled well over 10,000 members to discover their Alma-maters and majors. Coming in at number one was the University of Minnesota, with the highest number of members on the hookup site. The second place school is Arizona State University. SUNY Buffalo rounds out the top three. In at number two: Arizona State University has the second-most members on the site . Rounding out the top three: SUNY Buffalo has the third-most members on the site . Ashley Madison members were also far more likely to have a college degree than to have just attended high school. The most common major for cheaters? Psychology. Almost a quarter of all cheaters have a postgraduate degree and almost the same amount maintained a GPA of 3.0 or above? Over 80 per cent of cheaters attended public schools, and more than half lived on campus. Less than 10 per cent of those on the site completed only high school.","The adultery site polled over 10,000 users to determine the schools with the loosest morals .

"A group of 90 schoolchildren fled from a volcano in New Zealand dubbed 'Mount Doom' featured in Lord of the Rings after it erupted today. An ash plume more than 5,280ft high was seen emitting from the Te Maari crater on Tongariro Mountain there was a thick smell of sulphur in the air making it difficult to breathe. The pupils from Napier, who were walking the Tongariro track with six parents and four teachers, are believed to be safe along with other hikers despite being less than a mile from the eruption. Scroll down for video . 'Mount Doom' erupts: The Te Maari crater on Mount Tongariro erupted today sending an ash plume more than a mile into the air . Tamatea Intermediate School teacher Lomi Schaumkel said: 'We were right up there next to it. It was just amazing. ‘We were probably only a kilometre away from it. We were right next to one of the signs saying we were out of the danger zone. 'We saw all these tourists running away from it. We didn't stick around long.’ A further 20 pupils from Gulf Harbour School in Whangaparoa with parents and guides were also just 820 yards from where the crater erupted. Conservation Department area manager . Jonathan Maxwell said 30 to 50 people were being evacuated from the . Tongariro Alpine Crossing track and that no injuries had been reported. Flee for their lives: Hikers can be seen making their way down the mountain as the ash plume billowed into the air today. No injuries were reported . Schoolchildren nearby: Some 90 pupils were just one mile from the volcano when it erupted. Teacher Lomi Schaumkel said: 'We didn't stick around long' Up to 50 tourists were evacuated as the volcano erupted and some 90 schoolchildren were less than a mile from the action . State . highways in the area have also been closed. Two bus drivers from Nimon and Sons, . who drove the Napier pupils to the mountain, had reported back to their . base that they could see an ash plume one mile high, a spokesman said. GNS . Science confirmed that the eruption at the crater happened shortly . after 1.20pm today. It is the second eruption on the mountain this year . after an eruption on August 6. The . Department of Conservation had previously warned hikers to avoid the . summit of Mount Ruapehu. They said that temperature readings by scientists . indicated there was an increased risk of eruption at New Zealand's . largest active volcano. Hazard: Nearby residents complained that the sulphur in the air was making it harder to breathe . Has happened before: A blanket of ash lies over the upper area of Mount Ruapehu about 143 miles) north of New Zealand's capital, Wellington, in 2007 . Mount Tongariro featured as the volcano in Peter Jackson’s film adaptaion of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic Lord of the Rings. The volcano is where the ‘One Ring’ was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron and is the only place where it can be destroyed. Hobbit Frodo Baggins’ quest to destroy the ring takes him to the fiery mountain. GNS had said that temperatures below a . lake in the crater of the North Island indicated a vent was . partially blocked, leading to increased pressure that made eruptions . more likely 'over the next weeks to months'. The eruption lasted for about five minutes and the GNS has updated the alert on Tongariro to level two indicating ‘minor eruptive activity’. Airline Air New Zealand have cancelled flights between Taupo and Wellington because of the volcanic activity and the aviation colour code was raised to red which meant there was a ‘significant emission of ash’ in the atmosphere. An Air New Zealand spokesman said the . airline was working with the Civil Aviation Authority and the . MetService to monitor the ash cloud. Nearby . Lake Rotoaira resident Robyn Bennett said there was a big black ash . cloud over her house, about a mile from the eruption site. She said: ‘It just blew her stack. It's hard to breathe if you go outside, it's pushing out quite heavily.’ Ms Bennett said she did not hear the . eruption but it looked like a new vent had formed in front of a previous . eruption crater. The ash cloud was seen moving east towards Napier and . Taupo. Fiery chasm: Director Peter Jackson used Mount Ruapehu and the neighbouring Mount Ngauruhoe to depict Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings movies . Ann Lambert, owner of the Rainbow Motel at Tokaanu, near Turangi, said she had not heard any noise, unlike the previous time Tongariro erupted when there had been a ‘huge loud noise’. She said: ‘We weren't aware it had happened. We just looked up and saw it.’ A national advisory has been issued . by Civil Defence saying regions from Waikato down to Hawke's Bay could . be affected by ash cloud. The . eruption in August sent a plume of ash 20,000ft into the atmosphere, . showering the North Island and disrupting domestic air travel. Mount Ruapehu, which also erupted in June 1996, sent plumes of steam, ash and debris into the sky which towered an estimated eight miles above its crate . The . 2,797m (9,177ft) mountain also erupted in 2007, sending a lahar - a . fast-moving stream of mud and debris - down the mountain but causing no . injuries. In 1953, a massive lahar from the mountain caused New Zealand's worst rail disaster when it washed away a bridge at Tangiwai and a passenger train plunged into the Whangaehu River, claiming 151 lives. Director Peter Jackson used Mount Ruapehu and the neighbouring Mount Ngauruhoe to depict Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings movies.","An ash plume more than one mile high was seen from the Te Marri crater .

"Chris Bryant said the 'cover-up' at News International extended to James Murdoch . Phone-hacking will be the single largest corporate corruption case for 250 years and the 'cover up' went up 'to the very highest levels', a senior Labour MP sensationally claimed today. Speaking at a private members' debate held in Westminster Hall, Chris Bryant claimed the scandal at News International extended to executives and chairman James Murdoch. He said that senior figures 'ordered - we know this for sure - the mass destruction of evidence'. Mr Bryant claimed: 'There was a major cover-up at . News International which stretched right up to the very highest levels . of the company, as we know even up to James Murdoch. 'And that, in the . end, I suspect, will prove to have been the biggest crime.' The politician made his dramatic claims as court papers alleged that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire provided the News of the World with daily transcripts of hacked messages. The papers said voicemail interception was approved by at least two executives, the Daily Telegraph reported. Three senior figures figures on the paper were in frequent contact with Mulcaire, it is claimed. The documents say he entered into a conspiracy with executives and 'agreed to provide daily transcripts of voicemail messages to [NGN] journalists.' As the hacking controversy deepened today, Mr Bryant insisted U.S. authorities had a duty to investigate because members of the News Corp board, which is based in America, had failed to prevent staff paying off public officials despite 'incontrovertible evidence'. Mr Bryant claimed Parliament has been told 486 lies about the phone-hacking affair, by News International, police and other organisations. He also said he was 'absolutely sure' that the problems seen at News . International 'may well have been replicated' at other newspapers. Mr Bryant sensationally claimed there was a major cover-up at News International which stretched right up to James Murdoch, executive and chairman, pictured, at the Commons Culture Committee . Mr Bryant, the Rhondda MP, received £30,000 in compensation from News International last month after his phone was hacked. He said News Corporation directors were at fault for not stopping the attempt to disguise what was going on within the company. He said: 'Senior figures at News International ordered - we know this for sure - the mass destruction of evidence. 'The clear, incontrovertible evidence of . corrupt payments to police, which News International had garnered . together, they gave to lawyers and squirrelled away and only revealed to . the public very recently - I believe that aspect is one of the things . that the authorities in the United States of America should be . investigating because I don't believe that a single member of the board . of directors of News Corp took their responsibilities in this regard . seriously enough to prevent the payment of corrupt officials.' Mr Bryant said police apparently told Rebekah Brooks about the original phone hacking investigation . As the Labour politician spoke out, Mr Justice Vos ordered that previously redacted court documents submitted for a phone-hacking case in the High Court should be released. The papers revealed the victims wanted News Group Newspapers, the publishers of the NotW to admit that every one of the 6,000 people named in Mulcaire's notebook was a hacking victim. Mulcaire and Clive Goodman were both jailed in 2007 after hacking the phones of senior members of the royal household. Mulcaire has not accepted any of the allegations contained in the court documents - and was opposed to them being released today. Today Mr Bryant also pointed to the 'shocking' revelation that police officers apparently gave Rebekah Brooks details about the original phone-hacking investigation. He claimed this shows that 'the police effectively became a partly-owned subsidiary of News International'. Earlier this week it emerged Scotland Yard told Mrs Brooks in . 2006 that there were up to 110 victims of phone hacking at the NotW. Police . had seemed to give Ms Brooks, then editor of The Sun, an incredibly . detailed briefing about their investigation into the scandal within . weeks of the arrest of News of the World royal editor Goodman and . private detective Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking. Mr Bryant said: 'This . is like the FBI going to Don Corleone and telling him that he's got a . bit of information on what his family has been up to.' The . explosive claims came from an email between Tom Crone, head of legal at . the News of the World and Andy Coulson, the paper's then editor at 10.34am on September 15, 2006. In addition, Mr Bryant claimed: 'People right at the top of the News of the . World knew in 2006 exactly what had gone on.' Mr Bryant used his speech to call for a powerful new media watchdog to be . set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal - and not just the . Press Complaints Commission 'dressed up in a new fur coat'. Communications minister Ed Vaizey . said he did not want to pre-judge the findings of the Leveson Inquiry . but added it was 'no secret' the Government favoured independent . regulation. He said: 'This independence from state intervention is fundamental to our democratic way of life.'","Chris Bryant sensationally claimed the 'cover-up' extended to James Murdoch, boss of News Corporation .

"UN narcotics chief: Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool are comparable to Brazil and Mexico for their 'no-go' areas . Badly managed large scale immigration fuels the problem . 'Drug traffickers, organised crime, drug users - they take over' Celebrity use of drugs is helping to 'normalise use' in society . ACPO says it does 'not recognise the reference to ""no go"" areas in the UK' British cities have lawless  ‘no-go . areas’ comparable with the most dangerous parts of Brazil, Mexico and . the U.S., according to a United Nations drugs chief. Professor Hamid Ghodse claimed Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester are on a par with the drug and murder capitals of the world. The president of the International Narcotics Control Board said the police had lost control of parts of these cities, and drugs gangs had taken over. Eleven-year-old Rhys Jones was one victim of the drug and gang culture permeating Britain. The youngster was shot in the car . park of a pub, in Croxteth, Liverpool, in August 2007 after innocently . being caught up in a turf war between rival gangs. Rhys was killed as he walked through a pub car park on his way home from football training. Sean Mercer, then aged 16, was aiming at members of a rival gang when he blasted Rhys by mistake. Members of Mercer’s Croxteth Crew helped him cover up his horrific crime. Rhys was shot with a First World War Smith and Wesson revolver, and a gang-member was caught trying to buy a replacement weapon just weeks later. Mercer was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years. But his comments caused fury from police and community leaders. Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Manchester Central, said: ‘I walk the streets of  Manchester on a regular basis. It is  not the same as Bogota, it is not the same as Mexico City. ‘He is either ignorant or stupid. If hehas surveyed my city from the decadence of a five-star hotel room then he may well draw those conclusions. ‘If he had come out with me on the streets he would see that people are living happily and peacefully.’ Liverpool council leader Joe Anderson said: ‘Anyone who knows Liverpool will not recognise the city from the way in which this report is being interpreted. 'The comparisons are fanciful and it  is absurd to say any part of the city is  a no-go area.’ Ahead of the publication of the INCB’s annual report on drugs around the world, Professor Ghodse said urgent action was needed because parts of the UK were experiencing ‘social disintegration’. The Iranian-born doctor claimed that Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester were experiencing ‘a vicious cycle of social exclusion and drugs problems and fractured communities’. ‘In many societies around the world, whether developed or developing, there are communities within the societies which develop which become no-go areas,’ he went on. ‘Drug traffickers, organised crime, drug users, they take over. They will get the sort of governance of those areas. ‘Examples are in Brazil, Mexico, in the United States, in the UK, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and therefore it is no good to have only law enforcement, which always shows it does not succeed. ‘It is crucial that the needs of communities experiencing social disintegration are urgently tackled before the tipping point is reached, beyond which effective action becomes impossible. ‘The consequences of failure are too high for society and should be avoided at all cost.’ One example of the scourge of drugs in Liverpool was a family of drug dealers and their . associates, last November were jailed for a total of 82 years for peddling heroin and crack cocaine on the streets of . Liverpool. Lisa Whitney and Carol Whitney, part of the 'drug family', were jailed for four and eight years respectively . As the net closed on the drug dealers, . officers found an SA80 assault rifle which had been stolen from army . barracks on Salisbury Plain in 2005, around 1,200 rounds of . ammunition as well as a large quantity of Class A substances. Thirteen people involved in running a 24-hour drugs cash and carry service were jailed after months of surveillance. Undercover officers from Merseyside . Police posed as addicts to make 'test purchases' to gain the necessary . evidence as undercover officers filmed the footage. His comments were undermined by statistics showing the wildly differing crime rates between cities in England and South America. For example, the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, which contains vast sprawling slums, saw 4,631 murders in 2009, including scores at the hands of drug dealers. In contrast, there were 35  murders in Manchester in 2009-10 – a record low – and 27 in the  West Midlands. The Greater Manchester police force . boasts a 96.8 per cent detection rate for murders. Officials in Rio . estimate there have been 60,000 unsolved murders in the past decade, . including 24,000 where the body was unidentified. Senior police officers also dismissed . the claims. Tim Hollis, the Chief Constable of Humberside and the . Association of Chief Police Officers’ drugs spokesman said: ‘I simply do . not recognise the reference to “no-go” areas in the UK. It appears to . be set in the broader context of social cohesion.’ Assistant Chief Constable Steve . Heywood of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘I am sure that the majority . of people in Manchester will wholeheartedly reject any suggestion that . parts of the city are “no-go” areas. ‘We . accept that drugs are a major driving force behind many other crimes . such as burglary, robbery and vehicle crime, and that is why we are . determined to root out all those involved’. Merseyside Police said it ‘absolutely disagreed’ there are any ‘no-go areas’ in Liverpool or elsewhere in the force area. Illegal internet pharmacies are targeting . young people online through sites such as Facebook and YouTube, a . United Nations drugs chief warned today. Professor Hamid Ghodse, president of the UN’s International Narcotics . Control Board (INCB), said illegal internet pharmacies were becoming . 'very sophisticated' in approaching young people on social media sites, . leaving them 'very vulnerable' online. He warned young people to be aware of whom they were talking to and interacting with on the internet. 'Disturbingly, illegal internet pharmacies have started to use social . media to publicise their websites, which can put large audiences at risk . of dangerous products,' Prof Ghodse said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has found more than half of medicines from internet pharmacies are counterfeit, he added. 'This has become really rather sinister now,' he said, 'it is much more widespread than you can believe it is. 'International illicit pharmacies are using social media and they are . not just coming overtly as they used to do, advertising their selling of . illicit drugs to you, they do it under a variety (of different ways). 'They use YouTube, they use Facebook, they attract you to their website . ... Then when you go there you will see they are also selling illicit . drugs. 'Particularly young people, they become very vulnerable in using internet pharmacies.' Prof Ghodse went on: 'A few years ago it was direct, it was the internet selling all sorts of controlled drugs. 'But now actually they are using the social media, engaging people in a . variety of ways which in the first instance you do not see they are . marketing the drug. 'But then, in a very sophisticated way, they are getting the right . question on to YouTube, on to Facebook, and even chatting in the . chatrooms, they get engaged, and then bombard them with drugs.' The INCB annual report added that the illegal firms took steps to ensure . they looked legitimate, 'providing quotes and images of purported . medical doctors'. But it added that the firms had turned to 'message board and social . network advertising' after several internet search engines banned the . use of registered trademarks for prescription drugs in their sponsored . links. More than half (58 per cent) of the 12,000 seizures of controlled substances . sent via the mail in 2010 were from India, with others from the US, . China and Poland, and 'some of course in the UK', Prof Ghodse added.","UN narcotics chief: Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool are comparable to Brazil and Mexico for their 'no-go' areas .

"Tony Colston-Hayter, pictured in 1989, has this week admitted his role in a £1.3million bank heist . He made a name for himself as the ‘Acid House King’ organising Britain’s biggest raves where children as young as 12 were plied with drugs. But today detectives know Tony Colston-Hayter by a different guise- Mr Big. This week he admitted masterminding a million pound cyber bank heist from one of Britain’s biggest high street banks. The 48-year-old led a gang who hijacked bank computers to siphon off £1.3million from Barclays in a sophisticated scam. The computer genius also stole the bank cards of 24,000 customers to pay for shopping sprees at Harrods and Selfridges splashing out on £35,000 Rolex watches. Police believe the fraudster, who once famously handcuffed himself to Jonathan Ross to promote his parties, also targeted celebrities. Amongst the vast array of 400,000 pages of personal data and stolen banking documentation found at his flat in Marylebone, police found the emails of comedian Stephen Merchant, although he denied hacking into them with the intention of stealing from the TV writer. Now after he pleaded guilty to one of Britain’s biggest cyber bank robberies at Southwark Crown Court this week, Colston-Hayter’s extraordinary downfall from millionaire entrepreneur and party organiser to cyber crime’s ‘Mr Big’ can be revealed. Colston-Hayter’s name was once synonymous with the all night Acid House raves held in the Home Counties which caused outrage in 1989. The Sunrise events run by Colston-Hayter and promoted by his friend Paul Staines, the political commentator known as Guido Fawkes, attracted thousands of schoolchildren and drug dealers who openly sold drugs such as ecstasy and LSD to revellers. When the parties were banned on the orders the then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, Colston-Hayter went on the Jonathan Ross chat show and famously handcuffed himself to the presenter before throwing a glass of water over music journalist Paul Morley. During a heated exchange, a fuming Ross told the cocky 23-year-old: ‘If you do that again I’ll thump you- and I mean it.’ The wealthy son of a university lecturer and a solicitor, Colston-Hayter enjoyed a privileged upbringing growing up in the plush suburb of Hampstead with his sisters Millie and Charlotte, now a TV producer whose credits include Celebrity Detox, TFI Friday and Celebrity Wife Swap. Fixated on earning money, his father Anthony, a lecturer in modern history at the University of Buckingham, was said to have paid his ‘genius’ son by the page to read the Bible. At the age of 16, he astonished his teachers by passing a special O-level in fruit machine technology after persuading the headmaster of the highly liberal Stantonbury Campus comprehensive school to let him set up a clubroom at school with a coin-operated video game he profited from. On leaving school a few months later, he persuaded a bank manager to loan him £500 to set up a video game business which enjoyed a million-pound turnover by the time he was 19 before crashing with debts of £108,000. Acid House King: At the age of 22, Colston-Hayter helped relocate acid house music from underground clubs to massive open-air raves . Colston-Hayter then spent six months . learning to play Blackjack in Monte Carlo before becoming a highly . successful professional gambler. He once raked in £23,000 a day before banned from every casino in Britain after winning more than £100,000 in a year. Colston-Hayter . later travelled to Hong Kong where he set up an engineering company . which produced a component for a Formula One car. But when he moved back to Britain to marry and start a young family, police believe he became an accomplished fraudster. The father of two amassed 24,000 credit cards and financial records which had been diverted in the post to his address. He used a 24 SIM phone exchange, a sophisticated telecoms machine which allowed him to impersonate High Street banks in order to solicit account details from hapless customers. Southwark Crown Court heard on Monday that he led a gang who stole £1.3million from a bank branch in Swiss Cottage in North London by taking control of its computer system. Fraudsters used a keyboard video mouse to take control of the bank’s computers remotely and siphon off the cash. The gadget, which can be purchased for as little as £10, enables thieves to take control of multiple computers and to transmit information from them to a remote location. Around £1.3m was stolen from accounts at the branch, although a significant amount of cash has since been recovered. Police were alerted when stolen credit cards were used to buy a number of Rolex watches in Harrods and Selfridges. This week Colston-Hayter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal credit balances from Barclays Bank. He also admitted conspiring with others to commit fraud using credit cards, conspiracy to steal and two counts of possession of articles for use in fraud. Southwark Crown Court heard that Colston-Hayter led a gang who stole £1.25million from a bank branch in Swiss Cottage in North London by taking control of its computer system. They will be sentenced next month . In an earlier hearing, he denied interfering with emails of the comedian Stephen Merchant with the intention of committing fraud or theft. The charge will now lay on file. Judge Alistair McCreath remanded him in custody ahead of sentencing which is due to take place later this year. Co-conspirators Darius Bolder, 34, and Michael Harper, 26, pleaded guilty to using a stolen credit card to buy three Rolex watches at Selfridges. Bolder also admitted stealing credit balances from Barclays. Segun Ogunfidodo, 26, and Leroy Odunusi, 24, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit fraud using credit cards. Five other alleged conspirators face a trial later this year. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tony Colston-Hayter admitted role in £1.3million heist this week .

"American politicians are considering creating a $1trillion platinum coin which the US Treasury would pay to itself with the aim of reducing the country’s monumental debt. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has the authority to mint platinum coins in the denomination of his choosing, and experts say the idea is being taken seriously in Washington. The proposal would involve the Treasury minting the coin and depositing it into its own account at the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to write down or cancel $1trillion of its $16.4trillion debt. Almost 5,000 people have signed a petition for the Government to mint the special coin to help pay off its huge debt . The coin would be paid into the Treasury's own account at the Federal Reserve . The idea was first raised last year and is gaining momentum. A formal petition has been started asking the White House to take the measure to avoid another high-stakes ‘fiscal cliff’ battle to raise the debt ceiling. Economist and Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman, one of those backing the idea, said the time had come to use any economic tools available to the Government. Economist and Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman has backed the plan but says it is a 'gimmick' Writing in his blog on the New York Times website, Mr Krugman said: ‘This is all a gimmick – but since the debt ceiling itself is crazy, allowing Congress to tell the President to spend money then tell him that he can’t raise the money he’s supposed to spend, there’s a pretty good case for using whatever gimmicks come to hand.’ The petition on the White House website – launched by someone who posted his name only as Graham K – has attracted nearly 5,000 signatures. It needs to get 25,000 by February 3 to get a formal White House response. It says: ‘With the creation and Treasury deposit of a new platinum coin with a value of $1trillion, we would avert the absurd yet imminent debt ceiling face-off in Congress in two quick and simple steps! ‘While this may seem like an unnecessarily extreme measure, it is no more absurd than playing political football with the US – and global – economy at stake.’ Financial analyst Cullen Roche said the idea is being taken seriously in the White House. The Treasury has two months to solve its  financial crisis as the fiscal cliff deal reached  in Congress gives politicians until the end of February to raise the debt limit before the country defaults.","Politicians are considering minting a $1trillion coin .

"When Princess Diana's death was announced nearly 20 years ago, a tidal wave of emotion swept over Britain with an intensity that took many aback. Mourners arrived in London in their thousands, leaving a mountain of floral tributes at the gates of the Royal Palaces and openly weeping in a rare collective moment of national grieving. But as crowds thronged the Mall, threatening to storm the palace if the Queen failed to fly the flag at half-mast, little has ever really been known about what was going on behind the closed castle doors of Balmoral, the royal estate in Scotland where the Queen shut herself away with her two grandsons as the hysteria around them intensified. Now, nearly two decades on, a letter written by the Duke of Edinburgh has given an insight into the frustration the Royal Family felt at the way they were portrayed in the 'nightmare' days following Diana's death. Scroll down for videos . The letter, which was sent by Prince Philip to his niece Princess Margarita of Baden, in the wake of Princess Diana's death in August 1997, is signed 'With much love Philip' (pictured). It sold at auction for £2,500 . The part-typed, part-handwritten letter by Prince Philip (left)  reveals his heartache in the wake of the car crash which killed Princess Diana (right) on August 31, 1997. He said the hysteria in the aftermath was difficult . Princess Diana was killed, aged 36, in a horrific car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997 . The letter, which was sent by Prince Philip to his niece Princess Margarita of Baden just five days after the Paris car crash, reveals how the delirium surrounding Diana's death made it harder to protect and comfort her two grieving sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. Presented on Balmoral Castle headed note paper, the part-written, part-typed letters also expresses the Duke's heartbreak at perceptions that the family were not publicly mourning. Signing it off 'With much love Philip', he also uses reacts to criticism levelled at the Queen for taking the princes to church on the day Diana's death was announced, in an apparent show of the Royal Family's 'business-as-usual' attitude. According to the Daily Mirror, the letter reads: 'We have even been criticised for ""forcing"" the boys to go to church on Sunday, the day of the accident.' He then points out that churches are for praying in. The note, dated September 5, 1997, has now been sold for £2,300 at auction by a dealer on behalf of a private client who said the letter was 'historically significant'. The auction house Reeman Dansie said the letter expressed the Duke's 'strong feelings regarding the press and public hysteria and criticism after the death of Princess Diana' and 'how it is making the job of protecting and comforting the young Princes difficult.' The Queen faced criticism for failing to return to London to witness the tens of thousands of mourners who had left floral tributes for Diana. She appeared at Buckingham Palace on the eve of Diana's funeral . Mourners had flocked to the Royal Palaces, including Buckingham Palace, in the wake of Diana's death. But many questioned why the Queen had remained in Balmoral for four days after the death was announced . Princess Diana, the first wife of Prince Charles, was killed in a horrific car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997. She died aged 36. At the time, the Queen faced criticism for failing to capture the mood of the grieving nation. Public anger began after the Queen took Prince William and Prince Harry to church at Balmoral, just a few hours after Prince Charles had broken the news to them of their mother's death. There were also accusations that the Queen remained in Scotland for too long, and did not return quickly enough to London, where thousands had gathered in united grief over the Diana's death. Compounding the Queen’s absence was the lack of any flag flying at half-mast above Buckingham Palace as a sign of royal mourning. The Queen made an eve-of-funeral live broadcast  from inside Buckingham Palace, telling mourners there were 'lessons to be drawn from (Diana’s) life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death' Tony Blair - who had been Prime Minister for a matter of months - addressed the nation from outside St Mary Magdalene Church in Trimdon in his Sedgefield constituency, calling Diana 'the people's princess' It also took the Royal Family four days to inspect the flowers that had been laid in tribute to Diana at the castle gates in the Scottish Highlands. The Queen had reportedly been encouraging this sense of detachment for the sake of her grandsons, but was reportedly convinced later by her advisers to shift her stance on how to handle Diana's death. Four days after Diana's death was announced, the Royal Family made a rare public statement, saying it was hurt by suggestions that it was indifferent to the country's sorrow over Diana's death. This Sun front page captured the public reacion to the public's grief over Diana's death . In the statement it said: 'The princess was a much loved national figure, but she was also a mother whose sons miss her deeply. 'Prince William and Prince Harry themselves want to be with their father and their grandparents at this time in the quiet haven of Balmoral.' Her Majesty then made an eve-of-funeral live broadcast to the nation from inside Buckingham Palace, telling mourners there were 'lessons to be drawn from (Diana’s) life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death'. The Union Jack was then flown at half-mast at Buckingham Palace during the funeral ceremony. Years later, Sir Michael Oswald and his wife Lady Angela Oswald, friends of the late Queen Mother, said she had been hugely upset and the 'cruel, unfair criticism' levelled at her daughter. In direct contrast, on the very day Diana's death was announced, Tony Blair - who had been Prime Minister for a matter of months -  addressed the nation from outside St Mary Magdalene Church in Trimdon in his Sedgefield constituency. The now-famous speech, written on the back of an envelope after advice from his spin doctor Alastair Campbell, was watched by millions and later featured in the film The Queen, starring Helen Mirren. He said: 'She was the people’s princess and that’s how she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and in our memories forever.' The two-minute appearance became so famous  that a stone plaque was put on the path exactly where Mr Blair stood to make his moving tribute.","'Historically significant' letter by Prince Philip sold at auction for £2,500 .

"People with a food allergy are more likely to be murdered than to die from a severe allergic reaction, new research has found. One in 10 children have an allergy and their parents often worry about the dangers of a severe reaction, or anaphylaxis. Now researchers at Imperial College London have calculated the risk of a person with a food allergy dying from anaphylaxis. People with food allergies, such as to seafood and peanuts, are more likely to be murdered than to die from a severe allergic reaction. They have a 1.8 in a million chance of dying from a reaction in a year . Based on data from 13 studies, they say the risk in one year is 1.8 in a million. For children and young people, the risk of 3.25 in a million. By comparison, in Europe the risk of being murdered is 11 in a million and the risk of dying in an accident is 324 in a million during a year. Dr Robert Boyle, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the study, said: ‘Everyone has heard stories of people who have died suddenly from a severe allergic reaction, and these stories are frightening. 'But events like this appear to be very rare, and it's helpful to put that risk in perspective. ‘We don't want to belittle the concerns of people with food allergies or their families, and of course people should continue to take reasonable precautions. ‘That said, we want to reassure them that having a food allergy makes a very small difference to someone's overall risk of death. Children and young people with a food allergy have a 3.25 in a million chance of dying from a severe allergic reaction in a year. Image shows a child using an EpiPen . ‘Worrying about severe allergic reactions can take a huge toll on someone's quality of life. ‘We should address anxiety and quality of life for food allergic people and their carers, rather than just focus on the risk of death.’ Food allergies are becoming more common and hospital admissions for children with food allergies have risen five-fold in the last 20 years.","The risk of a person with a food allergy dying from an allergic reaction in one year is 1.8 in a million, for children and teenagers it is 3.25 in a million .

"Richard Branson's dream to charter commercial space flights has taken a step closer to reality. His company, Virgin Galactic, yesterday signed a deal with U.S. aviation authorities to let it blast paying customers into space. Commercial flights are to begin by the end of this year and more than 600 people have already signed up at $250,000 (£150,000) each to take a trip on SpaceShipTwo. Scroll down for videos . Richard Branson's dream to charter commercial space flights has taken a step closer to reality. His company, Virgin Galactic, yesterday signed a deal with U.S. aviation authorities to let it blast paying customers into space on SpaceShipTwo (pictured) The agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sets out how routine space missions from the Spaceport America base in New Mexico will be coordinated with the normal air traffic control system. ‘Our team is working hard to begin routine and affordable space launches from Spaceport America and this agreement brings us another step closer to that goal,’ said Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides. The Virgin announcement came hours before Branson's main rival in the commercial space race was to unveil its latest spacecraft. Passengers climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. They become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, at which point SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II . The agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sets out how routine space missions from the Spaceport America base in New Mexico will be coordinated with the normal air traffic control system. Pictured is the SpaceShipTwo spacecraft that will be used to fly passengers to space . Spaceport America's Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space Building is seen at the end of the road to the main runway, near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. This is the world's first purpose-built commercial space base and soon-to-be site of the first space flights . Ticket cost: The starting price for flights is $250,000 (£150,000) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by Richard Branson and his family. Training: Passengers are required to go through a 'Pre-Flight Experience Programme', including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly. Once aboard: SpaceShipTwo will carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead. The space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity. Flight path: A climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, at which point SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II. The spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness, with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours. The spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound . Flight frequency: Initially one per week, eventually to have two flights per day. Elon Musk, chief executive and chief designer of SpaceX, present his company's ‘next generation’ Dragon V2 spacecraft at an event in California on yesterday evening. The group has proposed launching 12 rockets per year from a site near Brownsville in southern Texas, but has not yet confirmed that they will be built in the area. SpaceX, which already has craft supplying the International Space Station, has chosen Spaceport to test the Falcon 9 reusable rocket, meaning that it will launch vertically and then land intact. 'It really is the democratisation of space,' said Spaceport executive director, Christine Anderson, 'that you and I and our children and grandchildren can think about going to space, about going to Mars.' Ms Anderson estimates there will be 200,000 visitors per year to Spaceport 'when all our customers are flying.' As well as his dreams for commercial spaceflight, Richard Branson has said he wants to develop planes so fast that passengers will be able to travel between New York and Tokyo in less than an hour. And he says the technology could be available sooner than we think . Speaking to CNBC, the entrepreneur said that once his Virgin Galactic space tourism project is underway he will turn his attentions to developing supersonic commercial flights that fly at 19,000 mph (30,500 km/h) He said: 'After we've done the space programme, we will be producing supersonic planes, which will go far, far, faster than [the] Concorde.'

Scare tactics: One friendly neighbor in Fargo Moorhead, North Dakota, will be handing out this letter instead of candy on Halloween . Unsurprisingly, many parents have posted their outrage online about the woman's plan to give letters to 'moderately obese' children on Halloween (stock image) The letter, which has gone viral across the Internet, reads: 'You [sic] child is, in my opinion, moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this Halloween season. 'My hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this Halloween and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits.' Cheryl told radio station WRIG: 'I just want to send a message to the parents of kids that are really overweight… . 'I think it’s just really irresponsible of parents to send them out looking for free candy just cause all the other kids are doing it.' Cheryl's crusade comes from the belief that it falls to the whole community to prevent childhood obesity. The printed letter, with a festive pumpkin graphic in the corner, is now doing the rounds on social media where many parents have not taken too kindly to being told how to raise their children. On one blog where the letter appeared, one post from sharp_stick read: 'I hope she enjoys cleaning egg and toilet paper off every surface of her property.

"Pointed: Melynda Moon paid £250 for 'elven ears' A woman who wanted to look like an elf has had an operation on her ears to make them more pointed. Melynda Moon, 23, believes she comes from a different realm and was a fairy in her past life. She paid £250 for the operation that she feels will put her back in touch with her mythical side. Ms Moon - who also had her name changed by deed poll - had the tops of her ear cartilage skinned and pieces cut from the tips to form points. This gave her ears the triangular tips characteristic of the magical figures in her  favourite film, The Lord Of The Rings. The treatment lasted two hours. Stitches holding the whole ensemble together stayed in for a couple of weeks to allow the skin to fuse - and the result was fully 'elven' ears. Ms Moon has also had a subdermal implant in . her hand which represents the Triforce symbol for the Legend of Zelda. The model, from Guelph in Onatrio, said: 'Pointed ears are the most adorable thing, and I find the elven attire is so elegant. 'My inspiration comes from The Lord Of The Rings: the long hair, dresses and the closeness to nature. 'I . have always been very close to nature. When I found out I could have my . ears pointed I have never been so sure of something in my entire life.' Scroll down for video . Creating the look: Ms Moon underwent a two-hour operation to have her ears cut and reshaped . Before: Ms Moon's ear in its former shape . Ms Moon continued: 'I am drawn to elves because of their innocence, elegance and free spirit. They are a symbol of love and laughter.' She . described the treatment as 'a bit uncomfortable the day after' and . confessed that her ears 'were really swollen and sore with a slight . burning sensation'. But she added: 'It was completely worth it. 'I have a handful of people assume I am dressed up because I have put on pointed ears,' she said. 'When I tell them they are real, they look pretty confused as if they are waiting for me to say 'just kidding' - but I am not.' 'Obsession': Ms Moon says she has been a fan of mythological creatures since she was a child and believes she was a fairy in a former life . Ms Moon said she had been 'obsessed with all things mythical' since childhood. As a teenager, she said, she would use makeup and hair dye to make herself look 'elven' and even used Photoshop to make her ears look pointed . She said of her operation, which she underwent in August 2011: 'I have always had fantasies about what it would be like to be something other than human, so I decided to change my appearance to look supernatural. 'Now I will never go back to being human. I just lack the glitter and wings to fly.' Ms Moon said some of her friends use her to get their children to behave around Christmas. She said: 'Some people like to tell their kids to stop being bad because they know an elf who'll tell Santa they're being bad. 'Then their children see my ears and realise their parents aren't joking.' An elf is a supernatural being, probably originating from Norse mythology and folklore (although there are several sources) German folk tales often feature elves with magical abilities . Elves and fairies could be interchangeable in folklore and often had a reputation for pranks and mischief . Babies born with birthmarks have in the past been termed 'elf marked' while tangled hair has been called an 'elf lock' The Lord Of The Rings author JRR Tolkien was responsible for making elves into an almost angelic race and for adapting the tall, blond figure of the elf .

"Many people enjoy their birthdays by letting their hair down and having plenty to drink - but it seems one man took the celebrations a little too far. James Taylor told police he drank an incredible 48 beers in one evening to mark his 58th birthday on Hudson Beach, Florida, this week. The transient bizarrely told deputies it was about ten beers too many - and he also allegedly exposed his genitals and urinated in the sand. Arrested: James Taylor said he drank 48 beers in one evening to mark his 58th birthday on Hudson Beach, Florida - and that was about ten beers too many . Taylor was drinking by the beach on Wednesday evening and was given a stern lecture from a deputy because he was shouting at people. He then left the area but later came back and caused such a disturbance that he scared a woman and her young grandchildren. Then he exposed his genitals, ‘urinated in the middle of the sand’ and ‘went back to yelling profanities’, authorities told the St. Petersburg Times. A Pasco County sheriff's deputy then returned to the beach, arrested Taylor and took him to the Land O'Lakes jail. Scene: Taylor was drinking by Hudson Beach on Wednesday evening and was given a stern lecture from a deputy because he was shouting at people .

"Two veterans, who survived in one of the deadliest commando units of World War Two, have died in their nineties within hours of each other. Mark Radcliffe, 94, and 92-year-old Joe Glass both passed away within 12 hours of each other on Sunday. They both lived in Helena, Montana and were among the last members of the First Special Service Force (FSSF) - an elite unit made up of American and Canadian soldiers who captured 27,000 enemy prisoners between 1942 and 1944. Friends til the end: Joe Glass (pictured left) and Mark Radcliffe (right) died within 12 hours of each other on Sunday in Montana. They were among the last surviving members of an elite Second World War unit . The commandos were nicknamed the 'Black Devils' by the Nazis because of their formidable force. 'Mark and Joe were two of the original members of the First Special Service Force, and it’s appropriate that they were the last two survivors in the state,' FSSF aficionado Bill Woon told the Helena Independent Record. Joe Glass was born in Ontario, Canada in 1920. After high school, he worked on a steamboat on the Great Lakes before signing up to the Canadian Army in 1940. Mark Radcliffe was . born in Farmington, New Mexico in 1918. He began active duty in 1941 and . was deployed to the South Pacific. He was stationed in Hawaii when . Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941. Decorated in battle: Mark Radcliffe speaks during a documentary about the First Special Service Force. He died at the weekend aged 94 in his adopted hometown of Helena, Montana . Honour: Joe Glass (left) at the 2007 funeral of Herb Goodwin - a long-time friend who also belonged to the Devil's Brigade - with Goodwin's grandson Eric Morgensen . Both . men were selected in 1942 for the Plough Project - described as a . 'suicide mission' and trained together at Fort Harrison in Helena, . Montana. Mr Radcliffe was married to his wife Edith for more than 60 years after they met while at a dance for the troops and local girls in the Montana town. The couple had two children Bob and Carolyn. For his bravery Mr Radcliffe received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with cluster and the Purple Heart with two clusters. Behind enemy lines: The First Special Service Force earned the nickname 'Black Devils' because they smeared their faces with boot polish and murdered Nazis in their sleep . The Devil's Brigade (also known as the Black Devils) was a joint operation between the U.S. and Canada founded in 1942 and trained at Fort William Henry Harrison in Montana. The soldiers fought across Europe in the Aleutian Islands in the Pacific and later in Italy and southern France before being disbanded in December 1944. They saw only 251 days of combat but the force suffered 2,314 deaths, captured 27,000 prisoners and won . five U.S. campaign stars and eight Canadian battle honors. Modern American special operations have been founded on the work of this unit. The name came about because the men smeared shoe polish on their faces to help them sneak up on enemies in the dark. Nazis feared them. A journal of a German officer which was found by allies, read: 'The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come.' They were the subject of a 1968 eponymous film while director Quentin Tarantino cited the Black Devils as an influence for the 2009 film Inglourious Basterds. He became a civil engineer, staying in the Army Reserves and helping with the Montana Military Museum. He retired from the reserves a full colonel. His wartime friend, Mr Glass volunteered for the Devil's Brigade in 1940 to 'get into combat quicker'. One of the unit's first assignments in the FSSF was a daring midnight assault up Mount la Difensa in southern Italy. Mr Glass was injured during exchange of fire with a German sniper but was soon back on the frontline. He was later badly injured by a mortar in March 1944 during the siege of Anzio beach in Italy. According to the military website, Firstspecialserviceforce.net, Mr Glass said: 'A big piece of shrapnel... went through my chest and out my back. 'My lung collapsed, it broke all my ribs connected to the backbone and I was paralyzed from the waist down. 'When I started coughing up blood, I told a friend of mine, ''Say goodbye to my wife and kid.'' 'They picked me up and dragged me out of there, and then another shell hit me in the arm,' he also told the local paper in Helena. Mr Glass survived the horrifying injuries and returned to the town of Helena with his wife Dorothy and raised four children -  Chuck, Bob, Victoria and Dottie. He had a varied life, working as everything from a truck driver to selling insurance and delivering milk. In the 1950s, he operated the Valley Speedway stockcar race track and later owned his own fish and chip shop.

"A former Miss Malaysia could receive Britain's biggest ever divorce settlement of up to £500million after splitting from her multimillionaire husband. Pauline Chai, who lives in the couple's former family home on a 1,000 acre estate in Hertfordshire, is seeking half of Khoo Kay Peng's fortune. Lawyers believe she could be awarded between £400million and £500million, The Times has reported. Jet setting couple: Malaysian businessmen Khoo Kay Peng, left, is set to divorce his wife Pauline Chai, right, a former Miss Malaysia from 1969 . Dr Khoo, chairman of Malaysian United Industries, has properties in England, Kuala Lumpur and Australia. The 74-year-old also has a 40 per cent stake in Laura Ashley, which now has sales of £286 million a year, and is director of Corus Hotels Limited which owns ten hotels including the grand Corus Hyde Park Hotel. The couple, who married in 1970 and have five grown-up children, bought the estate in Hertfordshire in 1998 which is said to include a menagerie of animals and two custom-built lakes costing £60,000 each. Ms Chai, now 66, lodged a petition for divorce in London last month on the grounds of 'unreasonable behaviour' and preliminary hearings are expected to take place in the coming months. Lavish: Dr Khoo is a director of Corus Hotels Limited which owns the Corus Hotel in Hyde Park . The question of how much Dr Khoo is worth is expected to dominate proceedings as much of his assets are technically owned by his companies. 'English law works on the basis of a 50-50 split of assets unless there is a reason to depart from that principle,' Ayesha Vardag, the lawyer acting for Ms Chai told The Times. 'We have wealth here that was built up over 40 years and a wife's entitlement would be half of that. Any question of need is secondary.' Ms Vardag added that as Ms Chai has made her home in England she is entitled to seek justice here. It is the latest in a series of big-money international divorce cases to be brought to the UK courts. They include the wife of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky who received somewhere between £100million and £200million after the pair agreed a settlement out of court. In 2008 Beverley Charman was awarded £48million when her marriage to John Charman, who built up his fortune in the insurance industry, came to an end. It remains the biggest court-ordered payout for a divorce in British history.","Pauline Chai, now 66, is divorcing Malaysian businessman Khoo Kay Peng .

"Egypt's disgraced ex-president Hosni Mubarak could be freed as early as today following a court ruling that jolted a nation already in turmoil today. Convening yesterday at the Cairo jail where Mubarak is held, the court ordered the release of the military man who ruled Egypt for 30 years until he was overthrown during the uprisings that swept the Arab world in early 2011. News of the ruling came as the EU decided to suspend exports of weapons and goods to Egypt, but stopped short of halting aid programmes for fear of hurting ordinary Egyptians already suffering. Scroll down for video . Decision time: A closed hearing to decide whether Egypt's jailed former president Hosni Mubarak (seen at a court appearance earlier this month) should be freed has begun outside Cairo . Turmoil: A curfew imposed by the military-backed authorities remained in force in Cairo yesterday as they continued their arrest campaign against middle and lower-ranking members of the Muslim Brotherhood . Asked when his client would go free, Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed al-Deeb, replied: 'Maybe tomorrow'. Mubarak, 85, was sentenced to life in . prison last year for failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators. But a court accepted his appeal earlier this year and ordered a retrial. The ailing ex-president probably has . no political future, but some predicted 'public outrage' in the wake of the court ruling, which state prosecutor Ahmed . el-Bahrawi said cannot be appealed. 'The army has brought back Mubarak's . regime, the same regime,' said Guma Abdel Alim, outside a bicycle shop . in central Cairo. 'Those who were elected by the people are now in . prison.' He was referring to a widescale security sweep on Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood that has netted many of its leaders. The 28 EU foreign ministers have called on the military authorities . and the supporters of deposed President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim . Brotherhood movement to resume negotiations to avoid further bloodshed. Unrest: Sit-ins staged in support of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood are being forcibly dispersed by military-backed authorities in Egypt . Anger: Supporters of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi, seen with posters that read 'yes to legitimacy, no to the coup' in Arabic, are seen marching in Cairo on Monday . 'It was decided ... to suspend all arms deliveries that can be used . internally,' said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius following the . emergency meeting in Brussels. 'We have decided to maintain our aid for . the Egyptian population because it already suffers enormously,' he . added. Clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsi's supporters have killed hundreds of people since last week. 'We do believe that the recent operations of the security forces have . been disproportionate and we're worried about the resulting alarming . number of people that have been killed,' said the EU's foreign policy . chief Catherine Ashton. Political turbulence has kept Egypt on . edge for months. At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and . police, have been killed in a crackdown on Morsi supporters in the past . week, making it the country's bloodiest internal episode in decades. The United States and the European . Union have both been reviewing aid to Cairo in light of the bloodshed, but . Saudi Arabia, a foe of the Brotherhood, has promised to make up any . shortfall. There was no immediate reaction to the ruling on Mubarak from the Brotherhood, whose leaders are mostly behind bars. Mubarak is still being retried on . charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the revolt . against him, but he has already served the maximum pre-trial detention . in that case. The court ruling removed the last . legal ground for his imprisonment in connection with a corruption case, . following a similar decision in another corruption case on Monday. Mubarak will not be allowed to leave Egypt and his assets remain frozen. Mubarak's two sons, Gamal and Alaa, . along with former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly, are still in prison, . and Adly's lawyer said the ruling on Mubarak had no bearing on their . cases. Some of the liberal and secular . politicians who backed the army's ousting of Morsi, Egypt's first freely . elected president, on July 3, said they regretted the hated Mubarak's . release, but argued that the judiciary's decision should be respected. Response: Obama interrupted his vacation to announce that a planned joint military exercise with Egypt would not go ahead in light of the escalating crisis . 'His regime was lousy and he destroyed . the country,' said Mohamed Abolghar, head of the Egyptian Social . Democratic Party, to which the army-appointed interim prime minister . belongs. Noting Mubarak's age and the jail time . he has served, he said: 'We should focus on building the country, . establishing democracy and finishing the problem of the Muslim . Brotherhood. 'The government knows that if Mubarak is freed there will be public outrage, but a court decision is a court decision.' Khaled Dawoud, spokesman of the . liberal Dostour Party, said the trials of the ex-president and his . associates had all been flawed because the judiciary was ill-equipped to . deal with cases related to Mubarak's rule, resulting in a series of . acquittals. 'It was a faulty process from the beginning,' he said. The relatively muted response from . Mubarak's non-Islamist opponents may reflect a reluctance to rock the . boat following the army's removal of Morsi, which they had endorsed. The generals say they were responding . to the will of the people after vast demonstrations organised by . liberals and leftists demanding Morsi's ousting. They have installed an . interim administration to oversee a roadmap back to democracy. Hundreds of people - including 70 . policemen and soldiers - have been killed in Egypt since the . military-backed government forcibly dispersed sit-ins supporting the . ousted Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo a week ago. The . resulting massacre saw President Barack Obama interrupt his holiday in . Martha's Vineyard to declare that his government would not hold a . planned joint military exercise with Egyptian forces next month. But . Obama remained silent on the question of whether the billions of . dollars in foreign aid sent to Egypt from the U.S. each year will . continue in spite of the ongoing bloodshed. The EU and its member states last year pledged a combined 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in loans and aid for Egypt. Diplomats from several EU countries cautioned that a decision to halt all aid programs was unlikely since many are directed at helping the poor or propping up civil society groups - not directly supporting the government. Moreover, EU threats to cut some aid may not frighten Egypt's leadership since Saudi Arabia - a long-time critic of the Muslim Brotherhood - has pledged to plug any shortfall. Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf nations, including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have so far promised $12 billion in new aid. A suspension of EU arms shipments seemed more likely. 'I would assume that no one would export arms in this situation,' Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said on his way into the meeting. The Islamists arrested in Egypt yesterday include a preacher known for his fiery sermons at Muslim Brotherhood gatherings, who was reportedly caught as he tried to flee to neighbouring Libya in disguise, and a spokesman for the movement said to have been en route to catch a flight out of the country. Crackdown: Egyptian authorities have already detained Mohammed Badie, the Muslim Brotherhood's supreme leader and spiritual guide . Tensions: Egyptian soldiers stood guard at a military checkpoint during a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Cairo . Strife: Egyptian soldiers stand guard beside a tank at a military checkpoint in Cairo, as the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood figures continues . They are the latest allies of President Mohammed Morsi, who hails from the Brotherhood, to be arrested. This week, authorities detained the Brotherhood's supreme leader and spiritual . guide, Mohammed Badie, dealing a serious blow to an embattled movement . now struggling to keep up its protest campaign against the military's . overthrow of Morsi and subsequent deadly assaults on pro-Morsi sit-ins.

"Michelle Young, the divorcee who attacked her £20million court settlement as a 'mockery', has also branded herself a champion of women's rights, and her ex-husband as a man of 'no feeling'. The 49-year-old, who was hoping for £300million plus expenses, conceded that to some it may seem like a fortune but insists her case exposes how people fall through the net in family law. She also attacked her husband for cruelly forcing one of their daughters into state education. Her comments come at the end of a seven-year legal battle on Thursday, from which she emerged glaring. Battle: Michelle Young, here with daughters Sasha and Scarlet, claims she is doing this for women's rights . Despite telling the court she needed enough money to buy a £25million . mansion in London’s exclusive Belgravia, a judge ruled that ‘fixer . for the super-rich’ Scot Young, 51, would have to give his wife £20million. She had hoped to walk away with a nine-figure pay out from the man she refers to as 'Mr Young', who the judge ruled had hidden £45million from the court. Today she told The Daily Telegraph: 'I have made a stand for women. 'My case has exposed the woeful shortcomings of the family law system. 'I don't want to go through this for nothing, I want to see the law changed to protect women like me with children by men who conveniently find they suddenly have no assets when they want to go off with a younger woman. 'I think and hope this case is making history.' Warring: Scot, left, and his estranged wife Michelle, right, pictured arriving at the High Court in London on Thursday. She has always maintained that her husband, 'a fixer for the super-rich', was hiding his assets . Blasting 'Mr Young' as 'emotionless', . she attacked him for driving one of their two daughters into state . education when she could no longer afford the £5,375-a-term fees for . Francis Holland School in London. The mother and two daughters, Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19, have moved into a two-bedroom flat partly paid for by housing benefit. Sasha and Mrs Young share a room. It has been a tough battle for the family learning to travel by Tube and shop at markets. She . said: 'If you loved your children, you wouldn't do this sort of thing . to them, no matter what he says about loving them. When I see him it . makes my skin crawl.' However, in the final hearing this week, the judge launched a scathing . attack on both Youngs as parents, saying he felt ‘nothing but sympathy’ for their . two children, and criticising the warring couple for failing to be . ‘child-focused’. In his ruling, Mr Justice Moor said: ‘It is undoubtedly the most difficult financial remedy case I have ever come across. ‘This case has been extraordinary even . by the standards of the most bitter matrimonial breakdowns. Extremely . serious allegations have been bandied around like confetti. ‘Some of these allegations can only be described as “wild”. The case has cost the wife millions in litigation fees. ‘In many respects this is about as bad an example of how to litigate as I have encountered.’ He finished by saying: ‘Finally, I . feel nothing but sympathy for the two children of these parties. Through . no fault of their own, their parents’ marriage broke down. ‘A marital breakdown is distressing . enough for any child, but for the divorce to then be played out in the . full glare of the media must have been absolutely appalling for them. ‘What has occurred has not been . child-focused. I truly hope that the parents will reflect on this. I . hope it does not happen to any other children.’ Speaking outside the . court, Mrs Young – who has been refusing to finalise the divorce until . the finances are resolved – said: ‘It is a disgrace. I stand by what I . said. He is worth billions. Life of luxury: Michelle Young, pictured on the runway in Barbados with Scot and their daughter after their flight on Concorde. She told the trial they went on four exotic holidays a year . I feel nothing but sympathy for the two children. This must have been absolutely appalling for them . Mr Justice Moor . ‘Many people will be watching this and . think it’s a fortune but all this order is is a piece of paper. This . isn’t over. Not for me. Not for my two daughters and not for Mr Young.’ Asked about his wife’s reaction to the ruling, Mr Young said: ‘Disgraceful? That was my wife’s quote was it? No comment.’ Mrs Young had demanded half her . husband’s assets, claiming that he was worth ‘a few billion pounds at . least’ but had hidden away his cash in a series of secret investments. He was said to have created a business . structure called ‘Project Marriage Walk’ to hide assets from his wife . as their marriage hit the rocks.

Wronged: Michelle Young has been forced to pursue her estranged husband through the courts for years, claiming that he tried to avoid reaching a divorce settlement . Moving on: Scot Young pictured his model and TV presenter girlfriend Noelle Reno . After employing 13 sets of lawyers and . four teams of accountants, she remains convinced that property tycoon . Mr Young’s claims of bankruptcy are ‘lies’. But handing down his ruling, Mr . Justice Moor said: ’Doing as best as I can, I find that he still has . £45million hidden from this court. ‘The wife is entitled to a lump sum of . £20million. I can see no reasons why the husband should not pay the sum . quickly – I therefore order him to pay within 28 days.’ He added: ‘I have rejected all the more fanciful allegations made against him. ‘I cannot see how he would have . complied with an order for a lump sum of £300million let alone . £400million. I hope that he will take the view that he is better off . paying the lower sum of £20million so that he can concentrate on . rebuilding his life.’ After beginning their relationship in . 1989 and having two daughters, the Youngs had bought a home in London, a . mansion in Oxfordshire,  luxurious residences around the globe and . travelled by  private jet. But after they separated in 2006 a . bitter battle for cash began. Mr Young offered his wife a £300million . settlement on 25 August 2009 – but the next year insisted that he had . suffered a financial ‘meltdown’. The court heard a further claim that . Mr Young had then suggested another offer of £27million, saying that . ‘only a greedy cow would refuse that’. By DAVID WILKES . This isn't over: Speaking outside court today Michelle Young said she was furious and branded the judgment 'disgraceful' They enjoyed a lifestyle known only by the world’s wealthiest, globe-trotting by private jet between their vast homes. Inhabiting a world few people can imagine, Scot and Michelle Young mixed in a superleague of power players. But as details of their fantastic riches were aired in court during one of Britain’s most acrimonious and colourful divorce battles, perhaps the most eyebrow-raising moment was the revelation of the largesse of Mr Young’s friends after the marriage fell apart. In a statement to the court, retail tycoon Sir Philip Green said he had loaned Mr Young £80,000 in 2008 ‘as a favour’ to help pay for a Regent’s Park flat for Mrs Young. Restaurateur Richard Caring confirmed that he loaned Mr Young £50,000 as he had known him for many years and wanted to help him through his financial difficulties. Mrs Young, 49, sensationally alleged that the two men, along with X Factor impresario Simon Cowell and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky were involved in a conspiracy to hide her husband’s assets. Her bombshell claim to the High Court came as she pursued former property developer Mr Young for part of the billions of pounds she said he had hidden. But Mr Young, 51, said he was left penniless after the collapse of a Moscow deal that cost him his entire fortune virtually overnight. She even alleged her husband was a major shareholder with Cowell’s American Idol show, and added: ‘I am told I will never find out the truth because these people are wealthy and powerful.’ Mr Young, a former fixer to the super-rich, told the court his wife’s claims were those of a ‘fantasist’ and rejected her accusation that his friends were ‘sheltering’ his money. He had met Cowell fewer than five times and had ‘never had any business with him’, and it was ‘laughable’ that he had a secret shareholding American Idol. Mr Young claimed he had ‘probably bumped into Sir Philip in the street once and seen him outside a nightclub once’ in two years. He said he had had no income since 2006 and was living ‘with the support of friends’. Sir Philip, Mr Cowell, Mr Caring and Mr Berezovsky, who was found hanged at his Ascot mansion earlier this year, all dismissed her allegations of a conspiracy. In his ruling yesterday, the judge said that he ‘entirely and unreservedly’ accepted the evidence given to the court by Sir Philip and Mr Caring about their loans to Mr Young. Before their split, the couple lived in unimaginable luxury. They owned six mansions in Belgravia, Britain’s most exclusive postcode, and the family home was £21million Wood Perry House in Oxfordshire, described as ‘Buckingham Palace in miniature’. They also had a £3.5million beach house in Miami, a yacht in Monaco, employed a small army of servants and housekeepers, and dined in the finest restaurants. They drove fabulous cars, including two Mercedes Gullwings worth £700,000 each. Mr Young had a £70,000 watch, and said jewellery he bought for his wife’s 40th cost £150,000.","Michelle Young claims she made a stand for women and will make history .

"The online auction site eBay shaved almost £50million from its corporation tax bill in Britain by legally channelling payments through Luxembourg and Switzerland, it has emerged. The U.S. firm paid just a little over £1million in tax in Britain - despite generating sales of almost £800million in this country. Meanwhile Swedish furniture firm Ikea cut its UK tax bill by half by siphoning off profits overseas in the form of royalty payments to a sister company, it has been found. Headquarters: eBAY has said its European arm complies fully with all applicable tax laws and regimes . The news comes after it emerged coffee giant Starbucks has paid no tax in the UK in the past three years. The coffee chain has used loopholes in order to pay just £8.6million in tax in 14 years of trading in Britain - during which time it has raked in over £3billion in revenues. Foreign firms' use of savvy accounting techniques to legally avoid paying tax in Britain has provoked fury among politicians and consumers. eBay, the world's largest online marketplace, is structured in a way that allows it to dramatically reduce its UK tax liability. Furniture giant Ikea paid £8.1million in corporation tax on sales of almost £1.2billion and profits of £23.6million . According to an investigation by The Sunday Times, using a group-wide profit margin of 23 per cent, eBay's UK profits would have been £181million in 2010. At the time this would have resulted in a corporation tax bill of £51million. But the total amount of tax paid by the firm's four main UK-based subsidiaries for that year was £1.2million. This is partially down to the fact . that fees stumped up by eBay sellers in Britain are handed over to a . related company in Luxembourg called PayPal (Europe) Sarl, meaning most . sales are channelled through a tax haven. Other U.S. firms including Facebook and Google are known to use similarly complex methods of moving money out of Britain and into countries with lower tax rates. Furniture chain Ikea paid £8.1million corporation tax in the year to August 2011, on sales of almost £1.2billion and profits of £23.6million. The investigation found the firm uses a legal accounting trick to lower profits in Britain, by way of paying a three per cent 'franchise fee' to a separate company based in Holland. The fee covers the right to use Ikea's furniture designs and its trademark. In 2010-11 Ikea's profits in Britain were reduced by £35.7million by the fee, meaning the exchequer did not receive £9.7million in corporation tax it otherwise would have from Ikea's UK subsidiary. The fee was paid to Inter Ikea Systems BV in Holland, which is controlled by another firm based in tax haven Liechtenstein. The Public Accounts Committee are set to question the head of HM Revenue & Customs over the kinds of methods being used by foreign firms to legally avoid paying UK tax at a parliamentary hearing next month. Starbucks - the second largest restaurant or cafe chain in the world after McDonald's - has recorded losses in Britain while telling investors the UK market is profitable. It is now facing a backlash after thousands of outraged customers pledged to boycott its branches after learning of the host of complicated measures Starbucks employs to legally avoid paying tax in Britain. A spokesman for eBay said: . 'eBay Inc in Europe works with tax authorities and complies fully with . all applicable tax laws and regimes - including national and . internationally recognised rules.' An Ikea spokesman told the Sunday Times: 'There is a 3% franchise fee on Ikea sales worldwide. Tax authorities in the Netherlands have consistently confirmed that Inter Ikea Systems BV is the beneficial owner of the Ikea retail system and the franchise fee income.' Boycott: Thousands of customers have pledged to stop visiting Starbucks after it emerged the chain has not paid corporation tax in Britain in three years . Starbucks, which has to pay VAT on in-store hot drinks, has said it continues to pay its 'fair share' in taxes in full compliance with all UK tax laws. 'There has been no suggestion by any authority that we are anything but compliant and good tax payers,' the chain has said.","eBay generates sales of more than £800million a year in Britain - but paid only a little over £1million in corporation tax in the country .

"A mysterious explosion that rocked Nicaragua on Saturday night, creating a 39ft-wide (12 metre) crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite. And authorities in the region believe the meteorite was in fact a shard of rock from the 2014 RC ‘pitbull’ asteroid that soared past Earth over the weekend. The impact, close to the country’s international airport, did not cause any known injuries, but the hit was powerful enough to be felt throughout the capital, according to reports. The explosion hit woodland in Managua in Nicaragua on Saturday and created a crater measuring 39 feet (12 metres) wide (pictured). Authorities in the region believe it was a shard of rock from the 2014 RC ‘pitbull’ asteroid that soared past Earth at a similar time to the impact . Tests are now being carried out on the crater to learn more about how it was formed. ‘We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,’ said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute. Nasa estimates the 2014 RC asteroid to be approximately 65ft (20 metres) wide - roughly the same size as a large house. This makes it similar in size to the Chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over Russia’s Ural Mountains region in February 2013. At the time of closest approach, asteroid 2014 RC was said to be one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon - or about 25,000 miles (40,000km). The asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm BST (2.18pm EST), as it travelled over New Zealand. It did not hit Earth, but its orbit will bring it back to our planet's neighbourhood in the future. The asteroid's future motion will be closely monitored, but no future threatening Earth encounters have been identified, according to Nasa. The Nicaraguan authorities continued that the timing of the impact fits closely with the passing of the ['pitbull'] asteroid, which passed very close to Earth on Sunday. A meteorite was also spotted flying over Spain on Sunday evening, and astrophysicists are trying to determine if the two events are related. Before the event, Nasa estimated the asteroid to be approximately 65ft (20 metres) wide - roughly the same size as a house. This makes it similar in size to the Chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over Russia’s Ural Mountains region in February 2013. At the time of its closest approach, asteroid 2014 RC was said to be one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon - or about 25,000 miles (40,000km). The meteorite, which may have splintered from the asteroid, is said to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight, and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes. This is the incredible moment an asteroid the size of a house skimmed past the Earth. The rock, known as 2014 RC or Pitbull, made the unexpected close approach during the early hours of September 8 . Before the event, Nasa estimated the asteroid (Nasa image, pictured) to be approximately 65ft (20 metres) wide - roughly the same size as a large house. The asteroid was reported to have been closest to Earth at approximately 7.18pm BST (2.18pm EST), over New Zealand . The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport in the Nicaraguan capital (pictured) at around midnight on Saturday. The hit was so large, experts at the Seismic Institute said it registered on the instruments used to measure earthquakes . ‘You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,’ Mr Strauss continued. Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday. One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil. ‘You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,’ Martinez said. 2014 RC zipped passed a cluster of television and weather satellites around 22,000 miles from the Earth's surface at around 8pm UK time. Nasa scientists said it would be difficult to spot the asteroid without using a telescope and that it is likely to be even closer to the moon . The whale-sized asteroid had a ‘very close’ shave with Earth . on Sunday. This image shows the orbit of asteroid . 2014 RC around the sun. The asteroid is about 60ft (20 metres) across in size . Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, told MailOnline: 'The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth last night, raises some interesting questions. 'Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it. 'If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don’t really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there.' Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Managua would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about ‘this fascinating event’ in the Central American nation, one of Latin America's poorest countries.

The team is now studying footage and adding it to scientific data its machines gathered to try and work out what it was, where it entered the atmosphere, and where it ended up. Trigo added: 'Calibration requires weeks of research when there is an absence of stars in the images. But nevertheless, it has been made easier thanks to all the social media video footage and pictures.' Local emergency services also received several calls about the meteorite from panicked people wondering if it might be a plane or a UFO on fire. It is believed that the suspected meteorite crashed in a remote location. Trigo added that, given the size of the fireball, the suspected meteorite was almost certainly too large to have burnt up and therefore would have impacted somewhere – adding: 'The question now is to find out where.'

"A spokesperson for Coca Cola said they would not be changing the recipe of their flagship drink insisting that they offer a range of lower sugar options (picture posed by model) Food giants which promised to make products healthier under the Government’s trumpeted ‘responsibility deal’ have simply side-stepped their pledges, it has emerged. Some of the world’s biggest firms have failed to reduce calories or sugar content in their most popular brands - including Coca Cola, Magnum ice cream and Kit Kat chocolate. The Public Health Responsibility Deal, introduced by the Government in 2011, has been much criticised by health campaigners, who say it gives the food and drink industries carte blanche to regulate themselves. Some 663 organisations are ‘partners’ in the responsibility deal, under which they have made variety of pledges covering marketing, labelling and workplace practices. Thirty seven firms, including Coca Cola, Mars, Nestlé and PepsiCo, signed up to a ‘calorie reduction’ pledge. Their promise included ‘supporting and enabling’ customers to eat and drink fewer calories through actions such as product/menu reformulation, reviewing portion sizes, education and information, and actions to shift the marketing mix towards lower calorie options’. But it has emerged that some of the companies have not touched their main brands - instead focusing on reduced sugar in lesser-known products or altering labelling. Campaigners called on ministers to abandon the voluntary system and instead introduce sugar reduction targets similar to those in place for salt. Coca Cola has reduced the calories in its Sprite drink - but has refused to change its flagship product. Unilever, which makes Wall’s and Ben & Jerry’s ice creams has reduced the number of calories in children’s ice creams but not in its normal range. Nestlé has cut the calories in Aero and white Kit Kat Chunky bars but not in ordinary milk chocolate Kit Kats. Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘The problem with the Responsibility Deal is that it is all voluntary. ‘As far as Coke is concerned it remains the same product it was 10 years ago — there doesn’t seem to have been any change at all. ‘We need targets. Unless we get the target we have no benchmark.’ Keith Vaz MP said the voluntary code was not working and said the government should introduce targets to reduce the amount of sugar in food and drinks . Health experts have become increasingly concerned at the population’s intake of sugar - comparing it to tobacco in terms of its public health impact. Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said in January: ‘Sugar is the new tobacco. ‘Everywhere, sugary drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health. ‘Obesity and diabetes already cost the UK over £5billion a year. Without regulation, these costs will exceed £50billion by 2050.’ Obesity and diabetes costs the UK economy in the region of £5 billion a year . As part of its commitment to the calorie pledge, Coca Cola has cut the amount of sugar and calories in Glacéau vitaminwater and Sprite by 30 per cent. But a 330ml can of Coca Cola still contains 35g - or nine teaspoons - of sugar. A spokesman for Coca Cola GB said: ‘We have no plans to change Coca Cola. We know that people love it and we provide two great-tasting sugar-free, no calorie options in Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero, which together comprise more than 40 per cent of the cola we sell in the UK.’ Nestlé has reduced the number of calories in Aero and white KitKat Chunky bars by 5 per cent. However, it has not reduced the number of calories in milk chocolate KitKat bars and other popular products such as Lions and Rolos. Unilever, which owns Wall’s and Ben & Jerry’s, pledged to cut the number of calories in children’s ice creams, which now contain 110 or fewer calories per serving. It is also offering ‘smaller and lower calorie alternative choices’ such as mini Magnums. But ordinary Magnum bars and ice cream tubs from Ben & Jerry’s have not been changed. A Unilever spokesman said: ‘Sugar plays an important role in ice cream, not only for taste but also for texture and structure. However, we have a programme in place that aims to gradually reduce sugar in our products whilst maintaining our high standards of product quality.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Many manufacturers and retailers are already taking sugar, fat and salt out of their products as a result of our Responsibility Deal, which is based on working collaboratively with industry rather than imposing unrealistic targets. ‘The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition is currently undertaking a review of carbohydrates, and they are looking at sugar as part of this. Their draft report which is due to be published later this year will inform our future thinking.’","Producers pledged to reduce sugar following a 2011 deal with Government .
