"(CNN) -- It's been a year of up and down form for Rory McIlroy, but could major championship winning consistency finally be on the horizon? The Northern Irishman stretched his overnight lead at the British Open at Hoylake Friday with a majestic second round of 66 -- matching his score Thursday -- to finish the day on 12-under-par. Despite starting with a bogey at the first, McIlroy recovered to sink seven birdies and comfortably leads the way from America's Dustin Johnson who lies four shots back in second place at 8-under-par. A chasing group featuring Francesco Molinari, Ryan Moore, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia and Louis Oosthuizen are all tied for third at 6-under-par. It was almost a disastrous day for Tiger Woods, however, as the three-time Open champion carded a round of 77 to end the day at 2-over-par and only just make the cut. After an opening round of 69, Woods was only three shots off the pace going into Friday but dropped like a stone on an often windy but sun-kissed afternoon on England's northwest coast. In truth, Woods exhibited the kind of frustrating yo-yo form between first and second rounds that has inhibited McIlroy over the past months. Just last week, McIlroy backed up an opening round of 64 with a 78 to slip off the way off the pace at the Scottish Open. There were to be no such worries Friday, however. There was even a moment of light relief when a pheasant wandered across the eighth as McIlroy prepared to putt. ""I just wanted to stick to my gameplan,"" McIlroy told BBC Sport upon reaching the clubhouse. ""I had a shaky start with a bogey at the start but settled in and just played really well."" Looking towards Saturday and the stormy weather that is forecast for the early morning, McIlroy added that he hopes his major championship experience will stand him in good stead. ""Depending on what weather we get, I'm looking forward to it. I've been in this position before and enjoyed it and I'll try to enjoy it again,"" he said. McIlroy will have to watch out for the red-hot Johnson whose impressive 65, which included seven birdies, was the lowest score of the day. The 30-year-old South Carolinian has yet to win a major but revealed he was relishing the challenge at Hoylake. ""I'm glad I'm in the last group and playing with Rory,"" Johnson said. ""But I've got to go out and play my game. I can't worry about what he is doing. I'll just go out there and try to shoot a good number."" Further back, Francesco Molinari will also fancy his chances if he can replicate the shot-making he displayed on the back nine after a tough start while Sergio Garcia is still in with a shot of claiming his illusive first major. ""I played some really good golf on the back nine and I'm happy with what I did,"" Molinari said. ""I usually keep an eye on the leaderboard but it's still tough conditions out there. You need to be 100% focused on what you're doing."" Despite a brutal of round that saw him record two double bogeys, Woods struck a similarly optimistic tone in conversation with reporters. He even highlighted the dramatic victory of Paul Lawrie at the 1999 Open at Muirfield as his inspiration for the weekend. ""I had some opportunities but I never made anything. I had myself in good position to make birdies but I never did. ""Hopefully I can do something like Paul did in 1999, make up 10 in one day."" Elsewhere on the course, there was no luck for big hitters Ernie Els, Bubba Watson and Lee Westwood who all missed the cut.","Rory McIlroy extends lead at British Open after second round of 66 .

"(CNN) -- He's been out of competitive action for most of 2014, but Tiger Woods will return to golf next week. Woods, who underwent back surgery to repair a pinched nerve in March, will play at his own Quicken Loans National event at the Congressional Country Club as he begins his preparations for the third major of the season -- the British Open. ""After a lot of therapy I have recovered well and will be supporting my foundation next week at the Quicken Loans National,"" said Woods on his Facebook page. ""I've just started to hit full shots but it's time to take the next step. I will be a bit rusty but I want to play myself back into competitive shape. Excited for the challenge ahead."" Woods was forced to miss The Masters in April as well as the U.S. Open in June as the 14-time major champion recovered from surgery. The 38-year-old's last major victory came at the 2008 U.S. Open. He has now missed six major championships through injury, his absence at Augusta the first time he'd not been at the Masters since making his debut there as an amateur in 1995. Stuck on 14 majors since 2008, Woods has two more chances this season to close in on Jack Nicklaus' record haul of 18. Staged at Hoylake in north west England this year, the Open starts on 17 July. McIlroy misses cut . Days after saying he would represent Ireland -- not Great Britain -- at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Rory McIlroy failed to make the cut at the Irish Open. A poor first round of 3-over-par 74 immediately put McIlroy under pressure and even with a 2-under 69 Friday, he missed out on the weekend's action. McIlroy -- the highest-ranked golfer in the field at No. 6 -- needed to hit an eagle on the final hole to make the cut but could only produce a birdie. ""It's very frustrating,"" McIlroy, who also missed the cut in 2013, told the European Tour's website. ""To make six birdies and an eagle and shoot just two under means there were a lot of mistakes and wasteful shots. ""I just need to tighten it all up and become a lot more consistent, make the bad shots a little bit better and not be as wasteful around the greens. If I can do that, I know my game is right there. I've got a couple weeks off now to work on my game a little bit, play some links golf and get ready for the Scottish Open and the (British) Open.""

"(CNN) -- The daughter of Cuba's president supports the re-election bid of U.S. President Barack Obama, but believes he could do more were it not for the pressures he is facing, she said in an interview broadcast Monday on ""CNNi's Amanpour."" ""As a citizen of the world, I would like him to win,"" said Mariela Castro Espin, daughter of Raul Castro, in the exclusive interview, which was conducted Friday in New York. ""Given the choices, I prefer Obama."" The 49-year-old gay rights advocate said that Obama has been constrained in his ability to effect change. ""He wants to do much more than what he's been able to do,"" she said. ""That's the way I interpret it personally. I don't know if I'm being objective."" Still, she said, ""I believe that Obama needs another opportunity and he needs greater support to move forward with his projects and with his ideas, which I believe come from the bottom of his heart."" Asked if Obama would lift the half-century-old trade embargo on Cuba if he could, Castro said, ""I believe that Obama is a fair man. And I believe Obama needs greater support to be able to make these decisions. If Obama had all the political support of the American people, then we could normalize our relationships, as good or better than we had under President Carter."" During his single term as president, from 1977 to 1981, Jimmy Carter eased restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba. Castro added that she supports the release of Alan Gross, a U.S. citizen arrested in Cuba in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years on charges of subversion. But, she added, she also wants to see the release of the ""Cuban Five,"" who are being held in the United States for crimes of espionage. Castro was unswayed by Gross' recent request that he be allowed to visit his 90-year-old mother before she dies if he promises to return afterward to prison in Cuba. ""Alan Gross has been granted everything that he's asked for: He has been able to see his wife, he has been able to have matrimonial, conjugal visits, and he has been treated with respect and dignity the way we always treat prisoners in Cuba,"" Castro said. ""We haven't received the same treatment on the other hand for our five prisoners who have very long sentences that are not right. I think that the six must be released -- both the five Cubans and Alan Gross."" ""Is that what you're saying, that Alan Gross should be released and the Cuban Five?"" host Christiane Amanpour asked. ""Of course,"" Castro responded. ""I'm referring to the five Cubans and Alan Gross. I believe that this would be the happiest solution for all involved."" The gay rights activist said that sexual orientation and gender identification are among the rights that Communist Cuba still needs to address. A bill legalizing civil unions, not same-sex marriage, has been proposed, ""however, this hasn't happened as yet,"" she said. ""And people who are in same-sex couples do not have any protection in that sense."" She predicted the legislature would address the matter, which her father has not opposed, this year. Castro said the nation had learned to acknowledge and correct past mistakes after its aggressive quarantine policy for HIV-positive men and women during the early years of the AIDS epidemic was abandoned in 1993. ""I never agreed with these quarantines,"" she said. ""There were several international health organizations that evaluated these quarantines as a positive thing at a time when not much was known about how the epidemic spreads."" Amanpour pointed to a Human Rights Watch description of Cuba as ""the only country in Latin America that represses virtually all forms of political dissent."" But Castro said the rights group ""does not represent the opinion of the Cuban people. And their informants are mercenaries. They're people who have been paid by a foreign government for media shows that do not represent Cuban positions directly."" She defended her nation as one that allows dissent. ""People who dissent don't go to jail,"" she said. ""Everybody in Cuba expresses their view and there's a political participation so that we can express ourselves and question everything."" Holding an opinion contrary to that of the government ""enriches the debate,"" she said. ""No one goes to prison for an opinion, rather for serving foreign interests who pay them. That's called being a mercenary and that's penalized in laws everywhere in the world, including the laws of this country."" She said the island's single-party system would disappear if other nations would stop trying to impose their will on Cuba. ""If Cuba's sovereignty weren't threatened, if the internal affairs of Cuba weren't manipulated in media campaigns, if Cuba weren't the subject of an economic and trade embargo, which has caused so many problems for us, then in Cuba, it wouldn't make sense to have a sole party, just one party,"" she said. Though some critics have said the nation relies on the embargo to crack down on internal dissent, and that the nation's socialist system would collapse if the United States were to lift the embargo, Castro disagreed about what would happen to her country. ""I think it would become stronger,"" she said. ""This is why they don't lift the embargo."" Castro offered no sympathy for Yoani Sanchez, the dissident blogger inside Cuba who has won multiple awards for her work, which is critical of the Castro government. ""She gives service to foreign powers who are interested in eliminating the Cuban experience,"" Castro said. ""She's an official voice of the global dominant powers."" Castro disputed Sanchez's assertion that she was not allowed to work. ""She is allowed to work in Cuba,"" Castro said. ""But she makes much more money with the prizes, which are being sent to her from abroad, than for any work that she might do with the very low wages that we have in Cuba."" Castro predicted that Sanchez's audience will ""get bored of hearing lies,"" and her influence will wane. ""She doesn't really fight for authentic rights; she's not committed to the rights movement in Cuba, because she doesn't even participate in any of the debates that are trying to achieve rights."" Castro blamed the trade embargo for the fact that many Cubans are not able to use the Internet. ""We pay Internet over satellite, which is very expensive,"" she said. ""We don't have the access to the fiber optic lines that pass by Cuba. We're negotiating with Venezuela to help us so we can maximize access to Internet."" But she said Cubans still have access to ""very big social networks."" ""There is more access to the Internet in Cuba, legal and illegal, than you can imagine, because the Cuban people are a curious people. And you can't deny us the access to information."" Asked about Sen. Robert Menendez's description of her as ""a vocal advocate of the regime, an opponent of democracy, who has defended the brutal repression of democracy activists,"" Castro called the Democrat from New Jersey ""a person who really doesn't have his feet down on the ground."" Asked why the United States had issued Castro a visa, a State Department spokesman noted that she had visited the United States twice during the George W. Bush administration. ""However, one should not mistake the fact that a visa was granted to this person with our general policy towards Cuba,"" Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Michael A. Hammer told reporters in Washington. ""In fact, we want, and we allow freedom of expression in our country, something, which in fact, does not occur in Cuba.""","""I would like him to win,"" Mariela Castro says of Obama's election bid .

"(CNN) -- Shark attacks were up last year, according to the University of Florida, but before you put that New Smyrna Beach timeshare on the market, please realize the numbers, statistically, are kind of meaningless. Then why on Earth is CNN writing about this, you ask? Because research shows you like sharks and are prone to consume stories about their more violent sides. What is less clear is why. Despite the popularity of shark attack stories, the actual odds of a hammerhead latching on to your midsection during a morning swim are minuscule, especially when you consider that your toilet and the neighbor's dog pose far more risk to you. You should also consider that if sharks had fancy news websites like CNN.com, their pages would likely be rife with (""Jaws""-dropping?) headlines about the estimated 30 million to 70 million of them that we kill every year. To be sure, sharks killed seven of us worldwide last year, according to Monday's UF report. ""Shark attack as a phenomenon is extremely uncommon, considering the millions of hours humans spend in the water each year,"" George Burgess, director of the Florida Program of Shark Research at the state's Museum of Natural History, said in a news release. Shark seriously injures California surfer . Let's have a look at the numbers, and we'll get back to the dangers of that toilet. There were 80 unprovoked attacks last year worldwide. An unprovoked attack is one in which the shark strikes first, as opposed to a provoked attack that often comes when a fisherman is trying to land one of the beasts with a hook or net. Eighty marked a slight uptick from 2011. However, in the United States, there were 53 attacks, the most since 2000. Also concerning to researchers is that for consecutive years there have been multiple attacks in western Australia (five in 2012) and off Reunion Island (three in 2012), located about 400 miles east of Madagascar. Another startling statistic is that of the four attacks in South Africa last year, three were fatal. That's a 75% fatality rate, as opposed to a 22% rate worldwide and a 2% rate in the U.S., where most shark attacks occur. It's not that South African shark varieties are any fiercer; the numbers are more likely a product of ""superior safety and medical capabilities in the U.S.,"" Burgess said. Surfer dies after shark attack . Here is a rundown of the U.S. attacks: . --Florida led the way at 26, with Brevard and Volusia counties tallying eight and seven, respectively; . --Then came Hawaii with 10; . --California and South Carolina were next with five each; . --North Carolina registered two; . --And Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Puerto Rico each had one. ""The numbers from an international standpoint were on target for the last couple of years because, in theory, each year we should have more attacks than the previous year owing to the rise of human population from year to year,"" Burgess said. Most of those attacked, 60%, were surfers, while swimmers and divers composed another 30% of the incidents. That doesn't mean you need to hang up your longboard or regulator. ""Shark attacks are rare and it doesn't matter whether you call them attacks or bites or bumps -- your chances of having any of them are slim,"" Burgess said. How slim? The Florida Museum of Natural History has a host of phenomena that are more likely than a shark attack, and National Geographic in 2011 put together a list of things that are more likely to injure you. Among them: . --Since 1948, those in any U.S. state with alligators had a better chance of being killed by one of the reptiles, which had killed 18 people as of 2005, than they did of suffering a fatal shark attack. Conversely, those folks still had a slightly better chance of a nonfatal shark attack. --Between 1985 and 2010, Floridians were almost 21 times as likely to be killed by a tornado (125 deaths) as by a shark (six). Between 1990 and 2009, the state also saw 2,272 bicycle deaths, compared to four from sharks. --In the coastal U.S., lightning killed almost 76 times as many people (1,970) as did sharks (26) between 1959 and 2010. --From 2001 to 2010, dogs killed more than 26 times the number of people (263) than did sharks (10) in the U.S. --Between 1984 and 1987, New York City had almost 1,600 incidents annually of humans biting other humans. That's not really germane to this story so much as it is plain odd. --Sand-hole collapses aren't generally considered among the greatest threats in the U.S., as they killed only 16 people between 1990 and 2006 -- but that's still five more people than sharks killed. --In 1996, toilets injured 43,000 Americans, buckets and pails hurt almost 11,000 and room fresheners were responsible for 2,600 injuries in the nation. Sharks injured 13 people that same year. (There are a variety of toilet-related injuries: Seats can fall, smashing boys' genitalia mid-micturition; cracks in toilet seats can pinch a user's buttocks; and, as the ladies have explained time and time again, gentlemen, leaving the toilet seat up can cause folks to crash into the toilet bowl, damaging their buttocks and/or tailbones.) While it can't always be said that you have a better chance of winning the lottery than being the victim of a shark attack -- it depends on which type of lottery and how many people are playing -- it seems certain you're better served watching out for that commode than for fins on the water. Happy surfing.","University of Florida issues new statistics, but numbers can be misleading .
You're more likely to be injured by a toilet or sand hole collapse than by a shark .
Dogs killed almost 26 times as many people as sharks in first decade of 21st century ."
"(CNN) -- Despite claims to the contrary, the Syrian government is almost certainly responsible for a blackout Thursday that shut down virtually all Internet service in the country, according to a leading Web security firm. ""The Syrian Minister of Information is being reported as saying that the government did not disable the Internet, but instead the outage was caused by a cable being cut,"" writes Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare. ""From our investigation, that appears unlikely to be the case."" Fighting again between rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad disrupted much of Damascus on Friday, and there was no Internet service throughout much of Syria for a second straight day. The airport was closed to flights, and fighting killed another 31 people across the country on Friday, according to an opposition group that counts casualties. A Syrian government information minister said that ""terrorists"" -- which is how the Assad regime refers to rebels in a bloody, ongoing civil war -- cut the cable, knocking out Web communication with other countries. Rebels have routinely used the Web to transmit images of the civil war, including what they claim have been military attacks by the Assad regime on civilians. But Prince said only four Internet cables connect Syria to the outside world. Three of them run underseas, and the fourth is an overland line through Turkey. ""In order for a whole country outage, all four of these cables would have had to been cut simultaneously,"" he wrote. ""That is unlikely to have happened."" Connections in all regions of Syria, not just routes in some, were shut down in the outage, which began at 5:26 a.m. EST on Thursday, he wrote. The exclusive provider of Web service in Syria is the state-run Syrian Telecommunications Establishment. The last four sites accessed on CloudFlare before the outage were a photo-sharing site, a Syrian news site, a Muslim-oriented social networking site and a porn site, according to Prince. ""In other words, traffic from Syrians accessing the Internet in the moments before they were cut off from the rest of the world looks remarkably similar to traffic from any part of the world,"" he wrote. Web analytics company Renesys, which has closely monitored the Syria situation, reported Friday that a small handful of ""net blocks"" that had survived the original blackout had been yanked offline, as well. Renesys originally reported that about 90% of Syria's Internet connections were offline. A graphic on the firm's site Friday showed virtually no service remaining. The moment that Syria's Internet went down . Syrian government sites, however, had remained accessible because they're hosted in other countries, including the United States. The New York Times reports that several hosting companies said they were working late Thursday to take those sites down. The U.S. government has been providing Syrian rebels with ""non-lethal equipment,"" including communication tools to get around Internet outages. ""The Syrian government has been monitoring (the Internet) for years. They have been using the Internet with Iranian assistance to track opposition activists, arrest and kill them,"" said Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, in Washington on Wednesday. Beyond bodies and bombs: Syrians attempt 'a normal life' Meanwhile, Web giant Google is pitching in, enabling in Syria a service that lets users post messages to Twitter by speaking into a mobile phone. The service, Speak2Tweet, was developed by Google and Twitter about two years ago when Web access was shut down during a civil movement in Egypt. ""In the last day, Internet access has been completely cut off in Syria. Unfortunately we are hearing reports that mobile phones and landlines aren't working properly either,"" the company wrote in a post on its Google+ site. ""But those who might be lucky enough to have a voice connection can still use Speak2Tweet by simply leaving a voicemail"" on one of several devoted phone lines.","Security CEO: Syrian government almost certainly shut down the Web .
Analysts say essentially all Internet connections to Syria have been killed .

"(CNN) -- She'd spent all year hoping to win her first British Open, but Inbee Park has bounced back from last month's crushing disappointment. The South Korean golfer claimed her fifth major title on Sunday, retaining her LPGA Championship crown after once again going to a playoff. She needed three extra holes to win at Locust Hill last year, but this time one was enough as the 26-year-old ended American Brittany Lincicome's hopes of a second major success. ""It was a very tough tournament to forget, since I was so close and I thought I was definitely able to do it,"" Park said of the British Open, where she led going into the final round but faded to 10th after a 77. ""That's been the tournament that I've really waited for all year long, and that's been my only goal this year. And not being able to do it in the final round was very disappointing. ""It gives me a little bit of break from the British Open and I can kind of forget about it a little bit and kind of move on now."" This time Park came from behind, having been tied for second a shot adrift of 61st-ranked Lincicome going into the fourth round. She birdied the 17th and sank a 15-foot par putt at the last, while Lincicome three-putted 18 to ensure a playoff -- and then bogeyed as they played it again. It was world No. 3 Park's second playoff in as many weeks, having lost to tour rookie compatriot Mirim Lee at the Meijer LPGA Classic in Michigan. She claimed her second tournament win this year -- which has inevitably paled into comparison with last year's feats, when she won the season's opening three majors plus three other LPGA events. ""This year was always going to be a tough year after having such a great year last year,"" Park told reporters. ""You know, I feel like so far this season I've really handled myself well in this position, and it feels like I've played some good golf. And I played very consistently this year. I just sometimes didn't get that lucky as last year. Sometimes I just didn't putt as well."" For the 28-year-old Lincicome, it was her best finish at a major since winning the 2009 Kraft Nabisco Championship -- and she wept tears of joy at the finish, despite her playoff disappointment. ""I really feel like this will be the stepping stone that I kind of needed to push me to keep it going and to be in the top 10 each week like I was three years ago,"" she said. Teenager Lydia Ko, ranked second in the world, finished third on eight under overall, three shots back from the leading duo. The 17-year-old New Zealander bogeyed the last two holes, but sealed her best finish at a major. Spain's Azahara MuÃ±oz tied for fourth with Swede Anna Nordqvist, while world No. 1 Stacy Lewis was equal sixth in a group including Lee and Norway's 2007 winner Suzann Pettersen -- who had been tied for second with Park before closing with 76. Meanwhile, on the men's PGA Tour, Colombia's Camilo Villegas clinched his place in the FedEx Cup playoffs with victory at the Wyndham Championship on Sunday. The 32-year-old earned his first title since 2010 as his final-round seven-under 63 left him one shot clear of American Bill Haas (64) and Swede Freddie Jacobson (66). The former world No. 12 had tumbled to 254th in the rankings ahead of the tournament, but goes into the playoffs 37th in the U.S. tour's standings after leaping 68 places on the money list with the $954,000 first prize.","Inbee Park wins her fifth major title with playoff win at LPGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- The only bears known to inhabit New York's Central Park are at its zoo -- so how did a dead bear cub end up under a bush? Neither police nor park officials had an answer for that late Monday, hours after a morning dog walker discovered the carcass of a 3-foot-tall bear cub. The person alerted a Central Park Conservancy worker who then called the police, according to Central Park Conservancy spokeswoman Elizabeth Kaledin. She added that the bear was not from the park's zoo, but ""any time wildlife is hurt or injured we are upset and deeply alarmed."" The cub was found under a bush near West 69th Street and West Drive in the park, and appeared to show signs of trauma with an injury to its side and possible lacerations, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the bear wandered into the park or if its body was dumped there, an NYPD spokeswoman said. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's animal cruelty squad, the spokeswoman added. The carcass was taken to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany for a necropsy, according to police.","Bear cub not from Central Park Zoo .

"(CNN) -- The year was 1890. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky premiered his Sleeping Beauty ballet in St. Petersburg. Vincent van Gogh ended his life, apparently by shooting himself. And Idaho and Wyoming became the 43rd and 44th states of the United States. 1890 is also the year Carmelo Flores Laura was born, or at least, that's what his family and the Bolivian government claim. The Bolivian man, who lives in the town of Frasquia, in the arid highlands of Bolivia, showed CNN government documents that seem to confirm he's 123 years old. The documents include a birth certificate showing his birth date as July 16, 1890. There's also a national identity card with the same birth date. Several media outlets published stories about Flores calling him the oldest man alive. But there appear to be several problems with this claim. For starters, neither the birth certificate nor the national identity card is original. ""We were skeptical from the beginning,"" said Stephen Coles, a professor of gerontology at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California in Los Angeles. He's also the director of the Gerontology Research Group, an independent organization that tracks, monitors and verifies claims of longevity. ""He's not the real thing. Carmelo is not 123 years old despite the documents his family has shown. He was not born in the year 1890."" Coles said the first red flag was the fact that Flores is a man. The gerontologist said more than 90% of cases of what his organization categorizes as supercentenarians are women. Jean Louise Calment from France lived to the age of 122. Her case is the longest human lifespan that has been verified with several documents. According to Coles, there are 57 documented and verified cases of people over the age of 110 around the world. Fifty-five are women and two are men. Four other cases are still pending final verification. The Gerontology Research Group has found a document that purportedly shows Flores is actually 107 years old, and not 123. The document is a baptismal certificate. Back in 1890, the Bolivian government didn't record live births or any other demographic data, so it was up to the Catholic Church to register births, deaths and marriages. In any case, the fact that Carmelo Flores Laura has lived for more than a century in the arid highlands of Bolivia at an altitude of more than 12,000 feet is striking. Not only does he walk on his own, but his voice is still commanding. His son Cecilio Flores, who's 65 years old, has to speak loudly in his ear to communicate with him, but his memory seems to be in perfect shape. He doesn't speak Spanish, but his native Aymara, an indigenous language in Bolivia. ""I was born here in the highlands,"" Flores told CNN in Aymara, with his son translating into Spanish. ""I was not a mischievous child. I was rather calm. I arrived as a young man in Frasquia and worked as herder and farmer. I was very happy with my wife. We never fought. I never cheated on her and we were both very happy."" Flores' wife lived to be over 100 years old. According to family tradition, the secret to a long life is drinking the water that flows down the Illampu Glacier, located not far from Frasquia. Their diet includes no packaged or processed foods, but locally grown plants like barley and quinoa. They hunt a local fox that lives in the Bolivian mountains known regionally as ""zorrino."" 80 year old becomes oldest to climb Mount Everest . Before you get any ideas, the Gerontology Research Group has found that no particular diet, geographical location or kind of water makes people live longer. Coles said it's the genes. ""People who have extreme old age have virtually nothing in common. They don't share the same religion, nutrition or exercise routine. They only have one detail in common: they have relatives who have lived a long time and children (who) also tend to live a long time,"" Coles said. Cecilio Flores said his supercentenarian father had five children, 16 grandchildren and 39 great-grandchildren. ""I constantly congratulate my father,"" he said. ""He took care of me when I was little so I'm now taking care of him. Now it's my turn to make sure he's taken care of."" Cecilio is the only child of Flores still alive. No one in the Flores family doubts that the patriarch is 123 years old. There seems to be no doubt either when it comes to officials. In fact, the government of Bolivia plans to honor Flores by declaring him ""a living heritage"" of the Bolivian people.","Carmelo Flores Laura has two documents saying he is 123 years old .

"(CNN) -- A Cameroon appeals court has acquitted two men found guilty of homosexuality because they wore women's clothes and ordered a cream-based liqueur, according to rights groups.

""The acquittal of two Cameroonian men jailed for looking gay because they wore women's clothes exposes the systematic discrimination against perceived homosexuals in the country,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. The conviction was based on stereotypes because authorities never saw them engage in homosexual acts, according to their lawyer. ""The judge who originally sentenced them had stated that the way they dressed, the way they spoke, and the fact that they drank Bailey's Irish Cream proved they were gay,"" their lawyer, Alice N'Kom, told global gay rights group All Out, which launched a petition demanding the men's release. The court overturned the conviction Monday, but it was unclear whether they have left prison. Homosexuality is illegal in Cameroon, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. Sentences for homosexual acts vary between six months to five years. Rights groups applauded the ruling, but called on the nation to free others imprisoned under anti-gay laws. Last month, a Cameroon appeals court upheld a three-year sentence against a man convicted of homosexuality for texting his male friend to say, ""I'm very much in love with you."" The university student was arrested in 2011 after the man who received the message tipped off authorities. Authorities in the west African nation were not immediately available for comment. A series of countries have criminalized homosexuality, but prosecutions are rare. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life, but lawmakers are trying to introduce a bill that toughens the law.","The men were sentenced in November 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Has Gary Player found the secret to eternal life? The 78-year-old completes 1,300 sit ups every day, follows a strict and mainly vegetarian diet and sleeps on average nine hours per night. During a remarkable competitive career spanning six decades, Player won nine majors and 165 tournaments, adopting a grueling fitness and a practice regime to help underpin his game. ""The more I practice the luckier I get,"" was his most famous quote in reference to his unerring ability to hole shots from green side bunkers. Player's forays on to a golf course are now confined to exhibitions -- ""Jack Nicklaus and I were 10-under for a better ball three weeks ago,"" he says -- though he still regularly beats his age by several shots. ""I was 12-under par (18 holes in 66 shots) recently,"" added the South African, who turns 79 in November. The day before this interview he'd hit 100 practice shots, so it's hardly surprising Player is still able to average about 70 shots per round, which is the mark he achieved during his professional career on the PGA then Seniors Tour, one of the best of all time. Nowadays Player is driven by a different mission. ""I have a passion to save lives,"" he says, in reference to his desire to help confront the western world's growing obesity and type 2 diabetes problem. ""Thirteen percent of the world is now obese,"" Player told CNN ahead of the British Open, which starts on Thursday. ""We talk about wars, the number of people dying from diabetes and cancer and heart attacks -- in comparison to the numbers killed in wars are insignificant, but nobody cares about health or exercise. ""I don't know why only one out of 20,000 people taka exercise and has a proper diet. How can governments allow it? Golf's ""Black Knight"" -- a reference to his trademark all-black attire he wore on the fairways -- doesn't expect the world to emulate his own punishing fitness regime, but he does have some simple tips to stay healthy. ""My advice to fellow menfolk is every day to take you wife by the hand and go for a brisk 30 minutes walk, or get yourself a dog, they demand to be exercised! ""Secondly don't go for all these fad diets, just eat half the portion of food that you originally dished up. It will change your life."" The golf icon's foundation, run by his son Marc -- Player has six children and 22 grandchildren -- has raised over $50 million for underprivileged children in South Africa and around the globe. It aims to improve educational outcomes and Player is passionate that his message about health, fitness and diet reaches the younger audience globally. ""We are not teaching children in school, that's a great frustration for me."" Player with Nicklaus and legendary American Arnold Palmer revolutionized golf in the early 1960s and under sports management guru Mark McCormack earned the label of the ""Big Three"" as they dominated the majors and took the sport to a new television audience. Player had an unquenchable thirst for victory, racking up more air miles than any athlete in history as he competed in tournaments around the world. He is particularly proud of his nine 'senior' majors -- in competitions for golfers aged over 50 -- helping to raise the standard and profile of the events as he battled it out with the likes of Palmer and Nicklaus again. Don't dare tell Player that golf isn't a physically demanding sport. The South African recounts a story about basketball legend Michael Jordan, a low handicap golfer, telling him that 36 holes of golf in a day was pretty much as exhausting as playing in a match in the NBA Finals. A slight exaggeration perhaps, but judging by the number of nonagenarians who still inhabit the fairways the notion of Golf: ""A Game for Life"" -- the title of Player's latest instructional offering -- might not be too far amiss. In keeping with his reputation for supreme physical fitness there is a clip which shows him -- donned in black golf wear -- running at maximum speed on a treadmill -- to the astonishment of the accompanying interviewer. Watch: Player in incredible running demonstration . It's a breathless demonstration that men several decades younger would fail to emulate but does back up Player's central theme about a healthy life. ""I tell you, walk 18 holes, it's tremendous exercise and you can play golf for a lifetime,"" he said. On the evidence of Player's fitness -- a recent test showed he had a resting heart beat of 39 -- the South African will be gracing the fairways of golf courses for many years to come. But he clearly wants to leave a legacy stretching beyond his sporting fame. ""I said when I'm a champion I'm going to change people's lives. ""On my epitaph I want it to read: 'Here was a man who contributed to society and saved lives.'"" So for now he continues his punishing schedule of travel to meet burgeoning business commitments,such as golf course design, real estate, a winery and farm, as well as work for his foundation, which runs four high profile tournaments each year. ""Show me a busy man and I'll show you someone who gets things done."" That work ethic was engrained in him from an early age, with his mother dying when he was just eight and his father having to travel away to earn a living in gold mining. ""You must accept adversity with gratitude and never give up. You will overcome it,"" said Player.","Gary Player won nine majors and nine senior majors in stellar career .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi dismissed the government Tuesday and agreed to a 15% cut in fuel prices, in addition to other economic reforms, seeking to end weeks of tense protests led by tens of thousands of Houthi loyalists in the capital, Sanaa. Houthis, also known as ""Ansarullah,"" have rejected the initiative. Houthi representative Mohammed Abdul-Salam announced they will continue protesting in Sanaa and its outskirts since the government did not involve them in the initiative. ""We do not agree with the initiative announced by the government committee, and we will stand with the Yemeni people in their call for their rights,"" he said. Tens of thousands of Houthi supporters have been rallying for weeks to demand that a recently approved oil subsidy reform be revoked and that the government step down before they agree to lift their tents from Sanaa and the outskirts. The President's initiative also calls on the Houthis to withdraw fighters from Amran province and an immediate end of clashes in the northern Jawf province. Ali al-Bukaiti, A top Ansarullah leader, said that Houthi supporters, who follow the Zaidi sect of Islam, will not be tricked by the government's light reforms and that their demands are clear. On Monday, hours after Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi announced escalating the protests, Hadi sent Sanaa Mayor Abdul-Qadir Hilal to Saada province to give dialogue a final chance. Government committees that held talks with Houthi leaders over the previous two weeks didn't resolve the political tension. In a televised speech Sunday, al-Houthi said that his supporters would continue to protest and that at the right time, he would announce more stages of escalation. ""The final stage will be the hardest, and we will think of all ways to intensify our struggle and force the government to step down,"" he said. For years, Yemen has faced violent battles against Houthi rebels.","Houthi official says protests will continue, government did not involve Houthis in the initiative .

"(CNN) -- Germany's greatest golfer tried time and time again to conquer the U.S. Open, and failed. But where Bernhard Langer fell short, Martin Kaymer succeeded, becoming the first German to ever get his hands on the feted trophy. Kaymer has already made it to world number one, bagged his first major at the U.S. PGA Championship and sunk the winning putt in a Ryder Cup before he is 30. Langer did win the Masters twice in his illustrious career but now his successor has two of the four major titles in his back pocket after an emphatic win at Pinehurst. New heart, new hope for Compton . Kaymer laid the foundations for victory by recording the lowest score over two rounds in the tournament's history and duly kept his nearest challengers at arm's length to win by an incredible eight shots. Erik Compton, who had two heart transplants before joining the PGA Tour, finished in a tie for second with fellow American Rickie Fowler. ""We have almost a German grand slam -- only the British Open is missing,"" Kaymer said after finishing on nine under. ""To win the Masters is a huge thing and obviously that's why I need to adjust a few things in my swing in order to play better golf there. ""Winning the U.S. PGA and winning this one now I hope it will make Bernhard proud and all of Germany proud. ""Overall it was a very nice week, a very nice day. Credit to the fans because it was very fair to play. ""I didn't make many mistakes in the last two wins I had in America, especially this week. I played very solid the first two days and that gave me a very nice cushion for the weekend. ""I was very happy with the way I kept it together yesterday and that gave me a cushion for today."" Kaymer never looked like relinquishing the five-shot lead he held going into the final day and was one of only a clutch of players who posted under par rounds. Two birdies and two bogeys in the opening 10 holes consolidated his position before back-to-back birdies on 13 and 14 edged him further ahead. With a challenge from Fowler or Compton failing to materialize, the German could enjoy the closing holes knowing the title was his and he rolled in a par putt on the final green to seal the deal. It marks an incredible return to the top of the game for a man who drifted down to 63rd in the rankings after a slump in form. But after a stellar start to the season, Kaymer has become the first man to win both the Players Championship, regarded as the unofficial fifth major, and the U.S. Open in the same season. Compton meanwhile has had a very different journey to the top table in golf after undergoing two heart transplants . The 34-year-old was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at the age of nine, a condition that limits the heart's capacity to pump blood, and had his first transplant three years later. He had another just as his career was taking and has battled to secure a berth on the tour, his second place at Pinehurst his biggest achievement in the sport to date. ""It felt like a sacred place this week,"" Compton said on Sky Sports. ""I'm speechless, really. The support I got gave me goosebumps from tee to green. ""It's a real special moment. I've never got this far along in my story and it hasn't really sunken in yet. I'm just thrilled. ""I was playing for second, I think we all were playing for second. I hit the ball really well from tee to green. ""I didn't know I've got into the Masters so this is just a career-opening thing for me, for me to be able to put myself on the map and prove I'm not just a guy with two heart transplants.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calls it proof ""beyond any reasonable doubt."" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says it's ""very clear."" President Barack Obama says the United States has ""high confidence"" that Syria used chemical weapons -- the strongest position the U.S. can take short of confirmation. Britain, France, and Germany say their intelligence backs up the same conclusion. But despite all the talk about conclusive intelligence, questions remain. A declassified report by the White House does not divulge all details of the evidence the United States is looking at. And it remains unclear what the ""streams of intelligence"" cited in the report may be and how they were collected. Russia insists there's no proof. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to see evidence that would make the determination ""obvious."" And Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime says rebel forces were behind any chemical weapons attack. The United Nations, meanwhile, is calling on world leaders to wait for the results of a U.N. probe. Here's a look at what is known about the intelligence Washington points to. Kerry cites 'concrete' evidence . ""We have declassified unprecedented amounts of information, and we ask the American people and the rest of the world to judge that information,"" Kerry told lawmakers Tuesday. It ""proves the Assad regime prepared for this attack, issued instruction to prepare for this attack, warned its own forces to use gas masks."" Physical, ""concrete"" evidence shows where the rockets came from, when they were fired, and that not one landed in regime-controlled territory, Kerry said. ""Multiple streams of intelligence indicate that the regime executed a rocket and artillery attack against the Damascus suburbs in the early hours of August 21,"" the White House says in the declassified report. ""Satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred. ... The lack of flight activity or missile launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack."" The White House released a map along with the report. But the prospect of more details on the evidence seems dim as Kerry said the amount already declassified ""could possibly put at risk some sources and methods,"" and that releasing more could ""tempt fate."" U.S.: Opposition doesn't have 'the capacity' ""We are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale, particularly from the heart of regime territory,"" Kerry told lawmakers Tuesday. The White House report points to Syria's known stockpiles of chemical agents. And it says the United States assesses ""with high confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year, including in the Damascus suburbs. This assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of Syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin. ""We assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons."" In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicions that Syrian rebel forces had used sarin gas. But the findings were not conclusive, the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria said at the time, and the opposition Syrian Coalition condemned any use of chemical weapons. The U.S. State Department said at the time it had no evidence suggesting rebels had used chemical weapons. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday the results of an investigation into a March attack in Aleppo, apparently using chemical weapons, found that the charge used was homemade and similar to projectiles produced by the group Bashaar al-Nasr, part of the opposition Syrian Islamic Liberation Front. Sarin was discovered in samples from the scene, the foreign ministry said. Bashaar al-Nasr has slammed Syria for the recent chemical weapons attack in Damascus, and vowed revenge. U.S.: Syria prepared . ""In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack,"" the U.S. report says. ""Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of 'Adra from Sunday, August 18 until early in the morning on Wednesday, August 21 near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On August 21, a Syrian regime element prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the utilization of gas masks. Our intelligence sources in the Damascus area did not detect any indications in the days prior to the attack that opposition affiliates were planning to use chemical weapons."" 'Intercepted communications' ""We have a body of information, including past Syrian practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack on August 21,"" the U.S. report says. ""We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence."" Intelligence shows Syrian chemical weapons personnel were told to cease operations in the afternoon of August 21, and that the regime then ""intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical attacks occurred,"" the report says. Analyst: 'No way in hell' U.S. can back up death toll . The U.S. report says a preliminary assessment ""determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children."" The assessment ""will certainly evolve as we obtain more information,"" it adds. ""Secretary Kerry seems to have been sandbagged into using an absurdly over-precise number,"" said Anthony Cordesman, former director of intelligence assessment at the U.S. Defense Department. Now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he writes on the CSIS website, ""Put simply, there is no way in hell the U.S. intelligence community could credibly have made an estimate this exact."" It's unclear whether ""these figures really had an intelligence source,"" Cordesman said . ""Some sources indicate they may have actually come from a Syrian source called the Local Coordination Committees (LCC)"" -- a Syrian opposition group. A U.S. official told CNN the number is not based on opposition figures. The methodology used to come up with the toll remains classified. Rebel leaders have given similar estimates for the death toll, saying more than 1,300 people were killed. Britain's Joint Intelligence Organization, meanwhile, says at least 350 people were killed. It does not say how the figure was determined. A French government report notes that body counts by several sources, including Doctors Without Borders, estimated at least 355 deaths. ""Other technical counts, using different sources, estimate the toll to be around 1,500 deaths,"" the report says. Britain, France, Germany weigh in . A letter from Jon Day, chairman of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, to British Prime Minister David Cameron, also rejects suggestions that the opposition may have been behind the attack. ""We have tested this assertion using a wide range of intelligence and open sources, and invited (the government) and outside experts to help us establish whether such a thing is possible,"" Day wrote. No ""credible intelligence"" suggests the opposition has chemical weapons, he writes, adding that ""there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility."" ""We also have a limited but growing body of intelligence which supports the judgment that the regime was responsible for the attacks and that they were conducted to help clear the opposition from strategic parts of Damascus. Some of this intelligence is highly sensitive but you have had access to it all."" France gives a similar argument. ""The attack of August 21st could only have been ordered and carried out by the regime,"" its declassified intelligence report says. Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, has the same assessment. ""In a secret briefing to select lawmakers on Monday, BND head Gerhard Schindler said that while there is still no incontestable proof, analysis of the evidence at hand has led his intelligence service to believe that Assad's regime is to blame,"" Der Spiegel reports. U.N. probe: Limited scope, no clear deadline . The United Nations is pushing all nations to hold off on any action until results of its own examination are in. It's unclear how soon that may be. ""The U.N. mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons,"" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said repeatedly at a news conference Sunday. But the U.N. probe's mandate is only to determine whether chemical weapons were used -- not by whom. Obama argued Wednesday that that's no longer in question. ""Frankly, nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used,"" he said. Russia - which, along with China, would likely block any U.N. resolution authorizing military action in Syria -- has repeatedly thrown cold water on suggestions that there's proof of Syria culpability. ""If there are data that the chemical weapons have been used, and used specifically by the regular army, this evidence should be submitted to the U.N. Security Council,"" Putin said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press and Russia's state Channel 1 television. ""It should be a deep and specific probe containing evidence that would be obvious and prove beyond doubt who did it and what means were used."" If there was such evidence, Russia might support a resolution authorizing military strikes, Putin said. Syria: Allegations 'false and unfounded' Syria still insists it never used chemical weapons. ""These allegations are false and unfounded,"" Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar al-Ja'afari said Tuesday in an interview with CNN. He cited the confidence that the United States said it had a decade ago when it argued that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. It's an argument Kerry was prepared for before Congress on Tuesday. He noted that he and Hagel were senators at the time of the Iraq vote. ""And so we are especially sensitive, Chuck and I, to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence. And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and re-scrubbed the evidence.""","Kerry says the U.S. has declassified ""unprecedented amounts of information""

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy held his nerve to maintain the lead on day three of the PGA Championship at the Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky and will take a slender one shot cushion into Sunday's final round. The Northern Irishman, who is attempting to win his third straight tournament and second major of 2014, carded a round of 67 Saturday to leave him on 13-under-par for the week. Austria's Bernd Wiesberger is a shot back at 12-under-par followed by Rickie Fowler on 11-under. Phil Mickelson finished the day at 10-under-par alongside Jason Day while Louis Oosthuizen, Henrik Stenson, Ryan Palmer and Miko Ilonen are tied for fifth position at nine-under-par. ""I'm really happy with how I finished again,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports upon reaching the clubhouse. ""I finished really strongly which puts me in good position for tomorrow."" McIlroy won the British Open in July and reclaimed the world No. 1 spot last week when he picked up the WGC Bridgestone Invitational title. And his big-hitting game seemed made for the tender greens in Louisville that had been softened by early morning rain. But the day was not without its challenges and McIlroy had to dig deep to fend off the chasing field. The 25-year-old saved par on the fourth after teeing off into the hazard before carding birdies on holes five and seven. He bogeyed eight and then once again showed guile to par the ninth when he overshot the green. A birdie on ten was then followed by a bogey on 12 and another difficult par save on 13. At this stage Day, Fowler and Palmer had clawed McIlroy back to tie for the lead at 10-under-par. But the Rory McIlroy of the last month has been nothing if not resilient. He spoke Friday about how golf has become his life since splitting from fiance Caroline Wozniacki in May. And when the pressure was on here in Kentucky, he excelled. A birdie on 15 was followed by a miraculous approach shot on 16 that dropped two feet from the hole. Three birdies from Wiesberger on the final three holes, however, brought the Austrian level atop the leaderboard. But McIlroy added one last birdie of his own on 18 to secure the overnight lead. ""I knew there were guys ahead of me making birdies and it gives me a lot of confidence knowing that if I get challenged and people put the pressure on I am able to respond like I did today,"" McIlroy said. ""If I can keep playing well and staying mentally strong, there is another major to maybe come my way."" By comparison, Wiesberger will be aiming for his first ever major win when he heads out Sunday. The 28-year-old is ranked 70 in the world and had only ever made the cut once in five previous majors. ""I played beautifully today, I didn't miss a lot of shots, set up a few nice opportunities on the last few holes especially. I'm very proud of myself the way I played,"" Wiesberger said in quotes carried by UK news agency, the Press Association. ""It's a completely new situation for me, only my second cut in a major in six attempts, so I am quite a rookie in this particularly situation. I have driven it really nicely this week and if I can do it again it will settle down the nerves and I am going to have fun tomorrow."" Elsewhere on the course, former world No. 1 Adam Scott scored a fine 66 to leave him tied at seven-under par with Lee Westwood, Hunter Mahan, Kevin Chappell and Jim Furyk. Wales' Jamie Donaldson is a shot ahead at 8-under-par after scoring an impressive 66 alongside Graham DeLaet and Steve Stricker. At the other end of the leaderboard, Bubba Watson's frustrating form continued as he scored a disappointing round of 73 leaving him two-over-par for the tournament.","Rory McIlroy takes slim lead into final day of PGA Championship .

"New York (CNN) -- The two New York police officers shot to death earlier this month in Brooklyn are set to be immortalized in the streets of the city that they swore to protect. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito announced Wednesday that the city will move to name two streets in honor of the fallen officers, Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. A bill to rename a section each of two Brooklyn streets will be introduced and voted on by the New York City Council in January, according to a statement from the mayor. ""Our fallen heroes will never be forgotten. Their memory lives on in their families, and in the NYPD family. And now it will live on in the streets of the communities these brave men lived in and protected,"" de Blasio said. The blocks where the officers lived will bear their names -- a stretch of Ridgewood Avenue for Ramos and of West 6th Street for Liu, the statement said. The City Council members who represent the two detectives' districts, as well as the chair of the city's Parks and Recreation Committee, will sponsor the bill, the statement said. Liu and Ramos were shot in their patrol car in Brooklyn on December 20. The body of their killer, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, was found shortly afterward. He had shot himself.

"(CNN) -- With 17 Grammy awards, $75 million in world record sales and a fourth world tour underway, Beyonce is one of the world's biggest names in show business. From performances at this year's Superbowl to the presidential inauguration, few celebrities have the success, drive and international cachet of the high profile soulstress. But she doesn't just dominate the music charts and the stage ... Beyonce is a global brand and works hard to keep it that way. Her name appears everywhere from fashion labels to fragrance bottles and Pepsi commercials. On the heels of her own HBO documentary 'Life Is But A Dream', she and husband Jay-Z were also named the pop music industry's first billionaire couple. Watch: How Beyonce became businesswoman . Forbes also ranked Beyonce as the 32nd most powerful woman in the world last year, estimating her earnings at $40 million, a figure likely to grow as she reaps the rewards from her Mrs Carter Show World Tour and lucrative H&M campaign. Through a carefully-managed image, the 31-year-old star shows she can do it all by portraying herself as a sexy performer, an astute businesswoman, a dutiful wife and loving mother and a girl-next-door from Texas. ""Beyonce inspires others to dream because she is always reminding us that she was just a young girl from Houston, Texas, who had a dream to be a performer, and look at her now,"" says Cori Murray, entertainment editor of Essence Magazine. ""She had a dream, she envisioned it. Hard work, determination, and this is the result,"" sums up Gail Mitchell, senior editor at Billboard Magazine. Family ties . The daughter of a hairdresser and an IBM marketing executive, Beyonce took to the stage early. She began performing with a girl band -- later known as Destiny's Child - at the age of eight, managed by her father Matthew Knowles and his marketing expertise. It took some years before Destiny's Child made their major label breakthrough by signing with Columbia Records in 1999 with the album ""The Writing's On The Wall"" and two number one singles ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" and ""Say My Name."" Matthew Knowles left his job at IBM and remained Beyonce's manager into her solo career -- which began in 2003 with her album ""Dangerously In Love"" -- until 2011 when the pair parted ways. Watch: Beyonce's father says he's 'proud' ""It was hard for me to let her go -- it was hard for both of us to let each other go,"" her father later told The Sun newspaper. ""This was not a normal ending of a business agreement. This was a dad and a daughter and it was incredibly painful and it had some difficulties."" Aside from her music, she has mastered the art of celebrity endorsements over the years by striking lucrative deals with Pepsi and L'Oreal and launching fragrances with Tommy Hilfiger. Savvy sponsorship deals . Sealing a $50 million multi-year deal with Pepsi in December, the partnership includes commercials and print ads as well as a fund to support the singer's chosen creative projects. Far from featuring old tunes as many ads do, Beyonce's latest Pepsi commercial previews a new song ""Grown Woman,"" which will feature on her forthcoming album. ""Beyonce's influence in pop culture [is] not just in the music industry, but also in the beauty industry and in fashion,"" says fashion stylist June Ambrose. ""She has become the poster child in terms of her brand being so well recognized."" The singer and her mother Tina Knowles run a fashion label House of Dereon, named after the star's seamstress grandmother. She stays involved at every stage of her campaigns, giving her control over her own brand. ""This is not a woman who just lends her name to it and then she is off to her yacht,"" says Murray of Essence Magazine. The control extends to her own image. In her current world tour, she refused to accredit press photographers and banned all but authorized pictures from her own entertainment company, according to several media reports. Career evolution . Beyonce is executive producer of her own HBO documentary ""Life Is But A Dream"" in which she tells her story through her own eyes. The film is filled with home movie clips from her childhood in Houston to her show preparations and her life with Jay-Z and 15-month-old daughter Blue Ivy. From starring in her own documentary to films such as ""Dreamgirls,"" ""Cadillac Records"" and ""The Fighting Temptations,"" the songstress has kept her name in lights by contributing to movie soundtracks, most recently film director Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby."" Luhrmann wrote in Time Magazine as it named Beyonce among the world's 100 most influential people in 2013: ""She and Jay Z are the royal couple of culture, and she is the queen bee. Power networking . ""She's gone beyond being a popular singer, even beyond being a pop-cultural icon ... Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA, the reigning national voice."" From granting Oprah an exclusive OWN interview to supporting President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, Beyonce's proven her influence extends well beyond her voice by making friends in high places. In return, Obama called the singer ""a role model for his daughters"" at an election fundraiser hosted by the power couple and she performed the national anthem at his second inauguration. While stellar performances and lucrative endorsement deals far from guarantee a star's long term future in the fickle world of entertainment, one thing is for certain --Beyonce has proven she is a survivor.","Beyonce has built a global brand around being one of the biggest names in pop .

"Washington (CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-affiliated militant group in Somalia, has recruited more than 40 Muslim-Americans and 20 Canadians, U.S. Rep. Peter King said Wednesday as he opened a third congressional hearing on Muslim-American radicalization. Wednesday's hearing of the Committee on Homeland Security will focus on al-Shabaab and the results of a committee investigation into the threat it poses to the United States, said King, a New York Republican, according to a transcript of his opening statement. ""The committee has been briefed by intelligence agencies and we have interviewed dozens of experts on al-Shabaab,"" the transcript said. The committee has learned that more than 40 Muslim-Americans and 20 Canadians have joined al-Shabaab inside Somalia, a finding King called ""alarming."" The committee has learned at least 15 of the Americans and three Canadians ""are believed to have been killed fighting with al-Shabaab, according to King's transcript. ""Three Muslim-Americans became suicide bombers, such as Shirwa Ahmed from Minneapolis -- the first confirmed American suicide bomber in our history,"" the transcript said. Ahmed, 27, killed himself and 29 others in the fall of 2008. But, King also mentioned ""radicalized converts like al-Shabaab commander Omar Hammami, who was raised a Baptist in Alabama, and who has repeatedly threatened the U.S. homeland."" Hammami was one of 14 Americans indicted on terrorism charges last summer. Another ""would-be bomber from Minneapolis"" was shot and killed by peacekeepers in Mogadishu before he could detonate his suicide explosives vest, according to King's transcript. Three American al-Shabaab fighters were arrested after returning home, he said, and a fourth was apprehended in the Netherlands. Somalia, he noted, ""is now much easier to get to for jihad than Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan or Yemen."" ""As many as two dozen Muslim-Americans with al-Shabaab -- who in many cases were trained by top al Qaeda leaders -- remain unaccounted for,"" King's transcript said. Federal prosecutions for funding, recruiting and attempting to join the Somali militant group ""are the largest number and most significant upward trend in homegrown terror cases filed by the Justice Department over the past two years,"" King's transcript said. At least 38 cases in 10 states have been unsealed since 2009. The Justice Department believes al-Shabaab is recruiting inside mosques in Somali-American communities in cities such as Minneapolis and San Diego, according to King. Somali-Americans travel frequently between east Africa and U.S. cities, he said. While most of the travel is legitimate, ""senior U.S. counterterror officials have told the committee they are very concerned about individuals they have not identified who have fallen in with al-Shabaab during trips to Somalia, who could return to the U.S. undetected."" ""With a large group of Muslim-Americans willing to die as 'martyrs' and a strong operational partnership with al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and in Yemen, al-Shabaab now has more capability than ever to strike the U.S. homeland,"" according to King. King's first hearing on American Muslims, in March, sparked international controversy and garnered intense media scrutiny. A second hearing in June focused on the threat of Muslim-American radicalization in U.S. prisons.","Rep. Peter King: The Somali militant group is recruiting Americans and Canadians .

"(CNN) -- On September 30, a group of Jewish Israelis from the activist groups Solidarity and Ta'ayush set out on a visit to support the Palestinian al Rifai family in the West Bank. The family's claim to their land has been recognized by the Israeli Supreme Court, but the settlement of Anatot is nevertheless built upon it. Al Rifai family members have faced harassment for years while insisting on their right to access private land. The settlers of Anatot, enraged by the Israeli support of the Palestinian family, violently attacked the family and activists alike. It is all too common that Jewish settlements in the West Bank are built on stolen Palestinian land, and all too common that Palestinian farmers are prevented from cultivating and collecting their rightful harvest anywhere near these settlements. In 2007, in a report based on the government's own statistics, the Israeli group Peace Now showed that the majority of settlements are wholly or partially constructed on private Palestinian land. Regardless of what kind of land they are built upon, settlements are illegal under international law and contrary to U.S. policy. While Palestinians have long faced violence from both settlers and soldiers, now Jewish Israelis who choose to stand up for the basic human rights of Palestinians, can no longer expect protection from their own government. In Israel they are calling what happened a pogrom. What other name is there for state-condoned mob violence directed at a group of people simply because of their beliefs? Until recently, Jewish Israelis willing to take the risk of solidarity visits to West Bank Palestinians have been able to use the privilege they have as Jews to minimize violence against Palestinians. When Jewish Israeli activists put their bodies between Palestinians and violence, both soldiers and settlers have held back. Thus perhaps a field can be plowed or olive tree picked if Jewish activists accompany Palestinian farmers as in Anatot. Palestinians live with the violence and repression of the Occupation every day, while the Israelis only visit it and then return home. Yet the fact that these Israelis choose to place themselves in harm's way for the sake of justice is nothing short of inspiring. The violence in the video of the attack is shockingâ€”knives, rocks, blindside punches, screams of ""Death to Arabs"" and ""Death to Leftists."" Most horrifying of all were the policemen who stood watching without interfering. No arrests were made, and not a single policeman took action as a group of about 50 activists was attacked by a mob of approximately 200 settlers. It shouldn't be surprising that Israeli soldiers and police choose not to protect some Israelis. The status of Israeli citizens who defy discriminatory government policies regarding Palestinian rights is steadily eroding. In July, the Knesset passed a law making it a punishable offense to advocate for boycotting settlement products. This non-violent tactic used worldwide in social justice struggles, a basic tenet of democracy and free speech, is now off-limits for Israelis. In August, in a frenzy of unfounded fear of widespread Palestinian violence following a U.N. proposal on Palestinian statehood, Israel announced a new policy of arming and training settlers. The settlers have long been armed and dangerous, but this gave them the legitimacy to act with impunity. Finally, in September, President Obama's speech to the U.N. so lopsidedly supported Israel that Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman, a man even Marty Peretz called a ""neo-fascist,"" said that he would ""sign onto this speech with both hands."" President Obama spoke not a word about occupation or settlements or the suffering of Palestinians. Is it any wonder that the settlers in Anatot felt nothing should hold them back? The message, from all sides, is that Palestinians on their own land, and now the Israelis who dare to support them, are a dangerous enemy. At the end of the video a woman off-camera says shakily in Hebrew, ""This is really dangerous. I am afraid."" To put your body in harm's way for the sake of a righteous cause is both a hallmark of civil rights struggles and a remarkable personal act of will to transcend fear and discomfort. The pogrom occurred on the second day of Rosh Hashana, which also marks the beginning, in the Jewish tradition, of the Yomim Noraim, the days of reflection and repentance that culminate in Yom Kippur 10 days later. Especially for those of us who were raised with an intimate connection to an image of Israel as a safe haven and a beacon of light for all the world, it takes another kind of courage to face what it has become. As Americans, our government defends Israel in the economic, diplomatic and military realms, regardless of its actions. For those of us who are Jewish, Israel claims to act in our name. If the Israeli activists are brave enough to face physical harm, if Palestinian farmers risk attack just because they try to work their own lands -- aren't we obligated to face our own discomfort and speak up to end the American policies which make this disgrace possible?","Rebecca Vilkomerson says Palestinians are often the victims of attacks from Israeli settlers .

"(CNN) -- The pronouncement by the Roman Catholic Church at its extraordinary synod that ""homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community"" has left many pondering if this is a turning point for the LGBTI debate. I suggest that this is not a turning point particularly for the African Catholic community, but rather the start of an openness in debate that will take a long time to change the Church's doctrinal teaching. In a deeply conservative Church that has for a long time viewed homosexuality as ""an intrinsically disordered, contrary to natural law and cannot be approved under any circumstances,"" it will take more than a Synod statement to arrive at a turning point on the subject of homosexuality. A change in the doctrinal teaching/catechism of the church will take a long time and protracted debate in the Catholic community. Pope Francis' papacy has been heavy on symbolism and rhetoric on previously sidelined (and contentious) social justice issues but the jury is still out over whether he will take concrete steps to change the position of the Church on these issues. In July this year during a flight back to Rome from Rio de Janeiro after World Youth Day celebrations, Pope Francis responded to questions about the Vatican's alleged gay lobby, by saying: ""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?"" signaling an embrace of homosexuality into the Catholic commune. But these pronouncement certainly do not bring the concrete steps to require a shift in position. There are reasons that explain why the excitement about the apparent change of tone must be tempered. Firstly, the document is only but a preliminary, not final report. It is a summary of closed door debate between the Pope and the prelates. The document is a working document. It is not a papal decree or a doctrinal position. It is only indicative of the issues that were discussed in the closed door meeting. That the Synod have been open about their internal debate is admirable and must be lauded. But it will require much more than pronouncements to qualify as a critical departure from the Church's position on homosexuality. In its conclusion, the 12-page document notes that the reflections ""are intended to raise questions and indicate perspectives that will have to be matured and made clearer by the reflection of the local Churches."" Opinions of local churches that are to reflect on this matter are still in sharp contrast with those being expressed in the Vatican especially in Africa. It will also be a tall order to change the hearts and minds of the vast majority of African Catholics. In Uganda for instance, the Catholic Archbishop Kizito Lwanga is one of the leading proponents of the re-tabling of the country's expunged anti-homosexuality act, a controversial law that criminalized homosexuality provided for life imprisonment for same sex relations. It is unclear if such leaders will warm up to the changed tone from the Pope and the Vatican. If recent debates among Christians on the African continent is anything to go by, the turning point will be much more difficult to reach. The pronouncement sets the parameters for reflection in the form of questions. These questions challenge the church to reflect on whether it can guarantee homosexuals a fraternal space while re-echoing the long-held catechism on the subject. The world is desperate for new grounds to be broken. The optimism is therefore understandable but we all must receive the pronouncements with caution. Lessons must be taken from the fall-out in the Anglican Church between the global North and South arising from the ordination of openly gay bishops. It will not helpful if this debate only drives further apart rather than unites the Church. This will require patience, and a balancing of the diversities within the Church. The document, while sounding embracing of persons of different sexualities and children living in such relations, really restates the long-held position of the Church in many respects about homosexuality. So it is important not to get ahead of ourselves about this minimal but important tone. The drive to push the Church must be not only tolerant and accepting of sexual minorities but an ongoing effort. We must edge the Church along and ensure the momentum is not lost.

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, is dead, police say, because of a prank that went horribly and tragically wrong. Adrian Broadway was shot in the head and died early Saturday morning. She was with a group of teenagers who had gone to a house to do a ""retaliation"" prank on another teen who'd done a prank on them on Halloween, according to the Little Rock Police Department. The teenagers told police they had thrown toilet paper, eggs and mayonnaise on a car parked there. As they were leaving, a man came out of the house and opened fire. Broadway was struck in the head and died. Another teenager, the driver, suffered injuries to his right arm. He was transported to a hospital, where he was treated and released. ""When those kids left to go out and do this, they -- by no means -- did any one of them think that this was going to be a horrible event,"" Lt. Sidney Allen told CNN affiliate KARK. ""They didn't think that it would end up being a deadly prank."" Police have identified the shooting suspect as 48-year-old Willie Noble. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder, one count of a terroristic act and five counts of aggravated assault. Noble appeared Saturday morning in Little Rock Criminal Court, where bond was set at $1 million. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said Noble may have a viable defense. ""While Arkansas doesn't have a traditional stand-your-ground law,"" she said, ""I've learned that they have sort of an expanded castle doctrine law, which means -- not only can you defend yourself and your property inside your home, you can also do it around the perimeter of your home."" Hostin added: ""That's why this kind of thing just infuriates me ... It's about, sort of, not only stand your ground, but guns, and the protection of those to just use them stupidly."" Broadway's friend, Laguyia Bland, told KARK that she dropped the phone and started crying as soon as she heard the news. ""They was trying to be teenagers,"" Bland said. ""As you know, teenagers make mistakes, and this was one of those mistakes.""","NEW: 48-year-old shooting suspect may have viable defense, analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Indonesian authorities found 198 refugees from Myanmar early Tuesday off the country's west coast who said they had been drifting in a wooden boat for three weeks after they'd been towed out to sea by the Thai military. This picture provided to CNN is said to be the Thai army towing refugees out to sea. A survivor told Indonesian immigration officials that his boat was part of a group of boats carrying about 1,200 people who were set adrift by Thai military forces who had found them. The survivor also said 220 people had been on his boat, but 22 died, said Iwan Riyanto, an Indonesian immigration official. An official with the Sabang Region Navy also told CNN that the survivors on the boat said they had been set adrift by the Thai military. ""They were part of the nine boats containing Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and Bangladesh that were set adrift by the Thai security forces,"" Riyanto said. A Thai foreign ministry spokesman told CNN Tuesday that his government was aware of the report coming out of Indonesia. "" ""We have to listen to that but we need to verify, and there shall be no judgment made yet,"" Tharit Charungwat said. Meanwhile, delegates from five countries -- Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar -- went to Thailand's Ranong province Tuesday, prompted by such allegations.  Watch a report on more refugees washed ashore in Indonesia » . Allegations arose a month ago that a group of Myanmar's Rohingya minority -- who have been fleeing their homeland for years, saying they are persecuted by its military government -- had been dumped at sea by Thai military authorities. A recent CNN investigation found evidence of such activity. Photos obtained by CNN include one that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of about 190 refugees. CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few who had survived after a group of six rickety boats was towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities earlier this month. The Thai government has launched an inquiry. The Thai army has denied the allegations. But after extensive questioning by CNN, one source in the Thai military confirmed that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. The source defended it, saying that each boatload of refugees was given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source said Thai villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and they had accused the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. The Thai government has said that ""there is no reasonable ground to believe"" that the Rohingya were fleeing Myanmar because of persecution. ""Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants, and not those requiring international protection,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued in late January. One of the refugees who came ashore in late January said they would be killed if returned to Myanmar because of their minority status. He said the Rohingya are stateless because they lack bribe money to obtain identification cards in Myanmar. The discovery comes nearly a week after a judge in Thailand fined dozens of other Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty to charges of illegal entry after fleeing their homeland in December. CNN's Andy Saputra and Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Boat people say they were part of group of nine boats of 1,200 people .

"New York (CNN) -- The unidentified remains of those killed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were returned to New York's World Trade Center site Saturday in a quiet motorcade through the streets of lower Manhattan. Under an overcast sky, the remains moved slowly from the medical examiner's office several miles away in a solemn procession that included police and fire department vehicles with lights flashing. A handful of passers-by paused along the way to take notice. There were no dignitaries or speeches as the remains were delivered to their final resting place in an underground repository in the same building as the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. ""They are finally home,"" said Monica Iken, whose husband, Michael Patrick, perished when the towers collapsed. ""We should be thanking God they are home in the right place. This is where they died. This is where they took their last step, their last breath."" As she spoke, a group of protesters who favor placing the remains in a monument separate from the museum interrupted Iken in a sign of the longstanding dispute over what to do with the unidentified remains of victims of the worst terrorist attack in the nation's history. ""How dare you say that the remains ... belong in a museum?"" said one protester. ""How dare you. Shame on you!"" ""You're disrespecting the loved ones,"" Monica Iken said. Opponents of the move have said that a museum vulnerable to flooding and which charges $24 admission is not an adequate resting place for the victims. ""The issue here is that the remains we're talking about -- some 8,500 we believe -- are unidentified,"" said Norman Siegel, an attorney representing those opposed to the move. ""I hate to be crass. But who owns them? And who has the say in what happens to the unidentified remains?"" In 2011, 17 families of 9/11 victims petitioned a court to force the museum to consult with the families before deciding what to do with the remains. They also asked for a congressional hearing. Both efforts were unsuccessful. The remains will be stored behind a museum wall inscribed with a quote from the Roman poet Virgil: ""No day shall erase you from the memory of time."" The medical examiner's office has custody of 7,930 unidentified remains, which account for 36% of the 21,906 remains recovered, according to the office's most recent statistics. The medical examiner will continue to work to identify the remains. Families of the victims will be able to visit the repository's Reflection Room in the days before the museum's official opening on May 21. After that, they can schedule appointments to visit the private room. ""Finally our loved ones are home,"" Iken said. ""They are ... in the best place.""

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik, who admits killing 77 people in Norway last summer, has been asked to stop raising his fist in salute each morning at his trial, his lawyer said Wednesday. ""We will just have to hope that he respects that wish tomorrow. Either he will or he won't. There's nothing that we can order him to do,"" said the lawyer, Geir Lippestad. Lawyers for the victims of the massacre made the request, he said. Breivik, who boasts of being an ultra-nationalist who killed his victims to fight multi-culturalism in Norway, was in good spirits on the third day of his trial Wednesday, Lippestad said. ""I would say he's always in a good mood,"" Lippestad told reporters after the day's legal proceedings. Breivik was questioned in court about having met other ultra-nationalists in Liberia and London up to nine years before his rampage, and was somewhat evasive, reporters who attended the trial said. Prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh said there was evidence to prove he had visited both places. Breivik boasted Tuesday that he had carried out ""the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II"" when he carried out his gun-and-bomb rampage. And he would do it again if he had the chance, ""because offenses against my people and my fellow partisans are in many ways as bad,"" Breivik told the court on the second day of his trial. He planned his killings as a suicide attack, he said. ""I didn't expect to survive that day,"" he said. Breivik faces trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 attacks. Eight people died in a bombing in central Oslo, then 69 people were systematically gunned down at a youth camp on nearby Utoya Island. Breivik testified Tuesday and Wednesday after declaring Monday that he had carried out the massacre but was not guilty because the killings had been necessary. He was allowed to read a prepared statement in court Tuesday, taking considerably longer than the 30 minutes he was allotted. He rejected what he said would be prosecution efforts to portray him as a ""pathetic and mean loser"" and an ""antisocial psychopath."" He said he represented a ""European resistance movement"" and ""Europeans who don't want our ethnic rights to be taken away."" Lippestad said Breivik's statement was ""hard to hear, and it is difficult to understand."" But he said it was important to the trial, since his client wants people to see him as sane. ""It is probably because of his ideology and his thoughts about why he has done what he has done,"" Lippestad said. ""He thinks that it won't have any effect if he is considered insane."" Breivik's trial is expected to last up to 10 weeks. A court translator initially said Breivik was claiming self-defense as the justification, but court officials corrected that Tuesday, saying the correct legal term was ""necessity."" Experts have given different opinions about Breivik's sanity, which will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. Norway does not have the death penalty. Under examination by prosecutors, he claimed to be linked to two other individuals in Norway who are associated with the so-called Knights Templar ultranationalist movement. He said ""militant nationalists"" had drawn tactical inspiration from Osama bin Laden's terror network. ""We've taken a bit from al Qaeda and militant Islamists, including the glorification of martyrdom"" and organization into one-man cells, Breivik said. He denied that what he called the ""militant nationalist"" movement was evil. ""We don't act to be evil. We're trying to save our nations, our ethnic group and our culture,"" he said. His testimony is not being broadcast due to a court ruling. Most of the relatives of the victims did not want Breivik's remarks televised, and presiding Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen rejected Breivik's claim that airing it was a human right. Court papers indicated the five judges hearing the case did not want the trial to become a platform for Breivik to air his political views, or for them to distract from the legal issues involved. Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians. In a 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him, Breivik railed against Muslim immigration and European liberalism -- including the ruling Labour Party, which he said was allowing the ""Islamification of Europe.""

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Chicago man who just co-authored a book on how to run with the bulls in Pamplona was gored in the right thigh on Wednesday and underwent surgery in hospital, two friends with him in Pamplona told CNN. Bill Hillmann, 32, was gored by a bull that got separated from the other five bulls -- toward the end of the 850 meter, or half-mile, course -- just before the downhill slope leading into the bull ring. "" 'It's been a hell of a sh**ty fiesta so far,' "" Hillmann said at the hospital, according to his friend Alexander Fiske-Harrison, who edited their new e-book entitled ""Fiesta, How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona."" Other contributors to the book include John Hemingway, grandson of Ernest Hemingway, who brought global fame to the ancient tradition through his 1920s novel, ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title, ""Fiesta."" Hillmann has been running in Pamplona for about a decade, and in the book on surviving the running, he wrote a key chapter offering detailed advice for novices and experts alike on how to properly run with the bulls. It includes this description: ""There's more to the ancient tradition than just surviving it. At its most pure, this is daring street-art, a dance with death and majesty, a chance to come into harmonious contact with one of nature's fiercest monsters."" Hillmann continued in the book: ""At its worst, it's a bunch of panicked tourists falling all over each other in an idiotic stampede."" And Hillmann himself said he was tripped up in the confusion on Wednesday. ""I think today was a situation where somebody pushed me and I fell over and I got gored,"" he said from the hospital in a Skype interview with CNN's Jeanne Moos. Photographs from the scene show Hillmann on the pavement, on his back, when the bull's horn goes into his leg. ""I didn't feel it at all. When he lifted me, that's when I realized I was gored,"" Hillmann told CNN. ""Sadly, you know, it's just part of the run. All the great runners have been gored."" Fiske-Harrison said he was running on Wednesday near Hillmann and that the latter was trying to guide the loose bull -- which experts consider to be very dangerous -- toward the bull ring, when he got gored. The hospital medical report said Hillmann received two gorings, but Fiske-Harrison said there appeared to be only one main one, which he described as a ""clean wound. It didn't touch a bone or an artery. This is an honorable wound."" He estimated it to be about a 15 to 20 centimeter gash. Hillmann's wife went to hospital to see him and Fiske-Harrison said she was not pleased. Hillmann, who was in Spain to promote his new novel, ""The Old Neighborhood,"" about Chicago, had just days ago suffered the loss of his passport and laptop, Fiske-Harrison said. Hillmann mentioned it on his Facebook page. Hillmann remained alert at hospital, although he was sedated, and is expected to spend about four days there before he is released, Fiske-Harrison said. The six half-ton bulls from Victoriano del Rio ranch, including the one that gored Hillmann, were due to die in the bullfights on Wednesday afternoon, near where he was injured on the third day of the annual eight days of running, held at 8 a.m. local time, from July 7 to 14. On the first four days of running this year, 20 people have been taken to hospital, five for goring-related injuries, and the rest having been hurt in falls or collisions. There have been 15 deaths among runners since records began in 1924, most recently in 2009 when a 27-year-old Spanish man was fatally gored in the neck.

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- More death and violence were reported in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, as some investigators stood ready but were unable to go to the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, downed more than a week ago. At least 13 people, including two children, were killed in fighting on Sunday between pro-Russian rebels and Ukraine government forces in and near the Ukrainian city of Horlivka, according to the Donetsk Regional Authority, citing preliminary information from the local health care department. Ukraine separatists are using Grad rockets on residential areas of Horlivka, according to Ukraine's Counter-Terrorist Operations Press Center in a statement. Ukraine's military does not use artillery fire inside city centers to avoid civilian casualties, the statement said. Horlivka is surrounded by government forces. Pro-Russian militant commander OE Khasanov responded to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh's questions about the attacks in Horlivka by saying that the separatists are defending the city. At least 332 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and nearly 1,300 have been injured since April 7, according to Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council and law enforcement agencies. There is no known figure for the number of separatists killed. Crash site remains 'still under control of terrorists' Sunday's bloodshed comes more than a week after the Malaysia Airlines Flight went down July 17 in eastern Ukraine. All 298 on board were killed. Though some investigators from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe have been at the scene, Malaysian investigators haven't been able to access the entire crash site, officials said Sunday. Malaysia has struck an agreement with pro-Russian separatists in the area to allow international police to protect investigators, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Sunday, through a statement from his office. But he said he is ""deeply concerned"" those investigators still are not on scene due to the ""volatile security situation."" He implored that ""the human remains are removed from the site, identified and repatriated. ""Everyone who was on board MH17 must be afforded proper dignity and respect,"" he said. Forty-three of the people on MH17 were Malaysian, including two infants and 15 crew members. The crash site remained Sunday ""still under control of terrorists,"" Andriy Lysenko, the spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council told reporters. The OSCE deputy mission head, Alexander Hug, told reporters that the team stopped on the road to the crash site because they heard and saw the impact of artillery. He said it was unclear who was firing. The OSCE has been in contact with the separatists and the government to take another try at reaching the site Monday, he said. Hug said rebels have offered a train to transport bodies that the investigators find at the scene. Dutch investigators -- among them a team of 30 forensic experts -- are remaining for the moment in the city of Donetsk, which is about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Hrabove. Some 40 Dutch police officers are also positioned in Donetsk for now. About two-thirds of the people who died in the plane crash, 193 of the 298, were from the Netherlands. Russian team ready to join probe . Russia announced it had formed a team to join the investigation, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. It will be led by the deputy head of the Federal Air Transport Agency, Oleg Storchevoy. Russia has continued to increase its military presence near its border with Ukraine, the National Defense and Security Council press office said earlier Sunday. It said two convoys were spotted moving toward a Russian town near southeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are trying to encircle militants in Horlivka and cut off their communication with Donetsk, the press office said, hours before news emerged Sunday of victims killed in fighting. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to stop the flow of heavy weapons and rocket and artillery fire from Russia into Ukraine and to start de-escalating the conflict, a senior State Department official told CNN on Sunday. Kerry did not accept Lavrov's denial that heavy weapons from Russia were contributing to the conflict, the official said. On Sunday, the U.S. State Department released satellite images from the office of the Director of National Intelligence that it said show Russians firing into Ukraine. Senior White House adviser Ben Rhodes, in an interview with CNN, said that the images confirm ""what we have been saying publicly for several days."" ""We are putting out evidence to confirm the points that not only has Russia been providing the weapons across the border, including heavy weapons,"" said Rhodes, ""but they have also now been firing artillery barrages across the border."" The separatists are ""Russian proxies,"" he said. On July 16, the United States imposed its harshest sanctions yet on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, and what the Obama administration said was Russia's failure to end the Ukraine conflict. Obama expanded sanctions on two banks, Gazprom Bank and VEB; and two energy companies, Novotek and Rosneft. The institutions will not be able to get important financing in the United States. The administration banned American business contacts for eight Russian arms companies that make weapons, including small arms, mortars and surface-to-air missiles, including the Kalashnikov Concern, maker of the AK-47 and other weapons. Those sanctions have ""driven down forecast of Russia's growth rate to near zero,"" Rhodes said Sunday. But the measures have ""not been enough to change"" Putin's ""calculus"" about ""weapons going across the border."" ""That is why we've said to Europe and our allies that we need to impose additional costs,"" Rhodes told CNN. Earlier this year, Europe, which imports nearly 30% of its energy from Russia, joined the United States in imposing limited sanctions.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban sought to silence the teenage education activist Malala Yousufzai by shooting her in the head. They're also trying to stifle the widespread criticism of the attack in the news media by threatening journalists in Pakistan. The militant group's menacing statements have intensified fears among reporters in a country that is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist. The attack on Malala, 14, in the northwestern district of Swat last week has left her battling to recover from her injuries in a hospital in Britain and generated a wave of shock and anger in Pakistan and around the world. Girl shot alongside Malala haunted by the attack . The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the act, but they didn't appear to have anticipated the level of revulsion and condemnation that it would provoke. Thousands of people joined in rallies across Pakistan in support of the wounded teen, and calls grew for a strong response from the government. As coverage of the shooting -- and the appalled reaction to it -- swept across the Pakistani and international news media, the Taliban began issuing lengthy statements trying to justify the targeting of Malala, who had defied them by insisting on the right of girls to go to school. They also complained that ""this filthy, godless media has taken huge advantage of this situation, and journalists have started passing judgment on us,"" raising the prospect of killing those journalists. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? Reporters in northwestern Pakistan, the region where the Taliban are active, say they have been alerted by authorities of an increased risk to their security and some of them have received warnings that they are being specifically targeted. ""Things after Malala have become more tense, as the Taliban is very angry with the way the attack was reported,"" said a veteran journalist in Peshawar, the main city in the restive northwestern region near the border with Afghanistan. ""We are scared, but what can we do? We have to work."" The journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals, noted that factions of the Taliban had killed and abducted other journalists in the past because they were unhappy with their coverage. Tanvir Ahmed Tahir, the executive director of the All Pakistan Newspapers Society, a trade body of publishers, said the organization had requested extra security from the government to protect its members' operations and staff in light of the Taliban statements. The militants' threats against journalists for covering an attack for which they had unabashedly claimed responsibility may seem contradictory. But it goes to the heart of the Taliban's approach, according to Mustafa Qadri, Pakistan researcher for the human rights group Amnesty International. Attack on Pakistani schoolgirl galvanises anti-Taliban feeling . ""The underlying thing to understand is the Taliban only have one modus operandi: violence,"" said Qadri, who is based in Britain but travels to Pakistan regularly. ""They use it to intimidate people and coerce them into doing what they want."" He said that some of the local journalists he had spoken to in northwestern Pakistan -- including in Mingora, the main town in the Swat Valley where Malala's family lives -- were ""very shaken"" by the Taliban threats and had asked him to pray for them. ""These people have families and children,"" he said. ""Part of their job is going out into the field -- they don't have luxury of leaving the country"" like foreign journalists. Despite the risks, the Malala story is still ""actively being taken up by the press"" and journalists are ""doing their duty,"" Tahir of the newspaper society said. That role is all the more significant in a part of the world caught amid various geopolitical riptides. The volatile area southwest of Peshawar, along the porous border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, is a base for extremist groups, the focus of the controversial U.S. drone strike program and the scene of clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. Malala: A global symbol but still just a kid . Much of it has become a no-go area for reporters, especially those from Western news organizations, but some local journalists still venture into risky areas. ""If we don't have these people doing this job, we won't know what's happening,"" said Qadri. ""When conflicts are fought away from the media lens, that increases the scope for abuses."" The dangers that journalists already face in Pakistan are well documented. More journalists were killed there than in any other country in both 2010 and 2011, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a group based in New York that promotes press freedom around the world. ""Many of those who died in targeted killings had first been warned to be silent,"" the group said in a blog post on its website. Threats can come not just from militants, but also from government agencies, the CPJ said. ""It's really tough being a journalist in Pakistan, especially on the front line where they are under constant pressure from the Taliban, the state and even political parties,"" said Qadri, who worked as a reporter in the country for four years. ""It's a very politicized environment."" Pakistani teen inspires others to fight for education .","""We are scared, but what can we do?"" a Pakistani reporter says .

"Pamplona, Spain (CNN) -- I don't think that anyone can prepare you for Pamplona. From the moment of the Chupinazo at twelve noon on the 6th of July to the closing ceremonies at midnight on the 14th there is no other celebration like it in the world. Certainly many have tried to describe what goes on during the Fiesta, including of course my grandfather Ernest Hemingway in his novel ""The Sun Also Rises,"" but if you really want an idea of what it's all about then you've got to go there and see it for yourself. Which, of course, is exactly what Ernest Hemingway did in 1923. He had first heard about it from Gertrude Stein, one of his literary mentors and a woman who had piqued his curiosity with her tales of the Carthaginian origins of bullfighting. Nothing was ever as it seemed, she told her star student and the Corrida, or bullfight, represented for some the wedding gift of the groom to the bride, wherein the bull symbolically was the man and the torero the woman. Their fight was a ballet, she explained, and only when the bullfighter went over the animal's horns and placed his sword perfectly into the morrillo (the large muscle on the back of the bull's neck), pushing it down into the heart and killing it instantly, was there a union between the two and a consummation of their love. She knew my grandfather well and probably thought, where else in Europe could a war veteran go and expect to find the same danger and exhilaration that comes from living on the edge, the same camaraderie and apparent contradictions that Ernest had seen on the Austrian front in Italy in 1918? Only in Spain -- and specifically in Pamplona, where the townspeople gave any man the opportunity to risk his life every morning running in front of a herd of six Toro Bravos -- would my grandfather find what he truly needed. He came to the Fiesta a total of nine times, most of them in the 1920s and the last two in 1953, a year before he won the Nobel Prize and in 1959, two years before he died. Now while I'd advise anyone to read my grandfather's works to have a more intimate idea of the kind of person he was, if for no other reason than because being a writer myself, I understand how important it was for him to write every day and to write as well as he could, I also know that his many visits to Pamplona were just as much a measure of the man. They were as important as his writing was, but for other reasons. Here he could let himself go. Here he didn't have to worry about the blank page, or the flow of his words or maintaining that furious energy that any writer needs to create something that is powerful and sublime. No, during the Fiesta he was surrounded by friends and was reminded every day that ""you don't own it."" That nothing is permanent and that everything is ephemeral and passing, including the people that you meet and the moments that you share. Most everything that he did back then and that in fact people still do today was spontaneous and unplanned. ""La fiesta estÃ¡ por la calle"" they like to say in Pamplona, the party is in the streets. This is what you learn when you come here and what I understood immediately in 2008 when I came here for the first time. It brought me closer to my grandfather and made me appreciate him more as a man and as an artist. If he could embrace this chaos and see it for what it was (life itself) and understand the need for this modern day bacchanalia then I could too. ""You don't own it,"" I could almost hear him say, and you never do but you can face your fears and the unexpected like a man and run in front of the bulls as fast as your legs will carry you until you're either pushed aside, knocked down, gored or worse. That's the beauty of Pamplona, it gives you the chance to experience something that perhaps you've never experienced before, to finally be creative with your own life.

"(CNN) -- In 1950, the world's population was 2.5 billion people. Today, it is over 7 billion. By 2050, it will be nearly 10 billion. This explosive growth has put huge strains on our natural resources, but at the same time it has helped create conditions for an unprecedented period of global economic growth, which has seen billions lifted out of poverty. The financial future we face today is uncertain. Most people think global growth will average 3% per year for the foreseeable future, as opposed to 5% before the global economic crisis. This means that it will take 25 years for the economy to double in size -- 10 years longer than it would if it was humming along at its pre-crisis rate. What does this mean? A future of diminished expectations and increased uncertainties poses profound challenges. Considering we already live in a world where hundreds of millions of people are either unemployed or struggling to make ends meet on the fringes of the formal economy, this cannot be underestimated. But I also believe these challenges focus our minds on long-term solutions that will ultimately make our world a fairer, more prosperous, better place to live. The only way forward is to unlock the talent that's within all of us. Youth unemployment . We've become used to headlines chronicling the dire state of youth employment around the world. Average global unemployment is around 13%, but the figure is twice as high -- and then some -- in parts of Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. It doesn't need to be this way. Smarter school and university curricula and a higher focus on relevant skills -- helped by technology and the democratizing power of the Internet -- will allow young people to equip themselves for success in a competitive global marketplace, just as technology renders other jobs obsolete. Talent is as important today as capital when it comes to defining a country's economic competitiveness, and we're getting better at harnessing this. In Europe, for example, eight out of 10 jobs created since 2008 were in small and medium-sized businesses. By getting the public and private sectors working together with academia, this flowering of talent can truly flourish, and become our economies' new growth champions. Gender equality . But you can only unlock talent if you pay equal attention to both halves of the population. Gender equality isn't just about human rights -- it makes cold, hard economic sense. Creating genuine equality in the workforce from the boardroom down will have a transformational effect on many economies. It's been suggested that the U.S. economy could grow by as much as 5% if there were true economic equality between both halves of the population. Japan's could grow further, by as much as 9%. No economy wants to miss out on that kind of growth. This is why President Shinzo Abe announced at Davos in 2014 that he wanted 30% of all senior managerial positions in his country to be held by women by 2020. He won't be the last to make such promises. Leaving no one behind is key. We live in a diverse world and those economies that respect their most gifted people -- regardless of who they are -- will be the ones that will ultimately succeed in underwriting their future prosperity. The benefits of the silver workforce . At the World Economic Forum, we set so much store in countries' ability to attract and retain talent that it forms an integral part in our annual assessment of global competitiveness. The same goes for empowering the economic potential of those nearing the end of their working lives. On paper, preventing people from working later in life looks like a sound way of freeing up jobs for those entering the jobs market. But economists call this the ""lump of labor"" fallacy: in fact, an active, dynamic silver workforce is an excellent way of providing work for the young. The future we face may be uncertain but it need not be one of diminished expectations. Long-term thinking and genuine collaboration between all stakeholders would not only provide quality, sustainable growth and employment, it would once again re-balance national income towards labor, helping addressing the long term trend we are seeing towards income inequality. These are the outcomes our future generations deserve and they are outcomes I believe we can deliver. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Blanke.","Untapped talent is the key to economic growth, argues Jennifer Blanke .
Gender equality in the workplace will benefit the economy .
Despite popular belief, an active silver workforce can provide jobs for the young, she says ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama could reverse some of President Bush's most controversial executive orders, including restrictions on embryonic stem cell research, shortly after taking office in January. President-elect Barack Obama may overturn many of the executive orders that President Bush implemented. Two other executive orders from Bush -- one dealing with a so-called ""gag"" order on international aid organizations regarding abortion, the other with oil and gas drilling on federal lands -- also are receiving increased scrutiny. Obama's transition team is reviewing hundreds of Bush's executive orders, according to John Podesta, Obama's transition co-chair. New presidents often use executive orders to put their stamp on Washington quickly. Unlike laws, which require months to complete and the consent of Congress, presidents can use their executive authority to order federal agencies to implement current policies. ""Much of what a president does, he really has to do with the Congress -- for example, budgeting, legislation on policy -- but executive actions are ones where the president can act alone,"" said Martha Kumar of the White House Transition Project, a nonpartisan group established to help new presidential administrations.  See what orders Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, other presidents issued » . Obama is expected to use his executive authority to reverse Bush's order limiting the types of embryonic stem cell research that can receive federal tax dollars. Advocates for those suffering from a host of diseases -- including diabetes, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injuries -- are eagerly awaiting the Bush-era restrictions to be lifted. ""We have every reason to believe -- if not on Day One, then in the very near future -- they will be issuing an order rescinding this policy,"" said Amy Comstock Rick, president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research.  Watch how Obama could reverse Bush » . In August 2001, Bush barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells other than that using 60 cell lines existing when he signed the executive order. Researchers say the ban has limited their progress and want the opportunity to create new stem cells from human embryos. Many conservatives, however, object to the destruction of human embryos because they believe it ends a human life. On his campaign Web site, Obama said he supports the creation of new stem cells from embryos created for in vitro fertilization treatments that would otherwise be discarded. But White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Monday suggested that the incoming Obama administration should consider keeping Bush's policy in place. ""Unfortunately, the president's position on stem cells has been misconstrued over the years, with the suggestion that President Bush put a ban on research for embryonic stem cell research. That is not true,"" Perino said. ""The president made a very important choice after a lot of careful deliberation.""  Watch Obama's ambitious agenda » . Other controversial Bush measures Obama is expected to overturn are related to abortion and family planning. U.S. State Department officials and family planning groups such as Planned Parenthood said they expect Obama to overturn the ""Mexico City"" policy, first instituted by the Reagan administration. The policy prevents taxpayer dollars from funding groups that perform or promote abortions overseas. President Clinton dropped the order, but Bush re-implemented it and expanded the policy to ensure State Department funding does not go to family planning organizations that even counsel about abortion. An Obama administration also could overturn the Bush administration policy of banning funding to organizations such as the U.N. Population Fund that operate in countries that practice forced sterilization, including China, which adheres to the ""one child"" policy. Podesta said his team also is reviewing Bush's order that lifted restrictions on oil drilling on fragile federal lands in Utah. Environmental groups decried Bush's decision when he opened the lands to exploration this month, and Podesta called the decision a ""mistake."" One set of executive orders that may take longer to overturn pertains to detainees at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, military prison. Obama has said he wants to close the prison, but Denis McDonough, a senior adviser to the incoming Democrat, said Monday that no decisions have been made about what to do with the prison's 255 inmates. ""There is no process in place to make that decision until his national security and legal teams are assembled,"" McDonough said. Reversing Bush's executive orders would be an immediate way for Obama to show that a new era has begun in Washington, said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor. ""Until President Obama gets rid of all these executive orders, he'll be sharing his presidency with his predecessor,"" Turley said. ""Now that's a particularly obnoxious thought for an administration that was elected for change."" CNN's Elise Labott, Edvige Jean-Francois, Jim Acosta and Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report.","Reversing executive orders would allow Barack Obama to put stamp on presidency .

"(CNN) -- The United States and its allies are angrier at Russia now over Ukraine, but will they do anything more about it -- especially Europe? In solemn procession, wooden caskets carrying the remains of those killed in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine -- the majority of the dead were Dutch citizens -- have been arriving in the Netherlands. In all, the nearly 300 victims hailed from more than 10 countries, leaving nations mourning and politicians debating how to deal with Moscow, whose ties with the Ukrainian rebels suspected of downing the jet on July 17 are being cast in the most negative light. The tragedy has stirred European officials to look at new action against a country that is crucial to their economies. What's the layout on sanctions? On July 16, the U.S. imposed its harshest sanctions yet on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, and what the Obama administration said was Russia's failure to end the Ukraine conflict. President Barack Obama expanded steps in targeting two banks, Gazprom Bank and VEB; and two energy companies, Novotek and Rosneft. They won't be able to get important financing in the United States. In addition, the administration froze any U.S. assets and prohibited American business contacts for eight Russian arms companies that make weapons, including small arms, mortars and surface-to-air missiles. One is the Kalashnikov Concern, maker of the AK-47 and other arms. Earlier this year, the United States and Europe imposed a more limited range of sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and the massing of troops along its eastern border with Ukraine. Those included asset freezes and travel bans. What's changed since then? MH17 was blown out of the sky. U.S. officials believe Russia armed the pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine with the rocket system suspected of shooting down the jetliner on July 17. Though, they now say it's likely the rebels didn't know it was a commercial plane at more than 30,000 feet. Russian leaders deny any responsibility -- even indirectly -- and are pointing fingers at Ukraine and NATO for stirring up trouble in the region. It's only upped the ante regarding Russia and its relationship with the United States and its European allies. Aside from the general allied approach to Ukraine, there is more pressure than ever now on Europe to take tougher action because so many of the MH17 passengers were from there, and emotions are fever pitch. Why hasn't Europe acted that forcefully? Earlier this year, Europe joined the United States in imposing limited sanctions in response to Russia' actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Those sanctions included asset freezes and travel bans. The U.S. response is tougher but it doesn't do a ton of business with Russia. Europe on the other hand does. Experts said Europe imports nearly 30% of its energy from Russia, raising the specter of rolling blackouts and unheated homes in the region next winter should Russia decide to retaliate for tougher sanctions. London's place as a regional financial hub is highly dependent on Russian capital. France has already signed off on a deal to deliver two warships to Russia, according to experts. Oil giant Shell, which has its headquarters in The Hague, is the largest corporation in the Netherlands and has huge investments in Russia. Remember the MH17 victims and the Netherlands. But ... ""So the Europeans have over the last decade, as Russia has grown as an oil country, gotten themselves so intermeshed that it's very tough for them to do it,"" said CNN's Fareed Zakaria, referring to tougher sanctions. But isn't the pressure really on now? Yes. The European Union's 28 member states displayed a little more resolve on Thursday. EU ambassadors said they were considering targeting banks vital to Russia's economy, including access to capital markets, defense and technologies such as the energy sector. Robert Kahn, a senior fellow for international economics with the Council on Foreign Relations, said sanctions are only effective if widely backed by Western nations. U.S. sanctions alone have teeth but similar action by European allies would apply real pain. ""We're really at an early inning of the sanctions,"" Kahn said. OK, so what's next? It's really not clear if widespread anger at Moscow will ultimately force new action to isolate Russia further. The EU ambassadors continue to meet on the subject and there is no indication they will abandon caution at the very least. ""There are a lot of economic interests that would be affected by a comprehensive breakdown in relations,"" Kahn said. Map: Europe's thirst for Russian gas . But the end, some experts believe Europe is unlikely to take a tougher line. ""I honestly think the Europeans have no spine,"" said Boston University professor Alya Guseva, an economic sociologist. ""It's amazing to me on a moral level. How bad should it get? As a human being, I don't quite grasp that. This seems to be as bad as it can get."" But if they acted, what would be the toughest step? Let's start with the current sanctions overall. Kahn predicted that by fall, those will begin targeting specific sectors of Russia's economy -- the eighth-largest in the world, with GDP of more than $2 trillion. ""It's going to take some time for the accumulated effects of all of this to really be felt by the Russian people,"" he said. Real pain for Russia would come from any sanctions aimed at cutting off an entire part of its economy, such as defense, energy or finance, according to experts. Kahn said the United States took a first step in this direction last week by adding important Russian banks and energy companies to its list. ""I think the most realistic goal is what Obama was articulating early on: to change the calculus,"" Guseva said. ""It doesn't even have to be the damage that is done. It has to be a credible threat that damage can be done. The Russian economy is not that strong ... It may not take much to sort of spin out of control."" Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels?

"(CNN) -- After an eventful 12-plus months that began with him being named Time's Person of the Year and ended with his blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy, Pope Francis got a chance to celebrate on Wednesday -- by presiding over Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The Mass, typically one of the biggest events on the Roman Catholic calendar, was attended by 8,000 people inside the Basilica while another 3,000 followed along on screens set up in St. Peter's Square. This year, a drone outside and various 3-D cameras inside recorded the Mass. Pope Francis personally requested a performance of Mozart's Mass in C minor for the service, according to a Vatican spokesman. Israeli soprano Chen Reiss sang ""Et Incarnatus Est"" from the Mozart composition. On the Vatican Radio website, Pope Francis said that ""Et Incarnatus Est"" is ""unbeatable and brings you to God."" Manfred Honeck, music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, conducted the orchestra of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. It is the second Christmas Mass since Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, became pontiff. During his Homily, the Pope said that though time has been marked by hatred, oppression, violence and wars, God was there all along, waiting. ""Through the course of history, the light that shatters the darkness reveals to us that God is father and that his patient fidelity is stronger than darkness and corruption. This is the message of Christmas night,"" he said, according to an English translation of his remarks. Since becoming pope, Francis has stayed busy and remained an extremely popular, respected figure worldwide. In recent months, for instance, he urged religious tolerance during a visit to Turkey and played a key role in a historic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuba relations. His conversational tone, warm demeanor and rapport with children and others have continued to win Francis admirers. But he has also garnered critics, including among Catholic conservatives, for his positions -- such as a push to make the church more welcoming for gays and lesbians and his proposed solution for divorced and remarried Catholics who want to receive Communion. Despite his high position, Francis hasn't always been successful: Bishops ended a tense, two-week summit in Rome in October without agreeing, for instance, on how to minister to gays and lesbians. Such pushback hasn't stopped the Pope's efforts to change the church, however. In his annual Christmas address Monday to the Vatican bureaucracy, the Curia, he criticized its members' ""illnesses"" ranging from the ""disease of feeling immortal"" to vainglory and excessive planning. ""Dear brothers, such diseases and such temptations are naturally a danger for each Christian and for each Curia,"" the Pope said. ""... We have to cure ourselves of these.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is coming to the rescue of Republican Senator Pat Roberts, airing its first television ad in Kansas starting Wednesday morning, CNN has learned. The Chamber of Commerce has been playing a big role this election year by spending millions on ads to prop up incumbents in GOP primaries, and now in the general election, to help defeat Democratic incumbents. Spending money in the ruby red state of Kansas to defend Roberts was hardly the original plan for the Chamber of Commerce. But after the Democratic Senate candidate Chad Taylor dropped out, and Orman, an independent, began rising in the polls, the group decided to join several others to try to save Roberts, and potentially a GOP takeover of the Senate. Related: Republicans hit South Dakota airwaves . Orman's calling card is that he is a businessman outside Washington and outside the party structure, beholden to no one. It's a powerful weapon in an election where voters are even more fed up with politics and politicians than usual. The Chamber's ad, which is set to air statewide in Kansas on broadcast and digital, is trying to crack that image of Orman by painting him as just another politician refusing to take positions on key issues, and follows the GOP talking point of the last few weeks -- linking Orman to President Obama and Democrats in the Senate. It even uses the classic Obama campaign logo for the ""O"" in Orman. Orman has donated to Democratic campaigns including Obama's in the past, and said he voted Democrat too. But he has also voted for GOP candidates. His line is that he tried both parties, and liked neither. The ad also whacks Orman for refusing to say which party he would caucus with if he were to win the Senate seat. He has said he would caucus with the majority, but won't say what he would do if there is no clear majority and his decision on which party to back would be a deciding factor. CNN / ORC Poll: Roberts rebounds in Kansas Senate race . CNN is told this initial ad buy is half a million dollars. Scott Reed, former campaign manager for Bob Dole's presidential run, heads the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's political team. Dole, a longtime Kansas senator and good friend of Roberts, has been playing an active private and public role trying to prop him up. Last week, CNN reported that several other conservative groups from all corners were also beginning to pour resources into Kansas, including the Koch brothers' group Americans for Prosperity. Republicans had hoped to only be defending competitive seats in Georgia and Kentucky, but Roberts tarnished image in Kansas as someone who lost touch stuck with him even after he won a tough GOP primary earlier this year.","Republican Sen.

"(CNN) -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he has won Russia's presidential election, restoring the former KGB officer to the office he held for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. Putin won 63% of the votes with more than 99% of the vote counted in an election whose outcome was never in doubt, according to monitors and activists. ""The point of an election is that the outcome should be uncertain. This was not the case in Russia,"" the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said Monday, while urging Russia to hold fair elections. Opposition activist and former chess champion Garry Kasparov also accused Putin's supporters of ""massive fraud"" early Monday by packing the polls with additional voters. While Putin's victory seems certain, it is less clear what his return to Russia's most powerful office means for the country and its relationship with the world. What next for Russia's opposition? Russian opposition leaders predict a massive escalation in their campaign following Putin's announcement of his latest election victory, and Russian security forces broke up a planned anti-Putin protest in central Moscow on Monday evening. Outspoken opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who once branded Putin's United Russia party as ""the party of crooks and thieves,"" told CNN before the election: ""You have to put pressure on government until they give us back the things they've stolen from us."" In pictures: How Putin cultivated strongman image . Organizers of the protest movement are trying to maintain the momentum they have built up since December, when reports of fraud during parliamentary elections sent tens of thousands of Russians into the streets of Moscow to challenge Putin's leadership and demand democratic reforms -- the largest demonstrations in two decades, according to analysts and political observers. Another opposition leader wants anti-Putin protests to become a fact of daily life in Moscow. ""After his supposed inauguration in May, I think we will have a camp in Moscow, and the protests will become permanent,"" Ilya Ponomarev told CNN. ""Our objective is to bar him from taking the oath."" Can Putin govern the same way he did before? While Putin warned during the election campaign that Putin 2.0 would look a lot like Putin 1.0, expert Richard Sakwa says there is significant political change on the horizon in Russia. ""Times have changed, and he cannot go back to the old style of governing,"" said Sakwa, an Associate Fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London-based think-tank Chatham House. ""And the fact he's confirmed he'll have Dmitri Medvedev as Prime Minister suggests that he will not reverse the liberalizing reforms announced on December 22."" In an attempt to address the popular discontent following parliamentary elections in December, Medvedev proposed that Russia return to direct elections of regional governors, simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates, and establish a new editorially-independent national public TV channel. He also announced a number of new anti-corruption measures and called for the redistribution of power and financial resources from the federal government to local governments across the country. Sakwa says Putin is a pragmatist at heart and that enacting reforms will actually benefit the president-elect in the long run. ""The old system was stifling and ultimately it delegitimized Putin's rule,"" said Sakwa. ""But the new measures will be adopted, and all of them are absolutely fundamental truthful changes that will change the whole dynamic of contemporary Russian politics."" What does it mean for the average Russian? Post-election Russia will look remarkably similar to pre-election Russia, according to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, because Putin was already pulling most of the strings during Medvedev's four-year presidency. ""Putin, in a sense, never left. Putin was running the government and the economy on a day to day basis,"" Zakaria writes. ""While he had ceded the presidency, and therefore foreign policy, to Dmitri Medvedev, it was really a charade -- Putin was behind most of the most important decisions anyway."" For all of the flaws of the election, Sakwa says it is important to remember that Putin remains genuinely popular with a large segment of the Russian population. ""There's still a sense that he can deliver those public goods,"" Sakwa told CNN on Monday. ""And while a Putin government has its downsides -- the stifling of small businesses, the weakness of the rule of law, the stifling media environment -- I think that's going to open up."" ""It has to be a major push to ensure to protect the rights of property and limit collusion, because otherwise the economy will maintain its lack of diversity and competitiveness,"" said Sakwa. The Russian economy is primarily based on natural resources including oil and natural gas, and Zakaria believes there is little advantage for the Putin regime in seeing that change, adding: ""The more you diversify, the more prospect there is for losing political control."" What does it mean for Russia's relationship with the West? Putin's official return to the helm comes at a time where Russia has found itself at odds with much of the Western world due to its support for Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria and its rejection of further U.S. and EU sanctions against Iran for its nuclear activities -- and Sakwa doesn't expect that to change anytime soon. ""It's going to be a very bumpy and tough time -- Putin is not going to be anyone's patsy over Syria, over Iran, or anything else,"" he told CNN. ""We look as if we're gearing up for lots of difficult political discussions over the future of the Middle East."" While the West has long tried to delegitimize his policies and regime, Sakwa says Putin has always been careful not to let Russia become a new Soviet Union-style anti-Western bloc. ""It's going to be a lot of tough talking ... but in recent documents Putin has shown what he did when he first came to power -- a very strong pro-European tendency,"" Sakwa said. ""We see the relationship now with the EU is in the doldrums, and I would anticipate an attempt to revive and rejuvenate that relationship."" How long can Putin hold onto power? Putin's win in this election means he could potentially complete two more terms as Russian president before being required by law to step down again in 2024 -- potentially bringing his time as Russian President and Prime Minister to a total 24 years, just short of the record held by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Whether Putin stays on as president for two more terms is largely down to whether he can make changes demanded by a Russian population that is gradually growing weary of his rule, according to Sakwa. ""I think there is a clear sense that Putin has outstayed his welcome,"" said Sakwa. ""But he'll make it through this term if he puts himself at the head of a gradual evolutionary reform movement."" Whether Putin can reform remains to be seen, but Sakwa says he isn't going anywhere for now. ""Barring a catastrophe, Putin's going to serve six years, so we have just have to get used to working with him again.""

"(CNN) -- Two Montana legislators have put their names behind what they hope will be a class-action lawsuit aimed at Greg Mortenson, who has come under fire for allegedly fabricating details in the best-selling book ""Three Cups of Tea."" The lawsuit, which also names Mortenson's Central Asia Institute charity, was filed Thursday in a federal court in Montana by attorneys Alexander Blewett III and his son, Anders Blewett, the latter of whom is a Democratic member of that state's legislature. The plaintiffs are Michele Reinhart of Missoula and Jean Price of Great Falls, both Democratic representatives in Montana. Alexander Blewett III, a Helena-based attorney, said the intent is to eventually open up the suit to anyone who'd bought a book by Mortenson or donated to the Montana-based charity he heads. He said the two plaintiffs hope is to collect money, should the lawsuit prevail, and use it to spur educational efforts in Afghanistan, as the charity has purported to do. ""People now realize they were deceived: They bought books and gave money based on false pretenses,"" Blewett said Friday. ""(The plaintiffs) want to try to get this money into a trust, and use it to actually build schools."" Mortenson shot to worldwide fame with ""Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Fight Terrorism and Build Nations ... One School at a Time,"" which describes his getting lost in an effort to climb K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, being rescued by Pakistanis in the village of Korphe and vowing to return there to build a school for local girls. The riveting story led to the creation of the Central Asia Institute, an organization that works to improve girls' education in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Co-written with David Oliver Relin, the book has become a international publishing phenomenon since it was published five years ago, spawning a sequel, two children's editions and translations in 19 countries. The charity did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on the proposed class-action lawsuit. It referred CNN to earlier remarks it and Mortenson have made, which deny that the fundamental stories behind the best-seller are untrue. The charity's website also posted a statement from one of Mortenson's doctors, Pamela Hiebert, saying that the author has a hole in his heart that has led to chronic low oxygen levels in his blood. As of Monday, an angiographic procedure that had been scheduled for last week had been postponed and Mortenson was at home on bed rest, where he was receiving oxygen but not allowed to use electronics, according to Hiebert. Several weeks earlier, when a critical ""60 Minutes"" segment came out, Mortenson defended his stories and charity. He wrote, in comments posted on the Central Asia Institute's website, that the CBS report ""paints a distorted picture using inaccurate information, innuendo and a microscopic focus on one year's"" tax return for the Montana-based charity. And two days before the piece aired, he wrote, ""I stand by the information conveyed in my book, and by the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students."" Yet the lawsuit filed this week claim that both Mortenson and his institute ""repeatedly fabricated material about his activities and work in Pakistan and Afghanistan ... to induce unsuspecting individuals to purchase his books and donate to CAI."" Mortenson ""committed actual fraud"" against the plaintiffs -- one of whom bought a book, while the other gave to his charity -- the lawsuit alleges. ""The conduct of Mortenson and CAI constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,"" according to the lawsuit. Blewett explained that a federal judge will now decide whether the lawsuit can be a class-action, which would mean anyone who bought Mortenson's book or given to his charity -- even if they live outside Montana -- can join as a plaintiff. The lawsuit specifically mentions the creation of a ""constructive trust"" that would funnel money from the lawsuit to charitable works. Ultimately, Mortenson and his charity could face a jury trial, based on the lawsuit's claims. ""We (could) could have our opportunity to present the testimony, and we'll see what the jury says,"" said Blewett. ""We are convinced that the vast amount of what (Mortenson) said is false."" Weeks before this lawsuit came to light, Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock said in a statement his office is looking into the Central Asia Institute. The organization recorded income of $14 million in 2009, the vast majority of which was raised from private individuals, many of whom may have been inspired by Mortenson's books. However, in 2009, less than half of that money actually went to building schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and $1.7 million went to promote Mortenson's books, according to the institute's board of directors. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A lawsuit is filedagainst Greg Mortenson and the Central Asia Institute .

"Maracana, Rio De Janeiro (CNN) -- The pressure suffocated those toiling on the grass, the gravity of a World Cup final adding weight to the air like plumbing a great depth in the ocean. That pressure was only intensified by the anxiety rolling down the terraces of the Maracana stadium, perhaps world football's holiest site. After four grueling weeks, across 64 games -- where 32 of the planet's best soccer nations scrapped and shot and passed and passed and passed each other to elimination -- it had come down to this. An estimated one billion people were watching, gripped, as the drama unfolded including a lucky, enthralled, 80,000 spectators in the seats of the arena. Two teams, forged on different sides of the planet, had been locked in combat for 90 minutes without significant advantage. Defenses had stood resolute, goalposts had been rattled, endeavor had created opportunity that even the great Lionel Messi had failed to capitalize on. Normal time had made way for extra time and -- with every energy-sapping minute played -- the Russian roulette of a penalty shootout edged ever closer. The legion of spectators that stood in the bowl were emotionally intoxicated and called on all superstitious and religious powers at their disposal to deliver them from doom. But not all in the arena had lost hope. Individual mental fortitude is difficult to attain, but at least with self growth the ability to change remains in one's own hands. A collective resilience, a communal resistance to set back, a refusal to be deterred from a group destiny requires careful nurture over years for all involved to believe in the same vision. The 2014 version of Die Nationalmannschaft had been patiently planned, engineered and inculcated. They'd waited for this moment for over a decade and now was not the time to buckle. ""The lowest point came in Euro 2000 -- that was German football's nadir: very poor performances, a very poor team and very poor management,"" German football expert Rafael Honigstein told CNN. Germany's performance in the 2002 World Cup, where they lost in the final to Brazil, helped papered over the cracks, but it would take another two years for the real changes to the national game to filter through. ""The grass roots reforms were already in place by the time Jurgen Klinnsman took over with Joachim Low in 2004,"" added Honigstein, referring to Germany's former and current coach. ""The 10-year development you've seen culminate in Brazil benefited from two changes being made at more or less the same time. ""Youth development was instilled to make sure young players were much better educated and had better facilities and coaching. ""And at the same time there was a change of philosophy and footballing ideas at the very top -- after 10 years these two elements fused quite brilliantly to deliver the World Cup. ""You have to credit the chairman of the German Football Association (DFB) at the time, Gerhard Mayer, who realized the needs for reform. He was able to get all the Bundesliga clubs, including the big ones, on board. ""They all signed up to create academies and there was a spirit of cooperation, which was especially pronounced in those years, because Germany had won the right to host a World Cup in 2006. ""There was a real fear the team and the footballing nation might embarrass themselves as hosts if they didn't make changes,"" said Honigstein. Germany's blueprint for change didn't come cheap and it needed the clubs to work closely with the DFB. ""If everyone is pulling in the same direction it makes a big difference,"" added Honigstein. ""You need a lot of money and you need the commitment to do it. Very few countries could replicate what Germany has done. ""You have to consider they now have 366 centers of excellence for youth development throughout the country. ""Bayern Munich has also been the driving force of the national team because they produce the best youngsters, and they buy the best German players and hone them, to make them even better. ""It's no coincidence that when Bayern did well in the 1970s, 90s and now, the national team has benefited. ""Bayern, under former president Uli Hoeness, always kept the greater good of the national team at the back of their minds and that's an important factor for the success of German football,"" explained Honigstein. Midfield dynamo Bastian Schweinsteiger would later dedicate Germany's final performance to Hoeness, as the man responsible for many of the players being where they are. Such long-term planning and dedication to a single goal, by the time the last match was being played in Brazil in 2014, was in the final throes of its application. The squad and the 11 men on the pitch were the fruition of a design drawn up long ago. The path to glory sewn into the psyche of everyone involved. With barely seven minutes left on the clock, Andre Schurrle, a man arguably only on the pitch due to injuries to two players selected before him, picked up the ball on the left wing, just inside of the opposition's half. With three Argentines in front of him he dared to be positive, to run forward with the ball. Navigating a slim gully on the flank he slithered past the retreating men in blue, ever nearer to the touchline. Five, 10, 20 yards he progressed until -- as defenders threatened to force him and the ball from the field of play -- he released a deft cross to the man in white on his right. Mario Gotze, one of seven Bayern players in the side and a man who entered the field of play as 88th-minute substitute, acted instinctively as if he had executed this maneuver a thousand times before. Without breaking stride he controlled the ball with a softening of his chest and then, as the near post of Sergio Romero's goal encroached, placed the ball across his body with a left-foot volley. The German-made Brazuca ball flew into the far side of the net and the three-time world champions of Franz Beckenbauer, Lothar Matthaus and Fritz Walter, were once again on top of the footballing world, this time under Philipp Lahm's leadership. It was a goal of sublime skill that epitomized all that has been good with Low's side in Brazil -- in one moment Gotze's goal ensured German dream had also come true. So what now lies ahead? Germany's future might bright but Honigstein argues they have some way to go to match the traditional global love felt for Brazil's "" A Selecao."" ""The reality is, as soon as you start winning a lot of things people want to see you fail. ""You can play beautiful football but people soon want another team to come to the fore, and accuse you of arrogance if you win too easily. ""Germany can still grow as a team with some really exciting youngsters, the likes of Marco Reus and Julian Draxler, coming through,"" added Honigstein, referring to the Borussia Dortmund and Schalke attacking midfield players. ""I think the future is bright, but will Germany be adopted as the world's favorite team? I doubt it very much."" Maybe the German writer will be proved right, maybe there will always be a place in the heart of football fans for the poetry the Brazil of Pele, Zico and Rivelino invoked. But Brazil should not rest on its laurels. Cooperation for the greater good, investment and commitment to achieve the impossible was the German solution to their crisis nearly 15 years ago. As hosts of the tournament and so-called keepers of the soul of the beautiful game, it would be worth Brazilian football taking note as they experience their own nadir.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Democrat Al Franken declared victory in the hotly contested Minnesota Senate race Monday, saying the win is ""incredibly humbling."" A Minnesota board says Al Franken won his U.S. Senate race against Norm Coleman by 225 votes. The Minnesota State Canvassing Board on Monday certified the results of the recount of Republican Sen. Norm Coleman's fight to retain his seat against Franken. The results showed Franken with a 225-vote lead. ""I am proud to stand before you as the next senator from Minnesota,"" Franken told reporters Monday night. ""It's clear that we have a lot of important work to do ... I'm ready to go to Washington and get to work as soon as possible."" Coleman's attorney, Tony Trimble, said shortly after the ruling that the campaign will officially file a lawsuit. The Minnesota Republican's campaign later announced that he will make a public statement on Tuesday afternoon. Coleman's campaign contends the recount should have included about 650 absentee ballots it says were improperly rejected in the initial count. Watch Coleman say he will take his fight to the courts » . The initial count from the November 4 election put Coleman, a first-term senator, 215 votes ahead of Franken, who is known for his stint on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" and as a former talk-show host on progressive radio network Air America. In Washington, the Senate's majority and minority leaders staked out opposing positions on the matter of who will serve Minnesota alongside Democrat Amy Klobuchar. ""There comes a time when you have to acknowledge that the race is over,"" Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters. ""The race in Minnesota's over. Now it's only a little finger-pointing. The certification by the canvassing board, which has been in process for a number of weeks, now clearly shows that Al Franken has won."" Reid added later: ""Coleman will never ever serve in the Senate. He's lost the election. He can stall things, but he'll never serve in the Senate.""  Watch Reid call on Coleman to concede the race » . Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said: ""The law in Minnesota requires certification from the secretary of state and that can't happen until the conclusion of all legal battles. It's not over."" Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan echoed McConnell's criticism. ""The efforts of Al Franken, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer to steal this election and seat Al Franken despite not having an election certificate are unprecedented,"" Duncan said in a statement. ""I am confident that if the law is followed, Norm Coleman will be taking his rightful seat in the U.S. Senate."" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has pledged a GOP filibuster if the Democratic-controlled Senate attempts to seat Franken before all legal battles play out and before Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, can co-sign Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie's certificate. Reid said there would be no effort to seat Franken on Tuesday, the day new senators will be sworn in. Meanwhile, in a move that leaves a post-election legal challenge the last hope for Coleman, Minnesota's high court earlier Monday denied his campaign's request to consider about 650 additional rejected absentee ballots. His attorneys had said those ballots should have been included in the count of mistakenly rejected ballots that were tallied over the weekend. The Coleman campaign also said Monday that there was no uniform standard for local officials and campaigns to review and tabulate these improperly rejected ballots. Previously, the court had ordered that only ballots that local officials and both campaigns could agree were rejected in error could be counted. A consensus was met on about 950 of 1,350 originally found by local officials. The court ruling suggested Coleman's latest request should be a post-election consideration. The Coleman campaign, meanwhile, said it was determined to take the question to court. ""Today's ruling, which effectively disregards the votes of hundreds of Minnesotans, ensures that an election contest is now inevitable,"" said Coleman attorney Fritz Knaak. ""The Coleman campaign has consistently and continually fought to have every validly cast vote counted, and for the integrity of Minnesota's election system, we will not stop now. The Minnesota Supreme Court has made sure that an election contest will need to be filed quickly in order to ensure that an accurate and valid recount can be achieved."" Coleman, who just finished his first term as senator, led Franken by 206 votes at the end of the original vote count in November. The margin automatically triggered the recount, which was hampered by multiple challenges from both sides. Coleman switched to the Republican Party from the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which Franken now represents, in 1996, after two years as St. Paul's mayor.","Norm Coleman to make public statement Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Sony's high profile lawyer David Boies is demanding Twitter take action to block tweets that draw upon the material hackers took from the corporation's computer servers. He wants the accounts of those who post the stolen emails to be suspended. Earlier, Boies wrote to news organizations admonishing them that they should not publish stories based on the company's stolen secrets. Gossip-hungry media consumers have been enjoying a feast of salacious celebrity fare from the hacked computers of Sony Entertainment. The U.S. government says North Korea is responsible for the hacking, which apparently was prompted by a Sony movie, ""The Interview."" Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a man who loves movies but bans virtually all contact between computer, videos and his own starving citizens, is apparently unamused at the film, which makes a joke of his imaginary assassination. In the aftermath of a clearly criminal invasion of Sony's computer system and the cybertheft of thousands upon thousands of documents, emails and related data, the press immediately started publishing the stolen goods. The media then self-righteously asserted that the First Amendment protects its right to publish even stolen material if it relates to ""matters of public concern."" This wording emanates from the only Supreme Court case somewhat ""on point"" as we lawyers like to say. The case is Bartnicki v. Vopper (2001). But is it really on point? The court's ruling in the Bartnicki case affirmed the right of a Pennsylvania radio show host to play the contents of an illegally recorded cellular telephone conversation over the airwaves. The private conversation between a union president and his union's negotiator related to collective bargaining between a teachers' union and a local municipality. This private conversation would later be blessed by the SCOTUS majority of Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer as a ""matter of public concern"" fully protected by the First Amendment despite the criminality and invasion of privacy clearly associated with the way the recording was obtained. A strong and lengthy dissent, however, was filed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Rehnquist, a conservative appointed to the court by Richard Nixon and later elevated to the chief justice position by Ronald Reagan, was quite prescient about future privacy issues for a man who was born 60 years before email came into widespread use. The words from his dissenting opinion may provide the basis for a re-evaluation of the Bartnicki decision and a needed reassertion of privacy rights in the United States. The Bartnicki rationale is being used to reward the actions of the Korean dictator, assuming his government has masterminded the hack. As Rehnquist observed, the downside of our reliance on electronic communication is that ""We are placed in the uncomfortable position of not knowing who might have access to our personal and business emails, our medical and financial records, or our cordless and cellular telephone conversations. Rehnquist objected to the court majority's ruling that federal and state laws against intercepting electronic communications violated the First Amendment. ""The court's decision diminishes, rather than enhances, the purposes of the First Amendment: chilling the speech of the millions of Americans who rely upon electronic technology to communicate each day. ..."" Surely, he wrote, ""the interest in individual privacy, ... at its narrowest must embrace the right to be free from surreptitious eavesdropping on, and involuntary broadcast of, our cellular telephone conversations."" In the Sony case, the invasion of the corporation's privacy revealed such minutiae as a movie producer's disparaging judgment of Angelina Jolie (""a minimally talented spoiled brat""), suggestions that Sony engages in wage discrimination against not only its female employees but also its female movie stars, and tasteless jokes from executives about whether the President liked black-themed movies. Is this really information protected by the First Amendment? Should those who profit from the disclosure of this cybertrash remain exempt from prosecution either criminal or civil? Are these items that the Supreme Court believes are ""matters of public concern?"" The law and the U.S. Supreme Court have been outrun by technology's rapid advance and we need a more carefully calculated balance between privacy, property rights and the First Amendment. The amendment as worded was intended to protect political speech, not the dissemination of stolen email and salacious gossip from corporations. Knowing possession of stolen property is almost always a crime and trying to dress it up as a form of ""free speech"" places the privacy rights of all American citizens in danger. Much of life has moved into the shadow of the computer, tablet and mobile phone's blue light. These devices are increasingly the targets of information theft by sophisticated cybercriminals. Surely the courts must recognize some privacy rights that are not automatically trumped by a bogus assertion of the First Amendment's ""public concern"" protection. In David Boies, Sony hired one of America's most famous and successful lawyers to advance the suggestion that those who reveal Sony's stolen emails and computer data may face lawsuits for damages. Not even the First Amendment's wide protective net will permit publication of copyrighted material and such things as personal Social Security numbers or intimate personal facts about noncelebrity figures who are included in the stolen Sony database. U.S. copyright law and the theory of ""invasion of privacy"" will assure substantial damages to parties legitimately aggrieved. And don't underestimate Boies. He handed out some of the highest bonuses in the legal profession this year, with one associate getting more than $300,000. If she was the attorney who landed Sony as a client, the bonus was obviously well deserved. She will also have a busy year in court if the leakage of hacked material continues.","Sony lawyer David Boies asks Twitter to block tweets of stolen company email .

"(CNN) -- A month into the fall semester, Clemson University has pulled the plug on two dozen fraternities. The university opted to halt all social and new-member activities on the South Carolina campus after the death of a student and a ""high number"" of reported incidents involving fraternities. Student Affairs Vice President Gail DiSabatino cited complaints ""ranging from alcohol related medical emergencies to sexual misconduct"" as contributing to the decision. ""These behaviors are unacceptable and mandate swift and effective action to protect students,"" DiSabatino said in a press release. ""There is no higher priority than the safety and welfare of our students."" ""It is especially prudent to suspend fraternity activities given the tragic death of Tucker Hipps,"" she said. Hipps was found dead on Monday. The 19-year-old sophomore went for a run with his fraternity early Monday morning and did not come back, according to the university. His fraternity brothers searched for him and eventually went to campus police. At 3:30 that afternoon, an officer found Hipps' body in nearby Lake Hartwell close to a bridge. The local sheriff's office is investigating and it said there is nothing to indicate that ""hazing played a part in the death."" An autopsy revealed the teen likely fell, according to CNN affiliate WHNS. The coroner told WHNS the teen had a head injury consistent with a fall from a height of 20 feet or more. Student responds to university's decision . Tanner Parsons, a freshman at Clemson, says he met Hipps briefly at a fraternity pledge event this year. While he didn't know Hipps personally, the news shocked him. ""It kind of hit me hard that this kid was just like me, just starting college and just figuring stuff out. It's kind of sobering to think how fast something can happen,"" said Parsons, who first shared his story on CNN iReport. Hundreds of students came together Tuesday night to remember Hipps at a candlelight vigil on Bowman Field at Clemson, according to CNN affiliate WLTX. Other schools have been showing their solidarity by wearing orange and posting their photos on social media.

"(CNN) -- It might be a bit of a blur to everyone else, but Lionel Messi always seems to keep a clear head -- even in the most pressurized situations. And if the football maestro's opponents struggle to keep up with him, spare a thought for the sports photographers who have to track his moments of magic. Mike Hewitt's artful image of the Argentina star in action against Mexico at the last World Cup in South Africa captures his dynamism down to a tee. But it wasn't the shot he had expected to walk away with at Johannesburg's Soccer City Stadium that evening. ""I had planned to go up into the crowd,"" Hewitt told CNN's Sports Photo Masterclass series. ""I found a position in the stands which I thought might give me a different angle, but a steward took exception to me being there."" The FIFA-accredited Hewitt protested, stayed put and the game started. Then the police arrived. ""About 10 of them showed up in full riot gear and said, 'You can't stay here.' I wasn't going to argue, so I was escorted down to the pitch where they thought all the photographers should be. ""I kind of squeezed in late -- not in a great position -- and I thought I might as well just go for it. Lionel Messi is playing and if I can get one image of him like this, I'll be happy."" The image was captured using a technique called panning, where the photographer follows a moving subject during an exposure. A successful shot will blur the background, giving a sense of movement and speed while keeping the subject, or part of it, in focus. ""I had a couple of attempts earlier that didn't really work -- a lot of the frames are a complete blur. But then luckily he had a good run down the wing,"" says Hewitt, who is Senior World Cup photographer at leading agency Getty. ""The key thing you're trying to do is freeze the head, and we're quite lucky that the ball looks fairly frozen as well."" The image was captured using a 400 mm telephoto lens mounted on a monopod, with Hewitt opting for a super-slow shutter speed -- around one-eighth of a second compared with 1,000th of a second typically used for action shots. Messi's forward-leaning, athletic pose is amplified by the disorganized tangle of arms and legs of his straggling opponent. ""It actually works better in other sports, particularly ones when they're on a predictable path like athletics or speed skating,"" Hewitt says of the panning technique. ""You know they're going to be at a particular place and you can try again and again. The nature of football is very zigzag ... so you don't get many of these."" Hewitt also turned his lens on Messi's national coach during the 2010 tournament, capturing Diego Maradona celebrating the winning goal in his first match in charge at a World Cup finals. Even more impressively, he took the defining image of the final between the Netherlands and Spain, dropping the shutter at the exact moment Nigel de Jong's boot clattered into Xabi Alonso's chest. When he's not snapping a match action, the 52-year-old is always on the lookout for salable pictures elsewhere. ""You've always got to have your camera with you just in case. You never know what's going to be happening anywhere,"" he says. A good example was a beautiful shot of kids playing football taken in the week before the 2010 tournament kicked off. ""We were driving back from Johannesburg when my colleague saw these children playing football in this sort of dirt ditch on the edge of a very large township,"" Hewitt explains. ""The office and the world media were crying out for an image that showed football in South Africa and I'd like to think that this one summed it up quite nicely."" Another enduring photo has been one Hewitt took two decades ago at the tournament hosted by the U.S. The image of Brazilian players' hands clutching the trophy following their penalty shootout victory over Italy in the 1994 final will be instantly recognizable to football fans worldwide. ""We had exhausted all the team photos of them and I just happened to notice a couple of them trying to get their hands on the trophy,"" Hewitt says. ""I think a large part of its success is that you've got different ethnic groups holding it -- you've got white guys and black guys. I think this is Romario and Dunga holding the trophy.""

"(CNN) -- ""Year in review"" time is upon us! You can't go on the Internet without being inundated with the top ""fill in the blank"" stories of the year -- from pop culture to politics to even the ""Top 10 Twitter fights."" But these lists also remind me of the things I wish I hadn't learned about in 2013. I don't mean the events I wish hadn't happened but the lessons from this year's events that I wish I could have avoided. And I would wager that many of you would agree with at least a few of my choices. So here's my list: . 1. Pope Francis' compassion for the poor is a bad thing to some: I thought being concerned about the poor and wanting to help those less fortunate was a good thing. But Sarah Palin criticized the Pontiff for being ""kind of liberal"" (which she views as a really bad thing) though she didn't specify the offending words and later apologized. And Rush Limbaugh even labeled the Pope's words about capitalism, income inequality and urging world leaders to combat poverty as being ""pure Marxism."" I guess the lesson for the Pope is don't actually preach what's in the Bible or else some on the right will call you names. 2. One dance move on a basic cable TV show can popularize a new word in our collective vocabulary: I'm speaking, of course, of, ""twerking."" That dance may have been around for years, but it wasn't until Miley Cyrus twerked her way into the headlines at this year's MTV Video Music Awards that we all became intimately familiar with it. ""Thanks,"" Miley. 3. You can lie to Congress under oath and still keep your job: In March, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper answered ""No, sir"" when asked during a congressional hearing whether the NSA was gathering ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans."" Of course, we found out a short time later about the NSA's massive surveillance program when Edward Snowden released classified documents. Yet Clapper was not charged with perjury nor even removed from his position for his less than fully honest answer to Congress. (He did apologize for what he called ""clearly erroneous"" testimony.) In contrast, when ex-baseball pitcher Roger Clemens allegedly lied to Congress under oath in 2008 about using performance-enhancing drugs, he was charged with perjury and had to endure a criminal trial. 4. We are so hypersensitive that people will even fight over fictitious characters: Fox News' Megyn Kelly created a firestorm by saying that Santa Claus is white. The amount of instant (faux) outrage may have hit an all-time high. And the more bizarre lesson I learned from this debate was that I agreed with Glenn Beck who said, in essence: ""Don't we have more important things to worry about than Santa's skin color?!"" 5. The leader of the free world can't get a website to work: Obamacare became law three-and-a-half years ago, but shockingly the website for President Obama's signature piece of legislation was a horrible failure when it rolled out in October. Sure, the website is now functioning pretty well after a two-month makeover, but if I were President and there was a program known as ""Obeidallah-care"" or ""Dean-aid,"" I can assure you that the website for that program would've been amazing from Day 1. 6.  A crack smoking mayor can have a higher approval rating than the President of the U.S.: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who not only admitted to smoking crack, but made inane public statements and walked into everything from cameras to other elected officials, had a higher approval rating in November than President Obama. Could it be that Canadians are too forgiving or are we too tough on our elected officials -- or both? 7. We are the most self-centered generation ever: I'm part of this self-absorbed generation so I'm not being judgmental, just honest. We have become so narcissistic that the word ""selfie"" was the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year for 2013. We even saw the rise of ""funeral seflies"" where people take self-portraits at funerals often posing with the dead body. And thanks to Kim Kardashian, we now have ""Belfies"" -- where you take a self-portrait of your buttocks and share that with the world. I can't even imagine the type of ""selfies"" we will see in 2014 but it may involve a tiny camera being inserted into body cavities. 8. 90% of Americans could support a proposed law and Congress still won't pass it: Prior to 2013, I would have bet money that if 90% of us supported the passage of a law that could save American lives, Congress would enact it. Yet this year even though that percent of Americans supported universal background checks for all gun sales, it still couldn't get through our dysfunctional Congress. Apparently we need 100% of Americans to support it before Congress will act. 9. Don't go on vacation with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum: When I checked into my hotel for a vacation earlier this year, I was told that the sequel to Hill and Tatum's hit film ""21 Jump Street"" was being filmed there. The result was a nightmare of closed hotel facilities and a mass of extras swarming the hotel. So if you check into your hotel for a quiet vacation and find out that a big studio movie will be shooting there, check out. What unwelcome lessons did 2013 bring for you? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comment section below. And best wishes for a 2014 filled with health, happiness -- and fewer lessons you wish you could have avoided.

"(CNN) -- In Brazil, they use the expression ""futbol arte"" to describe the type of soccer which made the country's world champion team of 1970 so easy on the eye. But no longer -- football has changed, and Brazil has changed too. When it won the World Cup in 1994, the national team's style of play was dubbed ""futebol dá força"" -- a tougher, more pragmatic approach. And, after a year of violent protests, rubber bullets and tear gas, the romantic ideal of Brazil often portrayed in glossy travel magazines seems hard to imagine. Thursday marks the start of an opportunity for Brazil to redefine itself after a difficult 12 months preparing for arguably the world's largest and most popular event. So no pressure, then, on Brazil's footballers, who take on Croatia in the tournament's opening game in Sao Paulo, the recent epicenter of the unrest. Will the host team's expected progress, led by current hero Neymar, help ease the sense of injustice which has ingrained itself within the population? As if that wasn't a great enough weight on the shoulders of coach Luiz Felipe Scolari's team, there is the added pressure of Brazil's quest to exorcise the ghosts of 1950 -- which will begin 64 years after what is known as the country's ""Hiroshima."" When Uruguay defeated Brazil in the deciding match courtesy of Alcides Ghiggia's strike, it left an indelible mark on a country whose first love has always been football. And yet, after more than six decades of waiting for the tournament to return to their home country, the Brazilian people are otherwise engaged. Whereas football may still be a religion, its Brazilian congregation have slowly turned their backs on their deity. ""This World Cup is not for the Brazilians,"" 59-year-old street vendor Maria Elza de Fatima told CNN. ""It is for the foreigners and FIFA friends."" While thousands of tourists flock to Brazil and media pack the streets to broadcast the action across the world, Sao Paulo has been brought to a standstill by metro workers striking over wages -- the latest in a series of protests against the government. An estimated $11 billion of public money has been spent on hosting the tournament -- much to the chagrin of the protesters, who argue that money might have been better spent on public services.. ""I think the best moment to protest is at the end of the World Cup,"" says two-time World Cup winner Cafu, Brazil's most-capped footballer, who was speaking to CNN to promote the Castrol Footkhana skills challenge. ""This will be the moment we can show ourselves that we can fight for our rights -- better education, better healthcare, better culture, better transportation,"" he told CNN. ""This is the moment we can show the world we are capable of staging a well-organized World Cup. We will show we are a democratic country and (later) fight for our rights."" Once the football starts, nobody will be more relieved than FIFA and its under-fire president, Sepp Blatter. The 78-year-old, who has held the position since 1998, was told Tuesday that he should not stand for a fifth four-year term by some of the organization's key European members within UEFA. However, at Wednesday's FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo, he told delegates ""my mission is not finished ... I am ready to accompany you in the future."" Just a fortnight after allegations of corruption during the 2022 World Cup vote was reported by Britain's Sunday Times, Blatter has been forced to endure one of the most difficult periods of his tenure. The newspaper claims to have unearthed millions of emails and other documentation which allege Qatar's former FIFA Executive Committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam used a multimillion-dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid. The claims have been strenuously denied by Qatar organizers, who in a statement released to CNN Sunday said they had been co-operating fully with U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia, who has been appointed by FIFA to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, awarded to Russia and Qatar. But president of the Dutch Football Association Michael Van Praag believes enough is enough. ""I then said at the microphone: 'I like you a lot, there is nothing personal here, but the reputation of FIFA is today inextricably linked to corruption,"" recounted Praag of what transpired at Tuesday's UEFA meeting. ""FIFA has a president. You are responsible, you should not stand again."" Despite the barbs, Blatter appeared in bullish mood Wednesday when speaking at the world governing body's congress, insisting FIFA could be a force for positive change. While European nations have gone public about their opposition to Blatter, African and Asian members have backed the Swiss to continue in the role he has held since 1998. ""The answer is easy and simple ... we must lead by example and we must listen to all voices, we must be responsible and upright in all that we do, we must do the right thing even if that comes at a cost,"" Blatter told the audience. ""It's not always very easy to live up to this principle. But it's our duty ... if we do not do it, who will?"" The bad news for Blatter is that the Sunday Times promises more revelations on Qatar, which suggests football might continue to play second fiddle to politics for a while yet. A successful World Cup and a Brazil victory might go some way to temporarily muffling the protests of both the Brazilian people and FIFA's growing critics.

"(CNN) -- Diego Maradona was a mesmerizing presence on the pitch during four World Cup finals as a player. When he returned to football's biggest stage in 2010 as coach of Argentina, it soon became clear that his capacity to entertain remained undimmed. His theatrical displays from the touchline during Argentina's matches became one of the unexpected highlights of the tournament. Mike Hewitt, senior staff photographer at Getty Images, had a ringside seat as Maradona took charge for his first competitive World Cup finals match against Nigeria at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium. ""You just know that this was going to be a worldwide story,"" Hewitt told CNN's Sports Photo Masterclass series. ""I decided to try and sit as close to the dugout as I could get away with -- just to get a portrait or a reaction shot. I wanted to get in, get that feeling of what it's like to be part of that bench when and if Argentina scored."" It's quite a careful balancing act taking photos in these situations,"" adds Hewitt. ""You don't want to get too close and start upsetting someone. ""But Maradona didn't seem to care. I don't think he even noticed I was there."" When Gabriel Heinze's diving header had the net bulging in the sixth minute, Hewitt took his chance. ""Obviously, there's a huge element of luck involved in it,"" the photographer concedes, pointing to the substitute on the left of the photo who jumped out of the dugout when he celebrated. ""I'm glad he did it there and not bang in front of Maradona or I would have missed the picture."" It's an iconic image, he thinks -- one that brings Maradona's World Cup story up to date. ""He's a man that practically won it single-handedly for Argentina back in 1986 (in Mexico) and then was banned,"" Hewitt says referring to Maradona's ignominious exit from the 1994 U.S. tournament after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine. ""For him to them come back as coach for the Argentinian team -- the whole world wants to know what's going to happen."" Maradona's last finals as a player in 1994 was also the scene of Hewitt's debut as a World Cup photographer. Back then he was still using film, sending reels back to the office for processing with pictures ready for clients usually within a couple of hours. ""In Brazil, I'll be sending pictures instantly to the editors within a second of it actually happening,"" says Hewitt. ""It will be edited and cropped and captioned and then beamed to the world so people have it in two minutes."" Technology hasn't just helped make sports photography become more efficient, it's also helped it evolve. ""You're constantly under pressure because it's a competitive industry,"" adds Hewitt. ""There might be upwards of 200 photographers on the pitch and people are just looking for the absolute best image of a particular incident."" Hewitt, 52, has thrived in that cutthroat environment, and came up trumps a second time in South Africa when he captured the moment Dutchman Nigel de Jong's right boot violently connected with Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso's chest. ""It was a very feisty final. It happened very quickly, out of the blue, so I was just fortunate that I was in the right position to get the kung fu kick."" Sitting on the touchline level with the 18-yard line, Hewitt took the shot using his 400 mm lens. ""Because it was a night game under floodlights you're shooting wide open -- a very large aperture -- so the depth of field on these images is very small, maybe about six inches. ""But it's good because it throws the background out (of focus) completely and isolates the players very well. I must have shot it at about 1/1,000th of a second."" De Jong escaped with a booking -- one of 14 in the match -- but the tackle became perhaps the defining image of the final which Spain went onto win 1-0 after extra time. ""It's quite an iconic image from a World Cup final -- they don't come around very often,"" Hewitt says. ""There's a large element of luck involved -- being in the right place at the right time -- but you still have to get the image."" Hewitt experience extends across the sporting spectrum with a portfolio that includes six Olympic Games, four cricket World Cups, four rugby World Cups and two round the world yacht races to his name. For now, another World Cup final at Rio's Maracana Stadium awaits Hewitt. Not bad for a man who started out as an amateur snapper shooting park football on Hackney Marshes in east London. ""We get to go to some great places and cover some great events. I had the pleasure of photographing the Beach Soccer World Cup in Tahiti (in 2013) which was magnificent,"" he says. ""It's times like these where you think: 'well, life doesn't get any better.'""

"(CNN) -- If anyone wondered about Argentina's World Cup-winning credentials, surely there can be little doubt now. Not because of the convincing nature of the team's football thus far mind you -- far from it. But after a solitary goal from Gonzalo Higuain was enough to overcome Belgium in Brasilia on Saturday, ""La Albiceleste"" are only one game away from the final of this gripping World Cup. The win also marked the first time Argentina has reached a World Cup semifinal since 1990, when -- after overcoming host nation Italy on penalties -- it was eventually defeated by West Germany in a bad-tempered final. That came four years after Diego Maradona inspired the country's second title success in football's showpiece event, in Mexico, following victory on home soil in 1978. ""After 24 years this is a good tribute to this squad -- they will go down in history as one of the best four teams in the world and we will see if they can go one step more,"" coach Alejandro Sabella told reporters. While Brazil will be without injured star striker Neymar for Tuesday's semifinal against Germany -- and the rest of the tournament if the host goes any further -- the Argentines have their own fitness concerns after trumping a Belgian team tipped as a pre-tournament dark horse. Angel Di Maria, who scored Argentina's winning goal in the previous round, is a doubt for Wednesday's match against the Netherlands -- which beat Costa Rica in a penalty shootout later Saturday -- after coming off with a thigh injury in the first half. Nevertheless, they will be glad to be through. Alejandro Sabella's team had struggled in the group stage, requiring a dramatic late strike from Lionel Messi to overcome unfancied Iran and only narrowly defeating Nigeria and Bosnia. An uncomfortable extra-time victory over Switzerland in the round of 16 also hardly inspired confidence. Yet such worries seem pointless when a team has the likes of Messi in its ranks. The Barcelona star has finally announced his arrival on the World Cup stage in Brazil after a disappointing 2010 tournament in South Africa and only a few substitute appearances as a 17-year-old in Germany four years prior. Messi had scored four goals in four games coming in to this encounter, as well as providing a fantastic dribbling assist for di Maria to secure victory over Switzerland. ""I felt he played a wonderful match,"" Sabella said. ""It's not only scoring goals, it's having possession, taking out three opponents, and every move he makes is a sign of hope for us and endangers our opponents. ""That a player like Messi almost never loses the ball is water in the desert -- he gives us that water in the desert. ""Today when the terrain was dry he gave us that breath of fresh air every time he had the ball."" But Belgium has talent of its own, a golden generation even. With genuinely top-class players such as Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Vincent Kompany in the squad, this was a quality of opposition Argentina had yet to face this tournament. Perhaps aware of this, the South Americans looked sharp from the off, backed by a considerable support in the stands, bouncing and singing in the early afternoon sun. A glorious Messi pass early on almost gave the fans something more to shout about, but Ezequiel Lavezzi's cross couldn't find Higuain in the center. However, the Napoli striker would not be denied shortly after. Kompany lost possession as he stepped out of defense and when Di Maria's deflected pass found Higuain, he swiveled to strike the ball in to the corner of Courtois' net from just outside the penalty area. It was a fine instinctive finish from a man who had failed to find the net all tournament before this game, and it drew him level with Messi on five World Cup career goals. Belgium sought a quick response. Kevin de Bruyne -- who netted the opening goal against the U.S. in the last 16 -- fired a shot high and wide from roughly 30 yards out after 13 minutes and once more shortly after which Sergio Romero did well to push away in the Argentina goal. Argentina suffered a blow after 33 minutes as Di Maria went down clutching his thigh. The Real Madrid winger looked in considerable pain as he left the field but was able to take a place alongside his teammates on the bench to watch the remainder of the game. Messi then went close from a free-kick just before halftime after the ever-unsubtle Marouane Fellaini had made four clear attempts to bring down the illusive striker. The second half began much like the first had ended, with Argentina carving out the better chances. Higuain nutmegged Kompany to put himself through on Courtois' goal but just when it looked like he was about to double the Argentine advantage, the crossbar came to the rescue of the despairing goalkeeper. Again Belgium looked to respond, bringing on Romelu Lukaku for the ineffective Divock Origi -- who in the group stage was the first teenager to score at a World Cup since Messi -- and Dries Mertens for Kevin Mirallas. With the Argentina defense being organized by the experienced pair of Martin Demichelis and Ezequiel Garay, the Belgians' best chance of success looked like it would come from a set-piece rather than open play. Fellaini made a nuisance of himself on numerous occasions, pushing, bullying and harassing as defenders at corners and free-kicks. However an inability to follow the offside rule repeatedly frustrated the Red Devils. Belgium hadn't scored a goal earlier than the 70th minute in this tournament but as the game progressed, coach Marc Wilmots became ever more desperate on the sidelines. ""We were not impressed by the Argentinians, they were just an ordinary team,"" said the former Belgium international. ""They can distort the rhythm, they take 30 seconds to take a throw-in and the referee doesn't do anything. If I played that way I would have been destroyed by the Belgium press."" Seeking a lifeline, Wilmots pushed veteran defender Daniel van Buyten -- likely playing his last game before retirement -- forward to operate as an auxiliary striker. But it was Argentina which came closest to scoring again, though Messi was unable to add to his 2014 tournament tally of four as the onrushing figure of Courtois blocked his dinked strike on the counter attack. Belgium scrambled forward one final time but when Axel Witsel's ambitious long range effort flew over, Argentina could celebrate.","Argentina defeats Belgium to reach World Cup semifinals .

"(CNN) -- It's nearly 200 years old, and people still come back for more. Ever since June 14, 1839, the quaint English town of Henley-on-Thames has been attracting spectators in their droves to its Royal Regatta. What started off as a small collection of boat races -- held over just a single afternoon on the River Thames near London -- has morphed into a five-day sporting and social extravaganza, where anyone who wants to be seen, attends. ""British people like the old charm of it -- its continuity, the idea, the past, comfort in a changing world,"" leading social commentator Peter York told CNN. ""All those thing that I call the 'Downton' things,"" added York, referring to the hit television show ""Downton Abbey,"" which has won a legion of devoted fans around the globe thanks to its depiction of Edwardian England. Like ""Downton Abbey,"" Henley lures visitors from both at home and abroad, reminding them all of an England of old -- the maiden regatta occurred two years into Queen Victoria's near 64-year reign over the country. Originally offering up just one trophy to rowers -- the Grand Challenge Cup, still today's biggest prize -- this month's 2014 edition boasted 20 different events on its 175th anniversary. The sporting aspect of the regatta, however, remains just one side of a rather lopsided coin. Along with the likes of Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and Wimbledon, Henley has a strict dress code if you want to gain entry. Lounge suits for the gentlemen and dresses -- ""with a hemline below the knee"" -- for the ladies is the order of the day. Should the rowing not suffice, a ""Champagne & Oyster Bar"" and ""Afternoon Tea"" are some of the other delights on offer to visitors searching for other distractions. ""The dress code is quirky and a bit quaint, but I think it adds to the atmosphere, and I love the flamboyance of the men's colorful blazers,"" says CNN's Milena Veselinovic, who attended Henley this year. ""When I first went it was like a window to another culture. ""It may not be representative of modern Britain, but it's a throwback to a different era and a chance to spend the day in the sun with your friends,"" added the Serbian, who provides an outsider's view of Henley. ""If you find that charming then you probably would go again,"" remarks York of Henley's ability to repeatedly draw crowds of thousands year after year. Henley's ability to retain that charm arguably separates it from Britain's illustrious horse racing and tennis showpieces. The English identity that lies at its very core has been kept intact, yet to be eroded away by multimillion sponsorship deals, around-the-clock television coverage and an A-list celebrity guest lists that its bigger, more glamorous rivals wear as a badge of honor. ""Henley is still relatively better preserved than the other events,"" York observes. ""The moment these things go on to full-on corporate, to full-on new-rich money, then they are spoiled and changed, and can never quite go back to how they were. ""That Henley is set on the river and hasn't got a horrible building adds to the charm,"" adds York, who is no fan of the Ascot Grandstand -- ""ugly and vulgar"" -- that was built in 2006. Henley's picturesque setting on the Thames, with an idyllic town as its backdrop, provides the event with its unique feel. Crowds line sections of the course, which at one mile and 550 yards (2,112 meters) is longer than the standard international distance of 2 km. They often witness two races simultaneously, while up to 90 can take place on certain days. To complete the program by a reasonable hour on such occasions, races are started at five-minute intervals, meaning action aplenty for spectators. ""It's clearly on the social calendar, but if you're actively involved in the sport it's the pinnacle of rowing, and a chance to see a world-class competition,"" says Alex Wood, a former junior Great Britain rower who has competed at Henley. ""It's something quintessentially British, and it has the feel of days gone past."" But while Henley's dream of ""Olde England"" is still alive and kicking, York suggests it's only a matter of time until the event follows in the footsteps taken by some of its rivals. In February, Ascot signed a five-year sponsorship deal with Qatar Investment & Projects Development Holding Company -- a company controlled by the Qatari royal family -- while the influence of foreign investment on British sport has been clear for all to see since Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003. ""They are being cherry-picked by rich foreigners,"" York says of traditional ""English Season"" events. ""It is an indication of what we are about. As Napoleon said, we are a 'nation of shopkeepers,' we'll sell anything to anybody. And don't forget, the Toffs (a slang term used to describe Britain's aristocracy) aren't in charge anymore. ""It's not new, but it's the scale of it. It's been happening since the very rich Americans came over in the 1890s, but they tried to fit in. ""These new people, though, are so rich and not bothered about trying to fit in."" York says the authentic ""Englishness"" of such social occasions has ""considerably diminished."" ""The people now look at things and say 'I want that one,' without thinking why. They are going to want it to work their way rather than the other way around.""","The Henley Royal Regatta has been going since 1839 .

"(CNN) -- It may not look special, but a modest 1950s ranch-style house in a suburban Bay Area neighborhood is now a protected historical site. The single-story house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is the family home where a young Steve Jobs built the first Apple computers in the mid-1970s. The Los Altos Historical Commission voted unanimously Monday night to designate the house as a ""historic resource,"" meaning any future renovations to the property will need to be reviewed by the city. ""The basis for this historic designation is not the age or architecture of the structure; it is with the property's association with an event and an individual of historic significance,"" city staff liaison Zachary Dahl wrote in a report to the commission (PDF). The house is now eligible to be named by the city of Los Altos as a historic landmark -- a higher-level designation -- and potentially listed on state and national registers of historic places. The faux religion of Steve Jobs . Jobs moved to the house with his foster parents as a seventh-grader and lived there through high school. In the attached garage, he and Steve Wozniak assembled the first 50 Apple 1 computers in 1976. The pair sold them to Paul Terrell's Byte Shop in Mountain View for $500 each. How Steve Jobs' legacy has changed . Nine months later, in 1977, Apple Computer Co. was formally established and moved its operations to nearby Cupertino. One of the original computers later sold at an auction for $231,000. Jobs went on to become a visionary who built Apple into the world's most valuable company and changed the face of computing. ""Steve Jobs is considered a genius who blended technology and creativity to invent and market a product which dramatically changed six industries -- personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing and digital publishing,"" according to the property evaluation. The three-bedroom, two-bath house was built in 1952 and is valued at $1.6 million, according to real-estate website Zillow. It's currently owned by Jobs' adoptive sister, Patricia Jobs.

No longer satisfied simply to moor their lavish vessels in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, an emerging market of jet setters are seeking unique voyages of exploration. And it's taking them to the ends of the Earth. ""You think a meal at a good restaurant in Monaco is memorable? Or a day at a St. Barts beach in the Caribbean is memorable?"" asks captain Ben Lyons, speaking by satellite phone from a ship currently cruising Finland's fjords. ""Watching a polar bear walk across the ice to your yacht. Or sailing past a three-mile-wide iceberg in Antarctica -- now those are once-in-a-lifetime experiences,"" says the chief officer of Eyos Expeditions, a company offering luxury journeys to destinations that time forgot. Rather than whiling away the days in the ""see and be seen"" playgrounds of the mega rich, these financial titans prefer to point their bows towards the most remote landscapes on the globe. The South Pole, New Zealand's volcanic islands, and Australia's river wilderness, to name just a few. And at up to $400,000 a week to charter one of Eyos' opulent boats equipped to handle these extreme locations, you will need deep pockets for these journeys. Enriching escapes . ""What we're really seeing is a trend for a lot more experiential travel -- people that want to do more, see more, learn more, and come away with an enriching experience,"" says Lyons.

Why would you do that, when you can actually be out there exploring on your own?"" For the wealthy holiday-maker accustomed to the most exclusive surroundings money can buy, these difficult-to-reach destinations offer the ultimate in elite escapism. Often the affluent adventurers must take a private jet simply to reach far-flung locations. Once on board, they can take a personal submarine out for underwater exploration -- ""they're essential toys on superyachts,"" explains Lyons. Of course, that's if they're not wandering among hundreds of thousands of emperor penguins in Antarctica, or watching traditional fire dancing by indigenous Papua New Guinea tribes. ""The places we go to are overwhelming. They are magical. They are awe-inspiring,"" says Lyons. ""For me, Antarctica is the most incredible spot on Earth. More than any other destination, it leaves people fundamentally changed."" For the crème de la crème of high society, these exotic journeys are also the ultimate dinner party conversation among guests who may have spent their summers moored in Monaco. Creature comforts . Unlike 20th-century polar explorer Ernest Shackleton, who was forced to endure frostbite, today's wealthy adventurers don't have to compromise on comfort on their adventures. Those choosing not take their own superyacht on the journey of a lifetime, can charter one of Eyos' luxury liners -- including a recently-converted, 71-meter Scottish Fishery patrol vessel. ""Enigma XK"" has been fully kitted out with opulent extras, including a gym and sauna -- hardly the Shackleton idea of ""roughing it."" ""With this sort of yacht you can do in one trip, what would take five years to do on a commercial cruise ship,"" explains Lyons. ""You have only 12 people on board -- not 200 other guests, so you can do exactly what you want and when."" If that means walking across an ice field at midnight under the moon, then so be it. Fancy jumping into an inflatable boat with humpback whales surfacing all around you? ""You can do it in a matter of two or three minutes,"" says Lyons. Educational experience . When money is no option, neither is the extent expedition staff are willing to go to cater to your every whim. Personal archeology, photography, wildlife and culture experts can be enlisted to add insider knowledge to the journey. ""Other people can go to remote islands in the Pacific,"" explains Lyons. ""But unless you can speak the language with the locals, unless you can really interpret what's going on and interact with the community in a meaningful way, you really lose out on a lot of the experience."" For children, it's a rare chance to experience Mother Nature's breathtaking extremes outside the classroom. ""Imagine the excitement of a kid watching a polar bear walking up to the yacht, or learning about whales, or cruising through Antarctica,"" says Lyons.

"(CNN) -- Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o has become a new critics' darling after her breakout role in last year's hit movie ""12 Years A Slave."" Since then, the award ceremonies and opportunities to dazzle photographers have been plentiful for Nyong'o, whose mesmerizing performance as Patsey earned her numerous accolades and recognition, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Though all this attention is new to Nyong'o, who was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents, the young actress seems to enjoy all the hype around her. But there is much more to her story than how she captivates the cameras on the red carpet. CNN's Stephanie Elam caught up with Nyong'o to speak about her journey from Kenya to Hollywood. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: How did you end up being born in Mexico? Lupita Nyong'o: My father is a politician. At the time he was also a professor of political science and he was organizing for democracy in Kenya. We were under an autocratic regime and after a series of unfortunate events, including the disappearance of his brother, he went into political exile in Mexico. I was born in his last year there. Read more: 10 things to know about Lupita Nyong'o . CNN: So you were born in Mexico but grew up in Kenya. LN: Yes, all my conscious memories are in Kenya until when I was 16 my parents sent me back to Mexico to learn Spanish. I grew up in Nairobi, which is the capital of Kenya, so it's hustle and bustle and there's always something going on. I come from a very big family and we're very close knit so I had lots of time with me family. My parents raised all of us to just pursue our hearts' desires. They were like ""figure out what your purpose is on this world and then do it and do it to excellence; no matter what it is, whether it's being a janitor or a doctor, as long as you're filling your life's purpose then we're good."" No pressure to pursue one thing or another, although I will say my father was very upset when I dropped physics though. Review: '12 Years A Slave' agonizingly magnificent . CNN: Not too long after you arrived to Mexico you decided to go to school in the United States. One of the things I read about was your discovery of race in America and how it's treated. LN: I grew up in a world where the majority of people were black so that wasn't the defining quality of anyone. When you're describing someone, you don't start out with ""he's black, he's white."" No, I was a girl, I was my ethnic group Luo, I was middle class, I was many things before I was black, so it was like a rearrangement when I came here and realized that in America that's the first thing that people notice about me. You don't hear that word, ""black, black"" very often in Kenya to tell you the truth, so that was definitely jarring. CNN: ""12 years A Slave"" is your first feature film. Where do you go inside yourself to play a role like that of Patsey with such generosity of spirit? LN: I don't believe that we are really as individual as we think we are and that's what makes the profession of acting possible -- that we can empathize with things that are more than our personal, limited experience. And I think that you do work and like Oprah [Winfrey] said to me, ""you let God walk in the door."" I think it's less about going into myself than opening myself; just opening myself to the research, the script, the autobiography, the other things that I read, the other things I saw and just trying to immerse myself in a world that I personally don't know -- but I know that my spirit does -- and can know if I allow myself to open up to it. There is something about acting that's mysterious and magical because there is only so much I can do to prepare and then I have to just let go and breathe and believe that it will come through. Because I think if I had been required to play Patsey in any sort of methodical way where I go in and I never go out until we wrap the picture, I don't think I would have survived emotionally because it's heavy. But having those moments of lightness and separation from the work we were doing on set was very important, even to fortifying our trust for each other while we were doing the work.. Read more: Have you seen the year's best film? CNN: How do you feel about all the hype surrounding you since you since ""12 Years A Slave""? LN: I didn't know how, and we all didn't know how the world would take this film. It's not easy subject matter. It's heavy but it's beautiful and you hope that people would at least open their eyes to see it -- and then they did. So my first feeling was relief that it had been so well received and then they just kept receiving it and celebrating it and the conversation has been developing and shifting; it's been so exciting and for me to be part of that celebration and my work to be lauded in all these ways has been amazing. And I've felt relief as well that people are registering Patsey's loftiness -- in praising me I feel like her spirit is being uplifted, really, because what I met in those pages of Solomon Northup's book was heartbreaking -- and it still breaks my heart -- and inspiring, and I had the privilege of bringing her back to life. I'm just happy and filled with gratitude to have had the experience in the first place and for it to be so well received.

"(CNN) -- Are these the worst working hours in world sport? Twenty days at a time working four hours on and four hours off, crammed onto a boat with seven crewmates, some freeze-dried food and one change of clothes each. Repeat for nine months, until you have crossed the globe. ""My family didn't want me to join this team,"" admits Liu Ming, who goes by the English name Leo on the boat. His teammate, Cheng Ying Kit, confides: ""Actually, I haven't told my family yet. They don't know I'm going to do offshore sailing."" Leo and Kit are fighting to join an experimental boat for one of sport's toughest events: the Volvo Ocean Race. When the race begins, in October, the Dongfeng Race Team will be China's first meaningful attempt at offshore sailing. The route will take the crew from Spain around Africa to the southern coast of Asia, on to New Zealand, beneath South America to Brazil, then back across the Atlantic to Sweden. There are only seven places available on the boat, manned by French skipper Charles Caudrelier, and Chinese hopefuls have endured months of testing and training. Hundreds initially applied â€” most had some sailing knowledge but none had the experience expected of an ocean race competitor. Even so, 20 applicants were selected. Twelve reached the second phase and now a handful remain. Selectors kept the top applicants awake for 40 hours at a time, giving them task after task, replicating the demands they may face as a small crew, alone in a storm. Some left after that experience. Some walked away once the real sailing began. Novelty segments . ""We did a big, real test offshore and one of our best guys decided to stop. He said it's too hard, too long,"" recalls Caudrelier. The 40-year-old was part of the team which won the last Volvo Ocean Race and is now making his debut as skipper. He faces a race against time to prepare crew members from a country where sailing is barely known. In China, the big sports include football, basketball, table tennis and badminton. A fishing nation? Yes. Sailing as a sport? No. Chinese companies have sponsored boats in the past and, recently, individual Chinese sailors have won an Olympic title and crossed the globe, yet the sport remains in its infancy. ""They had a few novelty segments on Chinese TV, where they would stick a reporter on a boat for a day. And China has one Olympic sailing champion in Xu Lijia,"" explains Mark Dreyer, founder of the China Sports Insider blog. ""But no-one would recognize her on the street. Very, very few people would know her name."" Caudrelier's Chinese recruits hope to make their names in one of the world's most treacherous sporting endeavors. The team manager, Bruno Dubois, has personal experience of the worst the race can offer. Dubois, 54, skippered a boat in the 1989-90 ocean race. In just one leg of that race, rival boats had seven crew members swept overboard: one died. As racing progressed, some boats hit whales and others capsized. Earlier in June, as the Dongfeng crew crossed the Atlantic for the first time, they themselves almost struck a whale. ""So close, we could hear it breathing,"" reported Caudrelier from the boat. ""I have that in my mind all the time,"" says Dubois, ""knowing we are bringing the Chinese along. ""I know it's going to be hard and I don't want to finish the race with something dramatic like what happened in 1989."" Communication problems . Though the Chinese hopefuls all have some sailing experience, they are offshore novices and will be paired with experienced team-mates, mostly French, for the race itself. Safety is paramount, but tricky: language is proving a barrier. All of the crew, French and Chinese, must speak English as their common tongue, and one or two are struggling. ""Communication is a big problem,"" admits Caudrelier. ""Two of the Chinese sailors don't speak English. They are having English lessons, every day we try to improve their English."" Dubois adds: ""We have decided that when all the Chinese are together, if there is one non-Chinese person at the table, they have to change to English. Same with the French, which is really hard for them, too. ""Each time you fail, you have to put 50 cents in a box. We'll use the money for a big party."" Caudrelier warns: ""Everything is in English -- the rules, everything. If they want to play the game, they have to speak English. For Dongfeng racing it will be a problem of safety if we don't manage to solve this."" So why do it? Why take a group featuring inexperienced sailors, some of whom have trouble communicating, on such a daunting feat of endurance? ""Chinese Dongfeng, Global Dongfeng,"" reads the slogan of the boat's backer, a commercial vehicle manufacturer. For them, the chance to send a Chinese crew to the Volvo Ocean Race is a matter of global prestige. ""Twitter and Facebook are blocked in China, yet they are on the team's website,"" notes Dreyer. ""It's definitely very western. ""A lot of Chinese companies, from a business perspective, are trying to go global. ""Look at Huawei [the Chinese telecoms company]. They have sponsored a ton of different football teams across Europe, to make them look impressive in the eyes of the Chinese public because they were involved in international sport."" More challenges . For the sailors, both French and Chinese, the motivation is a rare chance to bring their sport to a new frontier. ""I feel more than just a responsibility,"" says Dubois. ""It wakes me up sometimes at night, and I know Charles Caudrelier is the same. Because we have, in 10 months, tried to do what people have done in 10 years and it's not easy. ""If we can show the public that 40% or 50% of our team is from China, the next time it will probably be 80%. They will learn more and more. The challenge for us is to bring some legacy in China for offshore sailing."" Leo says, through a Chinese interpreter: ""The sport of sailing has just started in China. As Chinese, what we need to do is to take more challenges, and to participate in more this kind of race. ""I think there will be lots of Chinese sailing teams joining international sailing in the future, so we must find the best way to do it at the beginning."" Leo will find out if he has made the team on June 26, while the race begins in Alicante on October 4. ""My big fear is not being good. Not being competitive,"" admits Caudrelier, who won aboard the Groupama boat in 2012. ""I hope we win some legs at least. For sure, it's more complicated because we have the Chinese aspect and we have to teach them. ""But I think, if we want to win, the story will not finish at the end of this race. Dongfeng want to do the next three Volvos and have more Chinese on board, maybe a Chinese skipper in three years' time. We have to continue the job."" Kit says: ""It's not scary. We really want to take the challenge. ""We know it's tough, we know it's dangerous, we know we'll have to take risks. But that's the game."" Learn: Why size really matters in the yachting world .

"(CNN) -- It was only fleeting and came amid a Scottish extravaganza of pop performances, dancing teacakes and a giant replica sea monster, but there was no mistaking its message. During the opening ceremony of the 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, actor and singer John Barrowman planted a kiss on a male dancer, before dragging him to the altar for a mock wedding. It was a move intended to remind millions of viewers that homosexuality remains a crime in 42 of the 53 Commonwealth member countries. The kiss won broad support on Twitter, though Barrowman retweeted negative comments with the retort: ""I am retwtin the neg because I want u all to see how bitter and Nasty and Neg some people r:) I am so happy right now. Jb"" Queen Elizabeth II made a less controversial appearance, declaring the competition open ahead of 11 days of sport, headlined by a cameo appearance by the fastest man on the planet Usain Bolt. Britain's monarch read out a message that had been kept hidden inside the Queen's baton during its parade and relay around 70 nations and territories in the last nine months. ""To you, the Commonwealth athletes, I send my good wishes for success in your endeavors,"" Queen Elizabeth told the athletes. There was also a minute's silence, led by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, for the 298 people who died in the Malaysia Airlines MH17 flight disaster, 82 of whom were from Commonwealth nations. The Malaysian team also carried its flag at half mast on entering the Celtic Park stadium where the ceremony took place. A capacity crowd of 40,000 were treated to a festival of dance and music with a strong thread of Scottish culture and heritage. World famous Scottish singers Rod Stewart and Susan Boyle also performed live, while former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar made appearances on video clips to highlight a UNICEF fund raising initiative promoted by the Games. Biggest cheer of the night was reserved for the 310- strong team representing the hosts, the last of the 71 to be paraded, with judo player Euan Burton carrying its flag. Six-time Olympic gold medalist Bolt was not at the opening ceremony but has been picked for Jamaica's all-conquering 4x100m relay squad. Bolt is slated to step out at the 40,000-seater Hampden Park stadium on Friday week for the heats of that competition, likely minutes after Mo Farah runs in the 10,000m final. The pair's antics on the final day of track and field competition at the 2012 London Olympics, where Bolt emulated Farah's famous ""Mobot"" celebration are still etched in the memory and Games organizers will be hoping for a similar iconic moment. The warm glow of home success in the London Games, personified by double gold medalist Farah, has left the British public still hungry for multi-sports competition and ticket sales for the Commonwealth Games have been strong. It means there will be no repeat of the half-empty stadiums which blighted the previous Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010 and left organizers facing criticism over the damage to India's reputation and the cost. The British royal family have been closely identified with the Commonwealth Games since its inception in 1930, originally titled the British Empire Games for nations and territories ruled and administered by the United Kingdom. In recognition of decolonization, by the 1970 edition in Edinburgh, Scotland's other major city, the title of the event had been changed to the British Commonwealth Games and by 1978 in Edmonton, just the Commonwealth Games. Scotland has hosted the Games three times, Edinburgh in 1970 and 1986 and now Glasgow, who fought off competition from Abuja in Nigeria to be awarded the right. Over 4,500 athletes will take part in 17 sports, in terms of countries and territories participating, 71, the second biggest event of its kind after the Summer Olympics. Unlike the Olympics, British athletes compete for their home nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, while there are also teams from the small islands of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. Cyclist Mark Cavendish, who is one of a number of big stars to suffer injury blows ahead of the Games, was due to compete for the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency in the Irish sea. Cavendish's withdrawal after his crash in the Tour de France was a blow to organizers, but compensated for by the decision of 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins to ride for England in the track cycling event. Aside from Bolt and Farah, the highlight of the track and field competition will be the appearance of Kenya's David Rudisha, who smashed the world record in the 800m in taking gold at the London Olympics, but has been troubled by injury since his triumph. Some of the most intense competition will be in the swimming pool where traditional power Australia is expected to dominate -- with Alicia Coutts leading the way. Coutts won gold at the 2012 Olympics and 21 medals for her country in major championships over the past four years, including five golds at the Delhi Games. Scottish hopes rest with Michael Jamieson, who is heavy favorite for the 200m breast stroke, while the hosts could earn early success in the track cycling with 20-year-old Katie Archibald. She will attempt to compensate for the absence of six-time Olympic gold medalist Chris Hoy, who announced his retirement last year having originally intended to end his career at his home Commonwealth Games. In his honor, the velodrome in Glasgow is named after Scotland's favorite sporting son and the action there will start Thursday with Wiggins in the team pursuit. Competition, particularly between ""old foes"" Australia, the leading medal winners in the history of the Games, and England, is set to be particularly fierce. But, by tradition, they have been called the ""Friendly Games"" -- with competitors enjoying the more informal settings compared with the hot house atmosphere of an Olympics. The closing ceremony will take place at Hampden Park where the baton will be handed over to Gold Coast in Australia, which is hosting the 2018 Games. There is a political dimension, with the Games take place against the backdrop of a referendum in September where voters in Scotland will be given the chance to gain independence from the rest of the United Kingdom. Salmond's Scottish Nationalist Party has been campaigning strongly for a ""Yes"" vote, but he has promised not to link potential home success as an argument for separation. ""I've taken a kind of self-denying ordinance to concentrate on the Games over the next 10 days and I think that's what the people of Scotland want,"" he was quoted Wednesday. Whether politicians on both sides of the argument stick to their pledges is open to question, but what isn't in doubt is the enthusiasm of the Glaswegian residents for the Games, which will highlight their regenerated city to an estimated television audience of 1.5 billion people.","Queen Elizabeth 11 opens 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow .

"(CNN) -- Cricket Australia has trademarked the term ""63 not out"" in an attempt to prevent people cashing in on the death of its Test batsman Phillip Hughes. The 25-year-old Hughes died after being hit on the head by a ball in a domestic match in Sydney last month. He had reached the score of 63 runs when the tragic accident occurred. His untimely death stunned the sporting world and the scheduled first Test between Australia and India in Adelaide had to be postponed as his teammates struggled to cope with their grief at his passing. Tributes on social media initially centered around a campaign #putyourbatsout on Twitter as thousands of people photographed cricket bats in unusual places to mark their respect for Hughes. But 63 not out also became an iconic symbol of the batsman's life and when the first Test eventually took place, spectators were asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause before the start. Australian players reaching that score during their innings also marked its significance with gestures and many in the crowd wore T-shirts or held up signs with 63 not out featured. However, cricket authorities in Australia and Hughes' representatives have become concerned about the volume of unlicensed memorabilia, mostly clothing and stickers, and the use of online auction sites to promote the various offerings. Cricket Australia said the agreement was purely ""defensive"" to prevent others trying to exploit Hughes' memory. ""CA registered the trademark in conjunction with Phillip's management to prevent others trying to exploit Phillip's memory,"" a spokesperson told CNN. ""There was some evidence of that starting,"" it added. The entire Australia-India series has been played out with continuous reminders of Hughes. The Australian team is wearing shirts with the number 408 stitched in. Hughes was the 408th player to represent his country in Test matches, the highest level of international cricket. Australia's players, especially those closest to Hughes, have also produced inspired performances against India, taking a 2-0 lead and dominating the Third Test which started on Boxing Day in Melbourne. Stand-in captain Steve Smith reached his Test-best 192 on Saturday as the home team posted a formidable first innings of 530. He was supported by innings from Brad Haddin (55), Mitchell Johnson (28) and Ryan Harris (74) as Australia scored quickly against the Indian bowling attack. India fought back to reach 108 for one wicket by the close, but its chancing of winning the match and attempting to square the four-match series is effectively over.","Cricket Australia trademarks term ""63 not out""

"(CNN) -- How do you get a foot on the property ladder, when you live in one of the most expensive cities in the world? For an increasing number of first-time home buyers like Sandra Reddin, the answer doesn't lie on land -- but in the water. ""Doing the washing-up with swans floating by your window -- I love it,"" says the 55-year-old, who bought a houseboat earlier this year. In a city where $1 million will buy you a mere 25 square meters in prime central real estate, Londoners are turning to the labyrinth of waterways silently snaking their way through the metropolis. Centuries ago, these gently rippling canals were used to transport cargo -- a floating highway bustling with barges and connecting towns across the country. Now the narrowboats which heaved goods up and down the UK have become homes for those struggling to get a foothold in the third most expensive real estate market on the planet. While a house in Narrow Boat Close, a street in leafy south-east London, will set you back an average $350,000, an actual narrowboat costs around a quarter of the amount. Those looking to take the plunge can expect to pay anywhere between $3,000 and $250,000 for a canal boat in the English capital -- and it's not the only European city utilizing its waterways. With Paris property prices rivaling that of London, houseboats along the Seine may be a more affordable option for those determined to reside within eyesight of the Eiffel Tower. In nearby Amsterdam, pavement life spills onto the intricate network of canals, home not just to residential boats, but a huge array of hotel vessels, and the world's only floating flower market. Canal costs . But is life afloat really as financially attractive as it seems? Alan Wildman, of the UK's Residential Boat Owners' Association, pours cold water on the idea. ""People move on board thinking it's a way to get on the housing ladder -- which is absolute nonsense,"" says the 64-year-old, who lives on a narrowboat with his wife. ""It can be cheaper than living in a house. But when you consider all the other components of life afloat that go with it ... people can very quickly become disenchanted."" Long-term moorings in London can be over $30,000 a year -- ""and that's just for somewhere to hang your boat,"" adds Wildman. Unlike real estate, houseboats decrease in value, he said. If you're thinking of taking the plunge, it has to be for love -- not money. River romance . That said, stepping aboard Reddin's elegant 13-meter houseboat ""Happy Days,"" it's easy to see the allure of life on the river. Inside, the wooden vessel is bigger than you'd expect, boasting a wood fire, fully kitted-out bathroom, kitchen, and double bedroom. A golden afternoon light bounces off the water, streaming in through the long narrow windows. Though relatively roomy, I still manage to knock my head on the low door, ungracefully exiting onto the decking for a sunset sip of wine. ""It's a very neat little operation,"" says Reddin, nodding towards the compact home, where everything has its place. The photographer bought her $124,000 boat a few months ago, seeing it as an affordable way to live in the heart of the city, while constantly change the view out her window. It now bobs in desirable north London's Regent's Canal, an area where waterfront properties regularly have million-dollar price tags. The mother-of-two was paying $3,000 a month to rent an apartment in another part of north London when she decided to give it up for life on the water. ""You've got all these different noises,"" she says. ""Little ducks landing on your roof, the lapping of the water, and when it rains, it's just amazing."" Tough love . Reddin is under no illusions that boat-living isn't all smooth sailing -- particularly come winter. ""I'm quite a gung-ho, intrepid type. I think you need to be for this lifestyle,"" she says. Wildman offers a reality check: ""Imagine you're out on the canal and you're iced in, and your toilet tank is getting full, and you've got to cruise half a mile to get to a pumping-out point. ""You've got to take the rough with the smooth."" If you want to live on board, you also need to be prepared to cut out any excess, says Nathan Rogers, manager of dealership NarrowboatShop.co.uk. ""You have to be disciplined in terms of your living space and how you utilize it,"" he warns. ""But this also leads to a streamlining and simplification of everyday life."" Close quarters . In such a confined space, is it possible to bring up a brood of scampering children? ""It means you have to get on with each other,"" says Wildman, who has seen many families happily grow up on the water. ""If you've got to get children to school, you need a continuous mooring permit,"" he adds, which is more expensive than current regulations requiring owners to move every two weeks. There are around 30,000 to 40,000 people living on boats in the UK, estimates Wildman. He describes a tight-knit floating community where neighbors look out for each other. ""It's very much like old England,"" he says. Though in modern times, people are getting on board for very different reasons. Learn: Size matters -- how big is your yacht?

"(CNN) -- Natalie Westling should be soaking in the last vestiges of her teenage years. For her, that would mean bringing out the vert ramp after school and skateboarding until dark. These days, the only thing she's boarding is another flight to Europe. This Fashion Week season, the 17-year-old model is being dogged by phrases like ""it girl"" and ""one to watch"" that are being tossed around by industry insiders. This week, she's across the pond in London walking for Jonathan Saunders and Giles and will soon be off to Fashion Week events in Milan. These appearances come on the tail of spring ad campaigns for high fashion houses Saint Laurent and Red Valentino. ""Every job that I get, I feel so honored,"" she said. ""Because yes, there are so, so many models that would die to be in my position on that set, doing that shoot."" But the Arizona-born teen wasn't always so keen on the idea of modeling, despite her mother's urging that she had something rare, that elusive je ne sais quoi. ""I was such a skater, tomboy girl that I was like, 'that will never be me,' "" she said. ""I was definitely anti-girly girl, makeup, fashion, all that."" Less than two years ago, fate stepped in wearing stilettos: Westling was scouted in her home state by the Agency Arizona. Shortly after, a representative from the Society, now her agency in New York, came out to scout her for a bigger market. Last summer, Westling was flown out to New York to try her hand at Fashion Week. But, as the end of the week approached, she hadn't booked a single job. ""It was like, 'OK, I don't know anymore, nothing is really working out,' "" she said. Then, she got the call for the Marc Jacobs ""exclusive"" -- meaning she would open the show. It's the fashion equivalent of a high school baseball player getting the call from the Yankees. Fast-forward five months, and the laid-back skater girl says that modeling, however unlikely, is her focal point. (Though she does, admittedly, get antsy after a while getting her hair, makeup and nails done and redone for each show.) ""People think we stand in front of a camera for 30 seconds and that's our day,"" she said. ""In actuality, we work really, really hard, and a lot of the money we earn, we earn it."" For her, that means shape-shifting from 17-year-old tomboy to high fashion archetype. Westling, who describes her natural hair color as a ""dirty blonde, auburn mix,"" first dyed her mane a shocking ""Little Mermaid"" red for the Marc Jacobs spring 2014 ad campaign, which also just happens to feature controversial star du jour Miley Cyrus. ""I think it's cool. It's perfect to be able to stand out,"" she said. With her neon tresses, Westling walked in shows for Prabal Gurung, Vera Wang, Anna Sui and Marc Jacobs during this month's New York Fashion Week. ""A lot of (designers) were surprised. A lot of them didn't like it, but I didn't really care,"" she said. ""When it comes to certain shows, obviously, this color wouldn't match the clothing, and it wouldn't look good, so I understand getting canceled for shows or not getting picked for shows."" That tinge of teenage rebellion is working for Westling, who is in high demand. Her breakout success comes at a pivotal time, as New York legislature passed a bill in November that deems models under 18, like Westling, child performers. Among the stipulations: Models must obtain a permit to work in the state, employers must also be certified to employ the young models, and child performers must get 12 hours of rest between jobs. Still, Westling is growing up fast in the high-stakes fashion world. ""You drop off the teenager side of you and just go full-force into modeling and make it into a career and pursue it for a while,"" she said. It's a work ethos she credits to being raised by older parents, who still live in Arizona: Her mother had her when she was 43. ""My teenage years were like when I was 10,"" she joked. ""It helps me in this industry, because you have to act mature, take responsibility for yourself, because no one else will.""

"(CNN) -- Looks like your iPads and Mac will be getting freshened up in time for the holiday shopping season. Apple on Wednesday sent invitations to media members for next Thursday under the headline, ""It's been way too long."" Last October, Apple unveiled the thinner and lighter iPad Air and a revamped iPad Mini. The company also used the event to roll out its then-latest Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks. It also updated its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops. But Apple's desktop Mac line hasn't gotten a thorough update since June 2013. Most Apple analysts expect to see new Macs at the event, which will be held at Apple's Cupertino, Calif., campus. There's also been talk of a bigger iPad, coming a month after the rollout of bigger iPhones. Some reports have predicted an ""iPad Pro"" with a massive 12.9-inch screen.","Apple announces October 16 event .

"(CNN) -- If anyone here feels Ron and Hermione should not be united in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace. Well, guess who's got a problem -- seven years later. Author JK Rowling, the woman who dreamed up the pair and turned them into two of the most recognized figures in literature, is now throwing cold water on the central romance in the gazillion-selling Harry Potter series. Rowling now says she should have paired Hermoine Granger with Harry Potter, instead of his bud Ron Weasley. And then she delivers this punch to the gut of Ron fans everywhere: . Ron and Hermione would have needed relationship counseling. What the what??!! Rowling makes her disclosure in an interview that Emma Watson conducted with her for the entertainment mag, Wonderland. (Watson, of course, played Hermione in the film adaptations of the Harry Potter books.) The Wonderland issue doesn't come out until Thursday. But Britain's Sunday Times published excerpts of the interview in a front-page story, ""JK admits Hermione should have wed Harry."" ""I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really,"" Rowling says in the interview. ""For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron."" ""I know, I'm sorry,"" she adds. ""I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not."" And what did the fictional Mrs. Weasley have to say about all this? She agrees! ""I think there are fans out there who know that too and who wonder whether Ron would have really been able to make her happy,"" Watson says in the interview. Say it isn't so, howled Potter fans on Mugglenet.com (which bills itself as the world's No. 1 Harry Potter site). ""WHAT??? I am heartbroken!,"" commented someone named ""ana."" ""Ron and Hermione's relationship is wonderful because it is FAR from perfect at the beginning of the series and slowly (and ingeniously) develops into my favorite couple in the whole series! I could go on for days about why I love them."" But the we-told-you-so side also came out in force. ""Hermione deserved someone better. Ron would have been insecure and it would not have been a healthy relationship,"" said a commenter who goes by the name ""militant delusionalist."" ""Harry had always said good things about Hermione and both of them being powerful wizards and brought up as muggles would have made them compatible."" Hermione meets Ron in the first book of the series, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" when he and Harry save her from a mountain troll. We learned of the pair getting hitched in the epilogue of the seventh and final book -- ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" published in 2007. The couple even have two kids, Rose and Hugo. And they lived happily ever after? Not quite. Not even before Rowling delivered this latest bombshell. Two years ago, she said she once considered offing Ron altogether. ""Funnily enough, I planned from the start that none of them would die. Then midway through, which I think was a reflection that I wasn't in a very happy place, I started thinking I might punish one of them off. Out of sheer spite,"" she says in a conversation with Daniel Radcliffe for the DVD extra feature for ""Deathly Hallows."" (Radcliff, of course, played Harry in the movies.) ""In my absolute heart of hearts of hearts -- although I did seriously consider killing ... Ron."" 'Harry Potter' play coming to British stage . Rowling returns for more in Potter's world .

"(CNN) -- The violence and bloodshed on the streets of Kiev has left Ukraine on the ""brink of catastrophe,"" according to one of the nation's most famous sons. Sergey Bubka, a man known across the world for his record-breaking exploits as a pole vault champion, has been left shellshocked by the scenes in his home country. From Sochi, where he is trying to salvage the spirit of Ukraine's athletes at the Winter Olympics, Bubka has watched on in horror as anti-government protestors clash with police. ""I couldn't believe that has happened in my country,"" the 50-year-old, who is head of Ukraine's Olympic Committee, told CNN in Sochi Thursday. ""Ukraine is so nice and the country is beautiful. We are kind, we are friendly and have shown outstanding hospitality in many events. ""In this moment, I cannot believe it. We cannot go against each other. We need to understand each other. ""We must listen. We must go back to dialogue, save the peace, save our Ukraine and save our nation. "" A fragile truce crumbled Thursday as gunfire erupted at Independence Square, where the anti-government protests have been taking place. The head of the protesters' medical service told CNN that at least 100 people have died and 500 were injured. The Ukrainian government has not released an updated figure, but the interior ministry said earlier that one police officer was among the dead. ""The reaction is really shocking,"" added Bubka. ""It's difficult to say something because we love our country and our people. ""We saw some moves to take the situation in a better direction but then suddenly the real violence started. ""We're really sad at what has happened and our team has expressed condolences to the victims who died. We want both parties to settle down and stop this. ""We have to try to start the dialogue again because we would love to see peace."" The pictures being broadcast across the world have led to shock and condemnation with Bubka and the nation's athletes struggling to come to terms with the events. Also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Bubka held a meeting with his country's 43 athletes in Sochi. The team held a minute's silence instead of wearing black armbands following discussions between the team and the IOC. However, two members of the team withdrew Thursday in a show of solidarity with the protesters in Kiev. Alpine skier Bogdana Matsotska and her father and coach, Oleh Matsotskyy, made a joint announcement on Facebook. ""As members of Ukraine's national Olympic team, we are extremely indignant at latest actions by President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, who has drenched Ukrainians' last hopes in blood instead of resolving the conflict with Maidan (anti-government protesters) through negotiations, which we had hoped he would when we left for Sochi,"" they said. ""This was the violation of the old principle of the Games -- the Olympic Truce. In solidarity with fighters on the Maidan barricades and as a protest against lawless actions made towards protesters, the lack of responsibility from the side of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games."" Bubka, who spoke with both athlete and coach before their decision was announced, admits that ""it is not an easy time to compete."" But he is adamant that Ukraine can be brought together by success in Sochi and through ""sporting and Olympic values."" Bubka, who won gold at the 1988 Summer Games, has put his hopes in the women's biathlon team which has a great chance of a medal in Friday's 4x6 km relay. ""We need this,"" he said. ""We need this and we pray for that. ""We discuss with them to give them confidence and eliminate pressure from sport and situation at home. ""We tell them we love them and believe in them. 'Do what you do every time. It's your time and it's your day. We need this.' ""We want to show to everyone that Ukraine exists and is united through sport and Olympics.""

"(CNN) -- At long last, Maria Toorpakai Wazir can indulge her life's greatest love without fear of persecution. Hounded out of the notoriously dangerous tribal region that borders Pakistan and Afghanistan -- once referred to as ""Hell's door knocker"" -- salvation has been found thousands of miles away on a different continent. She survived death threats, spent countless hours alone in her room and masqueraded as a boy for years. And all for her love of squash. Now Pakistan's number one female player, who is ranked 53rd in the world, is homing in on her quest to become the best female player in the world, under the tutelage of Jonathon Power, the Canadian star whose name was inscribed on the first racket she ever owned. It is a fairytale story that has taken the 22-year-old a world away from a treacherous existence in the mountains of Pakistan, to Power's academy in Toronto, and morphed her into an agent for social change in her native country. ""I think positive and I do positive so I think people in Pakistan need to be educated, need to take part in sports and skills so they have high integrity, high self-esteem and so they use energy in a positive way,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""They will start holding rackets and bats rather than holding guns and grenades. I don't want militancy or Talibanisation -- I just want a brighter future for all the kids. I don't want them to end up as suicide bombers."" Growing up in South Waziristan provided Wazir with a crash course in conservatism, a prevalent theme in a territory with a reputation for fierce tribalism. ""It was an area in between mountains and mud houses and as it was 100 or 200 years ago,"" she explained. ""The girls are deprived of all those basic rights. They stay inside the home and get married off at a young age. ""My whole family was different to the rest of the people in the area -- you could see the progress, the different mindset -- but they were still living in the Stone Age. ""They had no awareness about education or any health or exercise, or women's rights or child's rights. They didn't know how any education can be important for one person as a human."" Exasperated at the barriers placed in front of her, Wazir took drastic action aged just four, burning all her dresses, putting on her brother's clothes and shearing off her long, dark hair. ""My dad believes that it is your choice and your right to live the way you want,"" she said. ""He laughed and he gave me a boyish name Genghis Khan, the greatest warrior in the history of the world. He said 'So, we have a fifth son, and his name is Genghis Khan.'"" However for Wazir and her family, domestic tolerance came at a price. In a society cloaked by repression and inequality, even being seen unaccompanied in public could be perceived as a betrayal of her culture and Muslim religion. And the liberal attitude of her father, Shamsul Qayyum Wazir, who encouraged his wife to continue her education and allowed their daughter to play outside with her brothers, was contradictory to the prevailing attitude of ultra-conservatism. So much so that he family decided they'd had enough after a campaign of intimidation that included the stoning of the family house, attempts on their lives and an imposed spell in an asylum for the father. The family moved to the city of Peshawar -- another Taliban stronghold -- where Wazir's scrapes intensified, with one scuffle leading to a head injury that required 12 stitches. Realizing she needed to channel this aggression, her father enrolled her in weightlifting classes at a local sports club, keeping up the pretense she was a boy. Wazir went on to win a junior weightlifting championship, but she also grew fixated on squash, having seen it played on her breaks from training. She earned a place at a squash academy run by the Pakistan Air Force, though she had to reveal her true identity to the director. Such was his delight at seeing a girl enraptured by squash he donated a racket to Maria bearing the name of Jonathon Power -- who won 36 top level events during his 15-year career at the top of the sport. But as word spread of her emerging talent, the anonymity Wazir had reveled in for so long evaporated. ""Attitudes changed, they started bullying but I used to find a way,"" she explained. ""I used to go early in the morning when there was no-one in my way. ""I used to repair those balls that were bad and torn in the squash court that guys used to throw away with tape and glue."" Taliban's unwanted attention . A steady improvement in her game led to appearances in high profile tournaments and prominence in the Pakistani media. Awards from then president Pervez Musharraf and prime minister Shaukat Aziz were a mark of her pioneering spirit, but they also attracted the Taliban's unwanted attention. ""It was exhausting at every step,"" she said. ""It was hard to let people know all I want is to play squash. That's how I can live happy but I had to change my life with time. ""For the last eight years I've been trying hard to come through to the common people and today I'm getting threats from Taliban. I was totally exhausted. I didn't know what to do. ""I stopped going to the academy because it's the biggest dishonor if a daughter is kidnapped. That's (why) I locked myself in my room and started hitting from evening to morning."" Her absence was noted and when she relayed the threats she'd received the issue was debated in parliament, who reacted by beefing up security around her. ""They put so many attack posts on the way to the squash court and around the squash court too,"" she said. ""Above the squash court they put snipers. ""I was going once a week or twice a month but at that time I completely stopped because if a bomb happened -- there is so much glass in the squash court itself -- it would kill the innocent kids. ""I didn't want it to be the reason so I stopped going and started playing in my room for three-and-a-half years."" It was during this time Wazir says she knew she had to leave Pakistan to follow her dream. ""My dad said 'If a baby bird wants to learn flying, he has to leave the nest' and at that time I realized I cannot learn flying while am here. ""For three-and-a-half years I didn't get any email from anyone and one day I got an email back from Jonathan Power saying that he's going to help me, support me, teach me how to play squash so I can play at tournaments and become a world champion for Pakistan."" Power himself was sent to London as a 12-year-old to train with former Pakistani world champion and all-time squash great Jahangir Khan, and was immersed in the culture of Khan's country, traveling to play there on many occasions during his career. Wazir's plea struck a chord with Power, who flew her to Toronto and has since been working on building her strength and stamina, and molding the rawness of her technique into a formidable weapon. ""I recognized right away this girl is special, she's very courageous girl and I wanted to help,"" said Power. ""She'll run through that wall 10 times until she finally breaks it. She thinks working hard just means killing your body and you'll get better, but sometimes you have to work smart. ""It's so rare to find somebody who has so much drive and so much passion, who is just dying to absorb knowledge. I think she's going to make it to number one in the world. ""She knows it's going to take a lot and she's prepared to sacrifice whatever it takes. I think she has the skills and the mental ability to make it all the way."" Building bridges . As for Wazir, her ambition to be the finest player on the world is now allied to a desire to campaign for other young girls in Pakistan to have the freedom to explore sport. ""I feel the luckiest person and I think whether my hard work turned me into being lucky or if I am the chosen one to bring change to the world,"" she said. ""I learned it's more about humanity. It's not about religion, it's not about culture or caste or tribe or where you're from or the value of the background of the person. ""It's all about being a human. I learned a lot and squash taught me. Through squash I made it and learned otherwise I'd be stuck in those tribal regions. ""I want to create bridges between east and west, friendship between country and country, family to family and people to people. It's all about brotherhood -- sharing knowledge, skills, helping each other and sharing love and care for each other.""","Pakistani Maria Toorpakai Wazir battled Taliban persecution to indulge her love of squash .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- Why does Sochi 2014 matter? It's a question worth asking given we're thick into the action of the 22nd Winter Games. Maybe you're debating whether to engage, considering the need to consume, or assessing why you should pay attention to the festival of winter sports taking place in Russia? If so, maybe these 10 reasons will warm you to the event that just loves to be in the cold: . 1. Volunteers' view: . Sarana, Ksenya and David - Sochi 2014 unpaid workers: ""Russia could really use a reputation boost, its doors are open. This has been such a great opportunity for us, I'm from Holland (David) and I'm from the far east of Russia (Sarana), so it's been great to come together and to meet so many new people, to meet new friends."" 2. Athlete's view: . Dow Travers, skier Cayman Islands: ""I think it matters because of the camaraderie of the nations who come together and compete in events where human effort prevails, it's all about human spirit. It's a great honor to represent my country and there's a great sense of pride when everyone back home sees the Cayman Island flag. It proves that things can be accomplished even if you're from a small Caribbean island."" 3. Organizer's view: . Anthony Edgar, head of Media Operations, International Olympic Committee (IOC): ""If we went back to the bid and look at what Sochi presented, with the breakup of the Soviet Union we had a country which had won more Olympic medals than any other nation that all of a sudden had nowhere to train. They had to hold their own national championships in other countries! ""The Russians said they planned to bring world-class facilities back to Russia, to build a university in Sochi, so athletes could train in the best way and help them become the premier nation in winter sports once again, and they would do this regardless of whether they won or not. You look at the Park now and the university that's been built and they've come through on every one. That's why I think it's important."" 4. Athlete's view: . Susanna Tapani, women's ice hockey player, Finland: ""It's my first Olympic Games so I'm very excited to be competing on the biggest stage there is for sport! In Finland everyone watches the coverage but women's ice hockey is not that popular at the moment, so this will really help to inspire people to get interested in the sport and to take more notice."" 5. Press view: . Helene St. James, sports journalist, Detroit Free Post: ""I think it's great, just like it was with Beijing, when a fairly opaque country gets cast into greater transparency. I think there's been a lot more attention on human and gay rights in Russia. They haven't been able to hide because of all the attention the Games brings from all of the world's media. ""It matters because Russia will feel it helps the way they'll be perceived but there are also other governments and human rights organizations that will be hoping the attention will help change internal issues for the better."" 6. Athlete's view: . Ekaterina Lobysheva, speedskater, Russia:  ""I'm just so happy that we have an Olympic Games in my country. The last time we hosted was in Moscow in 1980 but that was the summer version. ""Sochi is the first time we've hosted the winter version and I think this will be vital to help popularize the kind of sport I participate in across my country. We used to be very good in these disciplines but did not always have the places to train or to compete in, but now we do!"" 7. Spectator's view: . Daniel Pressberger, school teacher, Los Angeles U.S.: ""It's about peace and getting together with a bunch of people, being out and about, being alive, getting up off the couch and doing something. I've only been to 14 Olympics and so far I think Sochi is great, the people are very nice, things are either finished or nearly finished. I have no hotel issues because I'm staying with a family here. ""It matters because ... if you can get away from where you are and go somewhere else, it's better to do something than stay home and do nothing -- get up and do something!"" 8. Sponsor's view: . Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's global chief brand officer: ""Sport is one of the great convening powers in society. Our association with Sochi 2014 allows us to bring access to the event to our customers. Sport crosses boundaries and there are very few truly global opportunities, but the Olympics is absolutely one of those. ""We do business in 120 countries and the reality is that all those countries participate in the either the Summer or the Winter Games. We want to be relevant to our consumers and we see the interest, country by country, in the Olympics as a democratizing force. ""Aspire to being the best, being inclusive, doing things in the right spirit -- the Olympic ideal has that ethos running through it and we feel that's a spirit we share. If it matters to our customers it matters to us. 9. Athlete's view: . Anna Gasser, women's slopestyle snowboarder, Austria: ""It was the best feeling just to compete even though it didn't work out the way I wanted (Gasser finished 10th in her event despite being a pre-final favorite). It's the first year that slopestyle has been part of the Olympics and everyone knows it's a dream come true if you can go to the Games and compete against the best in your sport. ""It really mattered to me to represent my sport and to fight it out with the best girls. A lot of people wonder, 'What is this sport? Sliding on rails and getting hurt a lot?' but now it is getting popular. They even showed it live in Austria, which is traditionally skiing heartland!"" 10. All-out action: . Ben Wyatt, CNN reporter in Sochi: Few sporting tournaments combine the danger, death-defying heights, break-neck speeds and requirement of bravery like the Winter Games. From the ski jump, to the skeleton, bobsleigh to the speed skating, puck slap shots to snowboard acrobatics this is about athletics exaggerated by its environment and climatic context to amazing effect. ""Nearly every event is laced with adrenaline. Even if you're not a sports fan, can you really stay unmoved by the audacity and adventure shown by the competitors?

"Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- A 26-year-old woman who had registered to take summer classes at Santa Monica College died Sunday from wounds she suffered in a shooting spree Friday that left four others, including her father, dead. Marcela Franco was with her father, Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, in an SUV on campus when they were shot. She was going to buy textbooks at the time. Carlos Navarro Franco died; Marcela Franco was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Relative Alfred Creollo told CNN Sunday that Marcela Franco had died. College President Chui L.Tsang also confirmed the death. ""Her family was with her by her side,"" Tsang said in a message to the school community. ""Our deepest sympathies go to the Franco family. At the appropriate time, the College will convene a campus-wide memorial."" The school has created a fund honoring the Franco family. The suspect in the shootings has been identified by Santa Monica police as John Zawahri. Authorities say he killed his father, Samir ""Sam"" Zawahri, and brother, Chris Zawahri, in a Santa Monica house before carjacking a woman and firing at a public bus on Friday. How to help the family . Scant details are trickling in about Zawahri, who was killed by police at Santa Monica College on Friday -- the day before his 24th birthday. The superintendent of the Santa Monica-Malibu school district said Zawahri attended a high school for students behind in academic credits in 2006. ""We are shocked and deeply saddened by the tragedy that ... once again, shatters our nation's confidence,"" Superintendent Sandra Lyon said. Police had contact with the Zawahri in 2006, but because he was a juvenile, authorities couldn't release further information, Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that the gunman had suffered from mental health issues. A few years ago, he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone, according to the official. It's not clear whether the state government or his family committed him for treatment or whether he committed himself. It's also unclear under what circumstances he was released. Authorities have found no link to domestic or international terrorism, the official added. The gunman and a family member had been enrolled in Santa Monica College as recently as 2010. Source: Santa Monica gunman previously hospitalized for mental health . Authorities believe the house was set on fire before Sam and Chris Zawahri were shot. The 13-minute shooting spree that followed spanned several parts of Santa Monica. One of the five people killed was shot outside the library of the school, college Police Chief Albert Vasquez said. That woman's name has not been released. The assailant dressed in black and carried an assault-style rifle. Seabrooks estimated the gunman had about 1,300 rounds of ammunition during the rampage. Because he was wearing a ballistic vest and was heavily armed, ""I would say it's premeditated,"" she said. His apparently random gunfire became the nation's latest disturbing killing spree, ending with his death in the college library and leaving this tourist beachfront city reeling with shock. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive in the shootings that also left four people wounded. iReporter: There was a body on the corner . Neighbors' stories . Jerry Cunningham stepped onto her porch when she heard the shots. She saw the gunman firing at a neighboring house that was on fire. She then saw the gunman force a woman to stop her car at gunpoint. Another car approached. The gunman waved it by, Cunningham said. That driver, also a woman, hesitated for just a moment, and the gunman ""fired three shots directly into her and the car,"" Cunningham said. The motorist was wounded in the shoulder, she said. Authorities said that driver was hospitalized and is in stable condition. The gunman then got into the first car and forced the woman to drive off with him, police said. During their ride, 911 calls poured in, keeping police on the gunman's path, Santa Monica police Sgt. Richard Lewis said. As the car headed toward the campus of the community college, where 30,000 students are registered, he opened fire on a passing bus, slightly wounding three people, Lewis said. He was carrying an ""AR-15 style rifle,"" pistols and more clips for the rifle, Lewis said. As the car pulled onto the campus, the man fired into Franco's red SUV, killing him and critically wounding his daughter, police said. Franco's vehicle crashed after the shooting. The gunman then abandoned the hijacked vehicle -- leaving the driver unhurt -- and ran, shooting at police, Lewis said. Inside a classroom . Jasmine Franco, 22, was in a classroom at Santa Monica College -- next to the library -- waiting for her English class to start at noon on Thursday. Little did she know that the gunman began his rampage at a house close to where she lives with her mother, Carmen. Jasmine Franco's friend had left the room to fill his water bottle, and she was sitting alone when she first became aware something was wrong. ""You could hear rumbling, a lot of rumbling,"" she said, describing the sounds of gunfire mixed with the stampede of people running. ""It sounded like an earthquake or something,"" But her 11 classmates and the teacher appeared oblivious and continued their banter until her friend burst back in. ""His whole face was red and his veins were coming out of his neck. ""I'm entirely serious,"" Franco recalled him saying. ""There's a shooter on campus."" He told the class he had heard a gun unload. ""He said it just sprayed and unloaded tons of rounds,"" Franco said. Not knowing what to do, ""We just sat there."" The teacher left the classroom to see what he could learn and, moments later, ran back inside. ""He says, 'They just unloaded a magazine.'"" With the exception of the gunman's father and brother, all of the other shooting victims were apparently chosen at random. CNN's Stan Wilson reported from Santa Monica; Michael Martinez reported from Los Angeles; Josh Levs reported from Atlanta; Susan Candiotti, AnneClaire Stapleton, Cheri Mossburg, Sonya Hamasaki, Tom Watkins, Chelsea J. Carter and Traci Tamura also contributed to this report.","Marcela Franco, 26, has died, a relative and a college president say .

"(CNN) -- Few games seem so well suited to the mores of the modern sports fan as rugby sevens. With quick-fire matches, end-to-end action and points galore, the speeded-up, pared-down version of rugby union satisfies a 21st-century urge for smaller, faster, flashier fare. A newcomer to the sport might reasonably conclude that the game -- seven-a-side, seven minutes each half -- was the result of a recent refashioning of the 15-man sport, but it traces its roots back to the late 19th century. English public schoolboy William Webb Ellis is famously credited with inventing the game of rugby itself in 1823, but the abbreviated version was the brainchild of a butcher from Scotland called Ned Haig. When his local rugby club in the town of Melrose was casting around for ideas to improve its ailing finances, Haig, together with his boss at the butchery, David Sanderson, came up with an idea that would change rugby forever. Recalling the moment some years later, Haig said: ""Want of money made us rack our brains as to what was to be done to keep the club from going to the wall, and the idea struck me that a football tournament might prove attractive, but as it was hopeless to think of having several games in one afternoon with 15 players on each side, the teams were reduced to seven men."" Sevens rugby kicks off . On April 28, 1883, Melrose Football Club hosted the world's first sevens tournament at its Greenyards ground. Hundreds of spectators turned up to cheer on the home side as they did battle with six teams from neighboring Scottish Borders towns. Fittingly, it was the Melrose team, which included Haig, who went on to win and receive a silver cup donated by local ladies. Barring two interruptions for war, the ""Ladies Cup"" has been presented to the winning team every year since, keeping up a proud tradition and ensuring a place on the world sporting map. ""Rugby is very much part of the community,"" Melrose RFC marketing director Douglas Hardie told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. ""It's very much an integral part and is the social hub of the town. I think if you mention the name Melrose anyone, certainly in the western world, will have heard of it and it's primarily down to the fact that rugby sevens were founded here."" Haig died in 1939, aged 80, long before the game really took off. Its success would have confounded him, Hardie thinks, as it does the town's 1,600 inhabitants. ""In fact, we have to pinch ourselves,"" he says. ""You have to bear in mind that we don't own the game of rugby sevens, we are merely its custodians to pass down to future generations so they can enjoy it as much as we have."" It wasn't so much a passing down as a spreading of the message in the years following the first sevens tournament. Twelve months later, neighboring Galashiels organized its own event and soon sevens tournaments were a being held all over the Scottish Borders and further north in Edinburgh. English audiences got their first taste of the game in 1926 when London-based Scot Dr. J.A. Russell-Cargill organized the first Middlesex Sevens at Twickenham. Sevens goes global . With the ""auld enemy"" persuaded, the task now was to convince rest of the world. Rugby-playing Commonwealth nations -- New Zealand, Australia and South Africa -- were early adopters as the game spread steadily in the decades following World War Two. But it wasn't until 1973 that the first international sevens tournament took place as part of the Scottish Rugby Union's centenary celebrations. Seven countries and a President's VII took part, with England beating Ireland 22-18 in the final at Murrayfield in Edinburgh. Two decades later at the same venue, 24 nations contested the inaugural Rugby Sevens World Cup -- and an unfancied England team won again, beating Australia 21-17 in final to lift the Melrose Cup. Fiji, led by sevens legend Waisale Serevi, took the title four years later as the tournament moved to Hong Kong. The South Sea Islanders repeated the feat in 2005 to become the first team to win the trophy twice -- a mark matched by 2001 winners New Zealand in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium earlier this year. While the 2013 event didn't attract the spectator numbers that organizers had hoped for, the general trend is of a steady growth in ticket sales. ""What we have noticed is the change gradually over the years,"" says Hardie. ""Melrose sevens was purely for rugby aficionados a few years ago, but that has now changed to a degree and it is perhaps getting to be as much of a social event as it is a sporting event."" Perhaps the best example of this is the Hong Kong Sevens -- a three-day jamboree held every year since 1976 where a mix of beer, body paint and fancy dress costumes provide a noisy and colorful backdrop to action on the pitch. Olympic dreams . Away from the alcoholic haze engulfing the Hong Kong Stadium, Hardie offers a sober assessment of the game's ongoing appeal. ""Rugby sevens now is a sport played by athletes,"" he says. ""They are much fitter, much stronger -- it is a faster, more entertaining game. Someone who perhaps is not a rugby follower can come along to a sevens tournament and enjoy it."" Participation continues to grow, notably so in the U.S. where rugby union is currently the fastest growing sport. More than one million people (a third of them women) play rugby at some level, according to the International Rugby Board. Turnstiles are also ticking over nicely in the U.S. with last year's Sevens World Series event in Las Vegas attracting 64,000 spectators, the country's record rugby crowd. But it is an invitation to the world's biggest sporting occasion in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 that has got everyone in rugby excited. The announcement by the International Olympic Committee in October 2009 that rugby sevens, along with golf, would be included in both the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics has provided the sport with a priceless boost. The 15-man game was actually played in the early editions of the modern Olympics -- founder Pierre de Coubertin was a fan of the sport's spirit and ethics. So, it seems are today's IOC members. ""It's mind-blowing,"" says Hardie. ""Considering where it started from, to now look at it as a worldwide Olympic sport is quite unbelievable."" From a butcher's shop in Scotland to the top table of international competition, rugby sevens looks like it will be serving up many sporting feasts for decades to come.","Rugby sevens started in the Scottish Borders town of Melrose in 1883 .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's announcement that the United States will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba is great news for those of us who looked at the 50-year-old embargo as an ineffective foreign policy relic. Not only will moves such as expanding commercial sales and exporting goods and services to the island of 13 million people create goodwill with a country just 90 miles away, it will create more U.S. jobs and allow Cuban cigar aficionados to come out of the closet. It is also an important countermove to the advances made by Russian President and geo-political agitator Vladimir Putin. In addition to his annexation of Crimea and invading the Ukraine earlier this year, Putin has quietly been re-establishing Russia's ties with Cuba. Ties that were severed because the Soviet Union was no longer able to be Cuba's Sugar Daddy following its collapse in 1991. Sitting back and holding on to a failed foreign policy strategy while Putin got reacquainted with our neighbor off the coast would not be a smart move -- even if Russia's economy is in shambles. In short, there are a lot of practical reasons why this historic announcement makes sense. And while there will certainly be critics pointing out what the deal with Cuba does not contain -- such as removal of the Castro regime -- it is important not to limit discussion about our relationship with Cuba to one family's ascendance to power. After all, Fidel Castro did not just appear in a vacuum. We created him. Or rather we foolishly nurtured the environment in which someone like him could rise to power. That's because before Castro there was Fulgencio Batista-- and he, unfortunately, was our guy. Batista authorized the killing of 20,000 of his own people to stay in power, according to a speech by Senator (soon to be President) John F. Kennedy in 1960. He was a man, who, when on the cusp of losing an election, led a military coup and abolished democracy to keep power. A man who stole hundreds of millions from his own people, denied dark-skinned Cubans an education, forced them to work as indentured servants on white-owned sugar plantations and used the weapons we supplied him to quash any movement that would challenge his corrupt government. So before Sen. Marco Rubio and others talk about Castro, we should talk about how the United States called Batista an ally and friend much in the way we called Egypt's corrupt president, Hosni Mubarak, an ally and friend. The way we supported Iraq's now-disgraced prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki. The way we propped up oppressive dictatorships such as Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay and the Dominican Republic's Rafael Trujillo. In Batista, the U.S. shamelessly backed someone who viciously oppressed his citizens because he protected our interests. In the 1960 speech, Kennedy noted ""at the beginning of 1959 U.S. companies owned about 40 percent of the Cuban sugar lands -- almost all the cattle ranches -- 90 percent of the mines and mineral concessions -- 80 percent of the utilities -- and practically all the oil industry - and supplied two-thirds of Cuba's imports."" In short, we pillaged the land and then became indignant when Castro sided with our enemy, Russia. Here we are decades later, Cubans are once again hurting economically because of our actions...should we sit back and allow an anti-U.S. sentiment to encourage Cuba to side with Russia once again? Or do we look at our history and learn from it? When we talk about the embargo, and the Cuban Missile Crisis and evil dictators, let no U.S. policymaker whitewash our role. When President Obama's critics demand we seek some say in Cuba's future leadership ask them about our history of picking leaders for other nations. And when Cuban exiles talk about the land Castro stole be sure to ask them why was life so good for them under Batista, a man Kennedy said led ""one of the most bloody and repressive dictatorships in the long history of Latin American repression."" As, I said earlier, Castro didn't appear in a vacuum. None of which is meant to defend the horrific human rights violations committed by his regime in the years following the Cuban Revolutionary War. I have spent weeks in Cuba and have heard the stories about Batista and Che Guevara from those who lived through the bloodshed. Who whisper about Castro's barbaric firing squads for fear that the wrong person may overhear. I spoke with people who quietly run restaurants out of their homes, fearing one night government officials will come to seize what they've worked so hard to build. The people I spoke with love their country...but they love our freedom. They desire our freedom. And clearly this 50-year-plus embargo has not led to them obtaining this freedom. We've managed to do business with other communist nations without viewing it as a threat to national security. We've managed to do business with other nations accused of gross human rights violations without questioning our own morality. And the Russia that provided so much angst during the Cold War is nowhere near the geo-political juggernaut it was when the embargo went into effect in 1960. Cuban neighborhoods are peppered with incomplete construction projects, a byproduct of the lost financial support after the 1991 collapse of the USSR. Libraries I visited have dilapidated roofs and are starved for current books. Tourists from Europe and Canada are greeted with opened arms. And here we are, 90 miles away, trying to pretend everything was OK until Castro showed up when we know that was not the case. A local in Havana told me when Batista was in power, the poor with physical disabilities were treated like pariah and sometimes killed when young because they couldn't work on the sugar plantations. The following week in Santiago de Cuba, I noticed a Castro quote on a sign that read ""La grandeza de un estado se mide por la forma en que brinda attencion a los discapacitados"" which roughly translates to ""the greatness of a country is measured by how it treats its disabled."" Again, I'm not saying Castro is a misunderstood angel. I'm saying our conversation about U.S.-Cuba relationship does not begin with him. Acknowledging the mistakes we've made that helped to taint our relationship with our neighbor may put us in a bad light. But it may also shed light on this foreign policy hamster wheel we're on, where we characterize a bad person as a good one just because we picked them. And not for naught, it may stop Putin from placing a thorn closer to our side.","LZ Granderson: US-Cuba rapprochement is a huge breakthrough .

"(CNN) -- Three young women are dead and two are in serious condition after being crushed by a crowd at a Halloween party in Madrid early Thursday, police said. The women were among thousands of attendees at ""Thriller Music Park,"" an event at Madrid Arena that featured electronic music artists and a costume contest. There was a stampede in an arena hallway that connected the main dance floor to another area, police said. The five women, between 18 and 25 years old, were the only ones hurt in the incident, an ambulance spokesman said. Four of the women, including the three who died, are Spanish. The nationality of the other injured woman is unknown. Police are investigating whether someone set off fireworks in the hallway, the spokesman said. Thousands of partygoers were unaware of the stampede until after police arrived and began moving people out slowly. American electronic musician Steve Aoki was headlining the party. Aoki released a statement Thursday saying he was ""devastated"" by the deaths and injuries. ""The safety of my fans has always been my top priority and had I known that there was any distress putting people in jeopardy within the venue I would have ended my show immediately,"" Aoki said in the statement, adding that he was canceling a subsequent show in Bilbao, Spain, ""out of respect for those who lost their lives and those who are injured.""","Five women were crushed in a stampede at a Halloween party .

"(CNN) -- I still remember the chill that came over me the day my middle school history teacher showed the class a documentary about the Holocaust. Millions of Jews were systematically isolated, corralled and eventually murdered by the Nazi regime. It's a horrible blemish on the history of mankind, one that is rarely brought up lightly. It's one that is recognized in museums, dramatized in film and taught in middle schools like the one I went to nearly 30 years ago. And yet, despite my continuous exposure to the retelling of the Holocaust, it wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I learned Hitler had also isolated, corralled and murdered gay men and lesbians during this time as well. Right now I can hear the voices ask: What does it matter? I had graduated from high school before I learned some of the greatest voices during the Harlem Renaissance and civil rights movement -- Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Bayard Rustin -- were members of the LGBT community. It was in graduate school when I first heard the name Harvey Milk. I was a working journalist before I was told about Dave Kopay, the former NFL running back who came out in his 1977 autobiography, ""The Dave Kopay Story."" And now the chorus of voices ask: So what? Over the years, I am proud to say I have amassed a decent personal library. Most of the books are about history: presidential biographies, wars, social justice movements. And yet, it was only this week -- thanks to longtime civil rights activist David Mixner -- that I learned Congress once debated passing a law forcing gay men to wear tattoos and corralling those who were HIV positive into internment camps. Yes, just like the Jews. Just like the gay men who were next to those Jews in Nazi Germany but have since disappeared from our history books. It is here where the cynic wonders: Who needs to know? With the overturning of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the sweeping changes in marriage equality, the presence of open LGBT people working in the White House, on TV, even in professional sports, there may be some who believe the heart of homophobia no longer beats. Much in the same way others believed the burning of bras slayed sexism and the election of President Barack Obama was racism's death knell. One of the most powerful CEOs on the planet has announced he is a proud gay man, and while I may be hesitant to characterized Apple's Tim Cook proclamation ""brave,"" it is nonetheless important. He is here. Just as Hansberry and Rustin and Milk were there -- working for the greater good, changing the course of global history, woven into the fabric of humanity. The voices may ask: What difference does it make? Let the absence of LGBT people in our retelling of our history be the reply. For if being gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender truly did not matter, why then must we fight to have our contributions recognized? Why then, when California became the first state to require our stories be included in the history books, was it met with resistance in 2011? That conservative state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly described the day the bill was signed into law ""sad"" as if simply learning that a group of people existed infringed upon his Constitutional rights. To be honest, Cook's announcement is no great shock to anyone who has been paying attention to the rumor mill. But by owning his truth in such a public fashion, Cook is not only rebuking the tendency many LGBT baby boomers still have to hide, but he is also refusing to allow his silence to render him hidden. When the middle school history teachers speak of him, they will have his full story to share. Going forward, chants of ""who cares?"" will accompany nearly every person of note who chooses to come out publicly. Even among LGBT people, shoulder shrugs will not be that uncommon, as if debates about internment camps happened in the 1880s and not the 1980s. Yes, the country is different, and being gay is no longer shocking. But it is a mistake to confuse that progress with Cook's announcement having no importance. For far too long, the story of the LGBT community has been scrubbed from our education, contributions erased and existence relegated to the poorly lit corner of bookstores under the banner ""Alternative Lifestyle."" We are not a ""lifestyle."" We are a people, and we were there. And we are here.","LZ Granderson was an adult when he learned gay people were also Nazi victims .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Jubilant Libyan rebels in Benghazi erupted with fireworks and gunfire after the U.N. Security Council voted Thursday evening to impose a no-fly zone and permit ""all necessary measures"" to protect civilians. The opposition, with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units, has suffered military setbacks this week. It has said such international action was necessary for it to have any chance of thwarting Moammar Gadhafi's imminent assault on the rebel stronghold. ""We're hoping and praying that the United Nations will come up with a very firm and very fast resolution and they will enforce it immediately,"" said Ahmed El-Gallal, a senior opposition coordinator, before the vote. ""We should not arrive too late,"" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said at the U.N. The resolution was approved with 10 votes, including those of the United States and the United Kingdom. There were no opposing votes on the 15-member council, but China, Russia, Germany, India and Brazil abstained. Germany said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict. U.N. member states can ""take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force,"" according to the resolution. Moments after the vote, anti-Gadhafi forces in Benghazi broke into cheers, waving flags and chanting. Antiaircraft tracer fire lit up the sky at one rally. It was not immediately clear just how an international military operation and possible strikes against the Libyan military might unfold. The no-fly zone prohibits Libya's air forces from entering certain zones within the country. The United States and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours, according to an administration official familiar with planning. President Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone, the official said. The contingencies include air strikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish military units leading Gadhafi's push on opposition strongholds in the east, the official said. Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy after the vote. The three ""agreed that Libya must immediately comply with all terms of the resolution and that violence against the civilian population of Libya must cease,"" the White House said in a statement. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim, speaking in Tripoli, told reporters after the vote that the country will safeguard civilians and its territorial integrity. He called on the international community to send a fact-finding mission to the African nation but not lend material support to rebels. A few dozen pro-Gadhafi supporters chanted, ""Down with the U.N.! Down with Britain! Down with the United States!"" The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone alone as sufficient to stop Gadhafi. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing a zone would take ""upwards of a week."" U.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would not halt the heavy artillery the regime is using on the ground. Gadhafi's son Saadi told CNN Thursday evening that troops will change their tactics and take up positions around Benghazi Saturday or Sunday and assist people fleeing from the city. The younger Gadhafi said there will be no large-scale assault. Instead police and anti-terrorism units will be sent into the rebel stronghold to disarm the opposition. Unspecified humanitarian groups can help with the exodus of civilians from Benghazi, Saadi Gadhafi said. In a radio address aired on Libyan state TV, Gadhafi criticized residents of Benghazi and called them ""traitors"" for seeking help from outsiders. The Security Council resolution condemns the ""gross and systematic violation of human rights, including arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture and summary executions."" It details enforcement of an arms embargo against Libya, the freezing of assets and a ban on most flights. ""The United States stands with the Libyan people in support of their universal rights,"" said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice. The resolution deplores the use of mercenaries by Libyan authorities, expresses concern about the safety of foreign nationals and demands an immediate cease-fire. Kaim said the Gadhafi government supports a cease-fire, but is working out certain details. The Arab League's U.N. ambassador, Yahya Mahmassani, said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation, but he was not sure which two. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Arab League will be critical to the response to Gadhafi, and that he will travel to the region ""to advance our common efforts in this critical hour."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the U.N. vote shows the need for Libyan citizens ""to have a more representative government."" Earlier Thursday, Libyan state TV said Benghazi would soon come under attack. Gadhafi said that his forces would enter the city to rid it of those ""traitors"" and that his forces will search everyone for weapons. He added that his forces gave amnesty to those who gave up their weapons in the city of Ajdabiya. ""We will not allow further bloodshed among Libyans,"" Gadhafi said. ""Search for the traitors, for the fanatics. Show them no mercy. We will look for them behind every wall,"" Gadhafi said. ""This farce cannot go on."" There were air strikes on Benghazi's airport Thursday, with three blasts hitting the site about 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) outside the city. The opposition has been using the airport to launch its own air strikes, using a handful of jets that rebels have managed to get off the ground, opposition leaders said. It is not clear that Gadhafi's ground forces are actually within striking range of Benghazi, but they have been fighting their way in that direction for several days. State TV claimed Thursday that Gadhafi's forces were in control of Ajdabiya, on the road to Benghazi, a claim disputed by opposition leaders. El-Gallal, speaking from eastern Libya, said ""morale is high"" and people do not want to leave strongholds because Gadhafi ""is willing to kill everybody here."" The government forces have taken control of the eastern and western gates to Ajdabiya and are trying to breach the inside, opposition leaders said. The opposition says it controls the southern entrance. The opposition says it has a handful of jets that are no match with Gadhafi's superior air power and a pair of Russian-made ""Hind"" attack helicopters. Ajdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi. If it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces, it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition's base. In remarks to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William Burns, the under secretary for political affairs at the State Department, said Gadhafi's forces are only about 160 kilometers outside Benghazi. ""They've made advances, taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military firepower,"" Burns said. He expressed fear that Gadhafi, now isolated by the world community, could turn to terrorism again. ""I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground, that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well: The danger of him returning to terrorism and violent extremism himself, the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region,"" Burns told the committee. CNN's Arwa Damon, Nic Robertson, Tommy Evans, Elise Labott, John King, Alan Silverleib, Raja Razek, Jennifer Rizzo, Joe Vaccarello, Yousuf Basil and Reza Sayah, and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","President Obama calls French, British leaders .

"ZAM ZAM DISPLACEMENT CAMP, Sudan (CNN)  -- Sudan's Darfur crisis has exploded on many fronts -- violence, hunger, displacement and looting -- but United Nations peacekeepers say the biggest issue now affecting the region is the systematic rape of women and children. UNAMID police officer Ajayi Funmi, left, educates Darfur women about rape. Thousands of women as young as 4 caught in the middle of the struggle between rebel forces and government-backed militias have become victims of rape, they say, with some aid groups claiming that it is being used as a weapon of ethnic cleansing. ""That is one of the biggest issues in Darfur: the rapes, and crimes against women and children,"" said Micheal Fryer, police commissioner of UNAMID, the United Nations peacekeeping force deployed to try to tackle the violence. Relief workers say they are powerless to stop the attacks and say that if they do speak out, they fear that the Sudanese government will tell them to leave the country. Humanitarian group Refugees International said in a report last year that rape was ""an integral part of the pattern of violence that the government of Sudan is inflicting upon the targeted ethnic groups in Darfur."" Some relief workers say that almost every woman living in aid camps has been raped or become a victim of gender-based violence. Many teenagers, while out running errands such as collecting firewood, are raped multiple times by militiamen, the workers say.  Watch women face dangers in Darfur » . They say the situation has now become so bad that many women are now resigned to rape as a way of life and men are unwilling to accompany them because they fear that they will be killed if they try to defend them. But despite the extent of the abuse, the Sudanese government insists there is no problem, adding to the difficulties faced by the victims, who are often ostracized by their communities or fall afoul of a legal system seen as favoring their attackers. iReport.com: Share your photos, videos of Darfur . ""There is no rape in Darfur,"" said Mohammad Hassan Awad, a Humanitarian Aid Commissioner for West Darfur, who accuses foreign aid workers of persuading people in refugee camps to make false claims. Although few aid workers dispute the extent of the attacks against women, they say survivors are unwilling to come forward. But those who do reveal shocking levels of abuse. ""She said they removed their scarves and used it to tie them up and were taking turns to rape them. One is 13 years old; the other one is 16 years,"" Ajayi Funmi of the UNAMID police, who is trying to educate women, said after talking to two girls. Making matters worse, aid workers say scores of babies conceived through rape are being dumped by their mothers. ""Abandoned babies are reported, but because of the stigma attached to it, there is no detailed report, because the women don't come forward,"" said Dr Naqib Safi of the U.N. children's body UNICEF. As many as 20 babies a month are being dumped in one camp of 22,000 people. With U.N. officials calling for more female officers to better educate women against rape and women saying they won't feel safe until the under-equipped and undermanned United Nations force is strong enough to protect them, the situation shows little sign of improving.","Women and girls as young as four face rape on daily basis in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- It started with a haircut. The year was 1960, and Bela Guttmann sat in his chair at the local barber's shop. Guttman, one of the most iconic football coaches of his day, had just led Portuguese club Benfica to the European Cup and achieved legendary status. But that was not enough for him -- he wanted more. While pondering his plans, a gentleman in the next chair, who happened to be visiting the country as coach of touring Brazilian side Sao Paulo, let Guttmann in on a little secret. He told the Hungarian about ""A Pantera Negra"" -- the man they were calling ""The Black Panther."" A legend had begun to spread from Mozambique about a young player plying his trade with a youth team in the African country's capital, now known as Maputo, with links to Benfica's great rivals -- Sporting Lisbon. The son of a white Angolan railway worker and a black mother from the Mozambique community, Eusébio da Silva Ferreira was the name on everybody's lips. Guttmann took no chances -- Eusebio's mother had already turned down the advances of Italian club Juventus, so he made the family an offer they could not refuse. The financial incentive worked and the player joined Benfica, much to the dismay of Sporting officials, who had dallied in their pursuit of the player. The rest, as they say, is history -- and what a history: 733 goals in 745 matches confirmed Eusebio's status as one of the all-time greats. As Portugal said goodbye to one of its most famous sons Monday, following his death at the age of 71, thousands took to the streets to farewell a man who had brought joy and inspiration to a generation as the government declared three days of mourning. ""As a man, he was quite humble, kind and very down to earth,"" said CNN's Duarte Mendonca, a Benfica supporter who was in Lisbon for the funeral. ""He had a tremendous amount of love for his club Benfica, for whom he served as an ambassador. ""I've seen fans from various clubs, including longtime rivals, paying homage to a man they've learned to respect for his talent and flair, but also for his personality. ""Only a man such as Eusebio would be able to unify fans in such fashion. That says a lot."" During an illustrious career in which he won 11 Portuguese league titles, five domestic cups and a European crown, Eusebio became a legend of world football. From the moment he entered national consciousness by helping Benfica retain the European Cup in 1962, where he scored twice in a thrilling 5-3 final win over Real Madrid in Amsterdam, the country began to fall in love with the man from Mozambique. His incredible acceleration and lethal right foot helped him take Benfica to the very top of the European game, while he was honored as the continent's best player by winning the Ballon d'Or in 1965. But it was at the 1966 World Cup that he became worldwide sensation as he produced a series of performances which brought adulation from from across the globe. His nine goals, the most by any player at the tournament, helped Portugal reach the semifinal where it was beaten by the host nation England, which eventually went on to win the tournament. Such was Eusebio's impact that Inter Milan reportedly offered the striker 40 times his salary to lure him away from Benfica and even approached his wife to sign the contract on his behalf. The move was scuppered, however, in rather bizarre circumstances though, as Portuguese Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar refused Eusebio permission to leave the country. Instead, Eusebio remained at Benfica, scoring goals and helping his side reach the 1968 European Cup final, but this time losing to Manchester United at Wembley after extra-time. It was in that contest that Eusebio's sportsmanlike qualities shone through. With the game tied, Eusebio had the opportunity to win the contest but when his effort was brilliantly saved by United keeper Alex Stepney, the striker simply stood and applauded. It was a gesture which would not be forgotten. That same year, he won the European golden boot as the continent's top goalscorer -- a feat he repeated five years later. After leaving Benfica in 1975, Eusebio moved across the Atlantic to play in the U.S. before retiring in 1980 following ongoing problems with his right knee. He continued to work in football as an ambassador for Benfica and Portugal's national side, meeting with high-profile players on European match nights and attending global tournaments on a regular basis until his death on January 5, 2014. He left behind his wife Flora and their two daughters. ""I think he is immortal,"" Chelsea's Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho told state broadcaster RTP. ""We all know what he meant for football and especially for Portuguese football. ""He was not only a great inspiration but also an important figure in upholding the values, principles and feelings of football, even after finishing his career."" Eusebio's status as Portugal's greatest football player was confirmed by the thousands who flocked to watch his coffin paraded through the streets of Lisbon. His statue, which stands proud outside Benfica's Stadium of Light, is adorned with scarves, flowers and banners from fans across the globe. ""I was the best player in the world, top scorer in the world,"" Eusebio once said. ""I did everything, except win a World Cup."" That he did not win one does not detract from the impact he made on Portugal and on football around the world. Within moments of the news breaking that he had passed away following a heart attack, the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo were paying tribute to ""O Rei"" -- the King. In Lisbon, despite the rain, fans continued to line the streets to say farewell as the black hearse moved slowly through the streets. ""Even though my generation didn't see him play, through archive we were able to witness some of his brilliant skill,"" added Mendonca, who grew up listening to tales of Eusebio. ""But even better than that, we were able learn about what he meant as a footballer and person through the stories of our parents and grandparents. ""The way that he exploded on the pitch, with his fast pace combined with the power of his right foot, was simply unreal. His attributes could easily make him a star even in today's game."" Though he may now have passed away, Eusebio's legacy remains. A trailblazer who overcame poverty and early hardship in Africa to become one of the game's most talented and recognizable faces. It would appear that in barber shops in Lisbon, they'll be talking about Eusebio for many years to come.","Eusebio, 71, died from a heart attack, former club says .

"(CNN) -- Critics lashed out Wednesday against the Federal Aviation Administration, which extended its ban on U.S. airlines' flights to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. Calling the decision a ""mistake,"" Michael Bloomberg -- who arrived in Israel on El Al, Israel's national airline -- praised Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport as most secure airport on Earth. ""The real world is that there are things going on near airports all over the world. Ben Gurion airport, because Israel has been threatened since it was formed in 1948, is the most secure airport,"" the former New York mayor told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""You have to take reasonable precautions but you cannot shut down everything just because one terrorist someplace on the other side of the world says I'm going to be a threat,"" he said. The ban now runs through 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday. The FAA said it is ""working closely with the government of Israel to review the significant new information they have provided and determine whether potential risks to U.S. civil aviation are mitigated so the agency can resolve concerns as quickly as possible."" The agency did not detail what the ""significant new information"" is. But the Israeli government told CNN that Ben Gurion is safe from any rocket attack by militants in Gaza. ""The security in Ben Gurion and in Israel is as good as it gets,"" said Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat. ""The reality is that the risk coming to Israel is minimal, and if it would be larger we would take the initiative and tell everyone not to come here."" Hamas: 'Great victory for the resistance' The ban was enacted Tuesday after a rocket struck about a mile from the airport. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN the military had tracked the rocket, as it does in general with those fired by militants from Gaza. Israel chose not to shoot the rocket down, knowing the airport would not be hit. ""Any incoming rocket that would hit the airport ... would immediately be taken out by our system,"" Regev said. Ben Gurion was still expecting 206 flights Wednesday despite cancellations from U.S. and some European airlines, Israel's Transport Ministry said. American Airlines, which owns US Airways, said it will consider resuming service to the Israeli airport once the FAA approves. Delta Air Lines said Tuesday it was suspending flights until further notice. German airline Lufthansa said that ""based on an analysis of presently available information,"" it will continue to suspend flights Thursday. The European Aviation Safety Agency recommended avoiding Ben Gurion on Tuesday. Air Canada canceled Wednesday night's flight to Tel Aviv, as well as its return on Thursday. The airline typically flies one flight a day from Toronto to Tel Aviv. But British Airways continued flying into Israel even after other airlines canceled. Hamas hailed the slowdown as a clear victory. ""The resistance success in stopping the air traffic and isolating Israel from the world is a great victory for the resistance,"" said spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. Bloomberg: Banning flights rewards Hamas . Bloomberg landed safely Wednesday and tweeted a photograph of himself sitting down with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu. ""I just wanted to do something personally to show my support for standing up for what's right. I think Israel is doing that. Hamas is trying to kill the Palestinians and kill the Israelis and somebody's got to say that they've got to stop this,"" he told CNN's Blitzer. The exchange grew heated when Blitzer asked about the State Department's travel advisory for Israel and the West Bank. ""I think the State Department is just overreacting in typical bureaucratic fashion,"" Bloomberg said. When asked whether he thought there were political reasons behind the advisory, Bloomberg replied: ""By asking the question you're implying that our government does things for political reasons. ... Just the allegation against our government I personally take as an offense."" He praised Ben Gurion Airport as the best-protected such facility in the world. ""The flight restrictions are a mistake that hand Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately,"" Bloomberg said late Tuesday. In an opinion column for Bloomberg View, part of the media company he owns, the former New York mayor compared his trip to Israel to the way he responded to terror threats in the city. Sometimes it's prudent to act out an abundance of caution during a crisis, he wrote. ""But closing down access to major infrastructure networks in the face of terrorist threats can be self-defeating,"" he said. The FAA said its decision was necessary due to the ""potentially hazardous situation."" And after the shooting down last week of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, some jittery travelers understand the FAA decision. ""You have a rocket and you bring down 300 people at one shot,"" one said. But it didn't stop her from boarding her El Al flight. The airport is a key economic artery for Israel. While more than 2,000 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza, 6,000 flights have landed and departed at Ben Gurion, the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel said. ""It is not a miracle and not a trick,"" the authority's director, Giora Romm, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We know how to defend Ben Gurion, period."" CNN analyst: Incident could bring diplomatic consequences . It's unusual for the FAA to prohibit U.S. carriers from flying to a particular airport, said Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general. ""In the past when the FAA has done it, there have been diplomatic consequences,"" she said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry landed Wednesday at Ben Gurion on a mission to try to stop all hostilities. The airline suspensions didn't affect his flight because he traveled on a military plane. The flight suspensions have stranded some travelers in Tel Aviv. And others, who flew out on Israeli carriers, had to run for cover before takeoff when sirens went off at the airport. ""You had to run for about a minute to get to shelter and just wait there for about 10 minutes,"" a passenger arriving in New York from Tel Aviv told CNN affiliate NY1, describing what happened before the all-clear sounded. ""It was nerve-racking, actually."" Rabbi Shalom Lewis, whose synagogue is in an Atlanta suburb, was stuck at Ben Gurion with a group of American travelers all looking for a way to get home to the United States. But none was running scared over missiles. ""Every one of them was just aggravated by the inability to get home easily, but nobody was afraid,"" Lewis told NY1. On Wednesday, the Transport Ministry ordered the opening of the small Uvda airport in the far southeast of Israel. Canceling flights to Israel is a serious blow to the country's economy, said Romm of the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel. Tourism is a major source of income. Last year, Israel received a record 3.5 million visitors, according to its Central Bureau of Statistics. Before the recent violence, the bureau reported a record 1.4 million visitors for the first half of 2014. The violence will likely put a damper on tourism. Travelers reassess plans amid Mideast conflict . CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Amir Tal, Umaro Djau, Aaron Cooper, Marlena Baldacci, Justin Lear, Marnie Hunter, Caitlin Schmidt, Katia Hetter, Rene Marsh and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Security in Israel is ""as good as it gets"" says Jerusalem mayor .

"(CNN) -- In April 1964, only a few months after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, his widow Jacqueline Kennedy wrote to Kay Halle -- an old family friend of both the Kennedys and the Churchills -- and gave a glimpse of the dark melancholy that shrouded her. Jackie mentioned an Easter trip with her children, Caroline and John Jr., and expressed hope the holiday might renew her spirits. ""I hope it will give me via fresh air some new energy -- as I just have had none lately & cannot even touch the ever growing piles on my desk,"" she wrote to Halle. ""But this spring maybe everything will be better -- Love Jackie."" Jackie Kennedy's letters underline the behind-the-scenes role of Halle, who urged President Kennedy to bestow honorary U.S. citizenship upon Winston Churchill at special 1963 Rose Garden ceremony. But more importantly, the Halle correspondence provides further insight into the first lady's relationship with JFK during their White House years and the painful aftermath of her husband's November 1963 killing. During the past decade, the private letters of Jacqueline Kennedy have slowly come to light. Most were kept private for many years in archives, away from public scrutiny. As a result, history has been deprived of important, albeit disturbing, facts surrounding the assassination and its effect on those closest to JFK -- especially his widow, whose grief included suicidal thoughts expressed to a priest. To be sure, a generation of Americans admired Jacqueline Kennedy's extraordinary grace and courage during her husband's funeral and were naturally protective of her privacy when she was alive. But a wealth of letters and other documents -- including an extensive oral history by Mrs. Kennedy kept under wraps at the JFK Library until 2011 -- remained out of sight, well past her death in 1994, leaving the historical record incomplete. Now a half century later, it is time for all the Jacqueline Kennedy letters to be available for historians, allowing for a more full and accurate understanding about one of the most dramatic moments in 20th century U.S. history. Efforts by the Kennedy family to keep these letters at bay only mute our comprehension of what truly happened on that tragic day in Dallas and the kind of psychological damage that gun violence can wreak on the lives of innocent survivors. The existence of Jackie's letters was unknown to me until I stumbled upon some in preparing a 2003 book about how the Kennedys' Irish Catholic immigrant background influenced their personal and public lives. During my research, three people suggested speaking with the Rev. Richard McSorley, a Jesuit friend of Robert F. Kennedy's family, though none apparently knew of McSorley's involvement with Jackie. McSorley surprisingly told me how he counseled a grief-stricken Jackie for several months beginning in April 1964. He provided ""tennis lessons"" to Jackie at RFK's Virginia home while helping the widowed first lady through her agony and depression. McSorley later allowed me to review his personal files at Georgetown University's library. There I found several remarkable letters and documents about Jackie Kennedy's emotional struggles. She shared her doubts about God, fate, a heavenly afterlife with her slain husband, and her children's immediate future. ""Do you think God would separate me from my husband if I killed myself?"" Jackie asked the priest. ""It is so hard to bear. I feel as though I am going out of my mind at times. Wouldn't God understand that I just want to be with him?"" Georgetown later held a press conference about the ""unique historical window"" McSorley's papers provided. But soon after a complaint from the Kennedy family, Georgetown access was closed to Jackie's letters in McSorley's files. Similar letters, though, would turn up elsewhere. In May 2014, a batch of 33 Jackie letters to an Irish priest, the Rev. Joseph Leonard, whom she first met in the early 1950s, were headed for auction until the Kennedys objected to their disclosure. These letters, containing sentiments similar to those Jackie confided to McSorley, were published by various publications but were eventually returned to the Kennedy family, reportedly at the direction of Caroline Kennedy, her daughter. They are no longer public. More letters from Jackie Kennedy turned up in the files of Halle, made available in June 2011 at the JFK Library. I describe them in my new book about the Churchills and the Kennedys. After Halle offered successful suggestions for JFK's 1961 inaugural celebration, Jackie Kennedy sought advice about Washington's social scene. Her letter reflects the anxiety of a woman in her early 30s wanting to please her husband in her new role as first lady. ""One thing I wish you could help me with,"" Jackie wrote in her fragmented longhand sentences to Halle. ""Is it enough to just keep doing things in a private way -- as one would do if not President -- Go to the theatres, symphonies, etc. and try to have the entertainment at the (White House) be substantial -- ... But that is so little -- Do you think we should have an enormous reception at the W. House for artists -- that seems rather treating them like freaks -- I try to work some into every State dinner -- but that's a tiny drop in the bucket -- If you have a brainstorm do tell me."" Jackie let Kay Halle know how to send notes to her social secretary's attention so that she'd read them personally. ""Put your name on the letter and SPECIAL -- (my code for getting my own mail!)"" she instructed. After JFK's assassination and the 1965 death of Winston Churchill, Halle remained in touch with both families. She later asked Jackie and her second husband Aristotle Onassis to contribute to a book of remembrances about Winston Churchill's son, Randolph, who died in 1968. ""You know how Jack and Bobby loved him -- but did you know how my son John loved him?"" Jackie asked Halle about Randolph. Around her children, Jackie wrote, Randolph ""was completely himself -- and never changed gears for them."" In her essay for Halle's book, Jackie recalled how Randolph gave her son, John Jr., a complete set of Winston Churchill's books -- including his masterful biography about John Marlborough, a fabled Churchill ancestor -- which she kept in the Kennedys' Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan. ""They are in the bookshelves in the dining room, beside Jack's Marlborough, which he read when he had scarlet fever as a boy, and the Churchill books he had at Harvard,"" Jackie recalled. Uncertain of what her son's future might bring, Jackie told Halle that she hoped President Kennedy's heir might discover lessons about greatness from these bound volumes, just as other men had. ""If, when he is older, he finds in them what his father found in them -- that would be this strange, touching legacy of Randolph's,"" Jackie concluded. ""Winston Churchill and Randolph outlived Jack -- but maybe Randolph will be the one to draw John to the books that shaped John's father."" Documents like these are essential tools to gaining a clear and complete understanding our past. Surely, both JFK and Jackie Kennedy, with their keen sense of history, would have understood.","Thomas Maier: Jackie Kennedy letters show emotions of young first lady, later grieving widow .

"(CNN) -- In the sleepy seaside town of Mariel, northwest Cuba, a hulking monument to the communist islands' evolving economy is rapidly taking shape. It is here, under the intense glare of the Caribbean sun, that a giant free-trade zone (FTZ) and container port are in the latter stages of construction. The deep-water facility will have an annual capacity of up to one million containers when finished (three times that of Havana's existing port roughly 30 miles away) and 700 meters of berth that it is hoped will host some of the world's largest cargo ships. Partially financed by loans from Brazil and built by Brazilian construction firm, Odebrecht, the port will be operated by Singapore's PSA. The FTZ, meanwhile, aims to attract international companies to Cuba by offering them a low-tax, low-regulation environment in which to manufacture goods. ""What the zone is intended for is to create a special climate where foreign capital is going to have better conditions than in the rest of the country,"" said Cuba's foreign trade and investment minister, Rodrigo Malmierca, during a September visit to Beijing. See also: Dawn of the super-ports . The $900 million project mirrors similar developments and FTZs that have sprung up in fast-growing communist nations such as China and Vietnam in recent decades -- although experts doubt whether Cuba will follow the same path as the ""Asian Tigers."" While the ruling Communist Party maintains that state control will take precedence, the ambitious development is the latest in a series of controlled reforms that have been made since Raul Castro came to power in 2008. The government has already relaxed its control over many sectors, encouraging ordinary Cubans to fill the void with their own private enterprises. ""Cuba is shedding its old skin and it's becoming something else which is like a hybrid of models,"" explained senior Latin America fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of the book ""Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know,"" Julia Sweig. ""This will (likely consist) of a much larger private sector, a much smaller social sector with the basics of social protection left in place, a lot more personal autonomy and economic freedom for Cuban people without necessarily moving beyond the single party system,"" she added. Regional developments . This new economic direction -- which the administration refers to as an ""update"" of the socialist economic system -- and in particular the Mariel development have been brought about by a number of specific challenges and opportunities for Cuba, Sweig explained. The widening of the Panama Canal (which is due to be completed in 2015) means more of the world's largest ships will soon be passing through the Caribbean, providing Cuba with the chance to benefit as a transhipment hub thanks to its strategically favorable location. Fast-growing economies in the region, such as Brazil, Mexico and Chile, meanwhile, provide fresh possibilities for foreign investment and trade tie-ups. Nurturing new relationships has been made all the more important given the volatile political climate in Venezuela, whose leftist government currently sells subsidized oil and trades with Cuba on conditions that are highly favorable to the island country. A vitally important cog in this wide-ranging strategy is Mariel. According to Carmelo Mesa, professor of economics and Latin American Studies at the University of Pittsburgh and author of the book ""Cuba under Raul Castro: Assessing the Reforms,"" the port and FTZ are by far the most important development project on the island. See also: What happens to goods lost at sea? ""The objective for Mariel and the free zone is to expand infrastructure, increase exports, reduce imports and develop high-tech projects that will create jobs,"" Mesa said. ""This is important as the Cuban government has indicated that anywhere from 1.3 million to 1.8 million workers in the state sector are unneeded and must be dismissed. ""Cuban exports are generally raw materials, except for pharmaceutical products and biotechnology products but this is only about 8% (of exports). So they want to have value added goods such as computers, appliances and expand biotechnology,"" he added. Breaking with the past . Whether the wider economic plan and investment in Mariel will achieve these aims, however, remains far from certain. The 51-year-old U.S. trade embargo still restricts Cuba's ability to trade freely with its international partners. Any ship that docks in Cuba cannot enter the United States for six months. If the embargo was ever lifted, however, the FTZ would be favorably located (only 120 miles from Florida) to serve as a low-cost site for companies looking to manufacture and ship their products into the U.S. market. As it stands, international investors will have to be persuaded to choose Cuba over nearby competitors. The likes of Panama, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic already have established FTZs in their territories. Mesa also points to economic development zones introduced under Fidel Castro in the 1990s and early 2000s which expanded very quickly before ""there was a re-centralization of the economy"" leading many foreign firms to pull out of Cuba. According to Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Cuba specialist at IHS Global Insight, many investors still see Cuba as a ""hostile business environment"" and will treat any opening of the economy with a high degree of skepticism. ""This opening is going to be taken with a pinch of salt ... it's still to be assessed what the tax and regulatory benefits of the (FTZ) will be,"" he said. The end of communism? Despite these significant challenges, Cuba still has much to offer international companies, not least a well-educated labor force -- Cuba has one of the highest literacy rates of any country, according to data compiled by the CIA World Factbook. Mesa however identifies laws that restrict foreign companies hiring Cubans directly as a potential disincentive to FTZ investors. Instead, workers are employed via a government agency that makes all decisions on the wages they receive often driving up the price of labor -- although new laws on foreign investment are expected. See also: Where are the world's piracy hotspots? Sweig meanwhile points to the lifting of travel restrictions between the U.S. and Cuba in recent years and a gradual shift in rhetoric in Washington policy circles that indicates a softening on the issue of the embargo. All concur however that, despite the tentative adoption of market principles and the loosening of central economic control, this is far from the beginning of the end of communism in Cuba. ""(The Cubans) know they need to create these types of clusters where they can operate more aggressive free trade economic policies without necessarily affecting the economic dynamics of ordinary Cubans,"" Moya-Ocampo said. ""It's pragmatism,"" he added. ""Cuba is trying to update its structures to meet the new realities of Latin America.""","A new port and free-trade-zone are being built in the Cuban town of Mariel .
The development will cost $900 million and aims to attract international investment to Cuba .
Reforms in Cuba are opening up the economy and the state is rolling back its influence over many sectors ."
"(CNN) -- Hef owned one. Miss Universe had one named after her. And a recent vice presidential nominee campaigned on one. Now, after nearly 50 years, the iconic McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliner is pretty much done. Overall, say aviation enthusiasts, it's been a great ride. The twin-engine, single-aisle jet's biggest and first operator, Delta Air Lines, officially retired its remaining fleet of six DC-9s on Monday, leaving only a handful of passenger models operating among foreign airlines and government and military outfits. It's high time to give this plane its due. Experts credit the DC-9 with helping to open markets and spark air travel trends that continue today. And what about pop culture? During its peak in the 1970s, the DC-9 became an ultimate status symbol among the world's emerging Jet Set. For some, the plane was truly shagadelic. Playboy magazine owner Hugh Hefner bought a custom DC-9 and turned it into a personal fur-lined flying boudoir. But while Hef was making mile-high-club history, the DC-9 was making travel history. Airlines embraced this T-Tailed plane with engines mounted on the rear, instead of the wings. They liked its ability to land easily at airports with shorter runways. Here's how the DC-9's geeky aviation technology helped change America's travel culture: . â€”Longer wing flaps and dynamic engines helped DC-9s land and takeoff on shorter runways that often served smaller towns. â€”In turn, airlines used the DC-9 to open new shorter routes which connected big cities to smaller ones. â€”And that led to making jetliner travel more accessible to more Americans. Bottom line: The DC-9 helped Americans who live in smaller towns embrace air travel. It's hard to know for sure, but experts estimate the DC-9 series has flown perhaps 2 or 3 billion passengers between its first commercial flight on December 8, 1965, and its last flight on January 6. ""I think its age alone puts it in the hall of fame, just on longevity,"" said William Swelbar, an aviation industry blogger, consultant and research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Post-deregulation, the DC-9 was incredibly important in building hubs in lots and lots of smallish markets."" Swelbar said it had a direct impact on the growth of air travel to smaller cities like Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""Today that airplane would arguably be too big to serve Green Bay -- because now Green Bay is served by a number of smaller regional jets,"" he said. ""But the fact of the matter is, the DC-9 really helped make Green Bay an important point on a number of airline maps."" Affectionate nicknames for the plane stuck. Some called it the Chuck Niner. More powerful versions were called ""Sport Nines."" Labels like ""Dirty Niner"" and ""Diesel 9"" were veiled references to its smoky, loud engines during the early days. ""As an ex-Northwest employee I can't say enough great things about the Diesel 9,"" wrote CNN commenter Keith Montgomery. The plane's rear-mounted engines made loading and unloading luggage faster, he wrote, because baggage handlers didn't have to wait for the engines to ""spool down"" before they could access the bags. By the late '60s, the buzz was growing and Hefner wanted one. In 1969 he took delivery of a DC-9-32 -- a longer version than the original -- painted black and stenciled with the iconic bunny logo on the tail. The aircraft was dubbed ""The Big Bunny."" Riding this sleek chariot, the Playboy prince whisked his bright-eyed girlfriend Barbi Benton on a whirlwind trip to Europe and Africa in 1970. Video posted on YouTube shows the plane as a high-altitude party palace, complete with a reel-to-reel videotape player, a shower, and a disco. In 1977, BWIA West Indies Airways celebrated the crowning of Trinidad and Tobago's first Miss Universe, Janelle Penny Commissiong, by naming a DC-9 in her honor. More recently, the plane played a role in the 2012 election. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney trusted a DC-9 to ferry his running mate, Paul Ryan, from stump speech to stump speech. By the way, that plane -- built in 1970 -- was the same age as the vice presidential candidate. Since 1965, Delta -- the first carrier to fly DC-9s -- has flown a total of 305 of them -- nearly a third of the over 970 that McDonnell Douglas manufactured until production ended in 1982. This isn't the first time Delta has retired the DC-9. The Atlanta-based airline got rid of their first fleet of DC-9s in 1993. But 15 years later, it acquired 72 DC-9s as part of a merger with Northwest. It's been taking those planes out of service little by little until last week, when Delta retired its final six. (Delta said two of those DC-9s will remain on standby for a few weeks as backup planes.) Not wanting to ignore a key moment in the history of an aviation icon, Delta hosted a small ceremony with cake and balloons on Monday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The DC-9 chosen for the final passenger flight was a 120-seat Series 50 model built in 1978. Its FAA registry number: N773NC. Aboard the plane was aviation correspondent Jack Harty of Airchive.com. ""It was bittersweet,"" he said, reflecting on the passing of a relic from a different time when on-board WiFi sounded like science fiction and lighting up a Marlboro was commonplace. While still on the ground, Harty got a peak inside the flight deck. He found no advanced flight management computer and none of the modern, so-called ""glass cockpit"" digital displays you might find on newer airliners. The plane's instruments were a throwback to 1970s technology -- lots of old-fashioned round, analog dials. N773NC's first airline was North Central in '78. A year later, it was obtained by Republic. It changed airlines again in 1986 when Northwest swallowed Republic. In 2009, it got a Delta paint job, after Delta's mashup with Northwest. Eventually it was time for Harty to board N773NC for Delta's final scheduled DC-9 passenger flight -- appropriately named Flight 2014 -- from Minneapolis to Atlanta. Once in the air, the crew led passengers in a quick champagne toast to honor the aircraft. By the way, another storied airliner from the same era, the DC-10, will reportedly make its final passenger flight in February from Dhaka, Bangladesh, to Birmingham, England. The DC-9 leaves behind a powerful design legacy that will fly for years. Aviation geeks point to what they call ""variants"" of the plane which are still going strong, including the MD series -- the MD-88 and the MD-90. Another plane with design roots reaching back to the DC-9 is the Boeing 717. These planes all look a lot like the DC-9, with their rear-mounted engines -- and of course that cool-looking T-Tail. To replace the DC-9s and other retiring planes, Delta is acquiring 36 717s this year from AirTran and another 36 in 2015. The 110-seat 717s have a range that will allow them to fly all of the airline's domestic routes. By 2017, Delta also plans to add 40 Airbus planes to its fleet, including the international widebody A330-300 and -- for domestic routes -- the single-aisle A321. Delta also is the process of buying 100 new Boeing 737-900ERs to replace older 757s and 767s. Get ready for a lot more airliners to retire between now and 2019. The aviation consulting firm ICF SH&E predicts more commercial jets will be retired worldwide this decade than ever before -- somewhere between 6,000-8,000. Compare that to about 1,700 commercial jets that were retired in the entire 1990s. The time is right for airlines to buy newer planes, experts say, because interest rates are relatively low, and higher fuel prices require newer, efficient engines. As for the exiting DC-9s, one will be handpicked for permanent display at the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta. ""It was a robust workhorse of an airplane,"" said Delta spokesman Michael Thomas. ""Its longevity proves how robust it was.""","Born in 1965, DC-9s opened jet routes to small airports, spurring travel .

"(CNN) -- Last year, after CNN readers voted for me to do a story on income inequality, I spent two weeks reporting from what was then the ""most unequal place in America"": East Carroll Parish, Louisiana. It's a tiny patch of land on the western bank of the Mississippi River -- home to a beautiful oxbow lake called Lake Providence. That lake, I found, is a stark barrier between rich and poor -- and a fitting microcosm for inequality across the nation. My goal in reporting on the parish, on your behalf, was to spark a national conversation on income inequality that could, in some small way, help push for change. I'm now happy to report that the level of income inequality in East Carroll Parish, while still quite high, has dropped considerably. New York is now the worst. East Carroll Parish went from top-of-list to No. 128. Manhattan -- or New York County -- has the highest inequality rating, followed by Borden County, Texas; Franklin County, Mississippi (which I visited in 2013 for a very different kind of story); Mineral County, Colorado; and Greene County, Georgia, according to census data released on Thursday. The new data is part of the American Community Survey, and is an average of data from the years 2009 to 2013. The census, and many economists, use a wonky metric called the ""Gini coefficient"" to measure how income is spread across a particular society or geography. A rating of zero means a society is perfectly equal -- or that everyone has the same level of income. A rating of one means that literally all the income falls into the hands of one man or woman. East Carroll Parish had a rating of 0.67 in 2011, which was the most recent data available when I traveled to the parish. Now, its rating is 0.50, which isn't that much higher than the U.S. Gini coefficient, which is 0.47, according to the census. ""It's a big change,"" Kirby Posey, a survey statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau said of the shift in East Carroll Parish. It's also one, he said, that's statistically significant when you compare 2011 data from the parish to the current set. New York County's inequality, meanwhile, has remained constant over the same period, holding steady at about 0.60. Mind you, that level of inequality is still not good. The United States is one of the most economically split nations in the world -- with more income inequality than Nigeria or Russia. The most equal country, according to CIA data, is Sweden, with a rating of 0.23. Also, there's a lag in data reporting. The most recent numbers, those released on Thursday, come from interviews that were taken between 2009 and 2013 as part of the American Community Survey. So it's difficult to get an exact snapshot of this moment. I do, however, find East Carroll Parish's drop in inequality promising. It's hard, from my desk in Atlanta, to tease out exactly how and why this shift occurred in East Carroll Parish. Posey, from the census, wasn't sure, either. I left messages with the sheriff of East Carroll Parish and the mayor of Lake Providence, among others, but I haven't heard back from them. I'll update this piece if and when I do. The one resident I could reach was Bernadette Barrett, or ""Sister Bernie,"" as she's known locally, because she's an Irish Catholic nun. She told me some new jobs -- including those with a pepper farm and at a chemical processing plant -- have come to town, or are coming soon. ""Some people have gotten employed there -- so that's helping bring people up,"" she said. She told me there's talk of a new tomato cannery in town, too. The numbers, however, indicate something else may be at play: The rich are getting less rich. The average income for the top 5% of earners in the parish was $610,884 in 2011 -- but fell sharply to only $165,017 in 2013, the data show. The average income for the top 20% fell from $224,264 to $97,104 over the same period. It's unclear what would have caused that plunge. There have been symbolic signs of progress, though. Among them is that locals and volunteers finished painting a mural downtown. It features a crossword puzzle with words like ""believe,"" ""hope"" and ""change."" It also includes a painting of Dede Willis, a young woman who was featured in the video on the income gap in Lake Providence, which I produced with videographer Edythe McNamee. I'll leave you for now with something Willis, then 18, told us on our visit: ""If one day someone just came (and said), 'Dede, here's a million dollars, do whatever you want,' I would build a huge bridge across the lake. And then, after a while, (the rich and the poor) are not going to have a choice but to talk to each other."" My hope is that Dede's bridge, at least symbolically, is already being built.","CNN's John Sutter looks at new income inequality data from the census .

"(CNN) -- Which state has given us B.B. King, Jimmy Buffett, Sam Cooke, Faith Hill, Britney Spears and Elvis Presley? Mississippi has. Which state has given us pro football's Jerry Rice and Archie Manning, Walter Payton and Brett Favre? Mississippi has. And which state has given us countless thrills, championships galore and some of the most famous teams in the history of American sport? Mississippi hasn't. But that is about to change. In fact, it probably already has changed. If you check out college football's latest national rankings, the No. 1 team in the entire United States is, to the shock of many, Mississippi State. Close on its heels at No. 3 is, almost as unexpectedly, the University of Mississippi, better known to y'all as ""Ole Miss."" Mississippians are burning with football fever. A state without a franchise in pro basketball, baseball, football and hockey, a second fiddler to the Dixieland bands of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Louisiana in college football for quite a while, Mississippi is making up for lost time in 2014. OK, not everybody from the Magnolia State is overjoyed about this -- there must be at least 10 or 20 folks down there who don't give a hoot. Otherwise, the campus towns of Starkville and Oxford are experiencing a rare kind of double-your-pleasure euphoria, and alumni (or just plain old football followers) from Gulfport to Jackson are busting with pride over America's hottest teams. Is this temporary? A midseason night's dream? Could be. The season's only half done, after all. And Mississippi State's Bulldogs still have strong opponents on the schedule, like those always dangerous Alabama Crimson Tide. Mississippi's Rebels, meanwhile, must still get past opponents like the Auburn Tigers and upset-minded opponents like the Presbyterian Blue Hose. And to top it all? Somebody's going to emerge victorious in what very well might become the most talked about battle in this state since the 1863 (at Vicksburg, for those of you wondering) -- hang onto your helmets for Mississippi State vs. Ole Miss on November 29. If you've been missing how this Mississippi madness came to pass, let us catch you up: . Mississippi State, unranked, unnoticed by a whole mess of Northerners and Westerners in spite of bowl-game victories in 2010, 2011 and 2013, began this season by defeating Southern Mississippi 49-10, Alabama-Birmingham 47-34, South Alabama 35-3, LSU 34-29, Texas A&M 48-31 and, this past weekend, Auburn 38-23. As a result, Coach Dan Mullen's squad has made an unprecedented rise in the Associated Press poll's rankings -- and is believed to be college football's first team to go from unranked to No. 1 in just six weeks. Mississippi State received 45 first-place votes to leapfrog Florida State, which got just 12. Ole Miss, meanwhile, claimed three first-place votes for itself and is ranked No. 3. So far, Coach Hugh Freeze's guys have knocked off Boise State 35-13, Vanderbilt 41-3, Louisiana-Lafayette 56-15, Memphis 24-3, Alabama 23-17 and, this past weekend, Texas A&M 35-20. It's proof positive that, to quote former Crimson Tide running back Forrest Gump, life really is a box of chocolates -- you really don't know what you're going to get. Few saw this coming. In the grand old Oktibbeha County town of Starkville, population 23,888, the teams of Mississippi State are loyally supported and loved. But the football team there has barely been a blip on the national radar since a 1940 one went 10-0-1. For as long as football has been there, the Bulldogs have lost more games than they have won. In the charming, brainy community of Oxford, population 20,865, the teams of Ole Miss are followed and revered. But not since the glory years of 1959, 1960 and 1962 -- three straight Sugar Bowl triumphs -- have the Rebels truly generated a nationwide gridiron sizzle. The name of Mississippi State's quarterback, Dak Prescott, did not roll off many tongues in Heisman Trophy preliminary discussions. Now, almost no one out there in NCAA Land is asking ""Who's Dak?"" After all, Prescott's impressive play, along with the rushing of Josh Robinson and receiving of De'Runnya Wilson, Jameon Lewis and Fred Brown, took this school from Never Heard of 'Em status to the exalted Team People Are Talking About. Ole Miss has a fine QB of its own, Bo Wallace, with a running game led by Jaylen Walton and the memorably named I'Tavius Mathers. If anyone expected a letdown when big, bad 'Bama came to town, a hard-earned 23-17 win over the Crimson Tide resulted in the Rebels' faithful storming the field and ripping down the goal posts. That impromptu act of celebration cost the school $50,000 in a fine from the Southeastern Conference, one that seemed well worth paying to many of those fans. Hey, why not? Mississippians must get tired of the constant attention given a Super Bowl or World Series or Stanley Cup or some other event from the wide world of sports, never having a horse in those races. It's nice to be in play. College football is cool, and hundreds of thousands there are true to his or her school. Again, the season's only half-done. But most of Mississippi won't miss a minute of the next half. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Mississippi State topped the latest rankings of college football teams .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry has acknowledged that he killed Taliban insurgents on his latest tour of duty in Afghanistan as a crew member of an Apache attack helicopter. Harry has been serving for four months as a co-pilot gunner (CPG) in southern Helmand province -- considered a Taliban heartland -- and flew on scores of missions with the trigger to rockets, missiles and a 30mm cannon at his fingertips. No one is saying how many insurgents Harry might have killed but toward the end of his deployment, the 28-year-old, known to his comrades as Captain Wales, shared some of his feelings about combat with reporters while on duty in the massive military base known as Camp Bastion. He said it was sometimes justified to ""take a life to save a life. That's what we revolve around, I suppose."" More: How 'soldier prince' tore up royal rule book . Harry explained how the roles of Apaches and CPGs have changed since his previous deployments in 2007 and 2008. ""It used to be very much: front seat, you're firing the whole time. ""Now, yes we fire when we have to but essentially we're more of a deterrent than anything else. ""Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them, then we will do it,"" said the prince, third in line to the British throne. ""It's not the reason I decided to do this job. The reason to do this job was to get back out here, and carry on with a job."" Away from his helicopter, the prince mixed freely on base, eating in the canteen with everyone else and relaxing by playing video games with others in the 130-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC). With those comrades, he was just ""one of the guys."" More: Harry named world's most eligible bachelor . In contrast to his privileged upbringing in palaces and an education at Eton College, the prince lived in a shared room within shipping containers converted into an accommodation block. He said he was free to stroll around the base, to visit the gym or the laundry. ""It's completely normal,"" Harry added. But he said he still received unwanted attention in more public places. ""For me it's not that normal because I go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp, and that's one thing that I dislike about being here,"" he said. Opinion: Cheeky Harry vs. dull brother William . ""Because there's plenty of guys in there that have never met me, therefore look at me as Prince Harry and not as Captain Wales, which is frustrating. ""Which is probably another reason why I'd love to be out in the PBs (patrol bases), away from it all. ""But yeah, it's completely normal. It's as normal as it's going to get. I'm one of the guys. I don't get treated any differently."" His deployment meant he could step back from the public eye, although he said his father, the heir to the British throne Prince Charles, often reminded him of his position. Harry admitted he had ""let himself and his family down"" when he was photographed naked at a party in a Las Vegas hotel last year. Harry on Vegas romp: 'I let my family down' He also expressed frustration about the media. Referring to the TV producer whom he was addressing, he said: ""I never wanted you guys to be out here, but there was an agreement made to invite you out on the deal that the media didn't speculate before my deployment. That's the only reason you guys are out here."" Harry appeared happier talking about his military role: building up the Afghan National Army, the ANA, so it can eventually take over. ""It's great to see the ANA taking more of a lead in things as well. And the professionalism is definitely shining through."" That's something his superiors in the army might say of the prince himself. What do you think about Prince Harry's comments?

"(CNN) -- Better late than never. Jerome Boateng, the man who once wore the blue of Manchester City, struck an 89th minute winner as Bayern Munich claimed a dramatic 1-0 victory in its opening game of the European Champions League. It was a goal which had seldom looked like coming given Bayern's profligacy in front of goal and the inspired performance of Joe Hart, the Manchester City goalkeeper. For 88 minutes, Bayern, champion in 2013, laid siege to the City goal with Hart producing save after save to thwart the German side. And then, with 89 minutes on the clock, Bayern finally made the breakthrough courtesy of Boateng. City, so disciplined in defense and having worked tirelessly throughout, failed to clear its lines and when the ball dropped to Boateng, the defender unleashed an unstoppable effort which brushed off the back of Mario Gotze and flew into the top corner. It was harsh on a City side, which although rarely looked like winning the contest, played with a determination and tenacity which almost earned it a point. For all the hype surrounding the fixture, this game failed to catch light with both teams struggling to produce their best form. Bayern, which was beaten on home turf by City in the group stage last season, wasted a number of opportunities to win the tie on a frustrating night at the Allianz Arena. But Boateng's late strike provided welcome relief and left City's players crushed. ""We fought hard all night against a good team,"" Hart told Sky Sports. ""You know what you get when you come here. ""A nasty deflection at the end has done us and Jerome Boateng comes back to haunt us. ""It would have been well deserved draw, we made them work hard for everything."" City will now hope to record successes against Italian side Roma and Russian club CSKA Moscow if it is to have any chance of qualifying for the last-16. Manuel Pellegrini's side is more than capable of progressing to the next round and while defeat will be hard to take, it showed more than enough to suggest it can still enjoy success in this competition. Last season, City endured a disastrous opening 12 minutes at the Allianz Arena in which it conceded twice and threatened to implode. That it did not spoke volumes for the resilience and character of Pellegrini's players, who staged a sublime fightback to claim an unlikely 3-2 victory. On this occasion, it was indebted to its goalkeeper, Joe Hart, who produced a series of outstanding saves to keep Bayern on bay. Having already squandered a fine opportunity within the opening minute after Thomas Muller failed to convert from close range, Bayern was frustrated further by Hart. The England international produced a remarkable stop to deny Muller after the Bayern man's thumping header appeared certain to find the net. Hart was then called upon once again to push deal with Gotze's deflected effort as the home side exerted its dominance. City, which has failed to win either of its previous two Premier League games, was beginning to creak under the pressure and Hart was forced to palm away David Alaba's fierce drive. Bayern, which was humiliated on its last Champions League appearance by eventual winner Real Madrid last season, continued to dominate the tie. Robert Lewandowski, an off -season signing from rival Borussia Dortmund, was next to go close, running in behind the defense before dragging his effort wide from a tight angle. Bayern, without the injured Franck Ribery, continued to pressurize City after the interval but struggled to create a clear opportunity. And when it did, with 20 minutes remaining, Hart was in the right place at the right time to thwart Muller from close range. City, which had rarely looked like threatening, might have stolen victory late on had the referee awarded a penalty when Mehdi Benatia appeared to foul David Silva. But Bayern survived and only another wonderful save by Hart prevented Boateng's rasping effort from nestling in the far corner. That save appeared to have ensured City would escape with a point as the clock ticked down. But there was still one more twist in the tale and when City failed to clear Philipp Lahm's cross, Boateng struck a powerful effort which took the faintest of deflections off Gotze's back and flew past Hart. Boateng, who spent one season at City before moving to Munich in 2011, wheeled away down the touchline to celebrate with his manager, Pep Guardiola. Sergio Aguero, so often City's savior, almost carved out a late equalizer at the death but he struck his effort wide of the post after running through on goal. In the group's other game, Roma, which takes on City next,  thrashed CSKA Moscow 5-1. Elsewhere, Barcelona gained a 1-0 win over Cypriot minnow Apoel, Chelsea was held 1-1 by Schalke and Ajax recorded a 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain. Porto was the big winner of the night in Group H with a 6-0 victory over BATE Borisov.","Bayern Munich defeats Manchester City 1-0 .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A volcano in Indonesia prompted the evacuation of more than 6,000 people this weekend, blanketing buildings and cars in ashes, emergency officials said Monday.

"(CNN) -- ""Roll Tide!"" ""Go Ducks! "" ""FSU is on the warpath!"" An Ohio State Marching Band sousaphone player dotting the ""i."" Those are some of the things you'll hear and see during college football's biggest games this season. Alabama, Oregon, Florida State and Ohio State are the four universities voted into the inaugural College Football Playoff, the selection committee announced Sunday. No. 1 Alabama will play No. 4 Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, and No. 2 Oregon will play No. 3 Florida State in the Rose Bowl. Both games will take place on January 1, and the winners will face off in the National Championship Game on January 12. CBF playoff winners, losers . After Saturday's games, SEC champion Alabama and PAC-12 champ Oregon were entrenched in the top two slots, and ACC champion Florida State had finished the season as the only undefeated team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, college football's top tier. But there was plenty of controversy over which team should get the fourth and final spot. Ohio State got the nod after stomping the Wisconsin Badgers 59-0 in the Big Ten championship game. Here's what you won't hear: any cheers from fans of Baylor or Texas Christian universities. One of the five major football conferences -- the Big 12 -- was left out of the playoff picture. Its conference co-champions, Baylor and Texas Christian University, finished fifth and sixth in the final rankings, respectively. TCU dropped from third last week to sixth, despite defeating Iowa State decisively, 55-3, on Saturday. Baylor also won on Saturday, and had beaten TCU by a field goal, 61-58, earlier in the year. Within minutes of the selection committee releasing its final rankings, Baylor and TCU partisans flooded Twitter with outrage. . Ironically, the new College Football Playoff was devised to eliminate controversy over who gets to play for the national championship. Into the 1990s, conferences were aligned with specific bowl games (for instance, the SEC champion played in the Sugar Bowl each year), and No. 1 rarely met No. 2 at year's end, sometimes leading to a split decision between the two main polls, Associated Press and United Press International, as far as who was No. 1. But starting in the 1990s, various incarnations of what came to be known as the Bowl Championship Series attempted to pit the top two teams in the country in a winner-takes-all finale. The overall rankings were compiled using a combination of human- and computer-generated rankings. While the game featured the No. 1 BCS-ranked team versus the No. 2 team every year since 1998, often debate raged regarding whether those were actually the two best teams. This October, for the first time, a panel of 13 people -- including former coaches, players and university administrators -- started meeting once a week to winnow down the field to the Final Four. While many fans praised the new system for giving two more teams a shot at a national title, the NCAA, the governing body behind collegiate athletics in the United States, acknowledged on its website that there ""almost always will be more than one correct answer."" Many sports pundits have called for an eight-team playoff. It's safe to assume Baylor and TCU fans would agree, though it's too late for this season. Twitter reacts to playoff choices .

"(CNN) -- Redemption is not easy to attain. Four years on and the scars still remain. When France's footballers left for Brazil, they were under no illusions -- it cannot happen again. At South Africa 2010, ""Les Bleus"" became a laughing stock as players and coaches clashed, strikes were threatened and results embarrassed a nation. Players were suspended, the entire country waged war on a group which had imploded and exited at the group stage after failing to win a single game. Four years ago the picture was grim. Fast-forward to the present and perhaps, just perhaps, France may get the opportunity to shock the world for all the right reasons. A 2-0 victory over Nigeria in Brasilia on Monday ensured its progress to the quarterfinals and a meeting with Germany, which beat Algeria 2-1 after extra time. It is a far cry for the disillusionment and disappointment which cast a shadow of French football during its last foray into the World Cup. ""What happened, happened,"" coach Didier Deschamps said when he announced his 2014 World Cup roster on national television. ""That won't go away. It put a stamp on our history. But we don't need to discuss it again."" Deschamps and his players have spoken at length of moving on from the embarrassment of four years ago -- but few expected them to achieve much in Brazil. After all, this is a France side which only just scraped into the tournament courtesy of a 3-0 playoff victory over Ukraine in Paris after suffering a 2-0 victory in the first leg. But Deschamps, a World Cup hero on home soil in 1998, has brought about a unity in the squad which has not been seen for many a year. His decision to leave out Manchester City's Samir Nasri caused controversy outside of the squad -- but it did not surprise those who know Deschamps as the single-minded man that he is. He commands respect -- it helps if you've won the World Cup and European Championships as well as a host of titles at club level. And his players are responding -- even when not at their best as they were during the first half against Nigeria. But such is the quality at his disposal, Deschamps never panicked, even when Nigeria appeared to take the game to his side in the opening 45 minutes. Paul Pogba's 79th minute header and an own-goal from Joseph Yobo smoothed France's passage into the next round following a difficult afternoon. ""I am very proud of everything we did from the start,"" Deschamps told French television after the game. ""There was tension out there. They are a very strong side and there were a lot of duels. ""But we're through. We're in the quarter finals and we'll do everything we can to go a stage further."" Only three African teams have ever reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup -- Ghana the last to do so four years ago. But Nigeria's campaign has been blighted by inconsistency and rows over appearance fees -- a matter so serious that the country's president, Goodluck Jonathan, was forced to intervene and assure players they would be paid. Form has also been a problem -- a drab goalless draw against Iran in its opening game of the tournament was followed by a narrow victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. A 3-2 defeat by Argentina, in which Lionel Messi scored twice, ensured Nigeria qualified in second place despite having only managed a solitary win. But France, a side which won its group with a style and swagger which was so sorely lacking four years ago, hinted at a far more difficult challenge. After all, Nigeria had managed just one victory in its previous 11 World Cup matches and suffered defeat on both occasions it had reached the second round in 1994 and 1998. But if anyone had expected France to simply brush Nigeria aside, they were sorely mistaken. The Super Eagles, who won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013, arrived in Brasilia as underdogs, not that you would have known it during the early stages of the contest. While France appeared slow and sluggish, those in green began in sprightly fashion and thought they had taken the lead after 19 minutes. Ahmed Musa, the man who terrorized Argentina with two fine goals, picked out Emmanuel Emenike inside the penalty area and the striker turned the ball home. Unfortunately for Nigeria, Emenike had strayed just offside -- not by much, but enough for the flag of the assistant referee to be held high and bring a curtailment to the celebrations. Perhaps that piece of luck awoke France from its slumber as just moments later a fine move almost broke the deadlock. Paul Pogba, one of the most exciting young midfielders in the game, burst into space before feeding Mathieu Valbuena. Valbuena, free of any Nigeria pressure, then produced an inch-perfect cross that Pogba met with a rasping volley which Vincent Enyeama saved in spectacular fashion. Enyeama, who plays his club football in France with Lille, kept more clean sheets than any other in Ligue 1 last season. But that save apart, he was a mere spectator in the first half with France failing to register another shot on target. France, which had lost two of its previous three World Cup games against African opposition, might have been expected to emerge a different side after the interval. But that fluidity so evident in group-stage victories over Honduras and Switzerland still proved elusive. Instead, Nigeria continued to look the more threatening of the two sides -- Peter Odemwingie's fierce effort bringing a sharp save out of Hugo Lloris in the French goal. By that time, France could have and possibly should have been reduced to 10 men following a horrific tackle by Blaise Matuidi on Ogneyi Onazi. U.S. referee Mark Geiger showed a yellow card -- much to the consternation of the Nigerians, who believed the challenge warranted more than just a caution. It was only with the introduction of Antoine Griezmann in place of the disappointing Olivier Giroud up front that France began to look dangerous. It was Griezmann who helped create the chance of the game with 20 minutes remaining. The Real Sociedad forward played a one-two with Karim Benzema, sending the Real Madrid striker in on goal -- but his effort was partially saved by Enyeama and hacked off the goal-line by Victor Moses. Suddenly, it was France which began to take control, with its passing game finally causing Nigeria problems. First, Benzema crashed an effort across goal which had those in green shirts panicking, while Yohan Cabaye's spectacular 20-yard effort smashed across the crossbar with Enyeama beaten. But, with 11 minutes to go, France finally got the breakthrough it had threatened. Enyeama came to deal with a corner and when he could only flap at the ball, Pogba nodded home from close range. ""There are no words to describe this,"" said Pogba after helping his side past Nigeria. ""I know there is a whole country behind us. Scoring that goal really liberated us. I am so happy for the team and all France. I'm speechless. ""To score a goal for your country, especially in an important match like this to get into the World Cup quarter finals, it's one of the best moments of my life."" Pogba's goal -- the 146th of the tournament, one more than was managed at the entire 2010 World Cup -- set up a frantic finale as Nigeria pushed forward in search of an equalizer. But every time those in green swarmed forward, France moved to exploit the space and only a wonderful save by Enyeama stopped Griezmann from doubling his side's advantage. The second goal appeared inevitable and it duly arrived during stoppage time when Joseph Yobo, making his 100th international appearance, deflected Mathieu Valbuena's cross into his own net. It was a sad end to an afternoon which had begun with such promise for Nigeria -- but for France, the chance for redemption remains.","France defeats Nigeria 2-0 in World Cup last-16 clash .

"(CNN) -- What more could a horse enthusiast ask for than a beautiful ride along the sea shore? One of the world's toughest horse races took place on Thursday at the  Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games -- the venue for the event known as an 'equine marathon.' Held over a distance of 160 kilometers with just 10% of the course made up of road, riders race along beaches and countryside in a bid to win one of the most prestigious titles at the Games. The Normandy shore played host to the race as crowds flocked to watch the riders. Four years ago, Maria Mercedes Alvarez Ponton needed just over seven and a half hours to complete the course on her horse, Nobby. This time around, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohamed Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates won gold on his mare Yamamah in a time of 8:08:28. The race, which started in the town of Sartilly, Manche, looped around a UNESCO World Heritage site with the Bay of Mont Saint Michel providing a stunning backdrop for the event. While the scenery was something to behold, the weather was not, as rain hampered the riders throughout. In the team race, Spain retained the title it won four years ago in convincing fashion. Its three riders finished in a combined time of 28:56:02.","The Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games are taking place in France .

"Beijing (CNN) -- It was 2 a.m. on Sunday April 18, 1989 when the phone rang, jolting me out of bed. I recognized the distinctive voice of the caller Jiang Liren, a student at Peking University, also known in Chinese as Beida. ""Our group is marching out of Beida now,"" he said excitedly. ""We are going to Tiananmen Square. If you want to see this rally, you better come now."" Jiang was a student leader I had befriended weeks earlier while visiting Beida, my alma mater. For months, Beida had been the center of student ferment. I was then a correspondent for TIME in China. Of course, I was keen to cover what seemed like a reawakening of campus activism. I grabbed my satchel, bolted from our apartment and drove to Peking University, some 12 miles from the city center. I was more excited than tense. It had been a long time since Chinese had dared demonstrate on the streets. Tension had been building in Beijing, in the officialdom and among political activists, since Hu Yaobang was unceremoniously dismissed as Communist Party chief. Hu was lined up to succeed his mentor Deng Xiaoping, but he was sacked for being too soft on ""bourgeois liberalization"", a catchphrase for Western political ideas and cultural influences. He was specifically blamed for failing to suppress waves of student demonstrations that buffeted several Chinese cities from December 1986 to January 1987. Upon Hu's dismissal, Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang took over as acting General Secretary. On April 15, 1989, Hu Yaobang died after suffering a heart attack. His death came as a shock to many Chinese, especially among Beijing's intelligentsia who considered the defrocked leader as a champion of reform. Students lionized Hu as a open-minded Communist leader. Past midnight on April 18, more than 4,000 students from Peking University and People's University marched out of their campuses and set off on a 12-mile bivouac to Tiananmen Square. Holding hands and linking arms, the students chanted patriotic slogans and sung the national anthem and the Internationale, the Communist Party's anthem. As their ranks swelled I abandoned my car and followed their march for four hours. Hundreds of Beijing residents joined the procession, on foot and on their bicycles. Police arrived but did not try to stop them. It was a precedent-setting breach of the government ban on demonstrations. READ MORE: 25 years on, Tiananmen no less taboo for censors . When the rallyists reached the mostly empty and unlighted Square, a dozen protesters unfurled a 20-foot long white sheet of cloth. Splashed on it in big black characters: CHINA'S SOUL. By then it was daybreak. As the students dispersed peacefully, I walked back home, pondering what the march meant and how I could get TIME editors interested in doing a story. My editors did not need much prompting. For the next few days, students continued their public gatherings, making speeches, writing posters, staging sit-ins and marching in the streets. Their numbers swelled as students from other colleges joined in. At each turn of events, the indecision and successive blunders of the Chinese authorities served only to embolden the protesters, and widen what evolved into an epic student movement. Week after week for over two months, the global media's attention focused on Tiananmen, as the students and their supporters denounced official corruption and clamored for reforms, freedom and democracy. From April through June, TIME ran five cover stories, four consecutively, on the Tiananmen protests. Little did I know that, when I was awakened by that early morning phone call, it would be just the beginning of what would later be known alternatively as the ""Tiananmen Incident"" and the ""Tiananmen Massacre"", a student movement that would snowball into a massive People Power protest -- and end so tragically on June 4, 1989.","CNN Beijing bureau chief Jaime FlorCruz was a TIME correspondent in Beijing in 1989 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- After walking several blocks through New York's busy streets recently, I finally found Wang Juntao in the middle of Times Square, where the exiled Chinese dissident was holding a sit-down protest. Wearing a grey suit and yellow tie, Wang sits in a makeshift cage to dramatize the imprisonment of Wang Bingzhang, a fellow pro-democracy activist who has been imprisoned in China for the past 11 years. Occasionally, tourists come by to read the posters on display, which explain the plight of Wang in English and Chinese, before they walk away. Close by, a bank of giant video screens flash advertisements for a range of consumer products and, by coincidence, for Xinhua, China's state-controlled news agency. Wang's hairline is receding and his waistline has expanded, but he remains the quick-witted rabble-rouser I remember from our days as students at Peking University in China. ""Armed uprisings aside, I've done all kinds on anti-establishment projects in a Communist society,"" he says, talking at full throttle. ""And I did very well. Now I am looking forward to resuming it."" I remember Wang as a ""Wunderkind"" who enrolled at a relatively young age as a nuclear physics student, even though his passion was in politics and the liberal arts. But in 1989, he was imprisoned for over four years for his role as one of the ""Black Hands,"" the term Chinese state media used for demonstration organizers, in the Tiananmen protests. He was eventually released on medical grounds in 1994 and found his way to the United States, where he enrolled at Harvard and Columbia, earning a Ph.D in political science in the process. Now 53, Wang lives in New Jersey and is co-chairman of the China Democratic Party, which campaigns for change in his homeland. China's Harvard . Beida alumni like Wang are fiercely proud -- some say chauvinistic -- of the school's free-spirit tradition and its reputation as ""China's Harvard."" ""'Conquer or die', that's one of Beida's spirit,"" Wang recalls. ""We care more about thinking or ideology than political achievements."" Peking University, known in Chinese simply as Beida from the first syllables of its Chinese name Beijing Daxue, was founded 114 years ago as a training ground for China's intellectual leaders. Over the years, the university has been a bulwark of intellectual pursuit, academic freedom and patriotism. In 1919, Beida students led street demonstrations in Beijing, known then as Peking, condemning Confucian traditions and values, as well as the foreign domination of their country. Years later, many became leaders of the so-called Red Guard -- a movement of young revolutionaries who swore allegiance to Mao Zedong -- during the convulsive Cultural Revolution (1966-76), while others became the shock troops of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, organizing discussion groups, street demonstrations and hunger strikes. Crème de la crème . When I enrolled at Beida in the fall of 1977, the university was steeped in the political ferment that followed Chairman Mao's death and the start of Deng Xiaoping's reforms. My classmates, many of whom had worked on farms or in factories during the Cultural Revolution, were viewed by many as China's crème de la crème. They belonged to the storied ""Class of '77"" who passed the first college entrance exams held after the Cultural Revolution. During the four years I spent at Beida, I met many other fascinating fellow students who went on to become important players in China's divisive political scene. Among them was Bo Xilai, once one of the most powerful politicians in China, now disgraced and sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power. Bo majored in world history, while I studied Chinese history. Among my classmates, Bo stood out as a charismatic and gregarious one. He was not shy in striking up conversations with foreign students like me to practice English and chat about current affairs. A princeling -- his father Bo Yibo was a revered revolutionary veteran -- Bo seemed destined for a sterling political career, but in college he seemed more intent on pursuing a career as a foreign correspondent for China's state media. After two years in Beida, he moved to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and enrolled in a master's program in journalism. Years later, however, Bo did venture into politics, serving as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and then a member of the powerful politburo of the Communist Party. Last year his political career crashed after his wife Gu Kailai was arrested and convicted for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. In September, Bo himself was convicted to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power. He is appealing his conviction but analysts say his political career is now over. Interestingly, Wang does not think Bo is finished just yet. ""When Bo was arrested last year, I had said that Bo's political career had just begun. The Communist Party may have ended his political career within the party, but it has given him his political identity and charisma as a Leftist, and in a way has made him a martyr."" During his time as party chief in Chongqing -- China's biggest metropolis -- Bo's red-tinged economic policies, which included millions spent on social housing, garnered him rock star status among ordinary people increasingly frustrated by the growing wealth divide. But his populist stance and high-profile personal style did not go down well with others in the party, particularly the economically liberal and reform-oriented faction, who would not have lamented his dramatic fall from grace. ""Perhaps Bo will be our biggest opponent in the future,"" adds Wang mischievously. Rise to the top . Another Beida contemporary, Li Keqiang, has fared better. Li, who studied law and later earned a Ph.D. in Economics at Beida, is now one of the two most powerful leaders in China. Last November, he was catapulted into the top tier of the Communist Party during the party's once-in-a-decade leadership transition before being installed as China's premier in March. ""He gave me a good impression then and even now,"" Wang tells me as he takes a break from his Times Square protest. ""He exuded the spirit of Beida -- vigorous, who prevailed with reason, virtue and performance rather than race, nationality and bloodline."" But Wang thinks Li has a dual character. ""On the one hand, Li is keen, diligent, eloquent and open-minded, not arrogant. On the other, he is savvy, a good listener and a sharp observer of different opinions from different sides, but he never crosses the forbidden zones."" After college, Li avoided political activism and dissent, or studying overseas, as many of his contemporaries chose to do. Instead, he opted to climb the ladder of the Communist Youth League -- a training ground for communist leaders -- where he became the protégé of the former President Hu Jintao. Analysts say Li is a virtual political clone of Hu. Looking back at the colorful careers of these three Beida contemporaries -- Bo on the Left, Wang on the Right and Li in the Center -- I am reminded of how our alma mater is so closely linked with China's recent history and politics.","Wang Juntao, Bo Xilai, Li Keqiang were all students at Peking University in the 1970s .

"(CNN) -- It's the story which just refuses to go away -- and now a new FIFA ""whistle-blower"" has claimed bribes were offered in exchange for votes during the World Cup 2018 and 2022 bidding process. A former member of FIFA's ethics committee, Les Murray, says a member of the world governing body's executive committee asked a member of the Australian bid team for the 2022 World Cup for a kickback in exchange for a vote. ""I know of one particular instance where one of the Australia bid team was asked for cash money by one of the executive committee members,"" Murray told CNN. ""I then reported that to the chairman of the investigative chamber of the executive committee, Michael Garcia, so even I have this evidence."" The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments has been the subject of an independent FIFA investigation by American lawyer Garcia following allegations of corruption. Garcia's report led to two female ""whistle-blowers"" being identified, with Murray now the third individual to come forward and identify problems with the bidding process. But the American lawyer's report has become mired in controversy after German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator -- published a summary of the evidence the American had collated. FIFA's hopes of drawing a line over the World Cup bidding saga almost immediately evaporated when Garcia said the 42-page summary contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."" Murray, who also works with Australian broadcaster SBS, went on: ""I was on the FIFA ethics committee at the time. The FIFA ethics committee was not dealing with the bid process at that time. ""But once Michael Garcia began his investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, I reported this to Michael Garcia, as was my duty."" While Murray refused to name the person who is alleged to have asked for a financial incentive and whether they are a current FIFA executive committee member, he says he was not surprised by the incident. ""A very high level official, a trusted, reliable person who I know reported this to me. This person is a member of the Australian bid team,"" said the 69-year-old Murray, who is known as Australia's 'Mr. Football. ""Matters related to the 2018/2022 enquiry are solely handled by the investigatory chamber of the independent FIFA Ethics Committee and as such we are not in position to make any comments,"" said FIFA in a statement. ""But we have passed on your enquiry to the FIFA Ethics Committee accordingly."" In September Garcia said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions, though FIFA has always maintained it should remain private over confidentiality issues. ""So that's an impasse that should be sorted,"" said Murray, who was a member of the Ethics Committee between 2003 and 2013, and as of July 2012 a member of the Investigatory Chamber, according to FIFA, before he left the organization just over a year aog. ""In my opinion it should be published, of course,"" added the Australian. ""If there is going to be transparency you cannot keep things from the public and FIFA has to publish these things in the end."" However Murray's intervention came as a surprise to one former member of the Australian bid team. ""The idea of Les Murray being a 'whistle-blower' is interesting, but not one that's weighed down by evidence,"" Bonita Mersiades, former head of corporate affairs for the bid team, told CNN. ""It's time to stop hiding behind this culture of silence and the quaint concept of confidentiality that pervades FIFA,"" she added. ""Les says he is 'perfectly free to talk about this', yet he is coy when asked who it is. Fans are entitled to know."" If Murray refused to name names surrounding the allegations of bribery, he was more forthcoming in his views on Qatar winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The Gulf State has repeatedly denied allegations that it bought votes and was cleared of any wrongdoing in the 42-page summary released by Eckert. ""The only possible explanation for Qatar winning that World Cup bid, in my view, is because there was some funny business going on, and with that being the case and there being no other explanation, this story is not going to go away,"" said Murray. Murray also believes that FIFA made a ""big mistake"" by allowing the World Cup to go to Qatar citing the nation's human rights records as one area of concern. ""I think FIFA made a big mistake in awarding Qatar the World Cup for many reasons,"" he said. ""Among them is that it's probably among the most morally corrupt regimes in the world, it treats its migrant workers like slaves, it has draconian medieval laws that are not in keeping with modern civilization. ""Its human rights record doesn't make the country fit to be a host of the World's greatest sporting event. ""I am hoping FIFA will be much more careful who it awards the World Cup hosting rights to, or at least it tries to compel a future host of the World Cup to clean up its act in the area of human rights before the tournament can actually take place in that country."" Last month, Qatar was back in the headlines after winning the right to host the 2019 World Athletics Championship. That decision was also met with criticism by human rights groups who are unhappy at the Gulf State's treatment of migrant workers. In a statement, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months. ""A new sponsorship law, currently under review, that will replace the outdated ""kafala"" system will be announced by next year,"" said the statement. ""Kafala"" is an employment sponsorship system that regulates the relationship between employers and migrant workers in several Gulf states. ""We are also working on laws to cover domestic workers,"" the statement added. ""As in every country in the world, change does not happen overnight. Significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish, but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in Qatar. ""Our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year.""

"(CNN) -- In short, it wasn't the return Tiger Woods had hoped for. Making his first competitive outing since missing the cut at the U.S.PGA Championship in August, Woods posted a five-over par 77 in the first round at the Hero World Challenge at Florida's Isleworth Golf and Country Club. The 14-time major champion, who has struggled with a back injury all year, got off to the worst possible start with three bogeys and a double bogey in the opening nine holes. A birdie -- his only one of the day -- came at the par four 12th hole, but was immediately canceled out at the next hole with a bogey six where, incredibly, he took three chips to get his ball onto the green. ""Today, it was weird, I didn't feel like I hit it that bad,"" Woods told reporters. ""My short game was awful, and I didn't make anything. It certainly is surprising that I could hit chips that poorly. Just flubbed them,"" he added. ""I felt comfortable on a lot of the chip shots this week as I was playing practice rounds off the tighter spots. But when it got a little grainier, just wasn't as good as I needed it to be."" Woods' round left him lying in last place in the 18-man tournament, four shots off compatriots Patrick Reed and Billy Horschel who are tied for 16th and a distant 11 shots off first-round leader Jordan Spieth. The attention surrounding Woods' return has been heightened after he announced at the end of last month that he had hired Chris Como as his new swing ""consultant."" Como replaces coach Sean Foley, who parted ways with Woods in August after a four-year partnership that yielded eight victories but crucially no major titles. With Como it could be a case of back to the future. Woods said he was ""excited"" by what the 36-year-old, whose has previously coached South African Trevor Immelman, is bringing to his game. ""It is new, but it is old,"" Woods said earlier this week. ""We looked at a lot of video from when I was a junior -- even when I came out there and had some really nice years where I hit the ball really well. We went back to some of those old videos and really looked at it. ""And it was quite interesting to see where my swing was then and how much force I could generate with a very skinny frame. How did I do that? How do I generate that much power? That's kind of what we are getting back into. Woods hinted that the changes may already be taking effect. ""I don't feel like I'm hitting it very hard. But it's coming off the face faster,"" he said. According to Golf Digest, Como has been studying for a master's degree in biomechanics at Texas Woman's University, working under Dr. Young-Hoo Kwon. Adopting a less stressful way of striking the ball could finally allow the 38-year-old to build up a competitive head of steam -- his tour appearances have been increasingly sporadic in recent seasons. Despite undergoing back surgery to rectify a pinched nerve in April, Woods has struggled to regain full fitness and has played just seven tournaments in all this year. An acceptance of his physical restrictions that age brings about may also help Woods, once the longest hitter on tour. ""I can't blow it out there with some of the longer guys any more. Back when I was younger a long ball was 290 [yards] in the air. That was a big ball. Now it's 320, 325. That's the new standard out here,"" he told reporters earlier this week. But he refuses to right off his chances of competing consistently at the highest level in the years ahead. ""You can win at a very late age because you don't have to physically dominate anybody, you just have to beat the golf course,"" he said earlier this week. ""And it is one of the reasons why you saw Sam Snead win at age 54, looked like Tom [Watson] was going to win the British Open at 59 and Greg [Norman] was part of the lead in the British Open when he was 54. ""I'm not quite 40 yet so I've still got some time."" Read more: Tiger 'an inspiration' says Lindsey Vonn .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago, when tanks and automatic rifles silenced massive political demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, I was TIME magazine's correspondent in China. For me, memories of the crackdown start in the early evening of June 3, and end with a mad dash at the wheel of a Toyota sedan, driving through checkpoints to a safe house with hunger strikers, Liu Xiaobo and Hou Dejian. Liu, one of China's prominent intellectuals and writers, was imprisoned four times after the Tiananmen crackdown, and in 2010 was awarded the Nobel Peace prize. Hou is a singer-composer, better known in China as composer of the ""Descendants of the Dragon,"" a patriotic tune popular in Taiwan and the mainland. A few years before the crackdown, he ""defected"" from Taiwan and became a celebrated compatriot on the mainland. Tension builds . In the early evening of June 3, as word spread that the authorities were losing patience with protesters in central Beijing, I decided to see for myself what was going on. As I stepped off the curb on the Jianguomen bridge, I saw a convoy of army trucks stranded on the bridge, about five kilometers east of Tiananmen Square. Students and their supporters milled around them, chanting ""Xia lai! Xia lai!"" (Come down!). Minutes earlier, an armoured personnel carrier of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) plowed through the crowd and rammed one of their own army trucks bound for Tiananmen Square. Many civilians had clambered onto the truck when it was hit and toppled over. Some managed to jump off, but one man was crushed to death. ""They're killing us,"" shrieked a young woman. Nearby I saw civilians surround another army truck, pleading with the soldiers to turn around and go home. The young soldiers listened silently. Some cried. Then the civilians started to pull the soldiers off the truck and led them past the body of a man curled up on a pool of blood, his head crushed. This harrowing scene was captured on the cover of TIME Magazine's June 12 edition. I hung around for an hour or so, talking to people and eavesdropping on conversations. Then, worried that the Chinese authorities might cut international phone service, I returned to my apartment to file my story. It was nearly midnight when I hit the ""send"" button. Final showdown to come . I thought it was the lead story of the day. I did not realize that the fiercest shooting was taking place at Muxidi, around seven kilometers west of the Square, where thousands of people had stood behind the barricades at various intersections to halt the advance of the military troops. In the morning of June 3, I sat down with two fellow TIME reporters who had been covering the Tiananmen story from the outset. We agreed that the final showdown between the protesters and soldiers was looming. Martial law remained in place, and troops and tanks were poised to retake the Square. When and how it would happen, we could not tell. To ensure that we covered what seemed like the end-game of the protracted student protests, we agreed to do two things: 1. We would work on three ""shifts"" through the next day (I volunteered to do the midnight-to-dawn ""graveyard shift"") and 2. We would file reports via our snail-paced modems as soon as possible, in case international phone links were abruptly cut off. Just past midnight on Sunday, June 4, 1989, I was preparing to rush to Tiananmen Square to do my reportorial ""shift."" The phone rang and I grabbed it as I slung my satchel bag over my shoulder. It was an American friend, a well-connected expatriate company manager married to the daughter of a retired Chinese general. ""Be careful, Jimi,"" he advised. ""Heard the assault order has just been given. Stay indoors."" I thanked him for the tip. Not long after I hung up, the phone rang again. It was Sandra Burton, TIME's Beijing bureau chief, calling from the vicinity of the Square. I was supposed to relieve her for the graveyard shift. ""They're shooting live bullets here,"" she said urgently. ""Don't come here anymore. Phone New York and tell editors what's going on."" It was Saturday noon, New York time, and I knew the latest weekly edition was about to go to press. I frantically dialed New York and promptly reached a top editor. ""We're switching covers,"" he said decisively. ""You guys have seven hours to file. Stay out of the firing line. Remember, no story is worth dying for,"" he said calmly. The TIME cover story that week told the horrific account of that fateful night. Since then, the Tiananmen story has been told and retold countless times all over the world with that day's harrowing tales and bloody images. Race to a safe house . Of course, the story didn't end there, though the lead article had gone to print. I drove to the TIME office to file more reports from TIME reporters and photographers. Remarkably, international phone lines remained open despite occasional threats to close them. Still, the bureau's two computers and one telephone modem were agonizingly slow. I tuned in local radio stations to monitor official news reports and commentaries, and started phoning sources. A septuagenarian Beijing resident told me: ""I've seen World War II, I saw the communist occupation of Beijing in 1949, but I've never seen such a pili pala (hail of gunshots)!"" I banged away at the bureau computer until nearly noon. With the story filed and the magazine put the ""bed,"" I was preparing to leave the bureau when the phone rang. A female caller wondered if I could drive over to the Capital Hospital to pick up my friend Hou Dejian so he could go to a safe house. She made it sound so easy. It was not. In late May, just as the Tiananmen protests were petering out, Hou and three young Chinese intellectuals, led another round of ""hunger strike"" on the Square and gave a boost to the sagging student movement. When the PLA troops encircled the Square in the early morning of June 4, Hou helped broker the agreement with the army officers to open a corridor for the protesters to leave the Square safely. From the Square, it turned out, Hou took refuge in the Beijing hospital not far from the Square. Could I help? I hesitated but then agreed. I drove past carcasses of trucks and debris from the barricades along the virtually empty streets. Only helmeted PLA soldiers brandishing AK-47s stood stiffly at every other corner. As I pulled in front of the Capital Hospital, Hou and two other fellow hunger-strike leaders emerged from the gate and jumped into my car. On our way toward the safe-house, we stumbled into a group of PLA troops in one intersection. ""Shall I proceed?"" I ask the trio. ""Yes,"" replied Liu. ""No other choice,"" Hou agreed. We drove past the checkpoint and made it to their destination. Once inside the safe house, I was rewarded with three separate debriefings and eyewitness accounts of what happened on the Square when the PLA came to clear it. Months later, Hou gave me the ultimate compliment by sending a cassette tape of his latest songs. On the cover, he scribbled: ""To the bravest driver in Beijing.""","Jaime A.

"(CNN) -- Take one dentist, a catsuit, a horse and a barrel, and you have a world champion. Four days a week, 25-year-old Joanne Eccles examines teeth in Kinross, north of Edinburgh. She spends the rest of her time clad in spandex, performing gymnastics on a horse. Her sport? Vaulting. The British rider is the favorite for August's World Equestrian Games, having won world titles in 2010 and 2012. ""I've been vaulting since I was eight. After that, everything had to fit around it,"" she says. ""I'm maybe not quite so enthusiastic about being a dentist, but I can earn a living and still get the most out of my vaulting."" Here are the basics: you get on a moving horse and perform leaps, handstands, tumbles and other acrobatic moves on the animal's back, while it canters in a circle. You can compete as an individual (where Eccles excels), as a pair (the ""pas de deux"") or as a team of six. Men and women of all ages can compete together. Eccles sometimes performs with her 22-year-old sister Hannah, who has also represented Britain. ""I still get to throw my little sister around, it's brilliant,"" she says. Even her father, John, is involved. He is Joanne's ""lunger"" -- which means his job is to guide the horse from the center of the arena while she competes. Lunging is an important job: when vaulters win medals, the lunger gets one, too. (The horse, meanwhile, must settle for everyone's lasting gratitude.) ""The lunger is in constant contact and communication with the horse,"" explains Craig Coburn, a leading vaulting judge. ""You have to work to keep the horse's pace and tempo, keep it paying attention to what's going on."" Eccles says her dad was less than impressed as a spectator at her early domestic competitions. ""He thought it was so boring,"" she recalls. ""But then I was the reserve for a big international event, and he realized that if you're at a high level, it's a brilliant sport. ""So he looked into getting a horse himself, he got into it, and now he's a coach and judge as well as my lunger."" John Eccles is not the first parent to revise their opinion of vaulting. When Sheri Benjamin took her eight-year-old girl to pick up hay for their rabbit at a nearby California farm, she had not planned on raising a vaulting world champion. However, there was a demonstration taking place at the farm, and a coach overheard daughter Megan's excitement. ""We knew nothing about it,"" recalls Benjamin. ""You can't imagine our amazement when we went up to this ranch, and here were these athletes on the backs of horses, doing all sorts of gymnastics and dance moves. ""I looked at that and thought, no way in hell am I going to let Megan do this."" Five years later, the Benjamins had a horse on each side of the Atlantic. By the age of 18, in 2006, Megan Benjamin had won world gold for the United States. ""I swear I'm not a bad mom,"" adds Sheri, who claims vaulting is statistically safer than playing on a playground. ""When Megan first wanted to ride a horse, they said she was too young to go into the regular riding program, but they would let her vault -- because an adult controls the horse, and a three-year-old can do it with the horse at walking pace. They can build up."" This is where the barrel comes in. If you go straight to the horse with a new move, chances are you will eat sand after a nasty fall moments later. A vaulting barrel is the answer. ""You can build your own,"" explains Coburn. ""It's basically an oil drum with four steel legs on the bottom -- long and round, with handles on it, and wrapped in padding."" You practice new moves on a mat and then go on to the barrel, says former competitor Lucy Bell, who now manages the British team at big events. ""The horses themselves are wrapped up in cotton wool, you train on them just a couple of times a week,"" she explains. ""The rest of the time? You'd be on that barrel."" New moves, and new links between moves, are the lifeblood of the sport. ""Something the judges haven't seen before, so the sport progresses,"" says Bell. For Eccles, that means the one-handed handstand -- a move many would find tricky on the ground, but which she must pull off while balancing upside-down on a cantering horse. ""A new move sets you apart from the rest and nobody else had done a one-handed handstand before,"" Eccles says. ""I tried it in France last month and it worked. Now a lot of people know I can do it, so there is more pressure to do it again."" Flexibility is an obvious asset for a vaulter -- the sport attracts plenty of young gymnasts, though Eccles insists she had very little bend as a child. ""I had to be held down and stretched by three other people, which I absolutely hated,"" she recalls. Strength is another vital component, sometimes masked by the necessity for vaulters to compete in all-in-one catsuits. ""What Megan had going for her was her upper-body strength,"" Sheri Benjamin says of her daughter, who played ice hockey before taking up vaulting. ""After she had been vaulting for two or three years, we went to watch the X Games, and there was a Marine Corps recruiting booth which had a pullup contest. ""Megan waited in line, got up there and popped off 25 pullups, aged 10 or 11. ""All the boys behind her melted out of the line after she finished. The recruiter said she could be a marine any time."" As a judge, Coburn looks for exactly the right balance of skills before awarding scores (from one to a maximum of 10). ""I'm looking for a vaulter that is smooth, and light, and in harmony with the horse. They're not springing off the horse like it's a trampoline, they are in motion with the horse as if they are one,"" he says. ""When you leap off the back of a horse, if you are in perfect harmony, you go up as the horse's stride is going up -- so you leap without jumping. ""When you land down on the horse, you land in sync with the horse, as softly as a feather on the ground. Performances will give you goosebumps when that's the case."" So who are the ""goosebumps candidates"" at the World Equestrian Games? Germany is historically the sport's leading nation. Austria and France are contenders, and the U.S. has improved dramatically. But Sheri Benjamin believes Eccles, the defending individual champion, is still the best. ""She is the person to beat,"" says Benjamin, whose daughter retired from vaulting in 2012. ""It amazes me that she continued to vault through dental school."" Bell, who will be Eccles' team manager at the Games in Normandy, adds: ""Joanne is very calm, she can focus completely on what she has to do. ""Between her and her dad, they've taken every single part of the sport and worked out what you need to achieve."" Eccles herself is, for now, secretly watching vaulting clips over lunch with her dental nurse at the surgery. However, she has two tournament wins to her name in the past month and feels ready to return to the spotlight. ""When I started, we were just having a laugh,"" she says. ""We were lucky to do so well. ""Now, it feels like we're riding on the back of success. It gets better and better.""","World Equestrian Games champion Joanne Eccles is also a dentist .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is back on the prowl -- and this time he's after a journalist who has had the temerity to poke fun at him. It was clearly defined as a parody interview, but Woods' angry reaction to a piece by Dan Jenkins in Golf Digest has raised questions over whether the golf star was correct to respond -- and whether the journalist was right to write the spoof in the first place. Jenkins, who said he had had a request for an interview with Woods turned down by the player's agent Mark Steinberg because ""we don't see what we'd have to gain,"" goes to town poking fun at his target. He highlights Woods' title drought -- he hasn't won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open -- mentions 'Woods' habit of firing people (""It gives me something to do when I'm not shaping my shots"") and, oh, adds that he's a bad tipper. Jenkins' parody also has 'Woods' responding to a question about the New York Post headlines generated by his affairs by saying the moral of his story is ""don't get caught."" The fake interview also quotes the golfer as saying he thought about renaming his yacht Serenity, ""but that pretty much went out the door when the nine-iron hit the window of the Escalade,"" a reference to an incident in 2009 that sparked a media storm around Woods' private life. The golfer was divorced from Elin Nordegren in 2010. Headlined 'My (Fake) Interview With Tiger*,'the parody's sub-heading is: '*or how it plays out in my mind.' But Woods' angry response, in which he said Jenkins had created ""some jerk... to pretend he was talking to me,"" has elevated its status from that of a story near the back of the magazine's December issue into front page news. The 38-year-old American chose the Players' Tribune website -- created by former New York Yankees baseball star Derek Jeter -- as his forum to lambast the 84-year-old writer for ""a grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination."" Describing Jenkins' work as ""invented fiction"" and saying it ""fails as parody,"" Woods angrily asks: ""Journalistically and ethically, can you sink any lower?"" He writes: ""I like to think I have a good sense of humor, and that I'm more than willing to laugh at myself. This concocted article was below the belt. ""Good-natured satire is one thing, but no fair-minded writer would put someone in the position of having to publicly deny that he mistreats his friends, takes pleasure in firing people and stiffs on tips -- and a lot of other slurs, too."" Steinberg, who is repeatedly referred to in the spoof, has written to the magazine to call for an apology. But Jenkins was in no mood to say sorry, tweeting that he had given Woods an easy ride. James Corrigan, the golf correspondent of British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, defended the spoof and said Woods' reaction was ""pathetic -- the self-pitying cries of an arrogant and yes, ignorant billionaire. You couldn't have made it up, even if you tried."" Corrigan added: ""Warning for any easily offended sporting superstar out there: if you really do not want everyone to read a negative article, then do not tell everyone not to read it. Because, erm, everyone will then go and read it. ""Parodies imitate with the intention to lampoon. The target is not supposed to find them amusing. Other people are. And many other people are doing exactly that in huge numbers, thanks to Woods' intervention."" Writing in USA Today, Christine Brennan opined: ""I think we can be assured it's a complete success as parody, because Tiger is so upset about it.""","Golf Digest published spoof interview about Tiger Woods by journalist Dan Jenkins .

"(CNN) -- The Queen would most certainly approve. Charlotte Dujardin, Britain's double Olympic champion, broke her own dressage world record on Tuesday night, in front of a rapturous home crowd in London. On board Valegro, the pair posted a new mark of 87.740, eclipsing their previous best of 87.129, which was set at the World Cup in April. The news is also sure to delight Buckinhgham Palace, Dujardin revealing recently the Queen had said of her prowess: ""no-one rides like this young lady."" ""To break another world record is fantastic,"" Dujardin was quoted as saying on Team GB's official website. ""I just went in there to enjoy it as Valegro and I hadn't competed since the World Equestrian Games and didn't want to put pressure on him. ""But we both love Olympia and the amazing atmosphere and it's great to achieve this and we'll just go out again and let rip on Wednesday."" The 29-year-old only began competing at the top level of dressage three years ago but is the current World, European and Olympic champion, becoming the first rider in the sport's history to hold all its major titles. Dujardin, known by the moniker ""The Girl with the Dancing Horse"" in her native Great Britain, was recently crowned Sunday Times & Sky Sports Sportswoman of the Year. And she recently spoke of her visit to the Palace to meet the Monarch, who is an avid fan of horse racing and dressage. ""She was absolutely amazing,"" Dujardin explained of her meeting with Queen Elizabeth II in a recent interview with The Guardian newspaper. ""I was talking to two ladies and she came over and said: 'I have to tell you two that there is no other girl that rides like this young lady.' And I was like: 'Oh my god the Queen has just said that!' You don't expect that from the Queen. ""I was thinking: 'Does she know all this because she has researched me, or does she follow what I do?' But when we talked further she knew so much about me, far more than you could read."" Dujardin's prowess has catapulted her into the limelight, with over 75,000 people voting for her during the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year contest. She came fourth in the annual vote to crown the sporting achievement of the year behind Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, four-time major golf champion Rory McIlroy and athlete Jo Pavey. After completing her ""grand slam"" of titles in September, she told CNN: ""If someone had asked me 'do you think that's possible?' I would have been like 'absolutely not. ""For it to have been possible and that I've actually done it is very surreal and something that I always have to think 'Oh my God!' I've won all of it. There's no more I can do.""","Charlotte Dujardin and horse Valegro post dressage world record .

"(CNN) -- The Premier League is supposed to be the most exciting in the world -- but there's something a little too predictable about it all this season. A decade ago, Arsenal won the title without losing a single game and was hailed as 'invincible' as it triumphed in 26 of its 38 fixtures. Now, 10 years later, there is a feeling that a new generation of invincible players are ready to emerge -- and they are wearing the blue of Chelsea. Another victory on Wednesday night, this time against Tottenham, takes Chelsea's unbeaten run to 14 league games and 21 in all competitions this season. Jose Mourinho's side sit six points clear at the top of the table ahead of Manchester City, the defending champion. Ostensibly, this is a two-horse race with Manchester United and Arsenal already well off the pace and Liverpool enduring a dismal start to the campaign. City, 4-1 winners at Sunderland courtesy of another couple of goals from the irrepressible Sergio Aguero, are still in the hunt, but there is something about this Chelsea side which makes it look so imperious. Already through to the last-16 of the Champions League and the quarterfinal of the League Cup, Mourinho has downplayed his side's chances of winning the quadruple before it enters the FA Cup in January. While such an achievement would be a stupendous achievement, the immediate question of securing the league title appears slightly more realistic. A 3-0 victory over London rival Tottenham was achieved with minimum fuss and the usual efficiency as Chelsea recovered from the surprise of only managing a goalless draw at Sunderland last weekend. ""We played against a very good team and they showed that during some periods in the game,"" Mourinho told the BBC. ""They started better than us and should have scored before us, but after our first goal our team became more stable and confident and we controlled the game. ""I'm really happy with the points, performance and spirit of the players. It's too heavy a result, though, for Tottenham."" There is nothing more appetizing to a Chelsea team than the visit of Tottenham -- a team which folds as soon as someone inside Stamford Bridge as much as sneezes. Tottenham's last win at Chelsea was back in 1990 and in the previous 57 meetings between the two sides, Spurs had managed just five victories. So even when the visiting side made a strong start to the contest and Harry Kane hit the crossbar, there were few imagining anything other than a Chelsea victory. They were to be proved correct of course. Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba both scored both the interval before Loic Remy added a third to seal the points. Spurs will not be the last team to be given a beating by Chelsea this season, this was the 11th time Mourinho's side have tasted success in 14 league games. City slickers . Chelsea's main challenge looks set to come from Manchester City which breezed to victory at Sunderland, a place where it has struggled in the past. City remained in touch at the top after coming from behind to win at Sunderland with Aguero playing a starring role yet again. The Argentine striker scored twice with Steven Jovetic and Paolo Zabaleta also on target after Sunderland had taken a surprise lead. Aguero, who has now scored 66 Premier League goals in 101 appearances, has managed 14 so far this season. Elsewhere, Arsenal grabbed a dramatic late winner to see off Southampton 1-0. Alexis Sanchez netted in the 89th minute to fire Arsenal to within two points of the Champions League places. ""It was a difficult game against a good side but we deserved to win, it was a victory of patience and intelligence and we kept our structure well,"" Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, told the BBC. ""We were jaded physically but Alexis Sanchez can dig deep and has such desire and a will to win, he still finds that resource to get you something special."" In the night's other game, Everton was held to a 1-1 draw by Hull City.","Chelsea makes it 14 games unbeaten in Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Joao Victor Marcari Oliva could become one of Brazil's brightest Olympic talents, if he can step out of the shadows of a legend: his mum. Oliva is the son of Hortencia Marcari, who led Brazil's women to the basketball world title in 1994 and Olympic silver at the Atlanta Games two years later. ""Hortencia is a celebrity at the level of a great soccer star here in Brazil,"" says basketball writer Marcos Antonio. ""She was a born scorer, a 'clutch player' -- it was almost impossible to block her shots. She was always on TV."" Oliva says: ""Every time I'm walking down the street with my mum, there are a lot of fans taking photos of her and people asking for autographs. Sometimes that gets boring -- but it's nice."" A fraction taller than his mother at 180 cm (5 foot 10 inches), the teen has shunned a career in basketball. His heart is set on an entirely different sport: dressage. ""I have my mother's blood when it comes to sport, but my father bred horses. When I was young, I spent all my time with them,"" says the 18-year-old, whose mother played in the Atlanta '96 basketball final just months after he was born. ""If my mother was someone else, I wouldn't be talking to you. A lot of people in the media speak to me because they know my mum. I think that's a good thing: it's good for me, and good for my job."" With a home Olympic Games two years away, the Brazilian equestrian team is in the middle of an unprecedented push for success on the world stage. Oliva belongs to the next generation of Brazilian riding talent hoping to capture imaginations, if not medals, at Rio 2016. Brazil has virtually no history of dressage -- one of three equestrian disciplines at the Olympics -- so Oliva has moved to Germany, one of the sport's leading nations, to find better tuition. ""I don't want to win in Rio -- I don't think that's possible,"" he says. ""I have a lot to learn and Europe is too strong in the sport. But I'm here, and I will learn like a European. I think I can be a good rider."" The nation has hired world-renowned experts to help its riders develop. New Zealand's Mark Todd, for example, is coaching the Brazilian eventing team. Todd is one of the most successful riders in the history of eventing, which combines dressage, cross-country riding and showjumping. At 58, he has twice won Olympic titles (in 1984 and 1988) alongside three bronze medals, including one at London 2012. ""The Brazilians are a long way behind, but they're very enthusiastic,"" says the 58-year-old, who coaches some of the riders at his base in Wiltshire, England, alongside several trips to South America each year. ""One of the things which struck us most is how little they knew. Yes, they could all ride. But as far as training horses goes? A lot of them didn't have much of an idea about basic stuff. ""Another thing I will say is that the funding system from the government is very hard to fathom. Although there is money available, the system isn't practical and there are huge amounts of red tape. You're asked to do a job and they say there will be help, but you spend six months of the year faffing around."" Moving to Europe, like those who have moved to train with Todd, is a rite of passage for many Brazilian riders. Standards are markedly higher east of the Atlantic. Showjumper Marlon Zanotelli moved to Belgium to further his career, even though -- unlike dressage and eventing -- his discipline has history in Brazil. Zanotelli is aiming to follow in the footsteps of his hero, Rodrigo Pessoa, at his home Games in Rio. Pessoa, now 41, became a star of Brazilian horse sport by winning jumping gold at the Athens Olympics in 2004. He has a world title and many other honors to his name. ""Rodrigo has always been my idol,"" says Zanotelli. ""When they talk about horses, people talk about Rodrigo -- even people who have never seen showjumping. They know who he is. ""There will never be another Rodrigo but I want to win medals and events like he did."" The 26-year-old spent his childhood on the road with his father, a moderately successful eventer named Mario, at tournaments across Brazil. ""Everything is completely different in Europe,"" says the younger Zanotelli. ""In Brazil almost everyone has grooms, everyone is spoiled. Here in Europe, most people do all the jobs themselves -- they help the horse themselves, they know how to do everything. ""Luckily, my dad always made me do everything too, so I had some experience of that. Otherwise, I would have arrived here and been completely lost."" Brazil has no shortage of aspiring talent: comparatively new faces like Oliva and Zanotelli line up alongside the likes of Doda Miranda in showjumping and Roger Clementino -- the first African-Brazilian to reach the Olympics, who taught a young Oliva -- in dressage. Then there is Luiza Almeida, who made her Olympic dressage debut at Beijing 2008 aged just 16, the youngest equestrian rider in the history of the Games. But Todd says Brazil's success in 2016 will depend on finding quality horses before Rio. ""No matter how good the riders are, you've got to have good horses, too,"" he cautions. ""And good horses take time to produce. ""One of the biggest problems for Brazil is the lack of horse power. Although the Olympics are two years away, two years is nothing in terms of getting a horse educated to compete against all the other countries at the top level."" The Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games, taking place in France, are the biggest test of Brazilian riders -- and their current lineup of horses -- prior to the Rio Olympics. But the riders are already looking to Rio, and what could be the greatest equestrian show of their lives. ""Brazil will put on a great party,"" says Zanotelli, who rode well to sit 22nd, seven places behind compatriot Pessoa, after two rounds of showjumping at the World Equestrian Games. ""Many people said many things about the World Cup -- even Brazilians were saying bad things about it -- but in the end, it was a big success. ""This is a big country, and we have a lot of issues, but when the time comes for an event we have really good people who love to host foreigners and put on a good show. ""Every day, when you wake up in the morning, an Olympics in your own country gives you the motivation to keep working. I think it's going to be amazing.""","Son of Brazilian basketball star is Rio Olympics hopeful in dressage .

"(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn will have to wait a little longer to equal the all-time record for World Cup race wins. Fresh from her triumph in Saturday's downhill at Val d'Isere, the American star had high hopes in the super-G but crashed out after hitting a gate mid-course. It left the way clear for Elisabeth Goergl to lead an Austrian one-two ahead of Olympic champion Anna Fenninger -- with World Cup overall points leader Tina Maze in third. For Vonn, who needs one more victory to tie the great Annemarie Moser Proll's record of 62 wins, there was disappointment but relief that she had escaped unscathed. She has only just returned to the alpine skiing circuit after right knee surgery which saw her miss the Olympic Games in Sochi earlier this year. ""I was a little tired,"" Vonn admitted as she reflected on her mishap. ""Yesterday was a great day, but a very long day and it takes a lot of energy. I skied pretty well on the top section and I was at my limit and I missed a little bit of elevation and I wasn't able to make the gate,"" she told the official website of the International Skiing Federation (FIS). ""The positive thing is that my knees are good and I'm still going home for Christmas with a big smile."" Goergl was also smiling after a superb display on the OK piste at the French resort, clocking a time of one minute 25.42 seconds. It left her just 0.05 faster than Fenninger, with Slovenia's ever-consistent Maze a further 0.08 seconds adrift. ""The course today was really tricky and I kind of like that. I had everything clear in my head and my coaches reported that there were some weird turns and what I had to do. ""It was great team work and it turned out fine,"" she said. It was her seventh World Cup win, her third in super-G, denying Fenninger, who had won at Solden earlier this year. Maze holds a 249-point lead in the overall standings ahead of Fenninger, with Vonn in third, 344 points adrift. Sunday also saw another giant slalom win for Austria's Marcel Hirscher, who was well clear of his rivals at Alta Badia in Italy. The triple overall World Cup champion finished 1.45 seconds clear of Olympic champion Ted Ligety of the United States, with Thomas Fanara of France completing the podium. Hirscher also went one clear of his legendary compatriot Franz Klammer for number of World Cup wins, racking up his 27th and fourth of the season, three coming in giant slalom. The 25-year-old also closed up on Norway's Kjetil Jansrud in this season's battle for the overall crown. Speed discipline specialist Jansrud won the downhill at Val Gardena Saturday, but Hirscher can overtake him in the standings with a strong showing in Monday's slalom on the floodlit Madonna di Campillo slope.

"(CNN) -- A string of sexual child abuse charges against a former Penn State assistant football coach includes an alleged shower incident that two current university officials are accused of covering up, prosecutors said Saturday. Jerry Sandusky, 67, who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, allegedly engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years, according to an investigative grand jury's summary of testimony. ""This is a case about a sexual predator who used his position within the university and community to repeatedly prey on young boys,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Saturday in announcing the charges. In some cases, Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, promised the boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers, according to the grand jury. Some of the incidents allegedly occurred in Penn State athletic facilities. Sandusky, who retired from coaching in 1999, was founder of the Second Mile, a charitable organization that began as a group foster home ""dedicated to helping troubled boys,"" the grand jury states. ""Through the Second Mile, Sandusky had access to hundreds of boys, many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations,"" it added. Also named in the grand jury report are Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley, 57, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, who face charges of one count of perjury each. Curley and Schultz ""allegedly failed to report the sexual assault of a young boy after the information was brought to their attention, and later made false statements to a grand jury that was investigating a series of assaults on young boys,"" Kelly said. The two university officials are expected to surrender Monday. Sandusky, who was arrested and released Saturday on $100,000 unsecured bail, faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and numerous other charges, including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, but defense attorney Joseph Amendola told CNN Johnstown affiliate WJAC he expects it be postponed in order for attorneys to have enough time to bring in witnesses. Sandusky has known about the allegations for three years, the lawyer said. ""Jerry feels like because of his background and reputation it took a long time to reach this conclusion and he's been ready for it,"" Amendola told WJAC. The grand jury investigation was initiated by the claims of one boy who alleged that Sandusky had ""indecently assaulted"" him and engaged in sex acts while the boy was a guest at his home, according to the attorney general. The victim met Sandusky through the former coach's Second Mile charity, Kelly said. Sandusky allegedly used expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games, golf clubs, a computer and money, Kelly said. The relationship, which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008, included overnight stays at Sandusky's home, where touching led to sexual acts, according to Kelly and grand jury testimony. ""One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002, in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus,"" Kelly said. ""Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty, a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old."" The assistant reported the incident to head football coach Joe Paterno, who in turn alerted athletic director Curley, Kelly said. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from Second Mile visit the football building, Kelly said. Specifically, the grand jury found that Curley committed perjury in repeatedly denying that he had ever been told that Sandusky had engaged in sexual misconduct with a child, Kelly said. ""Assertions by Schultz that the allegations concerning Sandusky were 'not that serious' and that he and Curley 'had no indication that a crime had occurred' were in direct contradiction to other testimony and constituted perjury,"" Kelly wrote. In all, the grand jury identified eight boys, ranging in age from about 8 to 14, who were the targets of similar sexual advances or assaults by Sandusky from 1994-2009. All of the victims first encountered Sandusky through Second Mile activities, Kelly said. Authorities said they are continuing to search for additional victims and that the case remains active. Penn State President Graham Spanier said in a statement that the allegations against the former coach are ""troubling,"" and that the investigation is appropriate. With regards to Curley and Schultz, Spanier said they have his ""unconditional support."" ""I have complete confidence in how they have handled the allegations about a former University employee,"" he said, adding that the charges are ""groundless.""

"(CNN) -- Zara Phillips is not one to rest on her laurels. After giving birth for the first time in January -- providing Queen Elizabeth II's fourth great-grandchild -- the equestrian star could be forgiven for taking a break from the harsh demands of the stables. Yet just three months on, the British Head of State's eldest granddaughter would find herself back on that familiar saddle competing once more. By August, she had remarkably gone a long way to likely booking her place in what will be her second Olympic Games. ""It was harder than I thought it was going to be. I had a lot of friends who said, 'Don't come back too quickly.' I sat on a horse about five weeks after (giving birth),"" Phillips tells the CNN Equestrian show. But come back quickly she did. Eight and a half months after Mia Grace Tindall -- the 16th in line for the throne in Britain -- was born on January 17, her mother placed 11th in the eventing at the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games in Normandy, helping her nation to silver and Olympic qualification. Phillips' performance in France, which among the UK riders was only bettered by world No. 1 William Fox-Pitt, could well be enough to persuade Britain's Olympic selectors that she is worthy of a spot in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. The master plan had come to fruition. ""I always wanted to get back for the Worlds at the right time,"" Phillips says. ""I've given myself enough time to get back where I left off."" The objective now, as well as bringing up her daughter with rugby star husband Mike Tindall, is winning Olympic gold. She claimed team eventing silver at London 2012, where she was presented her medal by her mother Princess Anne -- who competed for Britain in equestrian at the Montreal '76 Games. Her father, Mark Phillips, won eventing gold at Munich '72 and silver in Seoul 16 years later. Phillips' parents divorced in 1992. Yet despite now being a fully-fledged Olympian, the 33-year-old Zara still feels she has some unfinished business to attend to when she, if all goes to plan, touches down in Rio in two years' time. ""When you come out of the Olympics you just go, 'Let's just do it all again,' "" Phillips says. ""To be able to come out with a medal (in London) was incredible. But we wanted gold and we probably should have got it. ""We'd definitely like to go back and try and change the color."" In 2012, Phillips had a whole host of royalty fighting her corner, with Princes William and Harry, to name just a few, among those cheering on their relative from the stands. Come 2016, Mia -- who will be superseded as the youngest member of Britain's royal family when William's wife Catherine gives birth for the second time -- could be watching her mother's bid to win gold, having already spent time on the equestrian circuit. ""She's been on the road. There's so many kids on the circuit, so many people who've had babies already,"" Phillips says. ""We're lucky because we can ride and go back and forth a bit, it fits in really well. It seems to have worked and hopefully it will keep going like that."" Having admitted to not feeling maternal before Mia's birth, Phillips has since treasured the experience of becoming a mother for the first time. ""I've really enjoyed it. In a funny kind of way it's like having another type of high-performance horse on your hands,"" she jokes. ""It's an incredible bond you have. I'm lucky, she's really good."" Phillips has had plenty of experience developing special bonds down the years, having nurtured a number of relationships with her horses since being introduced to riding as a child by her equine-loving family. It was with her beloved Toytown that she first started competing properly, soon going on to become both a European and world champion -- taking continental glory in 2005 and 2007, while conquering the globe at the first attempt in 2006. Olympic success came alongside High Kingdom, and he could well be Phillips' partner in Rio, given that she rode the bay gelding in Normandy. ""I've had him since he was a five-year-old,"" Phillips says of High Kingdom, now 13. ""We've come up the levels together and taught each other everything. ""I'm trying to teach him. I think it really helps that I've had him for that long and know him very well."" Phillips' equestrian career, though, has not come without its setbacks. Injury to the now-retired Toytown cost her likely selection for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, while lightning unfortunately struck twice four years later as another injury to the chestnut gelding ruled her out of Beijing. Phillips also broke her collarbone in 2008 after falling off Tsunami II, and the horse had to be put down. ""I think you get to see the signs when things are really good and when things aren't so good,"" Phillips reflects. ""You would hope that you would notice before anything went too wrong. And that's what you always try."" She remains ever-indebted to the role her family have played in helping to lay the foundations for her successful career. Her grandmother, one of the great patrons of British horse racing, still rides at the age of 88. ""I remember always being around the yard and being around horses. It was great fun, you know,"" Phillips says. ""You get this passed down through the family and that's where it sort of came from. Obviously we're very grateful to our family and hobbies and traditions, and the love and passion they've got for the horses has filtered down through the years."" ""Horses mean everything to me,"" Phillips adds. ""They're what I do -- my work and my passion. I'm very lucky.""","Zara Phillips helps Britain qualify for 2016 Olympics less than nine months after giving birth .

"(CNN) -- In parts of France, he is regarded as sailing's answer to David Beckham, but Alex Thomson is just happy to be alive rather than fretting about his potential celebrity status. Eight years ago Thomson was quietly lying in the bunk of his yacht in the early hours of a Thursday morning listening to his iPod when his near-death experience began. In the heart of the Southern Ocean, 1,000 miles from the nearest land, South Africa, his boat suddenly pitched completely to its side. With his keel broken, Thomson began his battle to stay alive. ""Things go through your mind like 'is this it?'"" he recalls of what remains the biggest low of his career during the Velux 5 Oceans race in 2006. ""But then survival kicks in. What else are you going to do? Everyone else says 'that's amazing' but you don't have a choice. No one else is going to help you."" Except someone did come to his aid -- his sailing nemesis Mike Golding, with whom Thomson had spectacularly fallen out with on the eve of the race. Thomson had opted not to finish the prologue race while leading -- superstitiously believing that to do so would scupper his chances of overall victory. No prologue winner had ever won the race. It meant that Golding, who was also planning a similar strategy, took the win -- and was left fuming. ""He felt that I'd stitched him up on purpose,"" says Thomson. ""Words were said, a slanging match ensued and he called me a 'jumped-up little pr**k.'"" Despite the pair's spat, Golding gave up his own race ambitions -- he was second at the time -- to rescue a sailor in need. It took Golding a further 10 hours to reach Thomson, before the pair opted -- in the sleet and snow -- to undertake the rescue at first light. Wearing his survival suit, Thomson jumped ship into his life raft amid a 15-foot swell approaching the eye of a storm. Three times, Golding tried to undertake the high speed and treacherous rescue. Only to fail three times. During the fourth attempt, which was ultimately successful, Thomson broke his arm as he held on to some webbing. ""I remember an albatross sat in the water next to me in the life raft as I left myself go from the boat,"" says Thomson. ""The albatross felt like a mascot -- it gave me a warm feeling. Mike felt all the responsibility on him and he saw it differently -- he felt like it was a vulture to him."" The pair hugged before collapsing, both exhausted on the deck before Thomson went into shock. Golding dressed his wounds and the pair had a cup of coffee before a 40-knot icy gust hit the boat resulting in the mast on Golding's yacht breaking. ""I remember saying 'I'm so sorry' and he stood over me and said 'do you know what the moral of the story is?' and I thought he was going to punch me. 'Don't come first or second in the prologue!'"" The pair worked tirelessly together for eight days to sail into Cape Town -- a city where Golding had married his wife -- and from that moment onwards understandably become the best of friends. The eight-year anniversary of their rescue has just passed but Thomson has not been put off by the perils of the high seas. When most people will be preparing to pop champagne corks on New Year's Eve, he will set off on his next quest, the Barcelona World Race, a two-man non-stop circumnavigation of the globe with Spanish sailor Pepe Ribas. Thomson is far more welcoming than the British seas on the day we meet. Boarding is done on the move from a rib (small speedboat) and seconds after the usual greeting niceties, I'm put in the driving seat. Sailing such a boat at a 35-degree angle as it creaks noisily underneath is unnerving, the steering column responsive to the slightest push from the curved blue seat from which Thomson dictates his myriad voyages. The bearded Thomson is not tall but oozes a physicality that makes you realize he is well equipped to take whatever the sea throws at him. One minute he is cracking a joke or recalling a past sailing anecdote, the next deadly serious barking instructions to his team on board. For the most part, though, Thomson likes to be alone, his long term goal a return to solo sailing in the 2016 Vendee Globe. At the back of his mind when he sets out on that particular venture, he does so knowing he may never come back again. ""The emotion is horrendous,"" he says looking back to the start of the last Vendee Globe when he finished third. ""Your family and friends are there, in fact 500,000 people are there at the start. They come to watch the start as they know that maybe you won't come back again."" His long-term mentor Sir Keith Mills, who is also a key figure in Ben Ainslie's America's Cup venture, reportedly told Thomson, ""I've been to Olympic Games, World Cup finals and I've never experienced anything like this."" In the Vendee region of France, Thomson says he is held up on a pedestal, given superstar status like Beckham. Locals will give him free drinks and meals, while the short walk on the harbor to his boat will see him stop to sign autographs for scores of fans. Back at home, the married father of two becomes invisible among the public. ""No one pays attention to me and I like that, although it's nice to be a superstar for a week or two."" The Vendee is a race that no Briton has ever won before and Thomson is determined to be the first but he knows that trip and his upcoming one from Barcelona are hard to take for his family. ""My wife [Kate] worries every day and not just her but the team as they are a family,"" he says. ""Sometimes you forget to call or you say 'sorry, got to go' as you need to ease the main sheet or whatever and then you forget to ring back. ""They'll be tearing their hair out as they're not in control of the situation."" But the sailing, and in particular the solo sailing, is a drug that he cannot give up, and something he says he would even do for free such is his obsession with the sport. ""If you're performing well, it's great. It's like every day winning the 100 meters as you always feel like you're performing. ""If you're not doing well it's like hell on earth. I've had both ends of the spectrum and I just love that performing end."" Thomson has gained notoriety for two sailing stunts, one in which he stood on the keel of his boat as it was titled to the side in race mode before jumping off, the other seeing him hurtle up the mast before diving into the ocean -- both times bedecked in a designer suit. Conscious of the risks involved of stunts and voyages alike, Thomson uses sports psychologist Ken Way to talk him through the emotions he is experiencing. ""I use Ken if I've got a challenge that needs overcoming,"" he says. ""When you're on deck, it's pretty scary but when you go inside your brain is screaming at you 'you're going to die.' ""So to be able to go to sleep when your body's pumping adrenalin into it and keeping you alive is really quite hard."" The psychologist has taught Thomson visualization exercises to keep his demons at bay. ""I visualize being above the boat but not in the clouds, outside it. I can look down at the boat, I can see it's windy, the waves are big but it's not too bad. ""I can see there are no icebergs, containers, whales. That allows me to calm down a bit but you have to work out what it is, how to address it and it takes months being able to deal with that."" Whatever the formula, it is clearly working. Thomson remains in a select band of about 100 people to have circumnavigated solo around the globe. Now he wants to be the quickest.","Alex Thomson on the perils of sailing around the world and his one near-death experience .

"London (CNN) -- For four decades, London's underground transport network has been Bob Mazzer's photographic playground. He has collected surprisingly intimate shots in what, for many, is a most impersonal environment. At times Mazzer's subjects stare straight down the camera; others are unaware of their role as protagonist in a decades-long story of the city. Mazzer, 65, was born in East London to a Jewish couple. His dad, Mottel, was a cabbie and his mother, Jean, a cultured woman who encouraged her son into the arts. Mazzer was given his first camera, an Ilford Sporti, for his Bar Mitzvah aged 13. He recalls taking his first picture, of the London Hilton, before being encouraged by an arts teacher who showed the budding photographer images by Irving Penn and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Mazzer began taking photographs on the London Underground as he commuted to and from his work as a cinema projectionist. ""It felt like a party that I was the official photographer of,"" he says. Eventually, ""I'd been doing it so long that it was my job. ""No one ever protested, or ever complained, or ever tried to stop me. So I kind of felt by accident that everyone thought it was cool."" What he's captured is an unexpectedly personal flip-book of London since the 1970s: The fashion, the buskers, drunks, runaways and love stories. Mazzer describes himself as a ""nosy-parker"" and ""social butterfly,"" who says he has ""always seen beautiful things."" His images capture ""shape, and form, and I love the textures, and I love the lighting and I like the poses. I like seeing what comes off people when I point the camera at them."" Mazzer says they merge into ""this kind of mish-mash of colours and texture and atmosphere and smiles and scowls. When it works it's really great. I look at some of these myself and think, 'how did I do that?'"" The insides of the carriages also reveal London's changing times, as the newspapers and cigarettes which once littered the floors made way for bright lights and iPads. When he first started, the Underground ""did look pretty grotty,"" Mazzer says. ""The stations were rough and that has a character which comes over in the pictures. I think people identify with that and it gives it this historical edge."" Now, Mazzer adds, the lights are ""neon and there's no atmosphere."" East London blog Spitalfields Life first championed the then little-known Mazzer's work in 2013, and was bombarded with responses. Spitalfields Life Books has now released the images in hardback, titled Bob Mazzer Underground, with a debut exhibition held in Shoreditch's Howard Griffin Gallery. Many of the subjects, Mazzer says, may be unaware they will feature. ""I did photograph a lot of people on the Tube, hundreds and hundreds. There are a lot of people out there who I'd like to think [might say] 'dammit, I wish I wasn't in this book.'"" His favorites include the theatrical peroxide blonde in the midst of a dramatic public phone call, the inter-racial couple in red and blue colors, which ""was like Mondrian and good vibes and equality,"" and the so-called ""Clockwell"" man whose perfectly upright body is topped by Stockwell Tube's clock. And, even as he instinctively snapped scenes that caught his eye, Mazzer knew the project had gravitas. ""When you shoot something for 30 to 40 years, even though I didn't consciously have a plan, I felt there was something even I didn't know about yet. And you suddenly become aware that you are documenting something that is going to have a historical bent to it."" After he has finished the interview, Mazzer is driven off, past Brick Lane's famous 24-hour bagel bakery. The doors frame a sweet scene of a woman with her little girl, wheeling a plastic scooter. Mazzer, his camera sticking out the window, captures the moment.

"(CNN) -- Dee Caffari did not seem born for a life on the high seas. One of the greatest female sailors on the planet clearly did not take after her mother Barbara, whose fear of water is so strong she will not even take a shower. So when Caffari announced she was quitting her job as a school teacher to pursue a career sailing some of the roughest oceans on the globe, unsurprisingly it sent shock waves through her mother. ""It's a bit beyond her as she's scared stiff of water, to the extent she won't shower as she doesn't like the sensation of water running over her,"" says Caffari of her mother. ""She has an understanding of what I do but, in genetics terms, I clearly have taken after my father."" Last week, Caffari set out from Cape Town with a course for Abu Dhabi and the 6,125 nautical miles in between as part of the all-female Team SCA on what will be her fifth yachting voyage around the world, this time in the Volvo Ocean Race. Caffari is the first woman to have sailed single-handed, non-stop around the world in both directions. ""I never dreamt this would happen, I never dreamt I'd once sail around the world,"" admits Caffari, who was teaching physical education to 11 to 18-year-olds and loved the job, meaning she had no great urgency to leave. Her first voyages on water were on a boat on the Thames with her father, Peter who, in many ways, was the inspiration for her change of career -- the 41-year-old quit her job not long after his death 15 years ago. ""It's strange because I loved my job and had a lot of fun but I had a craving as an adventurer and to travel,"" says Caffari of her job teaching from a classroom on England's south coast where she regularly saw sailing boast pass by in the distance. Water sports were the immediate calling -- first windsurfing and then scuba diving before she finally settled on her sport of choice, sailing, which she had, at least, done at university as part of her degree. ""I remember thinking 'this is something I could do',"" she recalls. ""I told my Mum I was going to take a break from teaching to go sailing and you should have seen her face. It was a picture -- her face just fell. I tried to reassure her by telling her I could go back to it if things didn't work out but thankfully they did. ""Now the only time I go back to school is to give talks, to hopefully inspire people and give them the confidence to dream."" As for Mum, her outlook has considerably shifted to one of pride, although still laced with a modicum of bemusement due to her own discomfort in water. For Caffari, leg 2 of the Volvo Ocean Race will be her first of the race. The last of the 14-strong team to sign a contract in March, she sat out the opening leg, with only 12 competitors allowed on board to race at any one time. It is perhaps befitting for this latecomer to professional sailing to be a latecomer to this latest venture. She expects to add a fresh gusto to her teammates and is very clear what her role will be on board, one she hopes to keep right until the race finish next year. ""I think I'm the Mum of the group, a combination of experience with this being my fifth time around the world but also the fact I'm the oldest in the group,"" she says. ""I'm hopefully the level-headed one so they can look to me for confidence, particularly as for many this will be their first time in the Southern Ocean. ""It's shell shock when you first go down there, it's the race's first big weather system and you realize how big the waves are and how cold it can be. But this is what I signed up for, this is the good stuff, when it's blowing 40 knots and icy -- that's fabulous."" Despite her positive outlook, like many other competitors in the race she too has her fears, in particular one of heights and another of fish, both of which she has to tackle head-on. She recalls her time in the 2005 Aviva Challenge race when she was stuck up the mast of her boat for three hours being flung around like a rag doll or having to squeamishly scoop up flying fish that have landed aboard her vessel during the Vendee Globe. But she has a remarkable aptitude for dealing with the harsh nature of the ocean from just 50 minutes sleep at a time during the Vendee Globe to being pumped up on painkillers after suffering a badly swollen knee but having to plough on in the race. Plus there is the issue of solitude -- at one point during her solo circumnavigation, the closest human beings to her were the astronauts on the International Space Station. On this journey, Team SCA currently lie in fourth place overall, defying critics who argued that an all-female team could not match their male counterparts in such a rigorous race. ""The sport itself is still pretty male dominated,"" she explains, ""but I think it's beginning to change that it doesn't matter whether you're male or female. We're all in the same boat doing the same stuff in the same conditions. Hopefully we're breaking down the stereotypes and I believe our peers see us as proper competitors. ""We used to be called the girls but that's changed, now we're all referred to as Team SCA. I like that, it shows we're being taken seriously."" This race is one of the few big outings left on Caffari's to-do list. It also doubles up as another chance to feed her wanderlust and travel the globe again. ""You could say that round-the-world sailing is a drug,"" she says. ""When you're not on the water, you're pining to be back there. It's just no two days are ever the same. It's a fabulous place to be. The day I stop enjoying it is the day I stop."" On the eve of the competition starting for her, the great granddaughter of a Sicilian sea captain -- the only family maritime history she knows of -- she talked excitedly about getting out there, chomping at the bit to get going. She is well-versed to the potential dangers but argues that ""the more miles you do, the more confident you are."" She is relishing the intensity and camaraderie of the team, a far cry from her solo venture. She wants to bring fresh arms, fresh legs and a fresh mind to Team SCA. In her case, mum's the word.

"(CNN) -- If you want new soccer boots, the choice -- and cost -- can be dizzying. Forget trawling through hundreds of new models from dozens of stores and websites. How about if someone armed with all of that knowledge turned up at your house to help you out? Not only that, what if they took a look at your feet, picked out the best boot for you, then carefully shaped your ideal boot into an exact anatomical match? That would be nice. But you probably won't get that luxury treatment unless you either become a world-leading soccer player ... or a horse. For horses, it is standard procedure for a ""farrier"" to shape their perfect shoe. ""Think about an old-fashioned blacksmith,"" says Haydn Price, farrier to Britain's Olympic champion showjumping and dressage teams. ""Everybody knows what a blacksmith does, but not many people know what a farrier does. First and foremost, you're a blacksmith who specializes in shoeing horses."" Learning the trade . To become a top farrier, you have to master a wide variety of disciplines. For example, young farriers must pass a forging examination, to demonstrate they know how to safely and precisely shape metal in a fire -- exactly as a blacksmith would do. But farriers must also spend years learning the intricacies of horses' feet and the precise demands of the work each animal does, from a working carthorse to a thoroughbred racehorse and everything in between. ""It's a rigorous four-year training system,"" says Claire Brown, who launched the Forge and Farrier website seven years ago and whose husband Nigel has been in the business for almost two decades. ""There is a lot of competition for apprenticeships -- there are far more applicants than there are places. We receive applications every week, but we only take on one new apprentice every two years."" Shoe selector . A farrier's main aim is to select exactly the right horseshoe from the thousands of varieties available, then ensure each shoe perfectly matches the horse, often by custom-fitting each shoe. Switching all four shoes on a horse usually takes around an hour if it's a simple job. Under pressure -- for example, at a big competition -- a farrier could change one shoe in five minutes if everything went to plan. Price says the vast number of designs available in the 21st century, just like the proliferation in soccer boot designs, has changed the nature of a farrier's work. ""As little as 15 years ago, there were probably only six types of shoe to cover a range of common conditions and injuries,"" he explains. ""Now, 99.9% of the time you are making a bespoke shoe. Every time you pick up a horse's foot, you should be creating a specialist shoe -- even if, on the face of it, you are using what appears to be a normal shoe. It's the application of it, not the product."" Risky business . The job is becoming increasingly popular, combining an outdoor lifestyle and hands-on work with the chance to spend your working day with animals. But it can be a dangerous game. ""There is a real risk,"" warns Brown. ""There are animals that aren't well-handled, there are young horses, there are quite highly-strung racehorses. ""If something startles them -- like a bucket being blown over in the wind -- and if the farrier is in the wrong place, you can get trodden on easily."" Her husband has been kicked in the face while working. ""It was only through sheer luck that the hoof-print went around his eye, not in it,"" Brown says. ""The print circled his nose, cheek and eyebrow."" Other farriers have spent weeks in intensive care following kicks and falls, but most will tell you that the physical toll of the work is a bigger danger. ""This is not something you'll want to be doing when you're 65,"" says Brown. ""A lot of farriers have back problems and, while you can earn a good salary, you can only really earn that for 20 years of your career."" Best of British . This has not discouraged the 3,000 or so farriers currently working in the UK, which is officially the home of the best -- as demonstrated at the discipline's world championships. The Calgary Stampede hosts this event each year, pitting farriers from across the globe against each other in judged forging and shoeing contests. Yorkshireman Steven Beane has won five times in the past six years, taking his latest world title in early July. Since 1985 there have been only six non-British winners. ""The judges look at how accurately you can replicate a specimen shoe design, the quality of your forging, the trim -- how you prepare a foot to receive a shoe -- and then how well the shoe fits the foot, is nailed onto the foot and presented,"" says Brown, who is organizing this year's European championships in Lancashire. ""At this year's world championships, there was a completely UK-based top five and that is consistently the case."" Not everyone indulges in competitive farriery, though. When Price first joined the British world-class program in the late 1990s, working with top riders, he realized this was the challenge he wanted: playing a small part in winning Olympic medals. ""When I came away from London 2012, on the drive home, I felt for the first time in my life as though I had actually achieved something,"" says Price, who will work for the British team again at the FEI Alltech World Equestrian Games in France, starting on August 23. Price oversaw the shoeing of horses like Charlotte Dujardin's Valegro, who won individual and team dressage gold, as well as the four British horses who rode to the team showjumping title. ""It's not the event that's difficult,"" says Price. ""It's the pressure leading up to it. Horses have an unbelievable desire to break themselves and the pressure before the event can be quite something. ""When everything goes right, the first emotion is relief. When I knew we'd won the gold medal at London 2012 I broke down, and I'm not afraid to admit it. ""For the first time in my life, I understood -- when you watch grown men crying on television when they get out of rowing boats or at the athletics -- I understood where that comes from."" The farrier's challenge . Price spends roughly a quarter of each year working with top British horses, driving around 28,000 miles in the process. From the age of 14, farriery has gripped him. While the spotlight fell on the riders at London 2012, finding and fitting the perfect shoes for home Olympic gold marked the culmination of his life's work. ""I don't do farriery competitions anymore,"" he says. ""My competition is a self-imposed one: maintaining these horses to their peak performance. ""Competitions are hugely skilful and I take nothing away from them, but you are judged on a moment in time. ""I'm judged by the work that I do on a continued basis, to keep horses sound and fit, year after year after year. That, for me, is the farrier's challenge.""","Each shoe is bespoke: top farriers custom-fit horses with their own, unique footwear .

"Washington (CNN) -- A new national poll in the battle for the 2016 Democratic and Republican presidential nominations indicates what you would expect: Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming Democratic frontrunner, and there's no real leader among the possible GOP White House hopefuls. But if you get beyond the obvious, the CNN/ORC International survey released Monday becomes more revealing. It showed 65% of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party say they would likely back Clinton as their presidential nominee. Vice President Joe Biden comes in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6%, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at 2%. The CNN survey is in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated Clinton, who has not said whether she'll run, is far ahead of all the other possible Democratic candidates. Hillary Clinton: Syria weapons handover would be 'important step' Even though the next race for the White House is a long way away, there's already intense speculation over whether the former secretary of state will make a second bid for president. As with previous surveys this year, the new CNN poll also indicates no GOP frontrunner. Seventeen percent of Republicans and Independents who lean toward the GOP say they are likely to support New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, with 16% backing Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is at 13%; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 10%; Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at 9%; Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 7%, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate who battled eventual nominee Mitt Romney deep into the primary season, at 5%. Opinion: A reversal for GOP and Democrats . Rubio's number stands out. The first-term senator, considered a rock star among many Republicans, registered in the upper teens in polls of the possible GOP 2016 horserace conducted by other organizations earlier this year. But Rubio's support of immigration reform -- he was a high profile member of a bipartisan group of senators who pushed immigration reform passage through the Senate this spring -- may have hurt his standing with many conservative voters opposed to such efforts. Santorum's 5% is also interesting. ""It's often said -- and it's usually true -- that polls taken years before the first presidential primaries are mostly tests of name recognition. But clearly (it's) something more than name recognition when it comes to Santorum,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Santorum is well-known to GOP voters -- he had months of national exposure in the 2012 primaries, and since the start of the modern primary system in the 1970s, the GOP has tended to nominate the candidate who was the runner-up the last time the party had an open race for the nomination. But Santorum is not just in the middle of the pack -- he is currently running dead last out of the eight candidates tested,"" adds Holland. Santorum: The U.S. has no national security interest in Syria . Christie may be on top of the list, but he's not first in the minds of conservatives, who dominate more moderate Republicans in the GOP primaries and caucuses. According to the poll, only 8% of Republicans who consider themselves conservatives say they would be likely to back Christie, compared to 28% of self-described moderate Republicans. In the potential Democratic battle, the survey indicates Clinton performing better with women (76%) than men (52%). And Biden scores higher with voters age 50 and older (18%) than those younger than 50 (5%). Biden: House Republicans 'Neanderthals' With the start of the primary and caucus calendar more than two years off, take this survey and others with a grain of salt. ""Polls taken two to three years before an election have absolutely no predictive value,"" adds Holland. ""Do not treat this as a prediction of what will happen in 2016."" Biden courts presidential speculation with Iowa trip . The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error for Democratic and GOP primary questions is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The sample included 218 respondents who describe themselves as Republicans and 234 who describe themselves as independents who lean towards GOP, for a total of 452 Republicans, and 311 respondents who describe themselves as Democrats and 137 who describe themselves as independents who lean Democratic, for a total of 448 Democrats.","Biden distant second to Hillary Clinton in a new poll on 2016 presidential nod .

"Editor's note: Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology. (WIRED) -- The design studio Nervous System has created a novel process that allows a 3-D printed dress to move and sway like real fabric. The bespoke software behind it, called Kinematics, combines origami techniques with novel approaches to 3-D printing, pushing the technology's limits. Instead of pinning fabric to a dress form, a Kinematics garment starts as a 3-D model in a CAD program. Kinematics breaks the model down into tessellated, triangular segments of varying sizes. Designers can control the size, placement, and quantity of the triangles in a Javascript-based design tool and preview how the changes will impact the polygonal pinafore. Once the designer is satisfied, algorithms add hinges to the triangles uniting the garment into a single piece and compress the design into the smallest possible shape to optimise the printing process, often reducing the volume by 85 percent. After two days of printing at Shapeways, a dusty boulder of plastic emerges from an industrial-sized 3-D printer. Technicians remove excess dust like archeologists in search of a long-buried garment. The plastic parts are cleaned and dyed, resulting in a little black (or white) dress made from tiny, interlocking bricks of plastic. No Gimmicks for this Gown . Designer Jessica Rosenkrantz made sure the gown was more than mere gimmickry. Buttons, cleverly modelled into the triangles make it easy to don and doff. Unlike other 3-D printed clothing that feels like a suit of armour, the long dress flows and moves as the model strides and twirls. What Cities Would Look Like if Lit Only by the Stars . Comfort was a key concern. Rosenkrantz wore 3-D printed jewellery for weeks at a time in an attempt to catch design features that chafe. She built her wardrobe piece by piece, starting with a bracelet, then a belt, and finally a bodice before moving on to a dress. Rosenkrantz brought an old-school tailor's approach to the project, but was happy to leverage modern technology. For example, 3-D scans of the model's body ensured a perfect fit. She worked with Shapeways to optimise the print quality and aesthetics. As a result, her garment and its Github repository recently were acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. Making It Work . Nervous System originally developed the Kinematics concept as part of a project for Google. The goal was to help add bit of cool to a pavilion promoting Android phones. Nervous System figured out how to print bracelets on MakerBots by reducing dimensional designs to flat pieces of plastic that could be printed in under an hour and folded like origami. Google was pleased with the promotion, but Nervous System believed the concept could be used to make garments. ""We'd done some simulations and made some animations showing that we could do it hypothetically,"" says Rosenkrantz. These hypothetical simulations precipitated a software engineering effort one year in the making. Scaling up from a wrist-worn wearables to cocktail dress posed a particular challenge. The hinges linking the triangles must be small enough to let the fabric flow, but robust enough to avoid a wardrobe malfunction. These mechanical challenges were exacerbated by limitations in 3-D printing technology. Pieces made with the technology have a grain, like wood, and certain orientations create stronger parts. The solution was to revamp the software. ""We were able to do so much design-wise without ever printing anything,"" says Rosenkrantz. ""We knew not only exactly what the final piece would look like but also how it would behave."" Simulating folds was slow and inaccurate at first. Test prints of belts with 77 hinges worked beautifully, but scaling up to the 700 or more needed to create a dress repeatedly broke the software. Physics engines were tossed aside like fabric swatches. 15 Incredible Photos That'll Remind You to Be Awed by Planet Earth . Originally, the simulator would fold the clothes down into a ball. ""Sort of like you are wadding clothes up to toss in you hamper,"" says Rosenkrantz. ""It looked cool but it wasn't the most efficient way to get the volume of our designs down."" So Rosenkrantz and partner Jesse Louis-Rosenberg developed a collision-based simulator that replicates how one might fold clothes to put them in a drawer. The project pushed design, fashion, and fabrication in surprising ways. ""To 3-D print structures in this crazy compressed form and have them unfold; that almost sounds like science fiction,"" says Rosenkrantz. ""Frankly, when you work on something complex like this in a completely digital world for so long, the biggest surprise is that it actually works as intended, from the compressing to the fit, draping, and movement."" Printing also required special development. Nervous System needed to develop new tools to load its software. ""We've been working with Nervous and our community over the years to push the machines to their limits,"" says Carine Carmy of Shapeways. ""From how densely we can pack the trays so you can print 1,000 products at once versus just one, to how long you need to run them so we can produce products more quickly, to how precise and detailed the prints can be so that you can design with micron precision."" Ready to Wear? Next up for Nervous System is improving the speed and adding new mechanisms and structures that will allow simulating different materials -- think of a stout tweed versus a gossamer silk. Ultimately, the team thinks can be expanded for other applications like Skylar Tibbits Hyperform project. At $3,000 a pop, Nervous System isn't quite ready to commercialise its wearable wares. ""That is a very high number although perhaps considerably lower than the price of most other 3-D printed garments,"" she says. ""We're hoping to bring the price down before we start selling clothing."" Read more from WIRED: . 21 Awesomely Well-Designed Products We're Dying to Own .

"(CNN) -- It could be a sign, a vague one. A NASA rover has found the building blocks of life on Mars. They might be the product of past or present life on the Red Planet -- or they might not be. Either way, the samples of organic matter in the atmosphere and in rock show that Mars may at least have once had conditions favorable to hosting life, NASA said in a statement. They also show that the planet is still chemically active. The Curiosity rover's tapping into organics in rock is the first find ever of life's building blocks on Mars' surface. Gas blast . The rover has run into pockets of gas on Mars: methane, often used to fire up gas stoves back on Earth. Organic matter is made up of carbon bonded with other elements, often hydrogen and oxygen. Living things are made up of it, but life is not necessary for it to exist. Methane is the smallest organic compound, consisting of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms. On our planet, methane is a fossil fuel, but it can also rise out of rotting sewage or fly through the air in flatulence. In other words, it usually comes from something living, or something that was once alive. No life found . That could be the case on Mars, too, NASA said in a statement this week. But the space agency carefully points out that methane can also come from inanimate sources as well. ""There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock,"" said Sushil Atreya, a scientist on the Curiosity team. At this point, NASA doesn't know if microbes are behind the gas or just minerals. Researchers used Curiosity's instruments a dozen times to get a breath of methane, and four of those times, it peaked at a level 10 times higher than usual. They believe it may have been puffed up from the ground like little burps. Organic rock . Curiosity also found organic matter while drilling into stone. ""This first confirmation of organic carbon in a rock on Mars holds much promise,"" said scientist Roger Summons, who works on the rover team. These building blocks of life could have formed on Mars, or meteorites could have brought them there. Scientists aren't sure yet. Also, they can't be completely sure what molecules they are, because a coincidental chemical reaction that occurs in the detection device skews some of the samples. So far, they've also found no sign of microbes in the rock powder, neither present nor past. The history of water on Mars has also been a popular research topic. The analysis of hydrogen atoms Curiosity found in rock have led NASA scientists to conclude that much of Mars' former oceans disappeared very early -- before the rocks were formed.","The Curiosity rover found high levels of methane gas and other organic matter in rock .
It could have been produced by microbes, but there is no concrete evidence of that .
Other chemical reactions can also produce organic compounds .
But existence of organic compounds on Mars are sign it may have supported life before ."
"(CNN) -- The highly anticipated arrival of the Airbus A350 XWB took a small step closer, yesterday. The European aircraft manufacturer unveiled the latest in its test fleet of the new jet, the MSN2, painted in a new ""carbon"" livery and the first to be equipped with a full passenger cabin interior. Test flights of the aircraft began before the Paris Airshow last May. In the coming weeks Airbus will send the MSN2 into the skies on a series of Early Long Flights (ELF) with passengers onboard. The company says it remains on track to deliver the new aircraft to its first customer, Qatar Airways, in the fourth quarter of this year. ""XWB"" means ""extra wide body."" Three different iterations of the plane are being built: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers, respectively, in three-class seating. Read more: The year ahead in air travel . Currently there are 814 orders from 39 airlines on the company's books. The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. The project for the new jet began in 2006 and was initially criticized by some in the industry, including airlines, for not really advancing the global aviation scene. Most of the orders for the plane are for the larger -900 and -1000 versions, leading some industry experts to suggest the company may discontinue to offer the -800 and clear the way for a re-engineered Airbus A330. The distinctive carbon livery of the latest A350 XWB plane reflects how much of the aircraft is made from advanced materials; 53% of the A350 XWB is made up of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer and is Airbus' first carbon-fiber fuselage.","Airbus unveil first A350 XWB with full passenger cabin .

"(CNN) -- The 'queen' of Macau's gambling empire is about to unveil a new palace. The foundations are already being laid for Macau's new multi-billion dollar casino-resort, named -- aptly enough -- Wynn Palace. It will be the latest jewel in U.S. business magnate Steve Wynn's glittering casino crown, after he originally built Las Vegas's premier Bellagio, and The Mirage -- now owned by MGM Resorts International. And the person to launch it? Forty-seven year old executive director Linda Chen. Often sighted as a likely successor to billionaire Wynn, Taiwanese-born Chief Operating Officer Chen oversaw the opening of luxury gaming, hotel, and retail complex Wynn Macau, in 2006. And she's not about to stop there. ""When we first came to Macau, the scene was more about gaming,"" Chen told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. ""And the aspiration for Macau, the reason we wanted to be here, is taking it to the next level. ""In Vegas, it's no longer just about gaming. It's about the entertainment. It's where you would consider the best shows in the world, the best shopping, and the best restaurants. It's about the whole experience, and that's what we wanted to do here."" In its first year Wynn Macau quadrupled its annual revenue from $1 billion to $4.5billion, under Chen's stewardship.One of Asia's 50 most powerful businesswomen, according to Forbes, Chen has worked her socks off to become the second in command at Wynn. But could luck also have played a part in her success? Chen apparently has the number 8888 -- considered lucky in Chinese culture -- for her phone, a present from her wealthy boss. Luck or no luck, gaming was not the direction Chen or her parents saw her career going, when she graduated from New York's Cornell University in 1989. ""It was the end of the world for them,"" she says with a laugh. ""For Chinese parents coming from Taiwan, they never knew anybody else who worked in the casino industry. They never thought somebody would live outside the casinos in Las Vegas. So it took a while, but eventually they were supportive."" Stepping out of her private jet, Chen appears every inch the high-flying business superstar. But when asked about one day succeeding Wynn himself, she is a little reticent. ""Mr Wynn's very young, he is not ready to retire soon,"" Chen says with a smile. ""I hope he works for another 30, 40 years -- and I'll be alongside with him.""

"Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- Starting a business is never easy, but in Tanzania, the obstacles for women can be particularly fierce. Few women hold land titles, and as a result, many don't have the necessary collateral to secure funding from a bank. Dr. Victoria Kisyombe has set out to change that. She runs SELFINA, a micro-credit institution focused on female entrepreneurs. In addition to lending, SELFINA loans women equipment to start up their businesses. ""This is the era for Africa to move forward, and if Africa is moving forward, the women can move forward with it,"" says Kisyombe. Since launching in 2002, the company has financed more than 2,000 female-owned businesses and won a plethora of international awards, including the one from the World Economic Forum and Hillary-Clinton-backed Vital Voices. And to think, it all started with a cow. The story of Sero . Like many of the women she helps, Kisyombe struggled to get financing when first starting out. ""I thought, okay, instead of chasing money through the banks, which I cannot get, I started looking at what I had ... it was a cow,"" she recalls. ""It was that 'a-ha moment.' If a woman could have a cow like I had, she could have an asset that could generate income, then we could go around the problem of not being able to access financing."" Kisyombe sold milk from her cow, Sero, in order to raise money to start her business. Ultimately, the cow even named the enterprise (SELIFINA stands for Sero Lease and Finance). Empowering women . When women become business owners, they become pillars in their communities. Betty Materimu is one such woman. SELFINA leased her sewing machines, and Materimu used them to launch her own dressmaking enterprise. ""She has created a number of jobs for fellow Tanzanians,"" says Kisyombe. ""Women and men alike."" By offering loans to women in a range of industries, SELFINA is effecting change throughout Tanzania, though Kisyombe envisions the women she supports will have a global impact. Many of her charges have started exporting their products across the border. Take Chiku Shumari, a local farmer who, among other things, has started growing cashew nuts for export. Shumari is also hoping to develop a fish pond where she can farm tilapia for the local market in Dar Es Salaam. ""(These steps) may look small, but actually the impact is huge,"" says Kisyombe. Ultimately, she sees SELFINA encouraging women in a broader context than business. ""Some of our women now are even qualifying for political positions,"" she notes. Starting young . The key to empowerment, Kisyombe believes, is education, and to that end, she raised money to build the Mukuza Girl's Secondary School in Dar Es Salaam. The school has 129 students, and provides room and board so the girls can have their own space to study and learn. ""They are given an equal opportunity to become economically empowered, socially empowered and politically empowered,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- Today's world is more interconnected than ever, making the transmission of communicable diseases that originate abroad easier to reach our shores. And the ongoing Ebola outbreak is simply the latest unsettling reminder that all the benefits of an interconnected world also come with significant risks that must be addressed and mitigated. This Ebola outbreak likely began with a 2-year-old in the rain forest of GuÃ©ckÃ©dou, Guinea, and it has now reached halfway around the world to Dallas, Texas, where this terrible disease claimed its first victim in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, last Wednesday. We have the ability to prevent a significant outbreak of the virus here in the United States, but President Obama must act much more quickly and effectively if we are going to combat the disease at its source, and thus hinder further overseas transmission and ultimately prevent the spread of the disease outside Africa. This challenge will only be made more difficult because many Americans lack confidence in our government's ability to effectively confront crises like this one. Beginning with the first case in Guinea last December, the response to the Ebola outbreak by the international community has been slow and inadequate. Local health systems, which were weak at best, have been completely devastated as many health workers became victims of this deadly virus. The United States initially stood back and allowed the global response to be led by the World Health Organization, which failed to combat Ebola in its earliest stages. As a result, Ebola ballooned from a local problem to a regional problem, and now to a global problem. The United States is the country best equipped with the resources and power to tackle the medical and logistical nightmare that the Ebola epidemic has become. With over 8,000 people infected, more than 4,000 dead and infection rates increasing, this outbreak of Ebola is not going to go away quickly. Yet while we need a more effective and rapid response to contain the outbreak in West Africa, we also need to make sure sufficient safeguards are in place to protect Americans. We have to make sure that every aspect of our federal government's response -- from our passenger screening efforts to our public health system -- is effectively prepared to prevent the spread of Ebola. To that end, the United States must take several steps to strengthen our response to this challenge. First, Americans need to have some reassurance that someone in our country is in charge of confronting this epidemic and keeping Americans safe from it. So far, inexcusably, this has not really happened. President Obama should publicly designate a senior government official to lead a task force. This person would be in charge of coordinating the U.S. response to this crisis, both domestically and internationally, including our military presence, which in a limited amount of time has already had a real impact on the ground in Liberia. Second, we need to target the problem at the source. Containing the outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons, but it's also essential to protecting the American people. The longer the outbreak lasts in those countries, the greater the chance of the disease being transmitted to other countries, including the United States. As part of the response abroad, we need to bolster public health systems in the region to help prevent the virus from expanding across more borders. Third, we need to prevent the growing crisis in West Africa from leading to more cases in the United States. The recent announcement of increased entry screening of those traveling from affected countries by Customs and Border Patrol at select points of entry in the United States is a good but, frankly, overdue first step. However, it will not be enough, and the State Department should institute a temporary ban on new visas to non-U.S. nationals seeking to travel to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Since March 1, 2014, over 6,000 visas have been issued to nationals of these countries. Foreign health workers coming to the United States to be trained should be exempted, provided they pass screening efforts. However, until we have a better handle on the problem, we need to prevent mass travel from the countries most affected. We should also ensure that Customs and Border Patrol agents at airports beyond the current transit points have the equipment and training to deal with potential cases. And additional travel restrictions should not be ruled out. Fourth, the infection of two health care workers in Dallas during the treatment of Duncan raises questions about the ability of hospitals across the country to handle the extensive safety protocols required to treat Ebola patients. Two medical facilities in the United States have already successfully treated patients that have now been cured and two others have specialized facilities for treating patients with the virus. We should consider centralizing all future cases at these medical facilities, but hospitals across the United States will still need to focus on screening and isolating suspected cases that may arrive at their facilities. Finally, we need to increase our efforts to develop an Ebola vaccine and to increase production of antiviral drugs. There are a few promising drugs to fight Ebola in test phases. We should speed up testing of these drugs and explore the possibility of scaling up drug manufacturing at the same time as clinical testing. Once we develop a drug with proven success, we should be ready to supply it in large numbers. In order to avoid bureaucratic red tape, we should begin discussion with the WHO, drug companies and West African governments on the processes for purchasing and distributing of these drugs. The Ebola epidemic is a reminder of the evolving nature of our national security challenges. A sick child in Africa has advanced into a global health security issue that is now knocking on America's door. We can successfully address this problem, protect our people and once again demonstrate America's compassion abroad. But much more needs to be done and it needs to happen quickly. Like other national security challenges, the longer we wait to engage, the more limited our options will become and the likelihood of success will be reduced.

"(CNN) -- When your grandmother is one of the most famous cosmetics moguls in history, it might put a little pressure on you to succeed. But for Aerin Lauder, the 44-year-old granddaughter of Estée Lauder, who founded the eponymous make-up company, the legacy has been an inspiration rather than a burden. Lauder worked her way up through the ranks of the billion-dollar family company for 25 years to the position of style and image director. In 2012, she decided to combine her passion for home décor with her knowledge of beauty, to launch her own lifestyle brand, called AERIN. The businesswoman spoke to CNN's Kirstie Lu Stout about her drive, the importance of saying ""no,"" and how beauty transcends borders or race. CNN: Are you living out your dream today with your own brand, AERIN? Aerin Lauder: I'm definitely living my dream. As a little girl, I've always loved beauty and I loved home, so I've managed to combine the two into a brand. CNN: What is it like to live up to the heritage of Estee Lauder? AL: It is an amazing legacy and I think she is always looking down at me very proud. She taught me the importance of excellence; so has my uncle, my cousin and my aunt, everyone who works at the company as a family member has really re-emphasized the importance of excellence and perfection. CNN: You had a very international upbringing, growing up in Vienna, Austria, where your father was the U.S. ambassador, then moving to Manhattan. How did that shape who you are today? AL: It shaped a tremendous amount of my vision, style and taste. When we moved to Europe when I was a teenager I really did not want to go. I was happy in my school, with my friends, but looking back on it, it was the best experience I've ever had. We traveled every weekend, I experienced incredible new cultures, museums, cities and it really opened up my eyes. CNN: You worked your way through the ranks of Estee Lauder and managed to extend the reach of the brand to all corners of the world, partially through casting diverse models. In 2003 you hired the Ethiopian model Liya Kebede, then in 2011, models Liu Wen and Joan Smalls from China and Puerto Rico. Why is that an important thing to do in this business? AL: Because beauty is global. It's the idea that every woman can be beautiful, which is a concept Estée has which is still so modern today. It's the idea of beauty from all over the world. CNN: Are you a detail-oriented person? AL: I'm very detail-oriented, which is good and bad. Because I will wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about something or seeing a mistake, thinking about it and I immediately send an email -- I'm very focused on details. But I think that is really important because it is my name on that product, and I think it should be the best it can possibly be. CNN: What has been the biggest mistake you have made in your career and how did you overcome it? AL: I think it is very important to learn to say ""no."" I think it is sometimes important for brands or the creative director to learn to say ""this might be on trend but it is not right for us."" I launched products and campaigns which I thought might bring in new consumers but in reality would make the existing Estée Lauder one maybe discouraged. CNN: In your business schedule you are balancing work and family. How do you find time and get inspired? AL: I think you can get inspiration from anything. It can be a walk on the beach, it can be a moment with your children, and also the Internet has been a wonderful source for inspiration. You can Google it, search it, look at the beaches for the sensibility of there and feels like you are there. I think the Internet is a great way to get inspiration. CNN: Is luxury attainable?

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Heroin, cocaine and amphetamines are the kind of street drugs you expect to find in the shady corners of any city, hiding away from the glare of law enforcement. But in one small space in downtown Vancouver addicts openly inject their fixes -- as medics watch on. This is InSite, North America's only legal safe drug injection center. A banner outside reads ""InSite saves lives."" It's a facility where drug addicts can bring and use their drugs and not risk arrest. Some of the addicts line up two or three times a day to use one of the 12 injection booths. One of the first users of the day is Steve. The center opens at 10 a.m. and then runs steadily for 18 hours until 4 a.m. Approximately 800 people use the booths every day. Steve gives his alias to the receptionist -- all InSite users have an official alias to protect their identity -- and moves into the injection room. He takes a seat and calmly begins to prepare his hit of heroin. He uses the clean needle and sterile equipment provided by InSite. The white powder is mixed with water in a spoon, gently heated with a candle, before being drawn into the syringe, and injected into the inside of Steve's elbow. It's not for the squeamish. There's quite a lot of blood. With fluorescent lighting and lots of mirrors, the atmosphere is clinical, even as the room fills with drug addicts focused on one task only -- feeding their addiction. Medical staff are on hand and watching closely. If needed they can help addicts find the right vein to shoot up into -- something which can be tricky for long-term users. But their main job is to step in when a user overdoses. Steve has overdosed here three times. ""I'm glad it was here [where I overdosed]. It's still in my hope that maybe I can get clean. I'm only 48. And that's why these places ... it's just, it's common sense! When you have a problem that's grown for whatever reason to the epic proportions that it has in this city, it's time to come up with a really good solution, and this is it."" Vancouver is regularly lauded as one of the best places in the world to live. It's famously the city where you can ski in the morning, and swim in the afternoon. But the quality of life in the alleyways behind InSite is something altogether different. The Downtown East side is often labeled as the poorest postal code in Canada, which stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city's red hot real estate market. The alleyways are full of thousands of drug addicts, prostitutes and dealers. Vancouver Police Department estimates that these few blocks are home to more than 5,000 intravenous drug users. In the alleys we meet Liane -- another long-term user - who has used InSite since it opened in 2003. She is articulate, educated, and angry. She says that without InSite addicts would be still be getting high but without any of the medical oversight. To many around the world it may seem astonishing that a place like InSite exists. But for the people in the nearby streets who use it, it's a lifeline. Clean needles stop the spread of infections like HIV and Hepatitis C, and daily access to medical staff is all the more important for people living in harsh, exposed conditions. In 1997, Vancouver had the highest rate of HIV in the developed world. Using InSite makes sense, says Liane. It relieves the pressure of shooting up behind rubbish bins, or using dirty puddle water, or relying on a shared needle. ""We have to stop making it a moral issue and realise that this is a medical problem. Remember us addicts, we're somebody's mothers, we're somebody's sister, we're somebody's daughter -- we're not just a number -- the next time you pass me on the street and shake your head."" Of course not everyone agrees with safe injection sites. Author, actor, and addiction counselor, David Berner, opened Canada's first ever residential treatment center for addicts back in 1967. He firmly believes that the best harm reduction strategies are centered on abstinence. ""There's only one problem with this place [InSite]. It ignores completely the mechanics of addiction. What are the mechanics of addiction? The mechanics of addiction are I want more. ""I understand reaching out and saying, 'Betty, Jack, you want to get clean? Let's go do some work. Let's get clean. It can happen, you can do it.' I don't understand, 'here's a needle, go shoot some more.'"" InSite is funded by taxpayers, at a cost of $3 million Canadian per year. It says for every tax dollar spent, four are saved, by preventing expensive medical treatments for addicts further down the line. The center has some support from the mayor, local government and some residents. The opening of InSite was a major campaign issue in Vancouver's 2002 civic elections. Supervised injection sites are not supported, however, by the Canadian federal government. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's opposition to InSite is well-documented. Speaking in 2005, he said: ""We as a government will not fund drug use."" His then health minister, Tony Clement, went further in a 2008 letter to Canada's ""Globe and Mail"" newspaper: ""A more apt analogy of what InSite does ... would be a doctor holding a cigarette to make sure a smoker doesn't burn his lips, or watching a woman with cardiac problems eat fatty French fries to ensure she swallows them properly."" The site is allowed to stay open only with a special license -- the result of a bitter battle with the Canadian government that went to the Canadian Supreme Court. In September 2011 judges ruled in favor of keeping InSite open against the wishes of Prime Minister Harper. The court said InSite allows drug addicts access to the same healthcare as other Canadian citizens. The dramatic Supreme Court ruling set a precedent and other cities in Canada, including Toronto and Montreal, had been watching closely. Councilor Gord Perks is chairman of the Toronto Drug Strategy. ""The Supreme Court ruling is a game changer. Now actually it's the law of the land that we have to provide equal access to medical services, including to people with drug addiction. So we've made progress."" A four-year study into the viability of injection rooms in Ontario province recommended three sites in Toronto, and two more in Ottawa - the nation's capital. But the findings of the Toronto and Ottawa Supervised Consumption Assessment Study (TOSCA), published in 2012, were swiftly rejected by the Toronto city administration. Toronto's drug problem is not as visible as Vancouver's but it's still there, with about 9,000 people in the city shooting up daily. As TOSCA revealed, more than 50 percent of the public supported the opening of an injection room in Ontario. Perks thinks it's only a matter of time. ""We've started to get people to face the very difficult fact that if you do not provide this medical service you are killing people. And I think it's only a few years away until we have a supervised injection site here in Toronto."" Injection rooms exist in a number of countries. The first opened in Switzerland in 1986, and since then Australia, Norway, Spain, Germany and others have followed suit. Accepting injection rooms as a legitimate part of drug strategy is hard for Berner to comprehend. ""It's more humane to help a person stay stupid? To help a person stay enslaved? You don't need to have heroin or needles or crack pipe kits to entice people to health. You could approach people and say, ""let me look at that sore. I'm a nurse. Let's clean you up a bit."""" But for people like Liane, it's a harsh reality that she may never get off drugs. She has been using for 20 years and InSite is her best hope of staying connected with medical and welfare services. ""I'm entitled to healthcare, and being treated like a human being, and not being looked at as somebody that isn't, somebody you don't want to talk about, like a dirty little secret. ""InSite in general, it's saved my life once, and it saved my husband's life on three different occasions."" She has a swift retort when asked whether other cities should open injection rooms. ""Do they have drug users? And if the answer is yes, then the answer is embrace it.""

"(WIRED) -- It's one of the biggest data breaches in history. Now that Sony has come clean -- sort of -- on a computer intrusion this month that exposed personal information on 77 million PlayStation Network users, one obvious question remains: Who pulled off the hack? In the old days, the answer would be simple: some kid did it. But today's underground is more complicated -- a slew of competing players with different agendas and techniques. Here's a quick rundown on the likely suspects. Anonymous . While noncriminal pranks are their stock in trade, the griefers of Anonymous have been on a hacktivism spree of late, staging distributed denial-of-service attacks against the corporate enemies of WikiLeaks, then famously cracking the computer security firm HBGary Federal and exposing the shady plotting of its CEO. Coincidentally, Anonymous declared Sony as its latest protest target right around the time of the intrusion. They were unhappy with Sony's lawsuit against PlayStation 3 rooter George Hotz, and unsatisfied by the settlement deal reached between Hotz and the company this month. But spokespeople for Anonymous have denied any role in the PlayStation Network hack, and the whole flavor of the hack just isn't Anonymous' style: they've pulled intrusions in the past, but computer crime isn't their mainstay, and a stealth run through the network of a corporate giant is decidedly short on lulz. Verdict: Probably innocent. WIRED.com: Sony to inspect PlayStation hacker's hard drive . China . Chinese hackers have been responsible for some of the most sophisticated known intrusions in recent years -- low-and-slow attacks against defense contractors, human rights groups and Silicon Valley bigwigs like Google. The attackers typically get in by hitting a single employee with an exploit, and then carefully expand through the network until they've found what they're looking for -- generally trade secrets, source code, or intelligence. A list of 77 million names, dates of birth and passwords could be useful as the raw material for future attacks, but aside from that, Sony's gaming infrastructure is not a logical target for this bunch. You also wouldn't expect a professional Chinese intrusion to be detected so quickly. Verdict: Innocent. Random recreational hacker . This breed still exists, though now in much smaller numbers than the professionals. The PlayStation Network would be an alluring target for a bored teenager or twenty-something who spends a lot of time grinding through multiplayer shooters -- to paraphrase ""Silence of the Lambs,"" you covet what you see every day. A recreational hacker might go after the user database as a trophy. Verdict: Maybe guilty. WIRED.com: Sony claims PlayStation 3 hacker sabotaged hard drive, skipped town . For-profit cyberthief . These guys, largely concentrated in Ukraine and Russia, know databases like the backs of their hands -- they dream in SQL -- and similar, if smaller, stolen databases are bought and sold routinely over carder forums and in private transactions. In this scenario, the credit card numbers potentially stolen in the hack aren't as important as they seem. According to Sony, the CVV2 -- the security code on the back of card -- wasn't stored in the compromised database, which greatly reduces the cards' usability to fraudsters. Credit cards without the magstripe data or CVV2 are among the least valuable commodities. But combined with the other data, the database is valuable indeed. The passwords (which Sony evidently didn't bother to hash) could be a gold mine, because people have a tendency to use the same password everywhere; you can bet a big chunk of those 77 million PlayStation Network passwords will unlock everything from Facebook accounts to online banking. The e-mail addresses could be used in phishing attacks, with the fraudster using stolen details -- like the target's date-of-birth -- to increase the chances of a response. Hell, even if it were just sold as a spam list, the Sony database could draw a pretty penny. Verdict: Probably guilty. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, barring an intervention of common decency, common sense and common compassion, the state of Texas will execute a man who scarcely comprehends who he is, let alone the reason why he will be put to death. The man is Scott Panetti, a hopelessly unhinged paranoid schizophrenic. No one disputes that in 1992, Panetti gunned down the mother and father of his estranged wife in cold blood. No one disputes that this was a horrendous wastage of innocent human life. Nor does anyone dispute that at the time, Panetti was enmeshed in deep psychosis. His madness was no secret. He had been hospitalized 14 times before the killings. The hospital system failed him. It could not or did not protect him from his demons, though regimens of medication and psychiatric supervision have repeatedly been shown to stabilize patients in his condition. Maybe his caregivers were overworked in an underfunded system. Then the Texas courts failed him. At his murder trial, the judge permitted this manifestly brain-ravaged man to act as his own lawyer. What a hoot that must have been. Reporters in the courtroom described Panetti as duded up in cowboy clothes, prancing around and ranting about Satan, an obsession typical for the psychotically insane. Perhaps the court anticipated this; calculated that his inevitably demented performance would solidify public opinion against him and thus hasten his convenient disposal via lethal injection. Hey, he was probably faking his craziness anyway, said prosecutors. The Texas court system, the American court system and many Americans in general are failing the Scott Panettis among us, and they need to educate themselves. Psychosis is not a condition of choice, like a cocaine high. Nor does it proceed from character flaws. Psychosis arrives in a person's psyche at conception via genetic transmission -- heredity -- and it devours character. It eats away at the circuitry of the prefrontal cortex, the command center of the brain, the regulator of thought, the behavioral choices that proceed from thought, the capacity to separate fantasy from reality. Schizophrenia, the genetic flaw that produces psychosis, afflicts about one in 100 Americans, an enormous figure. Schizophrenia does not always lead to violence. In Panetti's case it did, and on Wednesday, barring a commutation by the Supreme Court or Texas Gov. Rick Perry, he will pay the ultimate price for suffering the ultimate bad luck. Perhaps our national self-education should begin with some critical soul-searching. Who would benefit from Panetti's extermination? Would it protect society? Panetti is already sequestered from society, and should be forever. Would his execution serve as a deterrent? To believe this, you must believe that everyone will wake up on Thursday morning musing, ""Gee, look what happened to Scott. I guess I won't turn psychotic after all!"" Would it be a stern reaffirmation of -- of what? Of our righteous national ideal that nobody had better go violently nuts if they know what's good for them? Would it give comfort? It certainly would not give comfort to Sonja Alvarado, his former wife and the daughter of his victims, who filed a petition stating that because of his paranoid delusions at the time of the murders, he should never have been tried. Nor would it give comfort to Victoria Panetti, his sister. She has waged a heartfelt national petition campaign to plead for her brother's life. To achieve this, the voices of her petition's signers must break through the moral anesthesia of the powerful pols and judges who have thus far shrugged at the manifest injustice of her brother's case. Clearly, her prospects are not good. The Supreme Court upheld a 2004 federal judge's stay of execution of Panetti on the ground that a lower court's standard for determining a defendant's mental competency was unconstitutional. That was then. The Texas court lawyers bulled ahead, getting the case sent back down to that same lower court-- the Fifth Circuit -- to correct ""errors"" in the prosecution. In 2013, a psychiatrist testified that he thought Panetti was ""competent"" enough to understand why he was being put down, despite mountainous evidence to the contrary that beggars belief. So: Let us regretfully, and with apologies to the ravaged sensibilities of Victoria and the other Panetti family members, search for shards of redemption should the worst come to pass Wednesday night. After all, the rationale for executions, if there is a rationale, must be that they will make things ... um ... better. Will redemption come via a new surge of political backbone to stare down the NRA and strengthen laws to at least keep the mentally ill from possessing firearms? Don't hold your breath. Will it come via kicking our society out of its denial about the disgraceful chaos of American mental-health care, and make us insist that its reform be a national priority? This has been a crying necessity for generations. So it can probably wait a few generations more. Will it come via motivating people to enlarge their understanding by getting to know families with members afflicted with the disease? The nearest is not far away, I guarantee you. You will learn about torturous, nearly unbearable grief, and you will keenly perceive the need for compassionate activism. So, probably not. Speaking honestly, I can envision only one certain consequence of Scott Panetti's execution: . A spiritually declining nation will have shoved the lethal needle a little deeper into its own vein.","Ron Powers: On Wednesday, mentally ill murderer to be executed in Texas .

"Beijing (CNN) -- An early morning fire at a poultry processing plant in northeast China killed at least 119 people Monday, state-run Xinhua news agency said. Another 54 workers were injured. More than 300 workers were inside the plant in Jilin province when the fire broke out about 6 a.m., Xinhua said. About 100 of them were able to escape -- and told Xinhua that the gates to the plant were locked. ""Suddenly, the lights inside went out and the plant got quite dark,"" a worker named Wang Fengya told the news agency. ""When I finally ran out and looked back at the plant, I saw high flames."" Firefighters battled the blaze for six hours before they were able to bring it under control. A fire official told CNN that an explosion at the plant started the fire -- but the cause of the blast wasn't immediately known. ""The complicated interior structure of the prefabricated house in which the fire broke out and the narrow exits have added difficulties to the rescue work, sources with rescue forces said,"" the Xinhua report said. CNN's Dayu Zhang reported from Beijing and Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva from Atlanta .","More than 300 workers were inside at the time .

"(CNN) -- A plume of thick smoke rose over a Louisiana chemical plant Thursday after an explosion and fire that left at least one person dead and forced authorities to ask people as far as 2 miles away to stay inside to avoid exposure to potentially toxic fumes. Zachary Green, 29, of Hammond was killed in the blast, the Louisiana State Police said. A dramatic image provided to CNN affiliate WAFB by a plant worker who did not want to be identified showed workers running from a towering orange column of flame ripping through part of the plant. At least 75 people were injured in the blast, said Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman with the Louisiana Department of Health. ""Generally they were people who came in with burns, cardiac issues and blunt trauma,"" she said. Aside from a controlled burn at the Williams Geismar plant, the fire was out, Louisiana State Police Trooper Jaren Sandifer told CNN. Firefighters and a hazardous materials team were evaluating the situation, Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeffrey Wiley told reporters. ""We think we have a stable situation,"" he said. iReport: Video shot just after the explosion . As Gov. Bobby Jindal traveled to the area to meet with emergency workers, authorities lifted the shelter-in-place order for nearby residents early Thursday afternoon. Four nearby chemical plants remained under a similar order, Ascension Parish spokesman Lester Kenyon told CNN. At least one person died, Sandifer said. Three people were hospitalized in critical condition, according to information provided by hospitals who reported receiving patients from the blast -- Baton Rouge General Hospital, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center and St. Elizabeth Hospital. One person was in serious condition, 12 were in fair condition and one was in good condition, according to the hospitals. About 600 people were at the plant when the explosion occurred, Sandifer told CNN. It was unclear what caused the blast, he said. The plant produces about 1.3 billion pounds of ethylene and 90 million pounds of polymer-grade propylene each year, according to the company's website. The explosion in Louisiana comes two months after a deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, on April 17. In that incident, 15 people died and a significant portion of the town was damaged by the explosion.

"(CNN) -- California Chrome's 2014 has been something of a roller-coaster ride but the year could still end on a high in the colt's final race of the American thoroughbred horse racing season at Del Mar. The peaks of a Kentucky Derby triumph and a six-race winning streak have been matched by the disappointing lows of narrowly missing out on the Triple Crown and a three-and-a-half-month layoff to rest. Yet victory in the Hollywood Derby on Saturday could be enough to consign those darker memories to the past and fire the three-year-old chestnut colt to the prestigious Horse of the Year accolade at January's Eclipse Awards -- an annual ceremony recognizing the year's best thoroughbred horses. ""Winning the award after all these setbacks would be even sweeter,"" California Chrome's trainer Art Sherman told CNN. ""It would be a great accomplishment for California Chrome and the highlight of the year for him. To win the Eclipse would really be something special."" Coming out on top at the Grade 1 meet at California's Del Mar racetrack will be no easy task, however, given that it will be his maiden race on turf. In the days leading up to the event, Sherman and jockey Victor Espinoza have been working the horse hard on grass in anticipation that he will feel as at home there as he has done for much of the season on dirt. ""I don't think him running on grass for the first time will be a problem myself, I have a good feeling about this,"" Sherman says. ""If he gets the win then I think he deserves to be named Horse of the Year. To win on grass would be a whole new dimension for him, with his running style, so the voters would have to appreciate that."" An eventful year . Victory on grass would seal a fourth Grade 1 triumph of the year -- two more than any of his rivals have managed in 2014. The three previous successes came at the Santa Anita Derby, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes -- part of a six-race winning streak that captured the American public's imagination and set up the possibility of a first Triple Crown win in the sport since 1978. ""He got better and better as he turned three, he just got more mature,"" says Sherman, who became the oldest trainer to win the Derby in May at the age of 77. ""He really is something else, the Real McCoy. I've had some great horses, but I've never had one like him."" The Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes triumphs, however, could not be replicated in June's Belmont Stakes -- the three-year-old had to settle for fourth -- and so the wait for a 12th horse to achieve the Triple Crown goes on. Steve Coburn -- one of the horse's two principal owners -- reacted to the loss with a barrage of unsporting criticism and was later humiliated in the media for what was perceived as a severe case of sour grapes. He later apologized. Sherman, meanwhile, still struggles to talk about the Triple Crown near miss, and California Chrome himself has yet to record a victory since the disappointment at Belmont Park. ""I thought we could win that Triple Crown going into the last race,"" Sherman recalls. ""But California Chrome had problems in the race -- he was stuck and couldn't get out, he was stuck down in the railing. ""You hate making excuses for the horse, except I think he could have been the winner, I really do. The Triple Crown would really have been something. It would have been a real highlight."" Despite the setback, Sherman remains confident that the chestnut colt's record this year will be ""enough"" to at least secure the three-year-old-male title at the Eclipse Awards, with a trophy being presented to the most impressive horse in each division. Ifs and buts . Had California Chrome won the Breeders' Cup Classic in October the Horse of the Year award may have been a formality, but he could only finish third. The controversial race perhaps should have been more fruitful had Bayern and Toast of New York -- who finished first and second respectively -- been disqualified for early collisions involving the unfortunate Shared Belief. ""It was frustrating watching the way the start went, it was very controversial ... we're dealing with a $5 million race here,"" says Sherman. ""If we'd have won the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Eclipse Award would have been tied up by now. If there had been a double disqualification then we would have won."" ""But timing is everything in this game,"" Sherman adds on California Chrome's return from his rest period. ""I never got the chance to get a strong race out of him afterwards. I think that's what cost us the Breeders' Cup, to be honest with you."" Looking ahead . While 2014 appears to be tinged with a sense of regret for Sherman, it is still a year that has brought about unforeseeable levels of success, and the future remains bright for California Chrome. Despite persistent rumors that the three-year-old might not even race next year, it has since been confirmed that the chestnut colt will be back on the track in 2015. ""The success this year hasn't come without its setbacks. But when you're running horses you're always going to have setbacks and you can't have a perfect trip,"" Sherman says. ""I wasn't 100% sure if he was going to race anymore. There were rumors that people were going to try to buy him, but the owners want to race him at four years old. ""He will be racing next season and the future is looking good, you bet."" Lost among the excitement of looking ahead to the future for California Chrome, while also reflecting on this year's achievements, it can be easy to forget about the horse's humble beginnings and just how the story all started. Coburn and co-owner Perry Martin splashed out a mere $10,000 in total, paying $8,000 for mare Love the Chase in 2009, before then later breeding her to stallion Lucky Pulpit for a reduced fee of $2,000. Fast forward to today, and that investment has produced an offspring which has amassed $4 million in career earnings, is said to be worth in the region of $12 million and is potentially one race away from being crowned the supreme horse of 2014. ""Winning the award would really be something, and what a great story for everyone to write about given the horse has gone from a $10,000 investment to making the money he has made,"" Sherman says. ""It's a poor man's dream.""","California Chrome aiming to end historic year in style at Hollywood Derby on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg capped a memorable week by winning the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim but Sunday's race will also be remembered for a frightening opening lap incident involving the unfortunate Felipe Massa. The veteran Brazilian was clipped from behind by McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and his Williams performed a spectacular somersault before ending in the safety gravel at Hockenheim. There were immediate fears for his safety but soon allayed by the Twitter account of his team. ""Big crash for Felipe but he is out the car and heading back to the garage,"" it said. It was the second race in a row in which the 33-year-old Massa has been the victim of a first lap incident, his hopes at the British Grand Prix ended when Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari careered off. Earlier in the season, Massa was also involved in a 300 kph collision at the Canadian Grand Prix, accusing rival driver Sergio Perez of being ""dangerous"" as they battled for fourth and both ended in the barriers. The safety car was immediately deployed but on the resumption Rosberg, who had been on pole, took command and drove untroubled to take the checkered flag for his seventh career F1 victory. Since retiring while in the lead at Silverstone, Rosberg has married his long-time girlfriend Vivian Sibold, signed a contract extension at Mercedes and seen his beloved German football team win the World Cup. The victory extended his title lead over teammate Lewis Hamilton to 14 points. ""It's fantastic,"" he said in the post race interviews. ""It's an amazing feeling to win at home. It's a very special day."" Britain's Hamilton had the rub of the green in his home grand prix, but his luck deserted him this weekend, crashing out in qualifying with a brake problem. It led to a change of brake disc and a five-place grid penalty so starting from 20th. He cut a swathe through the field and initially looked to be on a two-stop strategy which may have given him the opportunity to challenge Rosberg. His second stop came on lap 32 of 67, but he pitted for a third time just seven laps later after Adrian Sutil spun his Sauber and was left stranded in the middle of the track. Race stewards decided not to put the safety car out out for the second time and at this point Hamilton's engineers pulled him in for a third stop. He still looked set to overtake Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas for second, but the Finn drove superbly to hold him off in the closing stages. Reigning four-time champion Sebastian Vettel got the better of great rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari for fourth place. Vettel's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo of Australia took sixth.","Nico Rosberg wins German Grand Prix at Hockenheim .

"Washington (CNN) -- If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything, it's how tense and strained President Obama's relationship is with Republicans in Congress. Borger: Fiscal cliff was bound to collapse . And Obama's relationship with Congress reached yet another low Thursday when House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN that he has told House Republicans he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president. And in an opinion piece on Thursday, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010. The new No. 2 Senate Republican also suggested that ""[i]t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country."" Low bar for new Congress . In the White House's relationship with Capitol Hill, ""the real negative is clearly that the relationship with House Republicans is as bad as ever,"" CNN contributor and Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer said, adding that the House GOP refuses to acknowledge any mandate from Obama after November's election. ""They are going to fight the president tooth and nail,"" Zelizer said, a problem made worse by the fact that Boehner ""is not in control"" of House Republicans, particularly the contingent of fiscal conservatives brought to Washington by support from the tea party movement. Zelizer: GOP faces choice -- leadership or gridlock? CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Obama's strained relationship with congressional Republicans dates back to the contentious debate over Obama's signature health care legislation, where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them. ""He is so good at the business of politics that he's really outmaneuvered them,"" Navarrette observed about Obama's relationship with Republicans over the past four years. Navarrette: The real issue is runaway spending . The already difficult relationship isn't helped by unique issues on each side. The GOP has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality. Zelizer: What the tea party cost the GOP . And buoyed by his electoral success in 2008, legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term, Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans, even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff. ""My preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain. But with this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time,"" Obama said Monday afternoon at a White House event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering. At the same event, Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months. ""Now, if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone,"" Obama said, ""[I]f they think that's going to be the formula for how we solve this thing, then they've got another thing coming. That's not how it's going to work."" Rather, Obama declared ""it's going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice, at least as long as I'm president. And I'm going to be president for the next four years."" Obama's recent post-election trash talking directed at Congress is ""defiance politics"" that misunderstands what it means to win an election, Navarrette said. The president's recent comments are like ""an end zone dance, a celebration"" or, in the world of mixed martial arts competition, like ""putting your foot on the other guy's neck and holding your hand up in the air,"" after you've felled your opponent, according to Navarrette. Instead of taking every opportunity to remind Republicans that he won (and they lost) last November, Obama needs to realize that ""with winning elections comes the responsibility to lead,"" Navarrette said. As the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence, ""your burdens are much greater (than your losing opponent's)."" Democrats counter that Obama hasn't had anyone to make a deal with. ""When John Boehner comes to the table and he can't even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to, I think you've got a real crisis of leadership in the House,"" former White House press secretary Bill Burton said. Debt Ceiling: Welcome to Fight Club . ""And so the president showed that even in that case, he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country, but going forward, you just wonder, how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get?"" For all his recent public swagger when it comes to Congress, Obama ""really does compromise a lot,"" said Zelizer. For example, Zelizer pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff, the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the Bush tax cuts. While he says he doesn't think there's much more Obama can do publicly to smooth over the differences with House Republicans, Zelizer said that Obama can't let stand Boehner's declaration that he's abandoning any more legislative deal-making with the White House. The president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep Boehner ""in the fold and maintain some sort of relationship"" with the speaker. And Zelizer noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between Congress and the president. After negotiations between Boehner and Obama broke down, ""(Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell stepped up and put the deal together,"" observed Zelizer, who added the Senate could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week's fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government. Zelizer noted that after McConnell negotiated a deal with Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner allowed House Republicans to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts, an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives couldn't muster a majority in the House GOP to support its passage. Ultimately, Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate's deal up for a House vote. By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set, Zelizer said, Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they didn't like the Senate deal. The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated, according to Zelizer, because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation, that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House. Tea party calls for consequences after fiscal cliff vote . In order to improve their relationship with the White House, Navarette said Republicans ""have to fix what's broken in their own party, they have to heal the divisions in their own party . . . and define what the GOP is about."" Boehner re-elected speaker in midst of public defections . Calling it ""a miracle"" that Boehner was re-elected as speaker, Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama's second term. Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems, including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition? Both are ""not terribly attractive options"" for the GOP, Navarette said, especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama. And Navarrette suggests that the sports-loving and competitive Obama invite top Republicans over to the White House for his annual Super Bowl watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in Congress. For Obama, moderating his triumphal, defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because, Navarette points out, gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama's second term agenda. And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama's liberal base on both issues. Politics in 2013: 5 things to watch for . Obama talks about 'worst day of my presidency,' goals for next term . On the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years, Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves. ""It's going to be rough, going to be tough, we're going to see this issue recur again and again over the years,"" the historian said. Indeed, both Obama and McConnell, the GOP's new lead fiscal negotiator, already seem to be playing out a familiar script. 3 more fiscal cliffs loom . The last fiscal battle barely over, Obama wasted no time late Tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come. After saying ""I am very open to compromise,"" the president went on to fire a shot over Congress' bow in the likely fight in February over raising the debt ceiling. ""[W]hile I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed,"" Obama declared, ""Let me repeat: We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred."" McConnell quickly fired back. ""The president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months, but it's the fight he is going to have, because it's a debate the country needs,"" McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night, adding that Obama ""must show up"" and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending. ""That's the debate the American people really want. It's a debate Republicans are ready to have. And it's the debate that starts today, whether the president wants it or not,"" McConnell wrote. Although he has sworn off direct negotiations with Obama, Boehner echoed McConnell's remarks on Friday. ""With the cliff behind us, the focus turns to spending,"" Boehner told House Republicans.

"(CNN) -- For Makudu, it all started with a friend playing him a Luciano Pavarotti record; for Linda, it was a TV commercial featuring a powerful soprano singer; and for Thesele, a community choir practice in his township. These flashes of operatic singing were all it took for the three young South Africans to instantly fall under the spell of opera and never look back. Makudu, Linda and Thesele are the stars of ""Ndiphilela Ukucula: I Live to Sing,"" a compelling documentary released earlier this year spotlighting the rising wave of talented opera singers emerging from South Africa's black townships. Born as South Africa was throwing off the chains of apartheid, the film's stars came to discover the enchanting world of opera in their teens, entranced by its beautiful voices and the magnificent music. Since then, they've sung their way from humble beginnings to South Africa's top stages, thrilling opera audiences in their country and beyond. Along the way, the determined singers had to overcome everything from financial hardship and health struggles to social resistance and lack of support in order to follow their dreams. Read this: Township girl to opera diva . ""If you had told me a few years ago that classical French and Italian opera is an art form that's gaining in popularity in black South African townships, I certainly would have been surprised -- in a way that I think many of the audiences for the film are,"" says Julie Cohen, director of the film. Rich tradition . What Cohen came to realize was that opera has become popular among some people in South Africa's townships thanks to the widespread culture of community choirs and competitive choral singing. This strong musical tradition has paved the way for many talented young singers to develop an interest in classical opera, says Michael Williams, managing director of the Cape Town Opera Company, one of the continent's most famous production houses. ""The national sports in South Africa are not soccer or rugby, but choirs,"" notes Williams. ""The culture of choral singing in South Africa is huge. It's deep rooted in the community and has a huge repertoire,"" he adds. ""And what happens with choir singers is they reach a sort of a ceiling -- because they're singing traditional works ... then they start moving towards opera genre and it opens up a new world for them."" Rising stars . ""I Live To Sing,"" which was first aired in July on WNET in New York, is centered around the University of Cape Town Opera School -- once an all-white school and now home to remarkable singers from South Africa's black townships, some of whom have graced international stages such as The Met and La Scala. The documentary follows Linda, Thesele and Makudu through their studies at the school as they set out to introduce themselves to the world of opera and become professional classical singers. Throughout the film, the stars' charisma and personality shine through. Thesele Kemane, 26 at the time of filming last year, is an extremely committed and disciplined bass baritone with confidence in his talent; Linda Nteleza, 24, is a shy soprano with extraordinary singing abilities; and Makudu Senaoana, the youngest of the protagonists, is a gregarious, outspoken 20-year-old with a powerful tenor voice. The filmmakers capture the singers' preparations for a performance of ""The Tales of Hoffman"" at Cape Town's main opera house -- a landmark building in the anti-apartheid struggle. Read this: Five African festivals you can't miss . They also follow the students to the United States, where they spend a summer as apprentices at the esteemed Glimmerglass Festival. While in New York, Kemane was invited to sing at the U.N. General Assembly to mark Nelson Mandela Day on July 18. ""I'd never dreamed that I would be singing at the United Nations,"" says Kemane. ""I felt delighted,"" he adds, ""singing there and honoring our late Nelson Mandela."" But along with capturing the triumphant performances and the intense training, the filmmakers also travel to the townships where the young singers grew up, often under challenging conditions. Nteleza hails from Khayelitsha, a sprawling township on the outskirts of Cape Town that has been struggling not only with high unemployment and crime rates but also health scares. ""(It has) one of the highest rates of tuberculosis in the world and in fact Linda herself has suffered from a bout of tuberculosis,"" says Cohen. ""Her parents have both passed away from health problems, so she has not had an easy life."" Kemane is from Galeshewe, a township in Northern Cape that is also struggling with rife unemployment. His extraordinary talent shone from an early age, winning several youth singing competitions, and last week he traveled to the United States to audition for, among others, Juilliard, the prestigious New York music school. But at the time, his discovery of opera and his decision to pursue classical singing professionally didn't go down too well with his financially struggling family. ""My father wanted nothing to do with it,"" says Kemane, whose parents are both unemployed. ""The last thing our parents want for their children is for them to live as difficult as they did -- so now they all want careers that they know you'll definitely get money for sure, and with opera it's kind of difficult,"" he adds. ""Last year was actually the first time my father actually saw me singing ... that is when he actually approved of opera music.""","""I Live To Sing"" is a documentary on opera students from South Africa's townships .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paparazzi have had nasty run-ins with pop star Justin Bieber, including a high-speed chase in July that prompted a city councilman to predict that such an encounter could end tragically. It happened Tuesday. A photographer who thought he spied Bieber sitting in his parked white Ferrari was struck and killed by oncoming traffic as he walked across a Los Angeles street to get back to his car after snapping photos. An opportune picture of the 18-year-old celebrity can rake in hard currency, but Bieber was not in the car at the time of the New Year's Day incident. California Highway Patrol officers had pulled over Bieber's vehicle Tuesday evening near an off-ramp of Interstate 405. The photographer, 29, spotted the sports car stopped on Sepulveda Boulevard, parked his own vehicle across the street, crossed to get closer to Bieber's car and took photos of its occupants, Los Angeles police said. Officers told the man twice to return to his car, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. An SUV struck the paparazzo as he was returning across the street to leave, Stoughton said. Authorities have not released his name. Police said in a statement that the driver of the SUV, a 69-year-old woman, stayed at the scene. There was no evidence that the woman was driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, authorities said. ""While I was not present nor directly involved with this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim,"" Bieber said in a statement. ""Hopefully this tragedy will finally inspire meaningful legislation and whatever other necessary steps to protect the lives and safety of celebrities, police officers, innocent public bystanders, and the photographers themselves."" In July, a group of paparazzi chased Bieber in separate vehicles down a freeway, whizzing past a Los Angeles city councilman, Dennis Zine, a reservist on the LAPD. ""He was coming up behind me, making abrupt lane changes, not giving signals, cutting off cars,"" Zine said. The photographers were keeping up with Bieber, thick on his heels. Zine said he expected to see a crash and feared someone could die. The lawmaker, known for supporting tough measures against obnoxious paparazzi behavior, alerted the highway patrol, who ticketed Bieber for speeding in his Fisker Karma, an expensive plug-in hybrid sports car. A photographer was slapped with criminal charges, including reckless driving. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report .","NEW: Photographer, 29, was struck by SUV driven by woman, 69 .

"(CNN) -- A second man charged with murder in the 2011 disappearance of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo told a judge he was innocent Wednesday. Jason Wayne Autry, who is already in prison for an unrelated assault conviction, was indicted on especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder charges by a special grand jury on Tuesday, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said. Autry, 39, was a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, 29, who was indicted last month on the same kidnapping and murder charges. ""Your honor, I want to say one thing -- I'm innocent of these charges. Right hand before God, I'm innocent, sir,"" Autry said in court. Adams also appeared Wednesday in court, where a not guilty plea was entered for a coercion of a witness charge. Bobo was 20 when she was last seen on April 13, 2011. Her brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading her away from their home in the small town of Darden, Tennessee. Information from ""several witnesses"" led to charges against Autry, Gwyn said. Investigators ""believe there are more people with information and possible involvement,"" Gwyn said. He told reporters to ""expect more announcements in the coming days and weeks."" ""These individuals know who they are, and I'm sure they are watching, and they can expect us to be on their doorstep pretty soon,"" Gwyn said. The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee. Many knew the young woman and many rallied behind the effort to find her. Hundreds of volunteers turned out to help find her in Decatur, Henderson, Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Many more attended memorial services or offered other support. More than $450,000 has been offered in reward money. Bobo's body has not been found three years after her disappearance.

"(CNN) -- Defending Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins has been forced out of this year's race due to an ongoing knee condition, the Briton's Sky Pro Cycling team announced on Friday. Wiggins, the first British rider to win cycling's most prestigious event, withdrew from the Giro d'Italia with a chest infection on May 18 and he was scheduled to rest and train as well as receive treatment on his knee. But the seven-time Olympic medalist, who has also withdrawn from the Criterium du Dauphine and the Tour de Suisse, has now ran out of time to adequately prepare for the Tour de France, which begins on the island of Corsica on June 29. ""It's a huge disappointment not to make the Tour. I desperately wanted be there, for the team and for all the fans along the way -- but it's not going to happen,"" the 33-year-old told Sky Pro Cycling's official website. ""I can't train the way I need to train and I'm not going to be ready. Once you accept that, it's almost a relief not having to worry about the injury and the race against time. ""I've been through this before, when I broke my collarbone, so I know how it works. I'll get this sorted, set new goals for this season and focus on those."" Team principal Dave Brailsford expressed disappointment at the news, although it had already been confirmed Wiggins would play second fiddle to compatriot Chris Froome at this year's Tour. ""With illness, injury and treatment Brad has gone past the point where he can be ready for the Tour,"" said Brailsford, who is also performance director of British Cycling. ""It's a big loss but, given these circumstances, we won't consider him for selection. ""He hasn't been able to train hard since the Giro and now he needs further rest. Whilst we all know these things happen in sport, it doesn't take away from the fact that this is a huge disappointment for everyone in the team -- and above all for Brad. '""It's incredibly sad to have the reigning champion at Team Sky but not lining up at the Tour. But he's a champion, a formidable athlete and will come back winning as he has before."" Team doctor Richard Freeman said Wiggins had completely recovered from his chest infection, but his knee was worse than first thought. """"The chest infection that caused his withdrawal from the Giro has responded to treatment and rest. It has completely cleared up,"" explained Freeman. ""However, further medical investigations on the knee injury that we were managing at the Giro showed the condition was more significant than we thought. ""It has needed intensive treatment and, whilst it will be fully resolved, Bradley now needs to rest completely for five days before a gradual, return to full training over a period of two to three weeks."" Wiggins was set to play a supporting role to Sky's lead rider Froome at this year's Tour. Kenyan-born Froome finished second in last year's race and is one of the favorites to take the yellow jersey in 2013.","Defending champion Bradley Wiggins withdraws from the 2013 Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Longtime women's rights activist and Malawian Vice President Joyce Banda took charge of her homeland Saturday, ending two days of political intrigue after the death of President Bingu wa Mutharika. Supporters cheered and danced as she was sworn in at a ceremony in the capital, Lilongwe, as Malawi's first female president. ""You have come to witness this occasion from all walks of life regardless of tribe, religion or political affiliation,"" she said. ""I want all of us to move into the future with hope and with that spirit of oneness and unity."" Banda's ascension was contentious even though under the terms of Malawi's constitution, the vice president was in line for the highest office in the land. However, Banda's falling out with the ruling party had raised fears over a potential succession struggle. She was expelled from the party in 2010 in a dispute with the president over his efforts to groom his brother as his eventual successor. She formed her own opposition People's Party, but remained vice president. A government spokeswoman on Friday declared Banda not qualified to assume the presidency. ""The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency,"" said Patricia Kaliati, who serves as information and civic education minister. But Banda appealed for calm Saturday, and said the immediate focus of the country should be on the president's funeral and 10 days of national mourning. She has been a grassroots fighter for women's empowerment and marched in January with Malawian women who demanded an end to attacks on those who were stripped naked on the streets for wearing pants, leggings and miniskirts, instead of dresses. University of Malawi student Sphiwe Tanangachi Banda (no relation) said she was excited about having a woman at the helm. The country, she said, would take positive strides under Banda. Banda often tells her own story of an abusive marriage and how she was trapped in it because she was not economically empowered. She walked out at age 31 with her three children and promised herself she would never find herself in that situation again. She studied briefly in the United States and eventually founded several organizations, including the Joyce Banda Foundation, which educates girls and provides care for orphans, many of them HIV-positive. She also created the Young Women Leaders Network and the Hunger Project. She received the Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger in 1997 for founding the National Association of Business Women of Malawi, aimed at making women economically self-reliant. ""We have no choice in Africa but to invest in women,"" she said in a speech last December at the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. Banda became vice president in May 2009. She was previously foreign affairs minister and minister for gender, children's affairs and community services. Mutharika, 78, fell ill Thursday at the state house in Lilongwe, and was transported to a hospital in South Africa, where he was pronounced dead. It took two days for state media to confirm his death from a heart attack, sparking fears of political turmoil and a constitutional crisis. Soon after the announcement, broadcast stations started playing solemn religious songs as mandated by the government. The international community urged Malawi to observe the succession process in the constitution. ""We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power. We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly,"" said Johnnie Carson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Mutharika, a former World Bank economist who studied in the United States and other countries, was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an ""economic engineer."" He won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014. His initial years in office were considered a success as he focused on battling corruption and working to improve the economy. However, his popularity plunged as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts. Journalist Pilirani Phiri in Lilongwe said Mutharika's passing will help bring needed reforms in the poor nation. ""The president had completely changed,"" Pilirani said. ""He was not the same person who Malawians loved and gave him a landslide victory in 2009."" The United States announced last month that it was suspending $350 million allocated to Malawi because of concerns about its governance. In the city of Blantyre on Saturday, people expressed sadness at Mutharika's death but optimism for the future. ""My expectations are that things will start moving along fine,"" said footballer Enerst Nyaude. CNN's Alden Mahler Levine and journalists Gregory Gondwe and Teresa Temweka Chirwa contributed to this report.","NEW: Joyce Banda is known for her efforts at women's empowerment .

"(CNN) -- Is the greatest Olympian of all time making a comeback? American swimmer Michael Phelps, winner of a record 22 medals at the Games --18 of which were gold -- fueled speculation that he could stage a comeback by undergoing two drug tests over the past five months. Phelps, who seemingly brought the curtain down on his glittering career at the end of London 2012, has been tested twice by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) since July 1. By entering USADA's testing program, the 28-year-old is eligible to compete from March 2014 onwards. Swimming's global governing body FINA requires that athletes who intend to return to competition after announcing their retirement should be tested ""at least nine months before he or she expects to return to competition."" Rumors of a possible return for the ""Baltimore Bullet"" are sure to excite swimming fans, with Phelps himself refusing to rule out a comeback. ""Nothing is set in stone,"" Phelps told the Associated Press (AP). ""If I decide to keep going and swim again, then I'll compete. ""If I don't, I guess I'll re-retire. Just don't compare me to Brett Favre,"" he added, referring to the famed NFL quarterback who made a string of comebacks. According to the AP article, Phelps is training with his former team at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and has shed 15 pounds. Coach Bob Bowman insisted that his return to the pool does not mean he will be lining up at the Rio Olympics in 2016. ""It's premature to say that,"" Bowman told USA Today. ""What we're doing is kind of letting him have his options. ""He came back this fall and started to do some training with the group, mainly just to get in shape. He just felt like he was not fit. He wasn't. ""He's occasionally been training. He's picked it up a little more. We were just thinking about it, and I said, 'You know, you're getting in pretty good shape, maybe you want to swim in a meet?' He said, 'Well, maybe at some point.' "" If Phelps was to return to action in March, his first major international meet wouldn't be the Olympics but the 2015 World Championships in the Russian city of Kazan. Phelps has claimed 33 World Championship medals dating back to 2001, including 26 golds.","Michael Phelps refuses to rule out a swimming comeback .

"(CNN) -- Jo Malone must have one of the most lucrative noses on the planet. The British entrepreneur's ability to create delicate scents -- apparently coveted by everyone from the Duchess of Cambridge to Jennifer Lopez -- helped her create a multi-million dollar fragrance empire. Today her name is synonymous with luxuriously scented cream-colored candles with minimalist black trim, delivered in an oversized carrier bag. Malone sold her namesake fragrance company to cosmetics giant EstÃ©e Lauder in 2006 in a rumored multi-million dollar deal, admitting ""I hadn't anticipated how much of my soul was in that business."" Five years later she launched a new company -- Jo Loves -- which much like the original store, sells candles, bath oils, and perfumes, now with names like ""Shards of Cedar and Red Thyme,"" ""Green Orange and Coriander,"" and ""A Shot of Thai Lime Over Mango."" But it wasn't an easy journey to the top, and speaking to CNN's Leading Women, Malone reveals how some of her biggest obstacles, also became her biggest sources of inspiration. ""I'm dyslexic so I wouldn't be able to write you a letter or read you a paragraph. But I use my sense of smell like my eyes and hands. It's something that happens naturally to me, so I would look at what you're wearing, and who you are, and I would be translating it back into smell."" ""I left school in my early teens to take care of my mother. And I remember as a little girl, sitting in my bedroom and looking out the window and thinking: 'I don't want to live my life like this. I don't want to live hand to mouth, frightened that there's not going to be something to eat at the end of the day.'"" ""Jo Malone wasn't just a business... she was my best friend. She'd see me through the best and worst times of my life. I realized that it was like a child to me, and after I sold it I could see this business that I still felt a huge amount of emotion for but was not part of it. I would go to any store and touch the face cream and just had to leave."" ""When I fought cancer I didn't know that I was going to come out the other end. And yet my mental attitude was that I would always find a point where I wanted to get to, and I'd head towards it."" ""If I had to choose a different career, I'd be a cook, a chef, and work with food. I love food and I love flavor. Everything that I smell, I want to be able to taste too.""

"(CNN) -- There's a fine science to running a billion dollar company. Rosalind Brewer should know -- she used to study chemistry. Before she was CEO of American retail giant, Sam's Club -- a company which boasted $56 billion in revenues last year -- Brewer earned a degree in science at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia. These days though, one of the first things she thinks about when she wakes up is her 107,000 employees. ""I owe them leadership, direction, and the chance to grow,"" says the chief of the retail warehouse chain, owned by Walmart. ""I take that as a personal responsibility. And I have to earn it every day."" When 51-year-old Brewer took the job in 2012, she became the first woman and the first African American to lead a Walmart division. Two years later, the number of Sam's Club stores has grown from 610 to 643 across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Could the 64th most powerful woman in the world, according to Forbes, one day have the top job at Walmart? ""Oh boy, that is a good question,"" she says, laughing a little nervously. ""If ever I was afforded the opportunity, surely I would step up to the challenge."" Here are four more insights from the former chemistry student. ""One of the best pieces of advice I've received throughout my career was the importance of having honesty and integrity. It helped build me as a person and helped me stay consistent to my values."""" ""The first response from people is that I have a visible difference -- I'm an African American female.

"(CNN) -- Perched on a sofa in her West London apartment, Eve Branson recounts early memories of her son Richard. Disciplining him, it seems, was delicate business. ""He was like a ball of fire as a little boy,"" the 90-year-old told me. ""Like a thoroughbred. You didn't want to pull the reins too hard and spoil him, spoil his adventures and his madness but you had to pull a little bit."" His single-mindedness began to reveal itself when he was just three or four, she recalls. Branson ran off and hid at a local farmer's house after a strong reprimand. ""Eventually someone rang to say 'We've got a little blue-eyed boy here? Does he belong to you?' Gosh was I relieved."" Now, her son has a knighthood, is worth more than $5 billion according to Forbes and is one of the world's most able -- if eccentric -- entrepreneurs. But what was the secret to such success? Does tough love breed success or is support and encouragement key to raising tomorrow's tycoons? I set out to answer these questions in a series of interviews with the mothers of sports stars, tech pioneers and rockers and discovered they had many traits in common. Branson, it seems, was not the only budding businessman with a mind of his own. Maye Musk, mum of PayPal magnate Elon, has a similar story. The South African model and nutritionist laughs nervously as she recalls the time she left a young Elon Musk behind at home for misbehaving while taking her other children to visit their cousins. It was a 20 minute drive away or four hours on foot, she says. Just as she was leaving Musk says her son turned up out of nowhere. ""I saw this tiny little boy, just past toddler stage, coming down the sidewalk. It was Elon. He'd walked there! I was horrified."" Now aged 42, her son has revolutionized the world of e-commerce and electric vehicles through his companies Paypal and Tesla. And just like Branson, who soon aims to make passenger space travel a possibility, Musk is taking on the final frontier: with a contract from NASA for his firm Space X to transport orbital cargo. Maye says her each launch leaves her ""anxious and shaking and sick,"" with relief finally coming with success. It's a reaction Judy Murray can sympathize with. Murray has raised two successful children, both of whom hold Wimbledon titles. Older son Jamie is a doubles champion while her youngest is the singles title holder Andy. When Andy Murray clinched the Wimbledon title last year, the first Briton to do so in 77 years, his mother couldn't look. ""I buried my face because I knew the cameras would be on me."" Murray, herself an accomplished tennis player and coach, introduced her sons to the sport as a way of keeping them busy, but never expected her family name to make the sport's hall of fame. ""As eight and nine year olds they were exceptionally good tennis players...but when I saw Andy holding the trophy, I just thought ""I can't believe it,"" she says. Judy Murray has been accused of being pushy but says people ""make assumptions because they don't know me. ""I've heard Andy and Jamie being asked that before and they say 'my mum never pushed us.' That's why they are still doing what they are doing, because they love what they are doing."" Another famous son inspired by his parent's passion is Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. The child of two computer programmers and maths aficionados, Berners-Lee grew up in a household of calculus before bedtime. His 90-year-old mother Mary-Lee shows me a sketch drawn by a family friend on holiday one year depicting a young Tim and three siblings in animated conversation; the word ""Noise"" scribbled above their heads. ""I used to think my children were terribly well behaved but when I look back at this I realize it wasn't always so,"" she says. She recalls evenings around the dinner table, when the family would try and solve maths problems. If his parents were unable to crack it, Tim Berners-Lee would step in, she told me. ""It was all terribly good fun."" But good mothers don't always choose the conventional path: Jo Wood, who raised her three kids while on tour with the Rolling Stones, felt it important to educate them on life as a rocker's offspring. Describing the moment she offered her son and daughter cocaine and cannabis, respectively, Jo says she felt ""like a lioness showing her cubs the world and what was out there."" Did that make her a bad mother? ""Luckily it didn't backfire,"" she says. Now a grandmother, Wood has fond memories of the days she spent on the road with her family and the Stones. ""I used to love it. We'd just pack up and it was like we were all going on an adventure."" And in many ways Wood was a mother figure to the whole band. ""I loved Charlie for his wonderful cold sense of humor, and of course I loved Ronnie, Keith has a special place in my heart and Mick, you never know where you stand with him. One minute he can be fabulous and then next he'll ignore you."" Wood credits her kids, art dealer Jaimie, singer Leah and youngest son Tyrone, with helping her through the breakdown of her marriage. She is now runs her own beauty brand and says ""my kids kept me sane through all of my hard times,"" she says. ""They'd call me up and make sure I wasn't alone. They'd take me clubbing. And just like the other famous mothers I met she concludes: ""My kids are great. I know I wouldn't be the same without them."" More from Nina dos Santos: The European Union needs a new vision .

"(CNN) -- A New Mexico inmate, an ex-convict on probation and his nephew are under investigation for plotting to castrate and murder pop singer Justin Bieber, police said Thursday. Their unsuccessful scheme called for targeting Bieber and his bodyguard while in New York City in mid-November, and their motive grew from the inmate's quest for notoriety and his infatuation with Bieber, said a New Mexico State Police affidavit. The inmate, Dana Martin, who is serving two life sentences for a 2000 rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in Vermont, has a tattoo of Bieber on his leg and had attempted to correspond with Bieber, who never responded, the affidavit said. ""This perceived slight made Mr. Martin upset and that, coupled with Mr. Martin's perception of being a 'nobody' in prison, led him to begin plotting the kidnap and murder of (Bieber),"" the affidavit said, adding that Martin gave statements to investigators. With Martin serving as the mastermind, the plan called for the uncle and nephew to first kill two other people, in Vermont, the affidavit said. But the entire scheme to kill a total of four people, including Bieber, unraveled when the uncle and nephew missed their turn on a Vermont road and ended up heading toward the Canadian border on November 19, authorities said. There, a U.S. Border Patrol agent at the Highgate Springs crossing arrested the uncle, Mark Aaron Staake, 41, because he was found to have an outstanding warrant for a felony parole violation out of New Mexico, authorities said. The nephew, Tanner Ruane, 23, was released with their 1983 BMW, but he then spilled the beans about the murder plots when he called Martin in prison the same day, New Mexico authorities said. Prison guards were recording the phone call, and Ruane was later arrested in New York by state police, authorities said. In the phone call, Ruane and Martin spoke in code and referred to the victims as ""dogs,"" the affidavit said. ""Mr. Martin confirmed that the 'dogs' would be castrated too, and Mr. Ruane not only agreed, but stated he himself was the one who was going to do the castrating,"" the affidavit said. The instrument for castration would be hand-held hedge clippers used for trimming roses, the court document said. The victims were to be strangled with a paisley tie ""because that was what he (Mr. Martin) had used previously,"" the affidavit said, without elaborating. ""In response to Mr. Staake's reluctance to follow through with the castrations, Mr. Ruane stated he was going to do it and get 'five large for each one I get.' Mr. Martin confirmed that Mr. Ruane was going to get $2,500.00 per testicle,"" the affidavit said. The testicles were to be put in bags, to be hidden in a place such as the engine compartment, the document said. When asked by CNN if that grisly plan would be applied to all victims, including Bieber, McDonald stated: ""It would be safe to say they were going to do it for every one of them."" None of the three men have been charged in the alleged murder plot against Bieber and his bodyguard, but the investigation is continuing, New Mexico State Police Lt. Robert McDonald told CNN. New Mexico authorities are seeking the extradition of Staake from Vermont and Ruane from New York, McDonald said. Both men have Albuquerque addresses, police said. Staake and Ruane are now each facing two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and two counts to commit aggravated battery, and those New Mexico charges relate to their plot to kill two people in Vermont, McDonald said. Authorities weren't elaborating on that scheme and the two intended victims, McDonald said. The attorneys for Staake and Ruane didn't respond to CNN's requests for comment Thursday. Said McDonald: ""We got to interview these (two) men and see what they say about this whole thing."" The affidavit refers to Bieber as ""Victim 3"" or ""J.B."" who was the ""ultimate target."" McDonald told CNN that J.B. refers to Justin Bieber. A representative for 18-year-old Bieber said, ""We take every precaution to protect and ensure the safety of Justin and his fans."" Bieber rose to fame in 2009 with his hit single ""One Time."" He was named Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards in both 2010 and 2012. Martin and Staake met while inmates in the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility after Martin was transferred there from a Florida prison in April, the affidavit said. Staake was released and put on probation on October 22. McDonald didn't know why Martin was in a Florida prison, he said. ""When asked how he was able to convince Mr. Staake to participate, Mr. Martin stated he (Mr. Martin) was a very good manipulator,"" the court document said. Martin also promised money and a Vermont farm as a hideout, the affidavit said. Martin remains under investigation and is in fact named in the affidavit as a conspirator in the Vermont plot. The affidavit was filed in Dona Ana County for seeking an arrest warrant against Staake. But Martin hasn't been formally charged in any of the plots, McDonald said. ""For us, there's no rush (for charges) as far as Martin is concerned because he's serving life sentences anyway,"" McDonald said. Media across the world have been calling McDonald. ""It's been freaking crazy,"" he said. ""But the good thing is we nipped this thing in the bud and we caught it before anyone was hurt. ""We're definitely thankful -- we owe it to the guard at the correctional facility who caught these phone calls and got on it right away. That's how we were able to catch these guys,"" McDonald said. CNN's Laura Ly and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's been freaking crazy,"" police spokesman says of global interest in case .

"Washington (CNN) -- As debates swirl about the ""militarization of police,"" President Barack Obama has ordered a review of programs enabling state and local law enforcement to buy military equipment, a senior administration official said Saturday. The decision follows public criticism of the recent use of such assets -- including armored vehicles, high-tech weaponry and stun grenades -- in Ferguson, Missouri, where police have faced off with protesters ever since the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. Acquisition of military surplus equipment by local police departments became possible through the military's Defense Logistics Agency, a law enforcement support program established in 1999. But, once in the hands of these departments, it's ""up to local law enforcement to determine how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said earlier this week. Opinion: The real reason Ferguson has military weapons . Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has defended his force's actions, saying officers have needed protection and noting that some protesters have thrown fire bombs. Other officials, including Gov. Jay Nixon, have expressed concern about the ramped-up equipment and patrols following the first protests. On Monday, Obama signaled police access to military power may be due a look. ""There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,"" he said. ""That would be contrary to our traditions."" Concerns about perception have been echoed by Attorney General Eric Holder. ""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" he said. The review will explore whether such programs and funding are appropriate, whether state and local enforcement agencies have the necessary training and guidance after getting such equipment, and whether the federal government is sufficiently auditing the use of equipment obtained through federal programs and funding. White House staff -- including members of the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget -- will lead the review in coordination with Congress, according to the official. Officer Wilson's supporters: 'We will not hide'' CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","President Obama orders review of programs providing local police military equipment .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The illness that derailed Miley Cyrus' U.S. tour in April has returned like a wrecking ball at the start of her European tour. Cyrus' Friday and Saturday shows in Amsterdam and Antwerp have been rescheduled for June 20 and 22 because she suffered a setback in her battle against a ""severe allergic reaction"" to an antibiotic, her rep said. The 21-year-old singer fell ill on April 15 and was kept in a Kansas City hospital for several days.  The remaining North American shows in her ""Bangerz"" tour were postponed until August. ""After a period of improvement, Cyrus' symptoms have returned and doctors will not permit her to travel,"" her representative told CNN Wednesday. ""This type of extreme reaction can last up to 27 days and Cyrus must remain under doctors' care at this time."" Cyrus is still hoping to perform her ""Bangerz"" show at London's O2 Arena on May 6, the rep said. She initially became ill in early April with a flu-like illness, which caused her to pull out of her Charlotte show. After being prescribed the antibiotic Cephalexin, her health woes grew when an allergic reaction to the drug left Cyrus hospitalized for more than a week, according to a statement from her representative earlier this month. Cyrus used Twitter to express her sadness, posting a tweet of 132 crying emoticons Tuesday.

"London (CNN) -- If you call your office IT department, find someone to develop your website or browse in a computer store, chances are you'll be dealing with a man. So where are all the women? In the UK, women make up just 18% of the IT professional workforce, according to e-Skills, the sector skills council. Maggie Berry, founder of recruitment and career development agency Women in Technology, says employers are crying out for more women in their technology teams. Yet a survey of women in working in technology published by her organization in 2011 found many felt they hit a glass ceiling and were being passed over for promotion in favor of male colleagues. Almost two-thirds of respondents had more than 10 years experience in the technology sector, yet only 26% have reached senior management or board level. So, how can women break into the best technology jobs and keep rising through the ranks? Here, Berry gives her top tips for women to make it to the top in technology. See also: Women! Embrace your inner geek . 1. Get out there . Technology recruiters would love to take on more women, but can't do so if they don't see your CV, says Berry. So be more speculative and apply for jobs that stretch you a bit. ""Women will look at a job specification and feel they have to be able to do 100% before they apply,"" said Berry. ""Men are much more speculative and will apply even if they can't do it all. ""Women need to grasp the interest and be more ambitious in putting themselves forward for jobs or for promotion."" Almost 90% of the respondents to the Women in Technology survey said they would need to fulfill three-quarters of the job description before applying for a job. Berry said firms could help by reducing the long list of job requirements in advertisements that could be putting women off applying. 2. Self-promotion is OK . The relatively small number of women working in technology should mean it's easier for them to build a profile, according to Berry, but in reality the opposite is often true. ""If you look at technology conference lineups, the speakers are almost all men,"" said Berry. ""Women spend a lot of time keeping their heads down and getting their jobs done. ""Your technical skills might speak for themselves, but to get on you really need to focus on promoting yourself: Speaking at events, taking any opportunity to let people know what you're doing."" See also: How to have more Sheryl Sandbergs . 3. Find a sponsor . A mentor, someone more experienced in your industry, who can advise you on career choices is invaluable, says Berry. Even better is finding a sponsor -- someone within your company who will root for you, promote your work and push you for promotion. Berry said: ""Women tend to be good at finding mentors, but not so many have sponsors, who will speak up for them and actively work to progress their careers. ""Women can feel quite isolated as they might be the only female in their department or team, so it is very powerful to have people looking out for you."" Among the responses given in the Women in Technology survey was that more female mentors and role models were needed in schools and universities to encourage more girls into IT. 4. Get networking . And no, we're not talking about computer networks. The more people you know in your sector, the more people you can call on for help when you need it. ""Networking is something you need to do right from the start of your career. It should be part and parcel of your professional life,"" said Berry. ""You could join a professional body, a specific network for your specialism or something locally where you live. ""You need as many people as you can to call on for advice."" See also: Women only hotel floors take off . 5. Don't act like a man . Women who responded to the survey were almost equally divided on whether they felt showing male characteristics helped them at work. ""I would like to think women can progress without having to act like one of the boys. Whatever the culture of a workplace, it's important to be authentic to yourself."" The majority of respondents said that other women see working in technology as 'geeky'. While many said that they do not mind being labeled as geeks, they fear the nerdy image needs to change to attract more young women into the industry. 6. Keep in touch if you have a career break . The technology industries lose a huge number of talented women who find it hard to get back in after a career break with children, says Berry. ""Technology is changing so quickly with new releases and new software, so it's really important to keep your skills up to date. ""There are no easy answers, and it's a big problem for the industry. I would like to see employers running 'return to work' schemes to help women get their skills back up to date after a career break. ""It would help them harvest that talent and would help everyone, but it needs investment."" One comment from Berry's survey may ring true for many women with children: ""The male bosses had no sympathy or understanding towards working mothers.""","Women in Technology founder gives top tips for women to succeed in IT careers .

"(CNN) -- Fortune's latest ranking of America's 500 largest corporations includes more women CEOs than ever before. Women lead 18 of the 500 companies, including Hewlett-Packard (10th) run by Meg Whitman and IBM (19th) run by Ginni Rometty, both of whom started within the last year. Other executives to have shattered the glass ceiling include Patricia Woertz of agricultural processors Archer Daniels Midland; Indra Nooyi who is CEO of Pepsico, Irene Rosenfeld who heads up Kraft Foods; Ursula Burns who is CEO at Xerox and Sherilyn McCoy at Avon. Rometty is IBM's first female CEO and Xerox chief Ursula Burns is the first African-American woman to head a Fortune 500 company. The top five female CEOs on the list all held positions in strategic planning before being appointed. There are an additional 21 female CEOs in the Fortune 501-1000, some managing steel, oil and energy companies. Read more: 10 most powerful women in tech . Lists like the Fortune 500 typically generate debate about how to improve female representation in governance positions. Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization advocating for more women in business, found that in Canada women hold 14.5% of board seats, a figure that rose by only half a percent between 2009 and 2011. In America, women hold 16.1% of board seats, an increase of less than half a percent from 2010. About 10% of the top 500 U.S. companies, and almost 40% of Canada's 500 largest companies have no women on their boards, according to Catalyst. In the UK, where only 9.8% of FTSE250 companies are lead by women, and 44% have no female board members at all, a report by former trade minister Lord Davies estimated that, at the current rate of change, it will take 70 years to achieve gender balance in the boardroom. Baroness Mary Goudie is founder of the 30% Club, which encourages company chairs to commit to achieving at least 30% women on UK corporate boards. She notes that, while there is a record number of women CEOs in the United States, ""on the other hand, you've got hardly any women on boards. ""The United States doesn't have the same regulatory situation as boards in the UK and parts of Europe. In the UK you can only do two terms on a board, so we're seeing a turnaround for women, whereas in the States, people seem to get on a board and stay for a lifetime, almost. The pipeline is blocked forever."" Despite this, Baroness Goudie feels female CEOs can influence the make-up of boards. ""They can try to influence the chairman of their company by saying, 'Look at the shortlist: How many women are you bringing on?'"" They may also indirectly benefit others aspiring to senior positions. ""A number of women CEOs have children. They are looking to make change and to encourage the pipeline. There'll be a few who won't be helpful but the vast majority of women CEOs are doing all they can to encourage other women to go after these jobs."" More from Leading Women: Want more female execs? Sort out the household chores . Companies with fewer females in senior positions might be shooting themselves in the foot. Catalyst has also analyzed the performance of F500 companies with women board members. It found that, from 2004 to 2008, the Fortune 500 companies with the most female board directors outperformed those with the least -- by 16% on return on sales and by 26% on return on invested capital. Companies which had three or more women on boards for at least four of those years outperformed those with the lowest rates of female representation by 84% on return on sales, 60% on return on invested capital and 46% on return on equity.","This year's Fortune 500 list includes the greatest number of female CEOs in history .

"Bangalore, India (CNN) -- As one of India's richest self-made women, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has an impressive resume. Her business Biocon, worth $800million, is one of India's leading drug companies and employs more than 6,000 people at its vast campus in Bangalore. Mazumdar-Shaw was named among Forbes Magazine's 100 ""Most Powerful Women"" in the world in 2012, in the Financial Times' ""The top 50 women in world business"" in 2011 and Time Magazine's ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" in 2010. But it was a very different story in 1978 when Mazumdar-Shaw started Biocon at the age of 25 with the equivalent of less than $200 in today's money. She founded the company in a garage and -- as a woman and one of the first pioneers of biotechnology in India -- found it difficult to obtain both staff and funding. ""I had a lot of foolish courage because when I started up the company I found I had huge credibility challenges to overcome,"" said Mazumdar-Shaw. ""I was a 25-year-old woman with no business experience, I was trying to pioneer a sector called biotechnology which nobody had heard of. ""I therefore had huge challenges from getting financial backing to even getting people to work in the organization."" Mazumdar-Shaw originally qualified as India's first master brewer, but became an entrepreneur after failing to find a job in brewing. ""I was finding it very difficult to get a job as a brew master,"" she said. ""It was a chance encounter with a biotech entrepreneur from Ireland that got me started as an entrepreneur in India, because I partnered this Irish company in setting up India's first biotech company."" She added: ""It has taken me over 30 years to get from a garage to the huge campus that we have today. And it's been a long journey -- it's been a very exciting journey."" Having built up a leading company from scratch, many would expect Mazumdar-Shaw to have her mind fixed solely on the business. But she also has a social mission to expand access to healthcare in India. Also on Leading Women: A brighter picture for women in art . ""India is a country where 80% of healthcare (spend) is out of pocket; where 80% of healthcare infrastructure is in the private sector; where most people don't have access to quality healthcare,"" she said. In 2009, she founded a low-cost cancer hospital with the aim of making usually expensive cancer treatment accessible to more people. ""I felt there was a crying need for a comprehensive cancer center which also addresses affordability,"" said Mazumdar-Shaw. Her goal to make healthcare more accessible for all Indians has driven her to search for a cheaper model of drug development. ""We simply cannot afford to develop drugs that cost $1-3 billion to develop, because these drugs will not actually reach people who really need (them) the most,"" she said. ""You will only be confining it to a very few people in the world who can afford it. ""We've got to change this model. I believe that we have enough technology in the world to bring down this cost of innovation."" Also on Leading Women: Why women will impact global economy as much as China . One achievement of which Mazumdar-Shaw is particularly proud is helping to reverse India's brain drain of scientists. She employs almost 5,000 scientists, of whom just under 40% are women and many have returned to India from abroad. ""One of my objectives when I started Biocon was to make sure that I create a company for women scientists to pursue a vocation,"" said Mazumdar-Shaw. ""And I wanted to make sure that we created a research environment for scientists, because at that time we were facing a very strong brain drain of scientists and engineers from India, there just weren't enough companies to employee such people."" The challenges ahead for Mazumdar-Shaw include getting Biocon to the billion dollar mark, and continuing to innovate. ""There's a huge journey ahead for me. There are many, many more milestones ahead,"" she said. ""I want to be remembered as someone who put India on the scientific map of the world in terms of large innovation. ""I want to be remembered for making a difference to global healthcare. And I want to be remembered as someone who did make a difference to social economic development in India."" A side effect is that people might also remember how wealthy she is. ""I hate the title of being called the richest woman in India, but it's the recognition that this was the value that I had created as a woman entrepreneur and that makes me very, very proud.""","Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw pioneered biotech in India in a garage at the age of 25 .

"(CNN) -- YouTube has a new boss and she has a ""healthy disregard for the impossible"" -- according to Google CEO Larry Page. In that case, 45-year-old Susan Wojcicki has quite the job ahead of her. Not least of which, trying to work out how the video-sharing giant should display advertising on its website -- and get online viewers to watch it. Before she was head of YouTube, Wojcicki was senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google -- the company, which instead of trying to compete with the popular video-sharing website, decided to buy it for $1.65 billion in 2006. Ok, so apart from disregarding impossible things, what do we know about the highest-ranking woman at Google? Tip: there's your first clue. Google started in her garage. Cast your mind back to 1998. Steve Jobs had just introduced the world's first iMac, the internet still had a dial-up tone, and a couple of computer-savvy Stanford University students were setting up a search engine in Wojcicki's Californian garage. Those students were Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and their search engine would eventually become the multi-billion dollar global technology company we know today: Google. She's part of the Google dynasty. Since she first rented her garage to Brin and Page to help pay her mortgage 16 years ago, Wojcicki has been deeply rooted in the Google Dynasty -- yep, such a thing exists. She was the 16th person they hired and is married to fellow Google executive Dennis Troper. Her younger sister Anne married Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and her teacher and journalist mother Esther has consulted the company on education issues. She was four months pregnant when she joined Google. Wojcicki's friends told her she was crazy when she left her job at Intel to join the start-up company while pregnant with her first child. Today, Wojcicki says it was one of the best decisions of her life. Family remains incredibly important to the mother-of-four, who always tries to be home in time for dinner and tells colleagues not to contact her between 6pm and 9pm when she's with her children. As a kid she wanted to be an artist. ""In some ways I think that's what actually led me to technology,"" Wojcicki told Makers.com. ""I thought: 'This is like a new way of making things.'"" One of three sisters, her father is Stanford University physics professor, Stanley Wojcicki, and her mother is journalist and educator, Esther Wojcicki. Susan is also a huge supporter of girls in technology -- you can read her open letter on the subject here. She's behind Google Images and Google Books. When Wojcicki joined Google in 1999, she became the company's first marketing manager, later leading the initial development of high-profile projects like Google Images and Google books. As senior vice president of advertising and commerce, she was responsible for the company's advertising products -- accounting for 87% of its revenues in 2012. And when Google bought YouTube eight years ago, she was right behind it -- which seems all the more fitting, considering her new position.","Meet Susan Wojcicki: the new head of YouTube .

"(CNN) -- Kanye West has high expectations from his fans at concerts. And if you can't meet them, he's going to need to know why. While performing in Sydney on Friday, West paused his performance to request that all audience members stand before he went on with the show. It's not unusual for an artist to ask the audience to physically participate, but West's insistence at his concert Friday led to a very uncomfortable moment. ""I've decided, I can't do this song, I can't do the rest of this show until everybody stands up,"" West said, adding an exception for those with handicaps. ""No, seriously -- I won't go on with the show unless y'all stand up."" As video from the concert shows, West really wasn't kidding, as he took several moments to scan the audience for anyone sitting down. When he spotted two people who still weren't standing, West initially griped, ""This was the longest I've had to wait to do a song. It's unbelievable."" According to The Hollywood Reporter, one of those individuals had a prosthetic limb, and another was in a wheelchair. After sending someone over to investigate why the two concertgoers weren't standing, West quickly clarified that ""if you're using a wheelchair, then it's fine. ... Only if he's in a wheelchair."" Once he'd confirmed that those not standing really couldn't, West continued with his show. The stunt was met with an immediate backlash on Twitter. According to the Daily Mail, it wasn't the first time West has been criticized for making that kind of demand.

"(CNN) -- Liane Moriarty knows playground politics. The Australian author features catty mothers, birthday party snubs and a debauched parental gathering in her latest novel, ""Big Little Lies."" Moriarty is familiar with those dynamics herself: she is a hands-on mother to a 4-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son. While Moriarty says her characters come from her imagination, she's managed to strike a collective nerve among readers around the world. Her latest bestselling book also turned the heads of Hollywood moms: Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon optioned screen rights to ""Big Little Lies."" The novel opens with a school scandal, then traces three families through a tumultuous kindergarten year. Anyone who has picked up young children from elementary school will recognize the characters and conversations in ""Big Little Lies."" Many of Moriarty's novels are book club favorites, and not just in her native Sydney. Her novel ""The Husband's Secret"" sold more than 1 million copies in the United States. She spoke to CNN about putting parenting onto the pages of her novels. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: How are you able to replicate conversations that so many parents have? LM: I guess it just means that we're all having the same kinds of conversations across the world... that they're universal. And, obviously, because I'm completely in that world right now, it's really easy to think like that, because that's the life I'm leading. CNN: Did you have any of those conversations? LM: They're still fictional. Although, there might be little phrases taken from real life, but they're still all fiction. Because it's my world, the material is at my fingertips. CNN: How do you find inspiration for your plots and your characters? LM:  I was inspired by a little story a girlfriend told me when her daughter started school. On the very first day of kindergarten, two little girls came out of the classroom, and they had bite marks on their arms. Because it was the first day of school, no one could say who had done it. They just said a little boy had done it to them. They actually got the little boys to line up. When this girlfriend was telling me the story, I was just so enthralled by the little drama that went on in the playground, and imagining how you would feel if you were one of the parents, hoping that it wasn't your child that had actually done the biting. In the end, the little girls finally gave in and admitted they had bitten themselves. It's little stories like that (which inspire me). People tell stories of awful parents, and bullying parents. And you can definitely see the potential, because you do love your child so fiercely. Because it is a little bit like going back to school yourself. It brings out all those insecurities. When all the parties started, and sometimes, I remember hearing about certain parties, thinking, 'My child wasn't invited. What does that mean?' All those things come out. It's easy to collect on that material. CNN: Have you been surprised by how your books have transcended cultural boundaries? LM: I think as parents, we're all leading similar sorts of lives. So really, the differences are small. And I think they're differences that readers quite enjoy, in the same way that I enjoy reading books set in the U.S. There are things like trick or treating and Halloween, and little things like that. They're a pleasure to read, but easy enough to understand, so you don't feel alienated. CNN: What are you working on now? LM: I'm just in the very early stages of my next novel. I've been joking a lot that my next novel will be set on a tropical island. And I'll have to lots of research to get the setting right. The more I joke, the more I've started to think, 'Actually, that could work.' Because I often like to set my books in a confined setting, a little village .... That's why a school works so well, because you can control it. So why not a tropical island? CNN: Has your success changed the way other parents treat you? LM: They tease me. My husband was taking some time off, and announcing he was going to do some more of the pick-ups (from school). And somebody was saying, 'Will you still do some of the pick-ups?' Somebody else was saying, 'Of course she will. She needs us for her material.' They just seem happy for me. It's not like I'm a film star. It's not especially glamorous.","Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman optioned screen rights for ""Big Little Lies""

"(CNN) -- Apple learned an important lesson this week: Not everyone likes U2. And even those who do really don't like it when you put music in their libraries without asking. A week after giving away a U2 album to most iTunes users, Apple has announced a way for customers to get rid of it. The company released instructions on how to delete the album from an iCloud account, complete with a giant ""Remove Album"" button. Somewhere, a single tear is rolling down Bono's cheek. At the end of Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch announcement last week, the company trotted out the rock supergroup to announce a major marketing collaboration. Is the Apple Watch a game changer? Apple was giving away U2's first new album in five years, ""Songs of Innocence,"" to 500 million iTunes customers for free. It was a clever way to get more people to sign up for iTunes, and Apple even produced a special ad to promote the collaboration. Unfortunately, instead of just offering customers the option to download the album for free, Apple went ahead and gave it to them without asking.

"(CNN) -- It may have been one of the most eagerly anticipated casting choices of the year, and we now know the leads in the film adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" The novel's author, E.L. James, tweeted on Monday that actor Charlie Hunnam will portray Christian Grey, and actress Dakota Johnson has been cast as Anastasia Steele. The highly successful erotic novel was released in 2011, and fans have been speculating about who might portray the two main characters since plans for a film were announced last year. A psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire even put a face to the character of billionaire Grey, who has had readers all aflame. Now, the fantasy will come to life in the form of Hunnam, who is one of the stars of the film ""Pacific Rim"" and the television series ""Sons of Anarchy.""

"(CNN) -- Taylor Swift may be breaking records in the music industry, but Beyonce is breaking the bank. The superstar singer has for the second year in a row topped Forbes' list of the top-earning women in music. The artist known as Beyonce Knowles Carter slid into the No. 1 slot last year with $53 million in earnings; she more than doubled that in 2014 by earning $115 million. ""Beyonce played 95 shows during our scoring period, bringing in an average $2.4 million per city,"" Forbes reports. ""She added endorsement deals from the likes of H&M and Pepsi -- plus her self-titled surprise album, which hit iTunes in December 2013 and quickly became one of the year's top sellers -- to send her income into nine-figure territory."" Swift came in second with $64 million in earnings, which she can add to her accomplishment of selling almost 1.3 million records during the first week of the release for her ""1989"" album. Pink ranked No. 3 with $52 million, followed by Rihanna with $48 million and Katy Perry with $40 million. Forbes bases its list on calculating income from record and merchandise sales, touring, endorsements, publishing and other ventures, without deducting for management and/or attorney fees. The earnings were calculated from June 2013 to June 2014 and were based on data from Pollstar, the RIAA and Nielsen SoundScan, as well as interviews with managers, lawyers and executives.","Beyonce tops the list for second year in a row .

"London, England (CNN) -- When London's Olympic organizers needed a knockout venue that would wow the International Olympic Committee and hold the world's attention, they turned to Zaha Hadid, a provocateur who critics have described as ""the Lady Gaga of architecture"". Iraqi-born Hadid is one of the greatest architects alive. In 2004, she became the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize, architecture's greatest honor. The year prior, she was awarded the European Union Mies van der Rohe Prize for a tram station in Strasbourg. Besides art museums and opera houses, she has designed temporary pop-up structures -- such as a handbag-inspired mobile pavilion for Chanel -- a ski jump in Austria, furniture, door handles, a tea and coffee set and vase for Alessi, and plastic high heels for Brazilian shoe brand Melissa. Not all of her work is exclusively for the wealthy. She also won last year's RIBA Stirling Prize for redesigning a state school in Brixton, South London. Hadid's Aquatic Centre is the first venue you see when you enter the Olympic village. A £269m facility that houses two swimming pools and a diving pool, and seats 22,500, critics have pronounced it the Olympics ""most majestic"" space. But for decades, Hadid languished in the shadows, her work dismissed as ""unbuildable"" and her atelier rarely commissioned in her adopted city. ""I will always have two regrets,"" she told Leading Women. ""I don't have a presence in London, and I would have liked to have done more work in the Middle East."" More from Leading Women: NASA astronaut who inspired women . Architecture was a dream of Hadid's since she was a young girl and, in Baghdad, where she lived until a teenager, it was all around her. ""Many of the great architects of the time like Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright and Sert and Gropius all designed projects for Baghdad,"" she says. Hadid's father headed the National Democratic Party, a progressive force in Iraq in the 1930s and 1940s. ""In the Arab world, like Brazil and in Africa, it was about nation building in that period and also about identity,"" Hadid recalls. ""There was a moment of renaissance, of trying to build a new era and adopt some of these modernist ideas like they did in Chandigarh (a renowned example of urban planning in northern India) or Bangladesh. That was an incredible moment of excitement and that's also why I think it intrigued me at the time."" After an education at the American University of Beirut, Hadid studied architecture at London's Architectural Association School of Architecture. It was the 1970's, a time when, she says, the 1968 student uprisings had invigorated experimentation. ""There were so many different ideologies...There was a lot of focus on drawing at the time, and the idea of the school was really to pick your way through some labyrinth ideas. Looking back, it was very exciting."" Among Hadid's teachers was radical Dutch theorist Rem Koolhaas, with whom Hadid worked upon graduating in 1977. Two years later, though, she founded her own practice near Red Lion Square in Holborn. Today, it employs more than 300 people and brings in around $50-75 million annually. Deploying the ideas that galvanized her in architecture school has not been easy, and acceptance has come slowly for Hadid. After winning a 1994 competition to design an opera house for Cardiff Bay in Wales, her modernist design was derided by critics and locals, and ultimately rejected in favor of a stadium. It was a slap in the face for Hadid, who still describes the experience as ""traumatic"". ""It became a cause celebre,"" she recalls. ""Everyone was trying to prove a point, which was not to allow people to win a major project who are not known, who are not part of the establishment. They didn't like the fact I was not British and I think (being a) woman was also a factor."" ""After that,"" she says, ""we were stigmatized. People remembered there was a problem but they don't know what happened"". Hadid's major breakthrough came in 2003, when she designed the Lois and Richard Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art, in Cincinnati Ohio. Describing her as ""a cultish figure who has built very little of note"", one critic nevertheless pronounced this building ""a virtuoso composition"". The Pritzker Prize followed, and attitudes toward her wild, avant-garde aesthetic softened. Marissa Mayer: Six life lessons from Yahoo CEO . Today, Hadid is internationally feted. Her work is found in Bilbao, Riyadh, Rabat, Seoul, Miami and Manchester. She is a Dame Commander of the British Empire and a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France. She is an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and an honorary fellow of Columbia University. She has honorary degrees from Yale and The Pratt Institute, and has been named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people. In part, she is also celebrated for breaking ground, as a woman in a male-dominated field. It's an accolade she is begrudgingly happy to accept. ""I used to not like being called a woman architect: I'm an architect, not just a woman architect,"" she says. ""Guys used to tap me on the head and say ""you are okay for a girl"". But I see the incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it could be done, so I don't mind that at all."" Hadid was awarded this year's Jane Drew prize for her contribution to the status of women in architecture, something confirmed in a poll of her peers conducted by the British Architects' Journal. Some poll respondents argued that she could not be considered a role model for working mothers, but Hadid says although she has no children, this wasn't a conscious decision. ""I just didn't have them. People think I made a sacrifice, but it wasn't the case. I don't think people should do things because you know ""I am turning this age, I must go have a husband"". If you find somebody and it works out then have kids, it's very nice. But if you don't, you don't."" Stock Exchange CEO: 'Having it all' is pure nonsense . In the world of architecture, a classic juncture on the career path involves building a tower, something Hadid did not achieve until 2004, when she designed the offices for a Marseilles shipping firm. Her take involved a peculiarly striking base. ""We got this idea of the building having a skirt,"" she told Time, ""maybe because I'm a woman, so I know how to wear one — who knows? — but also because it swirls at the bottom to accommodate public areas on the ground, the lobbies."" Despite having achieved so much, Hadid still believes her outsider status as a non-British woman in architecture, particularly in London, as a mixed blessing. ""Being a woman, I don't have a stereotype. They let you get away with things they would not let someone else get away with,"" she says. ""On the other hand, because you are not a woman, not a European guy, there are certain territories that, no matter what you do, you cannot enter. I'm not part of the brotherhood. I will never be golfing with these guys or on a boat trip. I mean, it's not going to happen."" ""In America, it's different. Relationships between men and women professionally are more normalized...but not so much (in Britain)."" ""Contrary to popular view, I've never been patronized in the Middle East,"" she adds. ""Men maybe treat women differently but they do not treat them with disrespect. They don't hate women. It's a very different kind of mentality."" She attributes much of her current success to two unlikely sources: simmering resentment over her failed Cardiff design, and to sleeplessness. ""After the whole Cardiff mess, everyone thought I would give up. There was no reason for me to carry on, but I had to,"" she says. ""I made a very conscious decision in 1996. I thought, I am not going to let them get away with this, and I have to move on. It wasn't only me -- there were another 10, 15, 20 people in my office who knew there was no work. We were all desperate and they carried on as well."" Shared excitement over the work they were doing kept Hadid's team going, she says, and from the communal suffering of pulling all-nighters, genius emerged. ""When you are overworked and exhausted there was a sense of delirium. I remember doing four nights in a row with no sleep. Unless you are crazy, nobody would do that, but you are totally focused on the project. Nothing else matters, things could be falling around you -- and that's what induces great ideas. You are semi-isolated with a bunch of people and it's very exciting."" These days, she says, ""we are slightly more relaxed"", and she is now driven more by a simple desire to do good work. ""I really think that things can be done much better generally,"" she says. ""I have lots of ideas and, of course, just like everything else, you have to edit them, but as an architect you just want to make better and better spaces.""","Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid is the first woman to win architecture's Pritzker Prize.
Her Aquatic Centre is considered the Olympic's most important venue.
As a woman and non-British, Hadid still feels an outsider, but this sometimes works in her favor, she says.

"(CNN) -- Returning to late night after more than half a century earns you an entire evening for yourself. At least it did for Barbra Streisand, who was the sole guest and musical act Monday night on ""The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon."" In honor of her appearance after a 51-year absence, Fallon insisted that Streisand sit in his host chair behind the desk. ""Let's be honest, you're never coming back here,"" Fallon joked. ""This is special."" The legendary star -- who has been open about the stage fright that kept her from performing for years -- was on the show to promote her new album titled ""Partners."" The project is a series of duets with singers, including Blake Shelton, Michael BublÃ© and Stevie Wonder. There is even a virtual performance with the late Elvis Presley. Fallon filled in for some of those partners Monday night as he sang a medley with Streisand. Later, he expressed his nervousness about having the star on the program given her reputation for being difficult. ""I thought you might be a nightmare, or a diva, but you were nice to everybody here,"" Fallon said. ""You are allowed to be a diva. What did you do with Barbra Streisand?!"" The singer even Instagrammed a photo of herself getting makeup done for the show with the caption, ""Last touches...getting ready for Jimmy. #thetonightshow."" As for how Fallon matched her pipes during their duet, Streisand jokingly deadpanned, ""I wouldn't give up your night job,"" before saying that she and her husband, actor James Brolin, are big fans of Fallon and his show.","Barbra Streisand last appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" 51 years ago .

"(CNN) -- In his book ""The Great Escape"", a masterful account of just how much richer, healthier, and happier humankind has become in the last century alone, Princeton economist Angus Deaton makes the inescapable point that whenever some people move ahead the gap widens between them and those they leave behind. The story of ""material progress,"" he writes, ""is one of both growth and inequality."" It is thus hardly surprising that inequality within societies, as well as between them, has become one of the most pressing issues of our time. Many in the United States fear that we are developing the social structure of much of Latin America, with a small, fabulously rich elite facing off against the masses, hundreds of millions of people who see no ladder into the middle class. And we seem to be facing a future of factories in which the work is done by robots and computers, with only a few highly skilled humans to make sure everything is running properly; of Downton Abbey redux where the highly pampered fortunate few employ an army of retainers to care for themselves and their property. The jobs that created and sustained the middle class in the United States, at least, are nowhere in sight. Buffeted by these forces, can capitalism itself survive? That question was the theme of the 2013 World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab summarized the results of that discussion in a blog post, declaring that ""capitalism"" is due to be replaced by ""talentism."" He pointed out that capitalism is not an ideology of free markets and individual responsibility, but rather an economic system in which capital is the most important factor of production, requiring an infrastructure that allows it to be amassed and invested easily. That economic system was a product of the industrial revolution, creating an economy driven by investment in large enterprises. Today, however, ""capital is being superseded by creativity and the ability to innovate -- and therefore by human talents -- as the most important factors of production."" Geoff Mulgan, former economic adviser to Tony Blair, sees capitalism a little differently. He argues that it has always been two-faced in that it rewards not only ""creators, makers, and providers"" on the one hand, but also ""takers and predators"" on the other. Our current system of capitalism has indeed never been more creative, but also never more predatory. Going forward, we must design rules to reward the creators and discourage the predators. That is a lovely vision, at least for everyone who feels talented and creative. Certainly technology puts more at the fingertips of the world's creators, innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs than ever before. We can start a business from our laps: Creating a website, hiring and communicating with employees, assembling services from accounting to payroll to marketing all on-line. Technologists at the New America Foundation have developed a wireless mesh communication system that can be downloaded and installed by any community seeking to create a fast and effective intranet, for free. The sharing economy allows individuals to make money out of renting rooms, cars, power mowers and snow blowers, and anything else they want to pass on to others, changing the underlying concept of what it means to ""own"" something in the first place. Still, all creators are still riding on the backs of investors -- public investors. Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at Sussex University, has just made a powerful case that new technologies from the iPhone to the GPS to immunizations have all been initially funded and incubated by government investment. Incubation is a nursery image, enabling an infant to survive and thrive. States invest in their societies the way parents invest in children, not to create dependence but to enable independence. A successful, competitive state recognizes the underlying social contract between citizens who pay taxes and governments that invest in the physical and legal infrastructure necessary for businesses to flourish, from roads to regulations. Elizabeth Warren was right when she said that nobody in the United States ""got rich on their own."" They depended on roads, bridges, police forces, educated workers, and the other appurtenances of a modern industrialized state. Ask anyone in a developing country without decent roads, much less enforceable rules. Or anyone riding the trains in the United States and contending with the continual delays, breakdowns, and speeds far slower than in Europe or Asia. Or passengers jouncing over the rutted streets of even Mayor Michael Bloomberg's New York. But we don't just need a physical infrastructure. We need an infrastructure of care that invests in human capital. Instead of the ""nanny state,"" taking care of citizens from cradle to grave, we need both public and private investment to allow us to take much better care of each other. Call it the ""leg-up state,"" enabling parents to nurture the talent and potential of their children without taking their own talent and potential out of the economy. Supporting children as they work to help their parents remain independent, healthy, and productive for as long as possible at the other end of life. Valuing and rewarding teachers, childcare workers, early education providers, coaches, nurses, therapists, social workers, community volunteers and members of any other caring profession. The leg-up state is also the answer to growing inequality. An economy that flourishes through large investments of financial capital into an infrastructure of both competition and care is much more likely to be an economy of genuinely equal opportunity, focused less on providing jobs than enabling individuals to create their own jobs. The great escape of the 21st century need not be a zero-sum game. Those who have found a road to a still richer and more rewarding world can at least unlock the prisons and light the path for others to follow. Read more: Hillary Clinton and the sisterhood .

"(CNN) -- When the Winter Olympics roll around, Canadians pretty much always expect the national hockey team to win gold. Sure enough the squad ultimately didn't disappoint in Sochi, claiming the finale 3-0 against Sweden on the final day of the Games. It was Canada's second straight men's gold at the Olympics and third in the past four. And coupled with the women coming out on top in the women's competition, it gave Canada a much coveted hockey double. Russia crumbled amid heavy expectations in the men's hockey but the host nation, helped by a sweep in cross country skiing's 50-kilometer mass start Sunday, led the way in both medals won with 33 and gold medals tallied with 13. Canada finished third in golds and fourth overall after it blanked Sweden at the Bolshoy Ice Dome. With Canada hockey mad, questions were asked about the roster prior to the Olympics and eyebrows raised following unconvincing victories over Norway and Latvia in Sochi. But Canada picked it up when it mattered, overcoming the U.S. in the semifinals and also blanking the Swedes. ""I think anyone knows the talent and ability this team has,"" centerman Jonathan Toews told Canada's CBC. ""A huge credit goes to our commitment to playing a team game and will to win. ""People were doubting whether we can score goals in this tournament. It's easy for a group like that to go press and try and create offense and get away from our game plan but we stuck with it every single night. Here we all are on top of the podium so it feels really good."" Carey Price -- who plays for the Montreal Canadiens, perhaps the most storied hockey franchise around -- made 24 saves Sunday after keeping out 31 shots in the semis. Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Sidney Crosby, Toews and Chris Kunitz scored for Canada and it was more than enough given Price's stellar performance. ""Playing behind that group of guys was a lot of fun,"" Price told the CBC. ""That work ethic that those guys brought to the ice every day made my job easier."" As he did following the semifinals, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to congratulate the team. Sweden entered the clash short-handed, with key centerman Nicklas Backstrom of the Washington Capitals testing positive for a banned stimulant. ""I've got absolutely nothing to hide,"" Backstrom told reporters. ""It was shocking to me and at the same time I'm here right now and I have to deal it. ""I haven't done anything differently in the past seven years and I've been playing internationally all that time."" The NHL issued a statement and said it wouldn't take any action against Backstrom. ""We understand that Nicklas Backstrom tested positive for a substance banned 'in competition' by the International Olympic Committee,"" said NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly. ""It is our further understanding that the positive test was the result of a common allergy medication taken by the player knowingly, with the approval of the team doctor and without the intention of gaining an illegal or improper performance-enhancing benefit. ""In addition, the specific substance that resulted in the positive test is not currently on the League's Prohibited Substances List. ""Subject to confirmation of the facts as we understand them, and given the fact that the substance is neither prohibited in the NHL nor was used in an improper manner here, we do not anticipate there being any consequences relative to Nicklas' eligibility to participate in games for the Washington Capitals."" Russian 1-2-3 . Russia was tied with Norway for gold medals won prior to Sunday and led the U.S. by two overall. The 1-2-3 finish in the cross country ensured glory in both categories. Alexander Legkov edged Maxim Vylegzhanin by 0.7 seconds, with Ilia Chernousov capturing the bronze in a photo finish. Legkov's time was a shade past one hour, 46 minutes. ""This is priceless,"" Legkov told reporters. ""It's more valuable than my life. I can't express how I feel. For 15 years I've been trying for this result.""

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Lawrence isn't just an Oscar-winning actress. She's now a chart-climbing singer, too. Lawrence's song ""The Hanging Tree"" from ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I"" debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. That chart tracks the top 100 popular songs in the U.S. each week, and Lawrence's single is sandwiched between Nick Jonas' ""Jealous"" and Meghan Trainor's ""Lips Are Movin'."" That's not bad for an actress who's claimed she has a ""tone-deaf"" singing voice. ""I do not like singing in front of other people. That's my biggest fear,"" Lawrence told David Letterman on ""The Late Show"" in November. ""I'm, like, scarred from my childhood because I have a mother who would just tell me that I was amazing at everything and that I could do everything, and I can't."" Oh, but it would seem she can. According to Billboard, Lawrence is just the 13th acting Oscar winner to also notch a spot on the Hot 100 chart. She follows in the footsteps of stars like Bing Crosby, Julie Andrews, Cher, Jamie Foxx, Meryl Streep and Jennifer Hudson. ""The Hanging Tree"" was written by ""Hunger Games"" author Suzanne Collins and Lumineers musicians Jeremiah Fraites and Wesley Schultz. Lawrence shares a credit on the song with James Newton Howard, who provided the score for ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I."" The soundtrack for the movie, which features Lorde, Bat for Lashes, Charli XCX and CHVRCHES, is proving just as popular as Lawrence's song. Since its debut November 17, it's remained in the top 10 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and is at No. 40 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart. ""Mockingjay -- Part I,"" the third installment in the four-part ""Hunger Games"" franchise, has also been the expected hit at the box office.

"(CNN) -- The legendary computer club where Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first showed off their early retail computers is reuniting next month. Tech-savvy members of the Homebrew Computer Club are scheduled to present at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., the same city where tech giants Google and LinkedIn now have their headquarters. SEE ALSO: Technostalgia: 20 Misty Memories of Personal Computing . A Kickstarter campaign, which aimed to raise $16,000 to fund the reunion, announced that the event will take place on Nov. 11. Original members of the club will be on hand to ""celebrate their legacy and to impart their wisdom to the next generation of hackers and creators whose innovations will shape the future,"" according to the Kickstarter page. The Homebrew Computer Club was founded in 1975 and, in typical Silicon Valley fashion, hosted its inaugural meeting at computer engineer Gordon French's garage in Menlo Park, Calif. ""If one had to pick the single most important moment in personal computing history, the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club in that dimly lit garage in Menlo Park might be at the top of the list,"" the campaign's organizers said on Kickstarter. So far, 25 members from the club's old guard, including Wozniak, have RSVPed for the reunion. Tickets for the public are being sold via the Kickstarter page; a single ticket costs $64, or $128 for a ticket and a limited-edition t-shirt. The campaign aimed to raise $16,000 to fund the event space, food, and travel for some of the club's original members. As of Saturday, more than 200 backers had pledged over $23,000 towards the event. If the campaign raises $30,000, professional photographs from the event will be shared online. If $40,000 is raised, a micro-documentary will be made about the reunion. What do you think was the Homebrew Computer Club's biggest contribution to technology? Tell us in the comments, below.

"(CNN) -- Go ahead and grab a tissue before you watch this one. It's hard not to get swept up in the emotion of singer/rapper/producer Pharrell Williams as he breaks down while discussing his hit song ""Happy"" with Oprah Winfrey. Appearing on Winfrey's ""Oprah Prime"" show on the OWN network, Williams said the song didn't get much traction until he released a music video in November. Then everything went ""boom."" ""And we were like, 'What's happening?' "" he said. ""First of all, people are putting up their own videos. It was like no longer my song."" Winfrey then showed a compilation video of fans around the world displaying what ""Happy"" meant to them. The singer was so moved he wept. ""It's overwhelming because it's like I love what I do,"" Williams said. ""I just appreciate the fact that people have believed in me for so long, that I could make it to this point to feel that."" Winfrey said it made her cry also. ""It's being used for something that's greater than yourself,"" she said. ""I get that."" After Williams' clearly genuine reaction, Winfrey also had some thoughts as to why the song has become so popular. ""I so now get why it's so infectious,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Hollywood's A-list is a very tough club to crack, and membership is limited to stars of vast appeal with worldwide fame. Chris Pratt may soon get his invitation to join. ""I think Chris is the biggest actor in the world, it's just people don't know it yet,"" said James Gunn, director of the new action-adventure movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" which features Pratt in the lead role. Pratt plays the film's wisecracking space cowboy Peter Quill (aka ""Star-Lord"") who is as deadly accurate with a one-liner as he is with his trusty ""element gun."" ""He's got that old-time charm of Gary Cooper,"" Gunn said. ""He's got the vulnerability of a very modern actor. He's a big masculine guy that can definitely beat the crap out of any other movie star out there. ... There's nobody else out there like him."" Nobody else his age, perhaps. ""We're seeing this new leading man that reminds me of someone like a Harrison Ford,"" said Benicio Del Toro, Pratt's co-star in ""Guardians."" At 35, Pratt is slightly less than half the age of Ford (72), another actor launched to stardom by a space opera -- ""Star Wars"" Pratt seems unfazed by all the fuss being made over him as Hollywood's potential Next Big Thing. ""You know, I feel like, jeez, it's been cool, it's been really cool,"" Pratt stammered when asked about all the attention he's receiving within the industry. ""I came to Hollywood expecting to do everything but not really knowing what that looked like,"" he told CNN. ""So I was just as excited when I got my first commercial as I am now, you know what I mean? I have enjoyed this entire journey, the whole time I have been at this for 15 years. My enthusiasm has been turned up to 10 since about 2001 when I didn't have to be a waiter anymore."" The tables have certainly turned since Pratt was waiting tables. His early credits came via television shows including ""Everwood"" and ""The O.C."" His career got a big boost in 2009 when he was cast on the NBC sitcom ""Parks and Recreation,"" playing the daft but likeable Andy Dwyer. His movie roles were initially confined to supporting parts such as in 2009's ""Jennifer's Body,"" 2011's ""What's Your Number"" (starring his wife, actress Anna Faris) and 2012's ""The Five-Year Engagement."" If starring roles eluded him, it may have been that he didn't have a classic leading man's physique. According to Entertainment Weekly, the 6' 2"" actor's weight in the past five years has fluctuated between 220 and 295 pounds. EW dubbed him ""portly."" Pratt told the magazine he initially turned down the opportunity to audition for the Quill part in ""Guardians."" ""I was probably scared and thought I was too fat to play a superhero,"" he said. ""Guardians'"" director James Gunn apparently agreed. ""When (casting director) Sarah Finn first brought him up to me, I said, 'The chubby guy from ""Parks and Rec""? Are you kidding me?' "" Gunn said. ""There was like no way."" But Pratt had already demonstrated he could lose weight and firm up for a role -- to play a professional baseball player in ""Moneyball"" (2011) and a Navy SEAL in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012). And Gunn was won over by Pratt's audition. ""He came in and within 20 seconds, I knew this was our guy,"" Gunn said. ""I just knew it in my gut."" With the role his, Pratt set about reshaping his body. According to press notes compiled by the studio, Pratt ""collaborated with, and was closely monitored by, a team of trainers and nutritionists, training for four hours a day, sticking to a strict diet, taking the right supplements and vitamins, all of which he continued throughout the five-month shoot."" The results are plain to see on screen: Pratt bares his washboard abs in ""Guardians"" (although it must be said he's not the most muscular guy in the film; that honor would have to fall to former pro wrestler Dave Bautista, who plays the Hulk-like ""Drax""). Of course it takes more than a hot bod to land on Hollywood's A-list. On screen, Pratt displays a rare ability to relate to audiences and an appealing naturalness that sets him apart from other actors. He's also been hitting all the right notes with fans lately, from french braiding an intern for ""Entertainment Tonight's"" hair during an interview to sharing the deeply personal story of how his son's premature birth in 2012 affected his faith. And despite his emerging star status, he comes across as both self-assured and modest in assessing what he brought to the role and what he needed to learn. ""The comedy is something I can do,"" Prattt observed. ""I have been honing in on that skill in 'Parks and Rec' for seven seasons. I have always prided myself in being a comedic person -- it comes kind of easily to me. ... But it would be like the suspense and the adventure stuff, like the big movie one liners, that to me -- I had a hard time wrapping my head around that. That was a challenge for me."" Pratt's stock in Hollywood looks like it will continue to rise. He is filming ""Jurassic World,"" expected to be a blockbuster next summer. A sequel to ""The Lego Movie"" appears likely (he provided the voice of the lead character, Emmet Brickowski) and Marvel has already ordered a sequel to ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" For now, Pratt appears to be keeping his newfound success in perspective. ""This is just another nice exciting chapter... for me,"" he said. ""It's exciting and I'm definitely enjoying the ride so far.""","Chris Pratt is being touted as the ""next big thing""

"(CNN) -- It didn't seem like Taylor Swift could get any bigger. She's got massive success in the music industry, millions of devoted fans and a permanent place in pop culture history, the latter thanks to an incident that the world will never, ever allow Kanye West to forget. But clearly, that wasn't enough for the (literally) towering singer. In one week, she became the second-biggest selling act of 2014 and the only solo platinum-selling artist of the year -- all with the debut of her new album, ""1989."" She pulled her music off Spotify, the most popular streaming site in the world, and managed to get pulled into a political controversy thanks to a remark during the U.S. Senate race in Iowa. You just couldn't get away from her. Morning shows? There was Swift performing on ""Good Morning America."" Prime time? Look, it's Swift on ""The Voice."" Online? Between her tweets, ""1989""-related photos and a countdown clock, she was ubiquitous. For all we know, she's even boosted the sales of tap shorts. ""Taylor Swift is basically the biggest musician in the world this week, and that means she's in the rare position of being able to do whatever she wants,"" wrote Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge. It's the next step in the evolution of the singer who launched her career in country music at the age of 16. Now 24, she has weathered critics who have kept a tally of some of her alleged celebrity sins: Her music wasn't country enough, her wide-eyed ""Gosh, I really won"" awards acceptance speeches weren't genuine, and her relationships were mostly fodder for publicity and potential song material. Taylor Swift's '1989' has biggest sales week since 2002 . So what does Swift do? She releases her first fully pop album, designates ""Shake It Off"" -- an ode to her haters -- as the first single and declares herself happily single. ""I really like my life right now,"" Swift recently told Rolling Stone. ""I have friends around me all the time. I've started painting more. I've been working out a lot. I've started to really take pride in being strong. I love the album I made. I love that I moved to New York. So in terms of being happy, I've never been closer to that."" It would seem Swift has long been on the path to world domination. Big Kenny of the country duo ""Big and Rich"" said the singer displayed that she had what it took even as a teen at the annual Country Radio Seminar held in Nashville. ""She just had a charge in her that was twice her age really,"" he said of the then-15-year-old. ""From the get-go."" Singer-songwriter Frankie Ballard toured with her and said Swift isn't one of those stars who mails it in. ""She was plugged in. She was there every day,"" he said of his tour mate. ""She was the captain of the ship."" Protected by 'Swifties' Swift gets that if this were high school, she would be the annoying straight-A student who is gorgeous, is friends with the other cool kids (Swift is BFFs with the likes of actress Selena Gomez and singer Lorde), volunteers after school and dates the cutest boys. But she's running for homecoming queen and is courting your vote -- hard. Not that she doesn't already have plenty of admirers. Her fans, known as ""Swifties,"" are equal parts adoring and protective of her. Come for Taylor Swift on Twitter, and you are sure to encounter her army. They are paying her back in part for being one of the most accessible music artists in the business. She does meet-and-greets, surprises them at their bridal showers, stalks their timelines and Instagram feeds, and even made them part of her newest project. Before the world ever heard a note from ""1989,"" Swift handpicked fans who had really, really wanted to meet her and invited them to her homes around the world for a listening party. They got hours to hang with their idol, taking Polaroids and delving into the new album. The fans were allowed to share their experiences and asked only to keep details about the new songs under wraps. 5 reasons you love Taylor Swift ... even if you don't want to . Swift told NPR that not only did they honor her request, but her fans stood guard when the album was leaked online two days before its October 27 release date. ""Anytime they'd see an illegal post of it, they'd comment, 'Why are you doing this? Why don't you respect the value of art?' "" Swift said. "" 'Don't do this. We don't believe in this. This is illegal. This isn't fair. This isn't right.' And it was wild seeing that happen."" She needs that support in face of New Yorkers disliking the fact that she's been named Global Welcome Ambassador for Tourism of the Big Apple. The choice of the Reading, Pennsylvania, native to represent New York has been less than popular, despite her move to Tribeca and her new single ""Welcome to New York."" ""I'm incensed! It's insulting,"" Twisted Sister frontman and Queens, New York, native Dee Snider told the New York Daily News. ""She doesn't have any life experience here or connection to the town."" Taylor Swift: Dating is last thing on my mind . Center of controversy . It's not just New York. Swift also became part of the debate in Iowa during the waning days of the 2014 campaign. Tom Harkin, the state's retiring U.S. senator, entangled Swift in a bit of political negativity when he invoked her name while discussing Republican Joni Ernst, who was vying for his seat. ""Well, I (got to) thinking about that. I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift or as nice as Mr. Rogers, but if she votes like Michele Bachmann, she's wrong for the state of Iowa,"" Harkin said. He later apologized and said, ""I shouldn't have said those things,"" but Ernst made some hay from the comment and won election. Swift has also ended up as part of the debate about Internet music streaming. On November 3, she pulled her catalog from Spotify, leaving its 40 million users bereft of her five albums. Spotify quickly courted her return with a playlist filled with songs like ""Taylor"" by Jack Johnson and ""You're Amazing"" by Epic Connection. ""We hope she'll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone,"" Spotify said in a statement. ""We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want."" Swift told Yahoo Music that the decision was her own. ""I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment,"" she said. ""And I'm not wiling to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music."" Never underestimate Taylor Swift. Right now, she's standing very tall. Why Taylor Swift is everything to the music industry .","Taylor Swift is music's biggest star right now .
She can do no wrong with her fans .
Swift is using her power and changing the industry ."
"(CNN) -- Believe it or not, there are a fair number of people in the ""top 1%"" who think that the existing distribution of wealth and opportunity is grotesque. They believe that an American's place in this distribution is too dependent on irrelevant factors (race, creed, color, etc.) and relevant ones (educational attainment, intelligence); that inequality is bad not only because poverty sucks and the wealthy can do more but also because it is corrupting fairness in politics, education, health, national service and employment. They think it degrades social relationships, weakens national solidarity and drives the United States down international league tables in important areas. And these ""rich egalitarians"" believe that government can and should do far more to reduce inequality and mitigate its effects. John Sutter: The most unequal place in America . Rich egalitarians are often accused of weakness by the left for not voluntarily giving up more of their treasure, judged irrational by the right for not giving up their idealism (in the interest of self-interest), and suspected of self-righteous hypocrisy by people who doubt that they sincerely want to reduce an inequality whose fruits they seem to enjoy very much. Despite these attacks, for the last 20 years, it's been pretty easy for rich egalitarians to live by following this simple playbook: . • In politics, vote for progressive Democrats, support progressive policies yet still sleep easy (though with some guilt) in the knowledge that even when Democrats are in power no policy truly hostile to the economic interests of the rich can pass (e.g. the Buffett Rule or some other mechanism to tax capital gains sensibly and the ""carried interest"" earned by investment managers); gnash teeth when the Republicans are in power; generally ignore state and local politics. • In philanthropy, give significant money and time to organizations working domestically with disadvantaged people or providing public goods available to everyone. • In personal matters, eschew ostentation and the cloistered world of private planes and country clubs; live a normal upper middle-class life, in a liberal city, of parks, subways and economy-class travel (but private school for the children). • In business, remain committed to the core public/private division of labor where private markets, technology and business provide innovation, efficiency and effectiveness while the government redistributes otherwise excessive outcomes (through taxation and income support), mitigates ill effects (through regulation) and provides ""public"" goods such as education, parks, public transportation and health care as well as the core functions of the ""watchman"" state (contract enforcement, rule of law, national security). Opinion: Mobility, not income inequality, is the problem . But across the board, rich egalitarians are being tested. In politics, the emergence of the populist left poses a dilemma. Although they share some common policy ground, egalitarians believe in fairness (everyone doing what they reasonably can and should) while populists believe in taking (from those fat cats). And remarkably, some populists seem to believe that we live in a neo-agrarian economy where the poor are poor because the rich are rich, whereas egalitarians see broader structural causes. And rich egalitarians, while acknowledging that part of the policy remedy will require the rich become considerably poorer, also think it will require a long-term commitment to investments in education, health care, infrastructure and the other public goods. CNNMoney: World's 85 richest own as much as the poorest 50% . So in New York, where rich egalitarians were originally heartened by new Mayor Bill de Blasio's early focus on inequality, they now worry, given the tone of the inauguration, that he may prove to be a populist in egalitarian clothing who asks the wealthy, rightly, to do their fair share (higher taxes to expand affordable housing and pre-K) without asking others to do the same (reforming arcane work rules and unsustainable benefits for public sector unions, etc.). And it is easy to imagine something similar at the federal level if tax rates on the wealthy were increased without any of the structural changes -- increasing the total tax base, investing in public goods, curbing the growth in entitlements -- required to create a more egalitarian, yet fiscally sustainable, society. Of course even rich egalitarians can't fully embrace a populist movement whose defining narrative tars the wealthy as villains, but should they nevertheless support the populists because of the short-term policy overlap, or abandon them on principle? In philanthropy, charities clamor more than ever for support while pundits tell the wealthy to discard ""band-aid charity"" to focus on ""solving"" problems through various types of ""impact"" investing (where they might also make a buck). But if charity is out and problem solving is in, shouldn't ""merely wealthy"" egalitarians cede that terrain to Gates, Buffett and other Giving Pledge billionaires with the individual resources to make a difference? In personal life, the ""normal"" option -- just fine in the past -- continues to be hollowed out to make room for an ever-expanding set of gold and platinum tiers that are becoming the norm not only in credit cards and air travel but everywhere ($315/hour Disney VIP Tours anyone?). Worse yet, the bar rises each year with respect to what wealthy children see as ""normal"" given the increasingly perverse lengths to which many parents will go in the attempt to lock in high socioeconomic status by turning their children's lives into grueling, yet luxurious, 17-year, all-expenses paid, Ivy League applications. Does the commitment of rich egalitarians to a ""normal"" life require explicit acts of self-sacrifice and restraint on a daily basis? And in business, the debacles of the last decade -- gun control, insider trading, the financial crisis, Blackwater, etc. -- force rich egalitarians to question whether their commitment to markets/technology/business has become anachronistic in an era where business seems incapable of self-regulation while relentlessly absorbing hitherto public goods and defeating even sensible efforts at regulation. (And in the absence of campaign finance reform, rich nonegalitarians are now free to use their de facto control of corporate assets to fight against redistribution on the personal side as well.) But since rich egalitarians can't abandon the commitment to the market (rich egalitarians are not socialists), should they pin their hopes on nascent forms of ""social enterprise"" that are far from proving they can deliver the goods? How will rich egalitarians respond to these challenges? A few will ride the tide to become self-loathing populists. Others will give up their egalitarianism and retreat to bucolic suburbs where they're less likely to have awkward run-ins with old friends or feel picked on by the mayor. But I hope most discover that their convictions prove up to the challenge; that they'll explore new avenues of impact investing in addition to, not in lieu of, charity; that they'll continue to live in the city, ride the subway and fly coach; and that they'll engage with the populists despite their differences, showing them that the rich aren't so bad, arguing strenuously for sustainable fairness, not opportunistic taking, paying newly higher taxes without complaint and serving as a fifth column within the ranks of the wealthy to help the city and nation take at least baby steps in the direction that they've always claimed it should go. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John MacIntosh.","John MacIntosh: Rich egalitarians are being tested as never before .
He says those 1 percenters who oppose inequality don't share views of populists .
MacIntosh: Poor aren't poor because the rich are rich; there are structural causes .
He says wealthy should pay more in taxes but as part of a plan to invest in society's future ."
"(CNN) -- The 20th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations were announced Wednesday morning, and as one of the leading awards show salvos in what is expected to be a competitive season, what didn't get nominated was as notable as what did. Robert Redford was left out. So was anybody from ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" ""Captain Phillips"" missed out on a best ensemble nomination, and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" came up completely empty. A number of films did get good news. Awards Season 2014 . ""12 Years a Slave"" was nominated for four awards -- best ensemble, best male actor (Chewitel Ejiofor), best supporting male actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting female actor (Lupita Nyong'o). Though ""12 Years"" has narrowly missed topping year-end best-of lists so far -- and has even been left out entirely on some -- it's been considered an Academy Award shoo-in since its release in October, and the SAGs do nothing to stall its momentum. On the other hand, ""August: Osage County,"" the sprawling comedy-drama based on the Tracy Letts play, has been generally ignored on critics' best-of lists. (""Good but not great"" is the consensus so far. ) But it also did well at the SAG nominations, earning three nods, for ensemble, lead female actor Meryl Streep and supporting female actor Julia Roberts. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" also did well, earning nominations for ensemble, lead actor Matthew McConaughey and supporting actor Jared Leto. ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" and ""American Hustle"" complete the list of nominees for best ensemble, the SAG Awards' closest equivalent to best picture. ""The Butler"" also earned nods for stars Forest Whitaker (best actor) and Oprah Winfrey (female supporting actor). Jennifer Lawrence added to ""Hustle's"" haul with a female supporting actor nomination. And ""Captain Phillips,"" though snubbed in the ensemble category, picked up nominations for star Tom Hanks and a surprise nod for supporting actor Barkhad Abdi. ""Phillips"" is the film debut for Abdi, a Somali immigrant who plays a ship hijacker. But there are a number of Oscar favorites that couldn't get into the ring. ""Her,"" the Spike Jonze work about a man who develops a relationship with a computer operating system, was completely shut out. So was ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" the new Martin Scorsese film, despite excellent early buzz. Keep up to date on who has won what with our Awards tracker . Redford, whose one-man show in ""All Is Lost"" has made him a favorite for best actor, was left off SAG's list. So were Oscar Isaac (from the Coen brothers' latest, ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" which came up completely empty), Michael B. Jordan (""Fruitvale Station"") and ""American Hustle's"" Amy Adams and Christian Bale. The most unlikely nominees were focused in the supporting actor category. Besides Abdi, Daniel Bruhl picked up a nomination for Ron Howard's mostly overlooked ""Rush,"" and the late James Gandolfini was honored for his work in the comedy ""Enough Said."" Though the actors' wing represents the biggest bloc of Oscar voters, the SAG Awards aren't always a great bellwether of best picture success at the Academy Awards. Though ""Argo,"" last year's best picture, also won the SAG Awards' ensemble honor, the 18th annual SAGs went with ""The Help"" over ""The Artist"" and the 16th annual awards tapped ""Inglorious Basterds"" over ""The Hurt Locker."" The picks for actor and actress, on the other hand, are much closer to the academy's selections. Last year's SAGs went to Daniel Day-Lewis and Lawrence; the year before honored Jean Dujardin (though Viola Davis lost the Oscar to Streep); and 2010 SAGs went to Colin Firth and Natalie Portman. Does it mean anything? Thursday may muddy the waters further, when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announces the Golden Globe nominations.

"(CNN) -- I learned a new word today: Heterarchy. I came across it buried in this year's Davos theme. Apparently it means multiple structures, overlapping, interacting, connecting and networking. Good grief, am I really climbing a Swiss mountain to learn about an arcane corner of the English dictionary? The theme is set each year by the World Economic Forum. It is invariably a wordy bit of pretentious nonsense, designed to sum up what they hope we will focus upon in our meetings in the Swiss Alps. This year its headline is ""The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business."" Often the theme is overtaken by crises, pressing issues and economic fires, and everyone long forgets all about it before the first marshmallows have melted into the first hot chocolates. But suddenly I realized I was tapping this out on an iPad, with a Bluetooth keyboard, while flying at 30,000 feet, and using the airliner's Wi-Fi to read a blog post by an influential 19-year-old from some eastern emerging market. Hang on, I thought, this year's theme may have a little more staying power. In a further break from tradition, it may also actually make sense (assuming one can boil it down to useable English!). What this theme recognizes is that during five years of crises massive changes have taken place simultaneously: The ubiquitous Internet has forged its way into previously closed societies; social media has exploded; there has been a revolution in communication; new, powerful economies have emerged; and there has been a fundamental shift in economic power towards the east. In an incredibly short space of time, all the accepted truths that have guided us pretty much since the end of World War II have gone up in smoke. As well as trumpeting that the immediate crisis is over, this year's Davos will posit that we now need to think about what's next -- and how we will manage it. WEFers are being asked to debate how society should make decisions in the future in this new world. I think the WEF has a point. This is not just about smartphones, blogging and Facebook. It's about different ways of doing almost everything. The economic, social and cultural wreckage from the crises of the past five years is everywhere; in its wake is a landscape where old rules no longer exist and the new ones have yet to be written and agreed. Economically, central bankers own the world. Societally, a ""lost generation"" threatens cohesion. Culturally, the issue of privacy has leaped to the top of the agenda -- from NSA-style data snooping by governments, to private companies like Facebook, Google (including its intriguing purchase of Nest) and Yahoo thinking it is ok to treat my information as their own -- and to sell it on. Davos works best in two very clear situations: When there is a full-scale raging fire, and the big economic players come together and thrash it out (the Middle East, the Great Recession, and the eurozone crises spring to mind); or when serious tectonic shifts are going on in economies and societies. Often the WEF's grandiosity forces the issue beyond breaking point. But I don't think this will happen this time round. The issues are prescient, they are on everyone's mind, we all know that 'times are different' and we are by no means sure how to handle them. The question is whether the people coming to Davos can set their own little agendas aside for a few days, sit down, and really think about the kind of world we are facing now that the long overdue recovery is taking hold. They must then question the role of government, social media, traditional media, and business in all of this. If they can do this then our trip up the Swiss mountain will have been worth it. Of course this will require CEOs, government ministers and the grandees of Davos to actually practice what they preach and truly behave heterarchically. Perhaps WEF should provide a dictionary for all delegates in case anyone is in any doubt. READ MORE: .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't exactly the Miracle on Ice but the U.S. pulled off a minor upset when it controversially beat Russia 3-2 in a nail-biting penalty shootout that highlighted Day Eight at the Sochi Winter Olympics. Thirty-four years ago Herb Brook's men stunned the mighty Soviet Union in Lake Placid, New York to take gold in the ice hockey competition, one of the biggest shocks in a team event in Olympic history. Saturday's group game marked the first time the U.S. contested an Olympic hockey game in Russia since that memorable occasion and none other than Russian President Vladimir Putin was in the stands to witness proceedings in his hockey-mad nation. Russians and other Eastern Europeans have long since made their mark in the NHL and the Cold War is over but it was a match neither team wanted to lose. T.J. Oshie emerged as the hero for the U.S., outshining Russian captain Pavel Datsyuk -- who plies his trade for the Detroit Red Wings in the NHL. Oshie scored all four of the U.S.'s goals in the shootout that went to a whopping eight rounds. Blog: Superpower showdown had everything . ""My hands are a little tingling, my feet are tingling,"" Oshie told reporters. ""It was pretty nerve-racking out there. We knew it would take 65 minutes and then some (to win)."" But the referees were in the spotlight, too, disallowing what would have been the winning goal for Russia with less than five minutes remaining in the third period after the net was knocked out of place. Although Russia realistically isn't in danger of failing to advance to the quarterfinals, it slipped behind the 2-0 U.S. in Group A. Datsyuk opened the scoring midway in the second period, only for Cam Fowler to equalize late in the period. The U.S. reclaimed the advantage when Joe Pavelski netted past Sergei Bobrovski but Russia tied proceedings through Datsyuk's second past Jonathan Quick midway in the third. Then, Fedor Tyutin thought he handed Russia a famous victory, though the referees didn't allow his effort. ""I don't know what happened there, but definitely it was a goal,"" Russian superstar Alexander Ovechkin told reporters. ""Nobody touched the net. Their goalie touched the net and put it out."" Quick, however, said he didn't know the net was loose. Bobrovski saved a breakaway to force the shootout, where Oshie registered the winner after Ilya Kovalchuk missed in the shootout. ""I did (feel pressure) a little bit, but then the puck hits your stick and you start skating,"" said Oshie. ""It's just you and the goalie. I was fortunate enough to keep (Bobrovski) guessing and Quickie did his great job."" Still no joy for U.S. in speed skating . The Netherlands won a medal in the men's 1,500-meter speed skating event. The U.S. didn't. In short, nothing new, then. The gold medalist was a surprise, though, in the form of Zbigniew Brodka -- who became Poland's first speed skating Olympic champion. The part-time fireman edged Dutchman Koen Verweij by three-thousandths of a second in a race so tight that initially Verweij was listed as the winner. ""When I saw I had won, it was an unbelievable feeling,"" Brodka said. Verweij was far from euphoric as he tallied the Netherlands' 13th medal in speed skating -- tying a Games record -- in Sochi. ""I should be happy winning silver but this feels like a huge loss,"" he said. ""At the moment it feels like all my hard work and my consistent races were for nothing. After such a season you know you can do it, and I felt pretty good."" American Shani Davis, who slumped in the 1,000 meters as the two-time defending champion, placed a distant 11th even after the U.S. team changed its Under Armour skin suits that were thought to be a contributing factor to its woes. It reverted to a previous version of the suits. Poland landed another gold Saturday, with Kamil Stoch completing a personal double by adding the large hill title to his crown in the normal hill event. Stoch became the third man to pull off the sweep at the same Olympics. More Austrian success in super-G . Austria won its third straight gold in the women's super-g at the Olympics when Anna Fenninger upset the pre-race favorites on a tricky course. Fenninger, last year's Sportswoman of the Year in Austria, finished in one minute, 25.52 seconds to emulate the feats of Andrea Fischbacher in Vancouver four years ago and Michaela Dorfmeister in Turin in 2006. Current overall leader Maria Hoefl-Riesch claimed silver -- adding to her gold in the super combined -- and Austria's Nicole Hosp took the bronze. Hoefl-Riesch and Hosp were well behind Fenninger, more than half-a-second adrift. Almost half of the starters didn't complete the run. ""I've had races where I went through the finish line and I knew this was it -- 'This was a winner.' But this was not one of them,"" the 24-year-old Fenninger told reporters. ""I only realized what had happened when I stood on the top of the podium,"" she added. ""My feeling is indescribable. I just hope the realization will sink in the way I imagined it so I can properly enjoy myself by this evening."" Russian golds . Elsewhere on Day Eight, adopted Russian Viktor Ahn -- he formerly represented South Korea under the name Ahn Hyun-soo -- bagged the home country's first ever gold medal in short track speed skating in the 1,000 meters and Alexander Tretiakov added to the host's haul of gold by bettering the field in the men's skeleton.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the Arab Spring and the global financial crisis, focus has been on the world's new and so-called ""disrupted society."" But I would avoid using such a negative phrase for Jordan; which is where I live and which has avoided the severity of the uprisings in other Middle Eastern countries. While some might point to a ""disrupted society,"" I call our world an ""enriched and awakened society."" It is a society of potential, innovation, and opportunity. Youth dominate the globe -- the 3.5 billion people under the age of 30 make up half of the world's population. Therefore, we have an impact on our own lives today, and we are the decision makers of our lives tomorrow. So how do we react to such opportunities, and what do we do with such potential that resides within us? Do we add water and sunlight so it can sprout, or do we suppress it with darkness and ignorance? It is said that Arab youth have faced tough challenges since the Arab Spring. But this is not unusual. Youth all around the world have faced unemployment, high tuition fees, and tough economic situations for years. It is these challenges that allow for innovation and creativity to be born. This is when and where we unleash our potential. Jordan's youth are not completely satisfied with the performance of the public sector, nor are they satisfied with their ability to participate in the decision making process. These frustrations, coupled with difficult economic times, have created an unstable environment and resulted in the launch of initiatives to engage youth as active citizens in political, economic, and social decision-making. But unemployment in Jordan and the Middle East did not take us by surprise during the Arab Spring. High unemployment was present in the Middle East, and in almost every country around the world, for many years before the uprising. The impact, however, has been far more painful as the world faltered under the economic downturn. The domino effect of the economic crisis hit the developed countries first, and then reached the developing nations of the Middle East. When it hit Jordan it was, by coincidence, around the same time of the Arab Spring. Therefore, it is important to note that the Arab Spring wasn't a mere result of unemployment, nor was it a complete call for democracy and freedom. The Arab Spring was simply a call for change: change in ideologies, change in direction, change in hope. Unemployment is a major issue in the Middle East and North Africa region, especially in Jordan. The official rate is 11%, and unofficial estimates are about twice that figure. Generous employment opportunities in the public sector have eased the pressure, but the debt crisis facing the government has been hindering its ability to help. Policy makers are now pressed to come up with solutions to empower the private sector and improve the education system. Many of the world's young are uncertain of their future and their ability to find meaningful employment. Jordan's young have some of the region's most sought-after talents, due to their high quality of education and hard-working attitudes. Regretfully, their productivity is not contributing to Jordan's economy, as they cannot find competitive salaries or similar opportunities. Therefore, many look for jobs abroad, particularly in the Gulf region. Yet, there is still hope for Jordanians. The entrepreneurship scene is expanding, and more of the country's young are establishing companies. I believe the young can rise and flourish -- especially in today's tough climate -- by thinking about their ""sphere of influence."" We should collaborate with individuals from our region by crossing borders, creating partnerships, and exploring ideas. Travel between Middle Eastern counties can be challenging due to visa requirements, but the virtual world eliminates such boundaries. Technological advances unite us in ways we should be united. And we must remember that divided we are as fragile as separate fingers, but united we are a strong fist. Three years ago, the Arab Spring signified hope. Now, Jordanian youth have witnessed the negative transformations in neighboring countries such as Egypt and Syria. Jordanian youth are smart and will not allow their country to head towards that same path. But the need for security and stability must be accompanied by reform and growth. I do not believe the Arab Spring caused a ""disrupted society."" Rather, the Arab Spring has created an opportunity that allows things ""out of the norm"" to occur. Such an Arab Spring encourages innovation and creativity; it allows for thoughts and ideas to sprout that were once dormant. Therefore, I advise my fellow Arab to prepare, strategize, and implement with utmost passion, wisdom, and honesty. READ MORE: . Opinion: Should we be depressed about the 'Arab Spring'?

"(CNN) -- As the World Economic Forum drew to a close, at the far end of the chic Promenade running through Davos and well away from the conference center, police had closed off a small section of the road. Gathered within the cordon was a group of around 20 protesters, some in costumes and face paint, waving flags and dancing. A 20-something in a long coat attempted to whip up some enthusiasm with a megaphone shouting ""We are the 99%,"" and ""Occupy!"" while a middle aged man strummed a guitar. Italian rock music played through an amplifier that another protestor had wheeled into the road. On the periphery of the group stood a wiry man in a woolly hat, with the rainbow flag of peace wrapped around his waist. Alec Gagneux was handing out flyers and speaking softly to interested passers-by. Of all the criticisms leveled at Davos, its elite nature is the biggest gripe. Like other such pow-wows of the powerful, the lack of access to this minute sphere of massive influence has in past years stirred up visible dissent around the venue itself. At the height of the Occupy movement in 2012, protesters even camped in igloos near the heavily fortified conference center. Davos this year was oddly quiet though. Like the bitter cold that can often grip this mountain resort in January, protests were noticeable by their relative absence. There was a small group from Ukraine attempting to draw attention to their predicament on Friday, but little to really catch the eyes of the delegates safely cocooned behind the venue's ring of security. Gagneux's disparate group had been gathered via the internet, but while they had made it to Davos they were still a long way from the action. ""This is the only thing that was possible,"" Gagneux said. ""It is absolutely taboo to go further towards the center where the people ...are meeting from the World Economic Forum."" I asked him why he and his fellow protestors were here. Just like the delegates at the other end of the street, growth and inequality were on his mind too. ""The 2015 goal is to halve extreme poverty,"" he told me, ""but we don't talk about (the fact) that we have to halve extreme riches as well."" Gagneux's primary concern was for the long term impact of growth. The flyers he handed out quoted the economist Kenneth Boulding: ""Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist."" ""The planet is limited,"" Gagneux told me. ""In 30 years or in 70 years we have four times more cars, pollution, resources that are exploited, and future generations' family will have nothing."" He had been at Davos the entire week, and had been coming to the town for the past 12 years. ""This evening I will make another gathering,"" he told me. He planned to make what he called a ""thought stone"" representing WEF organizer Klaus Schwab. ""Mr Schwab (is) a very important person in Davos, but actually we are all the same, including the animals and the plants,"" he said. Why had Gagneux left his protest until the end of the week, and not staged it while the Forum was in full swing, I asked. ""Most of the people still have to work during the weekdays, so Saturday is the easiest way for people (who are not from) Davos to come here."" The global economy may be getting back on track, but even protesters need to pay the bills. READ MORE: . How does your salary compare globally? Quest: Why Davos must change to matter .

"(CNN) -- After more than 40 years of having his claims of an unjust murder conviction go unanswered, Louisiana inmate Herman Wallace is now a free man. But it may be a Pyrrhic victory. Wallace, who spent decades in solitary confinement, is terminally ill with liver cancer. He was released after a judge vacated his murder conviction and sentence, one of his attorneys told CNN. State officials had been threatened with contempt if they did not release Wallace immediately. Wallace, 71, is one of the ""Angola 3"" -- three inmates who claim they tried to point out injustices at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola during the late 1960s and 1970s. Wallace's sisters, nieces and nephews wanted him moved to hospice care in New Orleans, said one of his attorneys. ""He has claimed there was an unfair trial for 41 years and finally we have that ruling,"" attorney Nick Trenticosta told CNN on Tuesday night. ""For him to pass on from this world with friends and family at his side is extremely important."" The release came hours after U.S. District Chief Judge Brian A. Jackson in Baton Rouge said that women were systematically excluded from the grand jury that indicted Wallace in the 1972 slaying of a guard at Louisiana State Penitentiary. Jackson declined to address Wallace's other claims, including an allegation that the state knowingly used false testimony and withheld exculpatory evidence at trial. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore's office subsequently filed an appeal with the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and asked that Wallace not be immediately released. But, in a strongly worded order, Jackson later Tuesday repeated his demand that Wallace be freed immediately, saying the state has failed to show Wallace would be a flight risk or public danger if released. He threatened them with a contempt judgment. The judge ruled that prosecutors have 30 days to notify Wallace whether they intend to seek a new indictment in the case. Wallace's legal team lauded the release of their client. ""Tonight, Herman Wallace has left the walls of Louisiana prisons and will be able to receive the medical care that his advanced liver cancer requires,"" they said in a statement. ""It took the order of a federal judge to address the clear constitutional violations present in Mr. Wallace's 1974 trial and grant him relief. The state of Louisiana has had many opportunities to address this injustice and has repeatedly and utterly failed to do so."" Prison a ""cauldron of brutality"" Louisiana State Penitentiary is known as Angola after the land that it is on. The land used to be a plantation that the owners named after the home country of many of the slaves who worked there. The land was eventually bought by the prison system. There is a museum for the prison, which became known as the ""bloodiest prison in the South"" because of the number of inmate assaults. Official histories of Angola mention the abuses it was known for, but considers them a thing of the past. However, as recently as this year, two death row inmates at Angola testified in court about being subjected to ""indescribable"" heat where they were held. The testimony was part of a lawsuit against the prison alleging that authorities placed inmates with pre-existing medical conditions at risk, the New Orleans Times Picayune reported. Citing the case of the ""Angola 3,"" several U.S. congressmen filed a complaint, alleging that inmates are kept in solitary confinement for unreasonable stretches of time. Wallace was in solitary confinement at Angola until 2009, when he was moved to Hunt Correctional Center. He remained in solitary until his diagnosis, according to Trenticosta. Trenticosta said Wallace and another inmate at the Angola prison tried ""to stop the guard brutality as much as the inmate brutality."" Inmates often were in control of the Angola prison and young men were taken in as sexual slaves by fellow inmates, Trenticosta added. ""It was a cauldron of brutality."" Albert Woodfox and Wallace were convicted in the 1972 killing of Angola guard Brent Miller; a third inmate, Robert King, also known as Robert K. Wilkerson, also protested prison conditions. Together, they were known as the ""Angola 3."" Woodfox and Wallace claimed they were targeted because of their activism as Black Panthers. Wallace, who was serving an armed robbery sentence at the time of Miller's death, and Woodfox ""were threatening the status quo,"" Trenticosta said. King was transferred to Angola just weeks after the guard was killed. Even so, he was investigated as a possible ""conspirator"" and put into solitary confinement alongside Wallace and Woodfox, according to the documentary ""In the Land of the Free."" He was never convicted in connection with Miller's death. King was convicted in 1973 of killing a fellow inmate. His conviction was overturned in 2001, and he was freed. Diagnosed with cancer this summer . Wallace proclaimed his innocence in Miller's death in appeals. ""Mr. Wallace has fought his unconstitutional conviction for decades and is supported by four alibi witnesses who place him in another part of the prison when the tragic murder occurred,"" his lawyers said Tuesday. According to his lawyers, Wallace -- after losing between 40 and 50 pounds -- was found this summer to have terminal liver cancer. Chemotherapy treatment has not been effective and was suspended, according to Trenticosta, one of the attorneys for Wallace and Woodfox. He said the cancer should have been treated much earlier. Wallace and Woodfox, who remains in prison with appeals pending in his case, ""endured very restrictive conditions, including periods of 23-hour cell confinement,"" according to Amnesty International USA. ""Tragically, this step toward justice has come as Herman is dying from cancer with only days or hours left to live. No ruling can erase the cruel, inhuman and degrading prison conditions he endured for more than 41 years,"" Amnesty said. The human rights organization said it knows of only one other person in the United States who has been held for longer under such conditions. The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, asked authorities not to appeal the ruling that freed Wallace. ""We hope that they will see reason instead, and allow Herman Wallace the chance to spend his final days outside of the confinement he has endured for more than 40 years,"" the group said in a statement. Trenticosta said he last saw Wallace a few weeks ago. ""There is no anger with Mr. Wallace,"" the lawyer said. ""He is the strongest person I have had the great opportunity to represent. He is about positive thinking."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Inmate is released, according to attorney .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The message the brother and sister read aloud is one addressed to a missing father: 9-year-old Najwa and 8-year-old Tirad reciting the words in unison, ""Our mother's starting to worry about you."" Their mom, Ensaf Haidar, is indeed worried, but she's also pained. She knows how much her children yearn to see their dad, but she just doesn't know what to tell them. How can she begin to explain that their dad has languished in a Saudi prison for almost a year? How can she expose her kids to a brutal reality she feels they're not ready to face? ""They're always asking me, 'When is Dad coming home?' "" Haidar said. ""Telling me, 'Mom, I miss Dad so much.' "" Haidar struggles with the dilemma every day. ""It often feels like the world is against me,"" she said. ""When I see how the children are deprived of their father, this is what bothers me the most."" Her three children, including 5-year-old Myriam, think their father's just delayed by work. But Raif Badawi, 30, has been imprisoned since being arrested in June. He is accused of, among other things, breaking Sharia law and starting a website that infringed on religious values. According to Haidar, her husband just wanted to encourage discussion about religion in his homeland. But starting a liberal Internet forum in conservative Saudi Arabia can be a dangerous pursuit. ""No one wanted to take his case,"" said Waleed Abualkhair, Badawi's attorney. ""Because they believed that anyone who'd take this kind of case, that means he destroys his (own) reputation. But I don't believe in that. I believe that everyone has his right to have a lawyer. And I believe that Raif is innocent."" Abualkhair is more than just Badawi's attorney. He's also his brother-in-law and a fellow human-rights activist also on trial in Saudi Arabia. Talking over Skype because he's been banned from traveling outside Saudi Arabia, Abualkhair describes how he's been accused of ""speaking to the foreign media with the intention of harming the country's reputation."" He said any activist who calls for reform there is in danger of being arrested. Rights groups agree, accusing Saudi authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans. Many were outraged when two of the country's most prominent reform advocates, Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid, were recently sentenced to 10 years in prison apiece. Amnesty International called that trial ""just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom's human-rights activists."" ""Here's the thing,"" Abualkhair said. ""The government of Saudi Arabia, they want to show themselves outside Saudi Arabia that they are modern, that they are open-minded, that they want to change, they want to reform, that the problem is coming from the society, and that the society moves slowly. They keep saying that for the foreign media. ""But actually inside, when we act with our society, when we want to reform, when we want to do something with our society, they keep punishing us."" CNN has made several attempts to reach Saudi Arabia's Justice and Interior ministries for comment but received no response. Asked in January about accusations that Saudi Arabia is cracking down on dissent, Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, told CNN, ""At the Interior Ministry, our area of responsibility is security."" He added, ""My understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now. Nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts."" Badawi's legal troubles started shortly after he started the Free Saudi Liberals website in 2008. He was detained for one day and questioned about the site. Some clerics even branded him an unbeliever and apostate. According to Haidar, she and Badawi began receiving death threats. Fearing for their and their children's lives, they planned to move the family out of Saudi Arabia in 2009. That was before they discovered Badawi had been placed under a travel ban and that his business interests had been frozen, depriving them of a source of income. In July, Human Rights Watch released a statement urging Saudi authorities to free Badawi. ""Saudi authorities should drop charges and release the editor of the Free Saudi Liberals website for violating his right to freedom of expression on matters of religion and religious figures,"" a statement from the group said. Today, Haidar lives in Lebanon with the kids. She feels safer, but life's become a lot lonelier. Estranged from her family, Haidar said it would be impossible to take her children back to Saudi Arabia. The stigma is too strong there. ""You feel like everybody's accusing you,"" she said, close to tears. ""Like everybody's against you, at war with you."" According to Abualkhair, the Saudi Arabian government has little tolerance for activists who speak out. ""They didn't punish just (Badawi),"" Abualkhair said, describing how Badawi and those closest to him have effectively been ostracized. ""They punish his family. Actually, they punish their future."" Abualkhair said that even if Badawi is eventually released from prison, his future has been ruined. ""They destroyed his image in our society (by saying) that he's against our Islam,"" Abualkhair said. Abualkhair said Badawi fears he'll be kept in prison indefinitely. ""What he's afraid of,"" he said, ""is that they just want to keep him in prison without judgment for a long time, like what's happened now. Ten months without any judgment. They just moved his case from a court to another court to keep him in jail for a long time."" Haidar misses her husband more with each passing day, but she said all she can do is wait. Her children's questions become ever more pressing as she grows more desperate. ""At the end of the day, you find there's nobody to give you hope,"" she said. ""Everybody is silent about the case. Nothing is moving forward.""","Rights groups say Saudi authorities are targeting activists through the courts, travel bans .

"(CNN) -- If you ask a class of aspiring managers in a business school for the purpose of the corporation, you get a remarkably rapid response. The purpose of the corporation, they will tell you, is to maximize shareholder value. But like any simple answer, it is not only wrong, it is also profoundly damaging. To paraphrase Jack Welch, the legendary ex-CEO of GE, the idea that purpose of the corporation is to maximize shareholder value is ""the dumbest idea in the world."" Corporations with a strict focus on maximizing shareholder value tend to employ a cadre of generalist managers who have relatively short-term commitment to the firm. Because their compensation and future prospects are directly tied to share price, executives spend much of their time courting financial analysts. CEOs will often go to any lengths to keep this relatively small audience happy. This means announcing all manner of initiatives which will boost the share price -- including mergers and acquisitions, restructuring, and downsizing. Usually these initiatives look good on paper, and therefore deliver a rapid boost to the company's share price. However, actually delivering the value these initiatives promise is much more tricky. The result is that up to 80% of these initiatives fail to deliver on their promises. Meanwhile, the executives who started them years earlier have banked their bonus, sold their share options and moved on, often to start similar restructuring initiatives at another company. The people left behind -- such as longer term shareholders and employees -- are left to pick up the pieces. Many large corporations are remarkably resilient. The people working for them are often able to get over failed initiative and get back to delivering the results which matter. But this resilience can be rapidly eroded if the company -- driven by a relentless search for shareholder value -- goes through rounds of appointing heroic new CEOs who implement promising initiatives, create temporary share price boosts, then deliver disappointing or disastrous long-term results. When this happens repeatedly, a corporation can easily go into a death spiral. Employees become bitter and cynical. The best leave, while the worst stick around. The quality of products and services suffer, and customers become dissatisfied. The company diverts resources from innovation into providing immediate returns to shareholders. This can mean the company gets quickly overtaken by competitors. Over time, analysts begin to sniff the creeping signs of corporate decline and begin making more sell recommendations than buy ones. The result is that the share price begins to decline. Ever more change and turnaround efforts seem to add fuel to the fire. Eventually the firm goes out of business, or is taken over. There are many groups who lose from this process. Employees lose jobs, customers lose loved products and services, suppliers lose value customers, governments lose tax revenues and investors lose the value of their investment portfolio. One group who gains from this are the senior executives who keep moving between companies to get away from impending disasters and increase their pay packet. The other group are many professionals who skim the transaction costs off the multiple restructuring efforts, change initiatives and other activities designed to increase shareholder value. Pulling companies out of these death spirals is notoriously difficult, and senior executives' responses can make matters worse. They usually launch flashy initiatives designed to appeal to the markets, which ultimately fail to deliver value in the long term. But one of the biggest steps which we can take to avoid the fate of companies like the banks or Blackberry is to drop the myopic focus on maximizing shareholder value. Instead, it is vital we recognize corporations have multiple goals -- such as creating fulfilling jobs, building up industry, satisfying consumers and delivering returns to shareholders. The task of senior business leaders should be about balancing these multiple goals. To ensure corporations drop their shareholder value myopia, there are some immediate practical steps that can be taken. Corporate boards might include a range of representatives which goes beyond just shareholders. They might include employee, customer and community representatives. Corporations should report not just their financial performance to shareholders, but also how they perform along other important metrics such as customer satisfaction, social and environmental benefits. Executives should be measured and incentivized on a number of different dimensions -- only one of which would be shareholder value. The corporation itself needs to take active steps to repudiate a broad culture where share price is the only thing which matters. Questions such as how this impacts on customers, suppliers, communities and employees all need to be equally valid topics of discussion in the new corporation. The most damaging practices designed to boost shareholder value in the short term, such as share buyback schemes, could be banned. These measures are likely to create an environment where plans are rigorously tested against different criteria before they are hastily rolled out. READ MORE: . CNN's complete coverage from Davos .

"(CNN) -- That sport has become a big business is a well-worn cliche. It also widely acknowledged that commercialism in sport is relatively recent phenomenon. Fifty years ago the majority of sports were organized on amateur lines, and even in professional sports the sums of money at stake were negligible. Commercial sport has become one of the most visible manifestations of globalization, with broadcasting and sponsorships turning clubs and players into vehicles for generating cash -- some consider them more brands than athletes. So how is all this working out -- for the sports organizations, the players, and the fans? And in this time of crisis, what can this microcosm of capitalism teach the economics of the real world? Textbook economics teaches that woes of capitalism can be identified with two problems: The failure to achieve truly competitive markets and the manifest unreasonableness of the initial distribution of income. Markets fail to be competitive because of various manifestations of monopoly power, often associated with superior access to relevant information, whereas efforts to improve the perceived fairness of the income distribution often conflict with the objective of improving economic efficiency. Sports capitalism has some unique characteristics. First, monopoly will not work -- teams and athletes need sporting competitors. Second, those competitors need to be genuine, in the sense that there is some degree of balance -- a predictable contest has limited entertainment value. There are essentially two approaches to organizing competition: The American model and the European model. The American model works like this. A collection of businessmen agree to found a league, each operating a franchise which is responsible for managing a team, securing a stadium and selling tickets. The league, meaning owners operating as a committee, manage several important issues centrally. Typically, the broadcast rights are sold collectively, and often the merchandising rights too, with the money to be equally shared between the teams. Visiting teams may be given a share of the gate. The league negotiates centrally with a players' union, fixing both minimum and maximum salaries. No club is allowed to spend too much more than anyone else, and the weakest teams are typically rewarded with the first choice of new players entering the league (the draft). In essence, the league is run as a kind of socialist collective by the franchise owners. And this model has been colossally successful in generating profits over the last 50 years. In 2012 a study by WR Hambrecht estimated the market value of the four major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL) at $67 billion. Collectivism seems to work. The leagues argue that their success can be attributed to the rules which maintain balance among the teams. Skeptics argue that the economic success derives from artificial scarcity (entry into the majors is closely restricted) and monopoly power (these are the best leagues in the world in their sports -- the potential for new entrants to become rivals is negligible). Sports in Europe is dominated by soccer, which operates under a completely different business model. From an economic perspective there is free entry, in the sense that anyone can start a team and enter at the lowest league level, and then work their way to the top purely on sporting merit. This is because each league in a given country is connected to every other league through the promotion and relegation system. This specifies that at the end of the season the worst performing teams (in sporting teams) and sent down to play in the next league down (relegation), whose best teams replace them (promotion). This fluidity promotes a kind of cutthroat competition, where collective agreements are very limited. The threat of relegation means that the strong are not willing to share with the weak. Perhaps surprisingly, the European model is one of pure capitalist competition, red in tooth and claw. Profitability is very low. According to a study published by UEFA, the European governing body of soccer, in 2012, out of 700 clubs operating in the top divisions in European countries, 63% reported an operating loss, 55% reported a net loss, 38% reported negative net equity and auditors raised ""going concern"" doubts in 16% of cases. European leagues are also highly unequal in sporting terms, with a handful of clubs dominating competition at both national and European level. Many believe that the system is not stable, and UEFA has recently introduced regulations in order to achieve a less economically competitive environment. However, as a system European football has been remarkably stable, with few clubs being liquidated, and a succession of ""sugar daddies"" being willing to step in and finance loss making clubs because of the prestige that this brings. In both systems the players have done extremely well. In the U.S. the unions have secured guaranteed percentages of league revenues, while in Europe open competition has ensured that wages have been bid up. Top players earns tens of millions in salaries and even more from endorsements. Almost every school age child nowadays yearns to be a top athlete. Many people feel it unfair that nurses or firemen earn small salaries compared to sports stars, but their pay simply reflects scarcity. The best are able to perform athletically in ways that no else can, in order to win championships on which fans place enormous value. And do the fans do well? It sometimes seems that the default mode of the fan is discontent, with a jealous eye constantly turned to past in which life was simpler and tickets were cheaper. There are constant scandals concerning the abuse of drugs, violence on and off the field, match fixing and gambling, exploitation of fans through ever increasing ticket prices. But the fact is that the universe of fans has expanded dramatically over the last fifty years, attendances have grown to unprecedented levels and broadcasting has ensured that any sporting event can be viewed anywhere in the world. In this sense at least, modern professional sport, whether along the social-democratic lines adopted in the U.S., or the bare-knuckle laissez version practised in Europe, must be considered one of the most successful manifestations of modern capitalism.

"(CNN) -- Evangeline Lilly is in three of the highest-profile movies of the last few years: the last two ""Hobbit"" movies (the final one out this week), and next year's Marvel extravaganza ""Ant-Man."" Despite all this, Lilly's heart is really in writing. The actress, who first gained fame on the hit show ""Lost,"" recently spoke with CNN about ""The Hobbit"" and her current career and plans. CNN: You're now nearing the end of your journey on ""The Hobbit"""" with ""The Battle of Five Armies."" What attracted you to the role of Tauriel? Lilly: 'The Hobbit' was one of my favorite books as a kid. I was extremely honored to be representing Tolkien on the screen, and working with Peter Jackson. Working on that project is what inspired me to start writing [her children's book] ""The Squickerwonkers"" and get it published. It really got me moving and inspired me to set off and do something with my writing. CNN: Tauriel is an original character created for the movie. What was it like tackling that? Lilly: Tauriel was half as daunting as a character from the book. [With] Tauriel, there was no preconceived idea of who she should be. There was a lot of freedom to really play with it, and be open to my own interpretation of her. The scariest part was accepting the role in the first place -- I had to agree to play a character who would be very likely hated by most of the fans. Once I decided (that) I didn't have to live up to anyone's expectation of her, not knowing who she was. CNN: Since she is not in the book, we don't know what will become of her. Lilly: We left her in a situation where she had betrayed her king, and we weren't sure where her heart was at. We start to realize where her alliances are, and who she cares about. Is it the dwarf or Legolas? And she does more ass-kicking, which she does best. But there's a lot more emotional material for Tauriel in this film, which is good to see. We get to know her better. CNN: What made you decide to make the leap to writing? Lilly: When I finished shooting ""The Hobbit,"" I took two years off to be an author. A lot of that time was spent trying to help publish a limited edition run of 1,000 books for San Diego Comic-Con. Then Titan swept in and said they would publish in 2014. When I started to work on ""Ant-Man,"" it was a return to being an actor for a little while. I was curious to see how it was -- and if there was a part of me that missed it. Ultimately, my reaction was, ""God, I can't wait to get back to full-time writing."" There's nothing as pleasurable to me as writing. It was great affirmation that I was making the right choice and going in the right direction. CNN: So you see yourself doing less and less acting? Lilly: Acting has always been something that happened, but never something I dreamed about and pursued. I was fortunate to have such a wonderful job fall into my lap. If this wasn't the right fit -- an amazing job that most people would covet -- I thought that writing would be that. I think I was right. CNN: You just wrapped ""Ant-Man."" What was that experience like? Lilly: I've been astounded to discover how good to their teams and crew that Marvel are. They're so collaborative, so smart with their stories. They have rich, dynamic characters which are so much fun to play. I expected I'd be a cog in the wheel of a big machine -- I wasn't sure I'd like this experience. But I've been so astounded at how pleasurable the whole experience has been. CNN: Who is your character, Hope Van Dyne? Lilly: She is the daughter of the founders of The Avengers, Ant-Man and the Wasp. She is a very talented, intelligent, capable woman and a force to be reckoned with. This one is very much a heist film. It has all the fun, tension and drama of a good heist film. The heist is being masterminded by myself, my father and Scott Lang.","'Lost' star Evangeline Lilly has found big screen fame with 'The Hobbit'

"(CNN) -- Business leaders, heads of government, entrepreneurs and even the odd celebrity will be rubbing fur and down-quilted shoulders at Europe's highest altitude town, Davos, for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting this week. The high-powered talk-fest, founded by German economist Klaus Schwab in 1971, has become a vital part of the business calendar -- for the intensity of its networking as much as declarations of action from the speakers' podiums. WEF describes itself as ""an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas."" As is traditional, the theme of its annual meeting in Davos is sweeping and, at first glance, somewhat opaque: ""The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, politics and Business."" The WEF says the theme ""reflects on the disruptions that societies face on a global scale driven by rapid technological and scientific innovation, accelerating social change and a shifting global economic order."" According to CNN's Richard Quest, the WEF may have a point with its choice of theme. The world has changed, Quest says, after its emergence from the wreckage of five years of crisis. In its wake, there is ""a landscape where old rules no longer exist and the new ones have yet to be written and agreed."" ""The issues are prescient, they are on everyone's mind, we all know that 'times are different' and we are by no means sure how to handle them,"" Quest says. But he ponders whether those at Davos will be able to unite to plot a way forward in this new landscape. If it's a question of numbers, they've certainly got a head start. The 44th annual meeting is bringing together more than 2,500 leaders, thinkers and public figures representing more than 100 countries. It is strictly invitation only. Certain groups -- heads of state, faith leaders, academics, social entrepreneurs, members of international organizations and news anchors -- can attend free of charge, but for businesses, the cost of a ticket is approximately $20,000. For that fee, from January 22 to 25 participants will be able to attend more than 250 sessions and workshops based around the overarching ""reshaping"" theme. Guest speakers range from the European Commission President Manuel Barroso, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki Moon and Microsoft founder Bill Gates to actors Matt Damon and Goldie Hawn. The forum is taking place against a backdrop of violent conflict in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Syria. Syrian opposition leader George Sabra will be at the Davos gathering, with a second round of peace talks being held in another corner of Switzerland -- on the shores of Lake Geneva -- the same week. Bloodshed in the Middle East and North Africa has disrupted the region's economies, with the World Bank's latest report saying they remained depressed after the Arab Spring that began in Tunisia three years ago and sparked Syria's civil war. ""Political turmoil in Egypt, stalemate in Tunisia and an escalation of the civil war in Syria with spillovers to neighboring Lebanon and Jordan have weakened activity in the developing oil-importing countries,"" the report said. In Iran, there has also been a fall in production but the World Bank points to international sanctions as the reason. However, that may change after last year's historic deal between world powers on an interim deal with Iran that imposes limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani -- who replaced the country's controversial previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, last year -- will be at Davos and is due to speak on the subject of ""Iran in the World."" Also walking the WEF corridors will be Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described Rouhani as ""a wolf in sheep's clothing."" He is scheduled to speak on ""Israel's Economic and Political Outlook."" President Shimon Peres will speak on ""Celebrating the 'Spirit of Davos'"" -- which will perhaps explain why the traditional enemies are going to the same talk-fest party. Participants will have some reason to celebrate, as the global economy has shown signs of improvement since last year's meeting. China, often the focus for economic hope, has pushed through bold policies under its new leadership. The country's 300-plus political elite have reportedly agreed to curb government meddling in the economy and make state-owned enterprises compete with the private sector on a level playing field. Davos sessions include one on China's outlook and another on how China, Europe and the U.S. can compete and collaborate. Meanwhile, in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's bold measures to jump-start his country's economy -- dubbed ""Abenomics"" -- has had an impact, with an initial jump in growth before the economy weakened. He is a speaker at the forum, under the topic ""The Reshaping of the World: Vision from Japan."" Europe, whose ailing economic health has dominated discussions at the last two year's events, appears to be off its sickbed. Last year the eurozone returned to growth for the first time since 2011 but the difference for ordinary citizens may be negligible, and austerity measures are still in place. Youth unemployment in Spain and Greece is above 50%, while rates in Portugal, Italy and Ireland are all above 30%. As for the United States, much of 2013's focus was on the debt ceiling and October's government shut-down. Government dysfunction passed the economy as Americans' top concern in Gallup's polling late last year. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will attend Davos and deliver remarks on ""the United States' commitment to and engagement in the Middle East region,"" according to the State Department. Kerry has been working to achieve a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians but recently the U.S. has faced diplomatic hurdles closer to home. A top concern of America's traditional allies may well be the U.S. National Security Agency's surveillance program, details of which were revealed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden last year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, allegedly among those targeted, is a frequent Davos attendee but will not be present this year. This is not, a spokesman said, because of her skiing accident -- she fractured her pelvis on recent visit to Switzerland -- but because the event coincides with a government meeting. While those attending Davos may not be focusing on their winter sports activities, it is on the side-lines of the main program that some of them may go ""off-piste."" The raclette, gluhwein and hot chocolate chats could be the ones where deals are brokered. Read more: All you need to know to be a Davos delegate .

"(CNN) -- Actress Goldie Hawn says world leaders are discovering how ""mindfulness"" helps with stress -- but that she despairs at seeing young stars like Justin Bieber struggling to deal with fame. Hawn spoke to CNN at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she had led a session on the power of neuroscience and mindfulness to ""change the world."" Hawn, star of films including ""Private Benjamin,"" ""The First Wives Club"" and ""The Cactus Flower"" -- for which she won an Academy Award -- is also the founder of The Hawn Foundation. Hawn said when she started her foundation 12 years ago, mindfulness had been a ""what is that"" concept, but she was optimistic that was changing. ""It's extraordinary that this Davos this year seems to be centered a lot around the brain, a lot around stress reduction, mindfulness, all of these areas,"" she said. ""They're all coming out of the closet now, it's like they've all been meditating -- so many of them -- for 20 years and so forth. So it's beginning to happen -- mindful leadership."" Hawn explained how she believed a healthy mind could lead to healthy decision making. ""When the brain is silent, the executive function, which is this part of the brain that makes decisions can work much better. So when you get quiet you make better decisions, you're also more rested -- you're not as reactive,"" she said. ""So it's actually great for the economy, great for our leadership and our thought leaders."" When asked about Justin Bieber, the Canadian pop star facing allegations of driving under the influence and drag racing, Hawn said his situation was ""heartbreaking."" The Oscar-winning actress, who was accompanied by a Tibetan monk at Davos to speak to business leaders about meditation, recalled the challenges of her own early success. ""It was very stressful. I was away from home. It happened overnight for me and I really became anxious around it,"" she said. ""I sought help because I wanted to find out why I wasn't as happy as I should have been, or excited, but I didn't understand why people were asking me for my autograph."" But Hawn said she hadn't been attracted to drugs and her situation in the sixties had been different from that faced by the current generation of young celebrities. ""It actually breaks my heart because I know what's going on,"" she said. ""Now they're self-medicating and this is the most dangerous thing for them. ""Talent, sweetness, ability to manage -- what good they could be doing, how happy they could be feeling. And as a mother -- and a grandmother now -- all I want to do is hold them.""","Goldie Hawn is in Davos to talk about the importance of neuroscience and mindfulness .

"(CNN) -- It was a golden moment in a depressingly bleak week. Ukraine's female biathletes provided a temporary and joyful distraction from the ongoing troubles at home with a gold medal performance in the women's team biathlon relay on Friday at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The team led from start to finish in the 4x6 km race, taking gold in a time of one hour 10 minutes 2.5 seconds, 26.4 seconds ahead of defending champions Russia with Norway a further 11.2 seconds behind in third. Vita Semerenko, a bronze medalist in the women's 7.5 km sprint earlier in the Games, led Ukraine's women off before handing over to Juliya Dzhyma for the second leg. Valj Semerenko's twin sister Valj lost some time at the shooting range on the third leg but not enough to deny Ukraine their first Olympic biathlon gold as anchorwoman Olena Pidhrushna fell into the arms of her teammates at the finish line. ""Before the race people wrote us many messages and wishes, waiting for victory,"" Pidhrushna said after clinching her country's first Winter Games gold in 20 years. ""Until the very last moment, even this morning I read my emails, saying like 'Girls, start and win for us all, for Ukraine.' We are so happy that the people of Ukraine are happy back home and that something good happened for our country."" Pidhrushna, who called for a minute's silence at the press conference following the event, was asked about her husband, Alexie Kayda who is a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament. ""He talked to me and he said he didn't know how to support me and improve my mood. Before a race, he tells me that he loves me and that he believes in me,"" she said. ""I can only thank for him for trying to protect me from everything that is happening at home. We only know the minimum of what is happening there and that is a good thing."" Former pole vault world record-holder Sergei Bubka, who now heads Ukraine's Olympic Committee, couldn't contain his delight. ""Ukraine wins gooooold!"" he tweeted before praising Pidhrushna and co. for their efforts for winning Ukraine's first biathlon gold. Bubka, who won gold at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, told CNN's Amanda Davies that he was praying for a good result after violence had erupted in Ukraine's capital Kiev causing scores of deaths. ""We need this. We need this and we pray for that,"" Bubka said Thursday. ""We discuss with them to give them confidence and eliminate pressure from sport and situation at home. ""We tell them we love them and believe in them. 'Do what you do every time. It's your time and it's your day. We need this.' ""We want to show to everyone that Ukraine exists and is united through sport and Olympics."" Canada breaks U.S. ice hockey hearts again . Canada piled on the agony for U.S. ice hockey fans with a 1-0 victory in the men's semifinal match at the Bolshoy Ice Dome on Friday. Exactly 24 hours after breaking the hearts of the U.S. women's team, Canada's men inflicted more misery on the Americans who, for the second successive Olympics, come off second best to their neighbors. The solitary goal came at the start of the second period -- Jamie Benn of the Dallas Stars scoring in the 22nd minute to set up a final meeting with Sweden -- who earlier maintained an unbeaten run in the competition with a 2-1 over Finland. Read more: 24 hours of pain for U.S. ice hockey fans . The Swedes, who have won all their games so far in the tournament, had to come from behind after Finland's Olli Jokinen opened the scoring in the 27th minute. But they weren't ahead for long as Loui Eriksson scored five minutes later before Erik Karlsson scored the winner in the 36th minute. The U.S. will play the Finns in the bronze medal match on Saturday. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper took the opportunity to remind President Barack Obama of the result and the bet the pair had made following a meeting in Mexico earlier in the week. Shiffrin skis into record books . U.S. teenager Mikaela Shiffrin became the youngest skier to win the Olympic slalom title, following up her 2013 world championship victory in the same discipline. The 18-year-old raced into the record books with a combined time of one minute 44.54 seconds to finish 0.53 seconds ahead of Marlies Schild of Austria. Kathrin Zettel, also of Austria, finished third. ""It is tough to describe my feelings,"" Shiffrin said. ""This has been a dream of mine for a very long time."" Colarado-born Shiffrin showed her class under the floodlights at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. A composed first run saw her finish 0.49 seconds ahead of Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch, with Tina Maze -- seeking her third gold of the Games -- 0.67 seconds trailing in third at the halfway point. But while the Slovenian slid down the standings to eighth and Hoefl-Riesch to slipped to fourth, Shiffrin held her nerve after nearly falling on the icy surface in the second run before skiing home to take gold. ""It was a crazy moment. I was going very fast and I thought I was not going to make it, it scared me,"" Shiffrin said. Ski cross 1-2 for Canada . France's men may have swept the board in the men's event on Thursday, but it was Canada's women who were the big winners in the women's ski cross finals in the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park Friday. Marielle Thompson took the gold with Kelsey Serwa claiming silver, and Sweden's Anna Holmlund winning the bronze medal. ""It's crazy. I don't think it's even sunk in yet. I just had a big wave of emotion. I'm so so happy, especially to be up there with my teammate,"" Thompson said. ""We're all about girl power from the start. We're just having fun all day. I know Kelsey and we tried to help each other all the way down the course."" Russian short track double . Russia claimed two of the three gold medals up for grabs in the Iceberg Skating Palace on Friday. Victor An sent the home crowd wild as he claimed gold in the 500 meters final, narrowly beating 19-year-old Dajing Wu from China with Charle Cournoyer taking the bronze for Canada. Korea picked up gold and bronze in the women's 1,000m final as Seung-Hi Park became the only female to win two short-track golds in Sochi, taking her overall Olympic medal tally to five. Park's compatriot Suk Hee Shim won the bronze with 20-year-old Kexin Fan from China taking silver. Park said she and Shim hadn't discussed tactics prior to the final. ""We didn't have any special plan since every situation is different. We just try to use teamwork and do well together. Fortunately we were able to do really well. We have been practicing the whole season together and it paid off,"" Park said. In the final short track event of these Games, Russia roused an expectant crowd with an Olympic record in the men's 5,000m relay winning time of six minutes 42.100 seconds as An claimed a sixth career Olympic gold -- a record in his discipline -- while the hosts took their gold medal tally to nine, level with the U.S. and Canada. Canada sweeps to curling double . In the Ice Cube Curling Center, Canada's men matched the gold medal-winning performance of their women 24 hours earlier with an easy 9-3 win over Great Britain in the final. Canadian skip Brad Jacobs said: ""I'm ecstatic, it's awesome, amazing. There are a million other words that can explain it, but that's all I can think of right now."" His opposite number, David Murdoch was understandably more downbeat. ""I'm disappointed,"" Murdoch said. ""It was an opportunity of a lifetime, but it wasn't meant to be today. We did everything we could to try and start well, but we just had a poor start and that gave them a lot of confidence as well. ""Going 5-1 (after three ends) there was always going to be an uphill struggle and it didn't matter what we did in the second half."" Earlier, Sweden's men claimed the bronze medal following a 6-4 extra-end win over China.","Ukraine's women win gold in biathlon relay at the Sochi Olympics .

"(CNN) -- A morbidly obese Saudi Arabian man has lost 330 pounds (150 kilograms) since the Saudi king ordered him hospitalized three months ago, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. In August, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari, who then weighed 1,345 pounds (610 kilograms), to undergo treatment in the capital, Riyadh. Shaari, estimated to be in his late teens, was unable to move by himself and was transferred from Jazan in southern Saudi Arabia. His weight loss followed an intense nutritional and surgical treatment program a team of 21 specialists developed at the King Fahd Medical City, the agency said. ""The patient is responding well to treatment and is continuing to improve, especially the psychological aspect, "" Dr. Aa'ed al-Qahtani, head of the medical team, told the news agency. Shaari's most serious health issues are being managed, including heart and lung problems, diabetes and swelling and lack of mobility in the legs, according to al-Qahtani. Al-Qahtani told the agency that Shaari is scheduled for one more ""surgical phase"" after which, if successful, he could return to normal life.","Saudi king ordered morbidly obese man hospitalized .

"(CNN) -- For centuries, Timbuktu has existed in the Western imagination as a byword for the most exotic, far-flung place conceivable. Situated on the southern edge of the Sahara, it acquired a near-mythical status in distant countries for its fabled inaccessibility, and for the accounts of the dazzling material and intellectual wealth to be found there. Intrigued visitors continue to be drawn by the treasures that survive from the city's medieval golden age as an important academic, religious and mercantile center -- its great earthen mosques, and hundreds of thousands of scholarly manuscripts held in public and private collections. The city, today part of present-day Mali and known as the ""city of 333 saints"" for the Sufi imams, sheiks and scholars buried there, was made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. But there are fears this carefully preserved legacy could be under threat from groups of armed rebels who have overrun the ancient city this month, in the vacuum left by retreating Malian government forces. Irina Bokova, the director general of UNESCO, has called on the groups to respect and protect the city's heritage. ""Timbuktu's outstanding earthen architectural wonders that are the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, must be safeguarded,"" she said. ""Along with the site's 16 cemeteries and mausolea, they are essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali and of our universal heritage."" Timbuktu, which has a population of about 50,000, is held by at least two rival groups who have been involved in a northern uprising against Mali's government, headquartered in the southern capital of Bamako. One is Ansar Dine, a Salafist Islamist group that seeks to impose Sharia law. The other, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), has been fighting for an independent homeland for the nomadic Tuareg people in the country's north, and earlier this month unilaterally proclaimed independence for the region they call Azawad. Read also: Rwanda genocide survivors cycle towards London 2012 . Following the overthrow of Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi, many Tuareg who had been fighting for Gadhafi's forces reportedly returned to northern Mali, bringing their weapons with them. Last month, a Tuareg uprising triggered a military coup against Mali's President Amadou Toumani Toure by officers dissatisfied with the government's efforts to put down the insurrection. But in the disorder following the coup, the rebels seized large areas of the north. Martin van Vliet, a researcher at the African Studies Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, said that while Timbuktu was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance, it stood out as an important prize for the rebels due to its symbolic significance. ""The group that controls Timbuktu controls the symbolic capital of the entire region, because it's that well-known across the world. If you control that city, it will be known."" Historically, Timbuktu's legend began to spread throughout the medieval world when the Emperor of Mali made his pilgrimage to Mecca through Cairo in 1324, and dazzled those he encountered with the gold his party carried. Early in the 16th century, reports of the city on the sand -- then part of the Songhay Empire -- filtered back to Europe through the Moorish diplomat and writer Leo Africanus, adding to the city's near-mythical status as an African El Dorado. Becoming the first European to reach the city subsequently became an obsession for Western explorers, many of whom perished in the desert sands. In 1824, the Geographical Society of Paris even offered a reward for the first European to accomplish the feat. Two years later, however, the person to do so met with disaster. Scottish explorer Gordon Laing survived an attack by Tuareg nomads en route to Timbuktu, only to discover on arrival that its wealth had greatly diminished since its heyday. Laing stayed a month in the city, then was murdered two days after leaving. During its golden age, Timbuktu was a thriving desert trading town at the heart of important trade routes for gold and salt, and a major intellectual and spiritual center, which played a key role in the spread of Islam in Africa. Islamic scholars traveled great distances to study in the city's university, which had 25,000 students during its zenith, and was comprised of three mosques. Read also: Sculpting peace in Mozambique . Constructed from mud bricks and wood in the distinctive Sudano-Sahelian architectural style, the Sankore, Sidi Yahia and Djingarei-ber mosques have been maintained and remain major attractions in the city today. The latter, Timbuktu's oldest, was built in the early 14th century, while the Sankore, during its heyday, was said to have the largest collection of books in Africa since the Library of Alexandria of antiquity. ""Timbuktu in the 14th to the 16th century was an important university city where many manuscripts referring to knowledge of astronomy, economy, religion, mathematics, physics, and medicine were produced,"" said Lazare Eloundou, chief of the Africa unit for UNESCO's World Heritage Center. Comprising the other significant component of Timbuktu's heritage legacy, this immense trove of scholarly manuscripts -- estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands -- remains in the city in state and private collections. For generations, local families have protected the fragile manuscripts, some of which date from the 13th century, from invaders. Fearing that those responsible for the current unrest could loot or destroy the treasures, librarians and curators are making efforts to hide the texts or smuggle them out of the city to safety. While there have been reports that offices of local libraries have been looted by the gunmen, no significant losses of the documents have yet been reported, according to Eloundou. ""We are still concerned by what could happen there in case there is a fight -- we're concerned about the risk of damage,"" said Eloundou. ""We also don't know what the reaction of the Islamist groups will be with regard to the manuscripts."" He said the city's heritage was vastly important to locals -- as a source of cultural pride, but also of income. Even if the city's treasures survived unscathed, they stood to lose out from the uprising as it could plunge the region into isolation once again. In addition, an estimated 200,000 people have been displaced by the uprising in the wider region. ""The fact this part of the country has been taken by the Tuareg rebellion and Islamist groups does not allow any more tourists to visit, and the communities depend a lot on the tourism revenue,"" he said. ""This is really going to affect their lives.""","In medieval times, Timbuktu, in present-day Mali, was an important intellectual center .

"(CNN) -- A nationwide manhunt is on for a man who fatally shot one police officer and critically wounded a second in a shootout in Tupelo, Mississippi. ""Do not confront this person, notify law enforcement,"" urged FBI Special Agent Daniel McMullen, who added that the suspect should be considered armed and dangerous. The incident began two states away from Mississippi, in Georgia, two days before Christmas, when the man attempted -- but failed -- to rob an Atlanta bank, the FBI said. A few hours later and 300 miles west, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the same man robbed a bank. That led to a shootout with police, during which the man fatally shot Tupelo Police Officer Gale Stauffer and wounded another officer, the FBI said Friday. Representatives of dozens of police agencies attended the funeral for Stauffer on Friday, Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre said Saturday in a telephone interview. More than 300 police vehicles participated in a procession in Stauffer's honor. ""Almost the entire city of Tupelo lined the streets for the procession,"" iReporter Lee Anne Grace said Saturday. ""I lost count after 205 police cars, 16 motorcycles."" Grace, a music teacher at an elementary school, said she realized she knew Stauffer only after seeing his picture in a news story. ""Whenever our crossing guard is out, the Tupelo police sent someone to help out,"" she said. ""He was usually the one."" The eight-year veteran leaves a widow and children, ages 2 and 6. ""To my knowledge, we haven't ever had a fatality,"" Aguirre said about his force, which includes 109 officers and two dozen civilian personnel. The wounded officer, Joseph Maher, 27, has been released from the intensive care unit at North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo and moved into a private room, Aguirre said. ""He was able to get up and do some walking yesterday, with assistance."" The FBI, local banks and businesses are offering a combined reward of $200,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the man responsible. The FBI says the suspect is between 5 feet, 8 inches and 6 feet tall, with a slender build. He was wearing a ski mask, a patterned jacket, khaki pants, black gloves and tennis shoes. Authorities say he may have fled in a gray sedan, possibly a late-model Chrysler 200. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI.

"London, England (CNN) -- Filmmaker Keith Scholey has a PhD in zoology and three decades of experience filming and photographing wildlife. Yet when it came to predicting the behavior of the lions and cheetahs of Kenya's Maasai Mara Nature Reserve, all that proved of little use. ""You're constantly surprised,"" he said. ""When you start following wild animals, you're initially an incredible expert. And the more you follow them, you realize you're less and less of an expert."" For his new film ""African Cats,"" Scholey led a film crew documenting the lives of individual lions and cheetahs over the course of two and a half years. ""The only thing we had control over was the selection of the characters -- we had no control over the plot,"" says Scholey. The Disneynature film, which is narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart, debuted in the UK Wednesday, with a royal premiere attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Duke gave a speech calling for an end to wildlife poaching in Africa after the screening. Describing their filming routine, Scholey said each morning, the crew would wake in their camp before dawn, and set out to where they had left the cats the night before. If they managed to find them, the crew would then follow their adventures through the 1510-square-kilometer reserve, one of the few remaining places where the three big African cats -- lions, cheetahs and leopards -- live in large numbers and in close proximity. It led them to unforgettable sights -- all captured in high definition and slow motion -- as the animals engaged in rivalries and constant struggles for sustenance and survival, earning the movie a billing as the ""real-life 'Lion King'."" ""The most remarkable scene was two lions swimming across the flooded Mara River and one being taken by a croc and getting away,"" recalled Scholey. ""We didn't know crocs would go for lions -- and now we know. You can see why lions are really unhappy to go in that river."" As the crew followed their subjects, the animals' individual personalities gradually revealed themselves. ""You don't want to anthropomorphize, yet they do have distinct personalities that come out,"" said Sophie Darlington, the movie's principal photographer. Some were brave, others cowards. Some were leaders, others followers. And some had developed specialist skills -- like the lioness who had mastered a unique technique for suffocating her prey -- that others lacked. As a species, lions also had their own particular character -- dramatic, charismatic, and occasionally unintentionally comic -- which the crew grew to appreciate. ""There's nothing funnier than a lion doing a pratfall,"" said Darlington. Explained specialist photographer Simon King: ""It's their -- sometimes false -- sense of confidence, in everything. They don't think they can put a foot wrong and they frequently do, and it's amusing to watch."" The crew were safe observing the animals -- sometimes at extremely close quarters -- from the sanctuary of their vehicles, although lions and elephants sometimes wandered through their camps at night. On one occasion, a bull elephant, drawn to a fruiting tree, rolled over one of the crew's vehicles that had been parked nearby. Generally though, their presence did not bother the animals, who were used to vehicles entering the reserve. ""Do they care? Some of the time we're undoubtedly an asset, because we're shade on a hot day,"" said King. ""In the past I've had 13 lions under my car. They're very flatulent, and then they try to bite the brake tubes."" The film's producers hope that by engaging audiences in the real-life narratives of the great cats, they can encourage people to protect the species. Cheetahs, the world's fastest land animals, are endangered, while lions are classified as vulnerable. ""It's important not to convey a finger wagging message in every single production because that would be counterproductive,"" said King. ""A movie like this is a celebration of other lives that I hope will get people thinking, so when they next hear that tigers, lions, cheetahs, elephants, rhino are under threat, they do something about it.""","""African Cats"" is a new film documenting the lives of Kenya's lions and cheetahs .

"(CNN) -- A study finds that air pollution from Asia directly affects the storm pattern over the Pacific Ocean. Researchers further speculate that this could be driving freak winter weather in North America. ""The Pacific storm track is a major driving force over global weather patterns,"" says the study's lead author Yuan Wang, a post-doctorate fellow at the NASA U.S. Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""The modulated storm track can be linked to abnormal weather behavior in the mid-latitudes of the Northern hemisphere, including U.S. and Canada."" Results from the decade-long research project were recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Smog central . Reports of high levels of air pollution regularly emerge from the Asia region. In January, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing recorded hazardous levels of particulate matter in the Chinese capital's air, at 18 times the recommended amount by the World Health Organization. Residents were warned to stay indoors. Around the same time, a report by Yale and Columbia sparked debate on whether Indian capital New Delhi had worse pollution than Beijing. Now, Wang and his fellow researchers say pollution in these Asian cities is becoming a global problem. Fossil fuel burning and petrochemical processing in Asia's rapidly developing economies lead to a build-up of aerosols, fine particles suspended in the air. Typically, aerosol formation is thought of as the antithesis to global warming: it cools our Earth's climate. But researchers say, too much of any one thing is never good. ""Aerosols provide seeds for cloud formation. If you provide too many seeds, then you fundamentally change cloud patterns and storm patterns,"" says co-author of the study, Renyi Zhang, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station. From east to west . The study, which looked at simulated climate models using data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), shows that aerosols from Asia are transported to the Pacific region and intensifying the storm track there. Although the results only show the impact specifically on the Pacific Ocean region, researchers theorize that the full effect reaches around the globe. ""We are observing the mid-latitude cyclone system, which transports heat and moisture from low to high latitudes. If this system is changed by air pollution from Asia, then global heat distribution will also be changed. We can expect that weather patterns over other parts of the world can be affected,"" says lead author Wang. Co-author Zhang further agrees that it is ""very possible"" that abnormal weather such as extremely cold winters in the U.S. are driven by Asian pollution. The experts will conduct more research to assess the full global impact of Asian pollution, including creating more climate models, monitoring storm patterns by satellite, and conducting measurements in the atmosphere.","Particles in the air known as aerosols are responsible for cloud formation .
More aerosols blowing in from Asia to the Pacific Ocean means intensifying storm patterns, says new study .

"(CNN) -- This weekend, Morgan Spurlock's ""Inside Man"" gives CNN viewers an inside and in-depth look at the issue of firearms -- as viewed from behind the counter of a gun store. Here are five things to know about the debate: . 1 -- There is no debate about the impact of gun violence. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tallied more than 31,000 firearm deaths in the United States. Each year, some 55,000 violent deaths occur in the country, costing $60 billion in medical care and lost productivity, according to the agency. More than 38,000 people in the country are suicides. But, more than six months after 20 children and six adults were killed in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, legislative efforts to stem the impact of gun violence have failed to gain traction. ""At this point, nothing is different,"" said Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a policy analyst at the Rand Corporation in Washington who has witnessed the power of firearms as a hunter and gun owner and as an emergency room doctor. ""The public's attention has moved on."" 2 -- Much of what we know is outdated. That's because, in 1996, pressure from the National Rifle Association led Congress to cut $2.6 million from the budget of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Injury Prevention that had been devoted to finding out what works. To underscore its point, Congress -- in a move led by Jay Dickey, a former gun-rights advocate and Republican legislator from Arkansas -- added this language to the agency's appropriation: ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" Congress added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the CDC to all agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services after a National Institutes of Health study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed. Today, 17 years after the CDC restrictions were put in place, the NRA maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary. ""What works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others don't have access to firearms,"" the NRA's director of public affairs, Andrew Arulanandam, told CNN early this year. ""Not to carry out more studies."" 3 -- But more studies may be in the cards. The Obama administration has signaled it wants to resume such efforts. This month, the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council laid out priorities for a research agenda to help policymakers better understand the causes and impact of gun violence and how to reduce it. The report says progress can be made in three to five years through research into the characteristics of gun violence, risk and protective factors, prevention and other interventions, gun safety technology, and the influence of video games and other media. The report came after President Obama ordered in January that federal agencies -- including the CDC -- identify the most pressing firearm-related violence research needs and signaled that he wanted to devote $10 million per year to the task. How successful will it be? ""It's too early to tell,"" according to Kellermann. But he worried in a telephone interview that the matter could wind up as a tug of war between CDC and legislators in the House, who are responsible for passing -- or not passing -- appropriations. ""You can see the most highly respected public health institution in the world turn into a rag doll between a determined administration and the equally determined House"" majority, he said. ""I'm just hoping that research will be restarted,"" he said. ""Surely we can agree that having a better understanding of effective strategies to reduce gun violence is a worthwhile goal that everybody ought to be able to agree on."" Off the radar of the gun debate, which has focused on assault weapons bans and background checks, has been the fact that community-level strategies have already been shown to lower gang violence in a number of cities, he said. Rather than racing after every 911 call, it makes sense to break the chain of events -- such as illegal gun trafficking, illegal acquisition and illegal carrying -- that often lead to the next 911 call, he said. Focusing police efforts on the highest-risk people and places works, he said. Between 1997 and 2007, ""Atlanta put that strategy in place and, over a decade, had a 50% reduction in homicides."" 4 -- If you choose to own a gun, do it responsibly. Whatever one thinks about gun control, anyone who opts to own a gun should store it responsibly. Incidents in which a family member is killed or injured by a gun in the home far outnumber the times when a gun is used to injure or kill an intruder in self-defense, Kellermann said. ""What people must understand is that the gun that is kept loaded and readily available for protection is also readily available to a curious child, to a depressed or upset teen, an angry spouse or a depressed grandparent."" 5 -- Reasons for owning a gun have changed. A national survey published in March by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press reported that nearly half (48%) of gun owners say the main reason they own a gun is for protection, up from 26% who gave that answer in 1999. Less than a third (32%) cited hunting as the main reason, down from nearly half (49%) in 1999. The findings make no sense, since violent crime in the country overall has dropped by 48% since 1993, according to Kellermann. Perhaps even more important -- and less understood -- is the evidence that the benefits of keeping a gun for protection are far outweighed by the risks, he said. But those studies are more than 17 years old and out of date, which is why, he said, new research is needed.","Obama is seeking to fund work into how to stop gun violence .
The NRA says such research is not necessary .
For the first time, protection outranks hunting as a reason to own guns ."
"(CNN) -- She was the one caught driving drunk, but in an odd twist of political fate, he's now the one who has just been indicted on felony charges. On the face of it, you might think that Rosemary Lehmberg, district attorney for Travis County in Texas, would be out of her job after being caught driving under the influence, haranguing those who took her in, being convicted and serving 20 days in jail. But it's her bitter political rival Texas Gov. Rick Perry who's now facing serious charges for how he reacted to what she did. Here are four reasons why Perry -- a possible candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination -- is in more trouble than the district attorney caught driving with a 0.239 blood alcohol level, nearly three times the state's legal limit. Walking the line . She failed miserably to walk a straight line in a field sobriety test, but he's accused of crossing a political legal line. Perry joined others calling for Lehmberg to step down after her DWI arrest. But when she refused, he threatened to and then did withhold funding for a program run by Lehmberg -- a powerful Democrat in a heavily Republican state. Watch Lehmberg take the field sobriety test . Some saw his action as strictly political, and an illegal overreach of his powers as governor. He ended up in a police booking room, getting his mug shot and fingerprints taken -- making Rick Perry the first Texas governor in nearly 100 years to face criminal charges. And the two felony counts that charge Perry with abusing his power hit the longest-serving governor in the state's history right at the moment he's switching his presidential ambitions into high gear. Talking the talk . In her drunken state, with a blood alcohol level of 0.239, Lehmberg mouthed off to officers and jailers. Perry let money do the talking. He threatened to use his veto power to cut state funding for a special unit in Lehmberg's control -- the Office of Public Integrity -- if she did not step down after her conviction. Watch Lehmberg in jail . Lehmberg would not budge, so Perry pulled the $3.5 million in annual state funding for the unit, which ironically investigates wrongdoing by public officials across Texas. Perry has the right to veto whatever he likes, but threatening to do so to get something he wanted was illegal, according to Texans for Public Justice, a liberal group that filed the complaint against Perry. Location, location, location . A blueberry in a bowl of tomato soup. That's what Perry calls Travis County, where Democrats like Lehmberg reign. The county, home of the state capital, Austin, is a spot of blue in an overwhelmingly red state. In 2012, Travis County voted for President Obama while the rest of the state overwhelmingly went for Mitt Romney. The members of the grand jury that approved the indictment were selected from that Democratic county, but those involved in the legal case say their decision had nothing to do with politics. CNN spoke to several grand jurors, and they said politics never entered their secret discussions. One did add though that the decision to indict the governor was not unanimous. They said the special prosecutor, Mike McCrum, was fair and demonstrated how the governor violated the law. Read the indictment . The law . Lehmberg pleaded guilty to DWI, served nearly three weeks in jail, went to rehab and then went back to her job as the district attorney, able to ignore the calls for her to step down. The felony charges against Perry are much more serious and would not allow him such latitude were he to be found guilty. He faces one count of abuse of official capacity and one count of coercion of a public servant, with the maximum sentence for both at more than 100 years in prison. Perry calls the charges an ""injustice."" ""The actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right,"" he told reporters at the Travis County Court, where he appeared voluntarily to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken. Indeed, legal analysts, including CNN's Jeffrey Toobin, a former federal prosecutor, question the indictment. ""The governor has the power to veto this money,"" Toobin said. ""So, the question is, how can it be a crime to threaten to use a power that is entirely within the powers of your office?"" Perry is now in his last few months in office after his 14 years in the governor's mansion. Speculation that he's eyeing the White House continues, but he may well have to solve this court case first. 5 reasons Gov. Perry is underrated . Rick Perry takes back tweet .","Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been indicted on accusations he abused his power .
Charges stem from his threat to cut program run by a local DA unless she resigned .

"(CNN) -- No advanced seat selection, no changes or refunds. Sound like Spirit Airlines? Nope. It's Delta Air Lines' new ""Basic Economy"" fare, part of the airline's new five-fare class of pricing starting March 1. No longer content to just offer first-class and coach-cabin seating, Delta is splitting its aircraft into five fare classes. Travelers who want more than ""Basic Economy"" will pay more -- Delta's not saying yet how much more -- although that's already the reality for many travelers. Passengers who are willing to pay to change their flights and check their bags -- so-called ancillary fees -- helped 26 passenger U.S. airlines turn a net profit of $12.7 billion in 2013, up from a profit of $98 million in 2012. Delta topped that list, collecting $1.67 billion last year: $840 million in reservation change/cancellation fees and $833 million in baggage fees. United Airlines came in second place with $1.38 billion in fees: $756 million in reservation cancellation/change fees and nearly $625 million in baggage fees. Delta hopes its new seating options will also be profitable. Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum: The first-class cabin will be split into ""First Class"" for domestic routes and ""Delta One"" for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights. The ""First Class"" fare includes ""first to board"" rights, preflight alcoholic drinks, snacks on flights longer than 250 miles and meals on flights longer than 900 miles. The ""Delta One"" elite first class fare includes access to Delta Sky Clubs, full flat-bed seats on widebody aircraft, in-flight bedding, chef-curated menus, noise-reduction headsets and more. In the main cabin, customers will have choice of the ""Basic Economy"" fare and two other fare classes. The ""Basic Economy"" bare-bones coach fares will be available on domestic routes, and they're already available in some areas where Delta competes with deep discounter Spirit Airlines. The ""Main Cabin"" coach fares on domestic and long-haul international flights will allow seat selection at time of purchase and flexibility for flight changes. On long-haul international flights, the fare will include alcoholic drinks, meal service and a sleep kit. The ""Delta Comfort+"" coach fare on all flights will include priority boarding and dedicated overhead bin space, alcoholic drinks, premium snacks, premium entertainment, up to 4 more inches of legroom and quilted seat covers. Travel enthusiasts are already debating the impact on the flying public. A three-way split in the coach question raises the question: ""Will these new economy fares be lower than previously, because you're getting less?"" asked George Hobica, founder of AirWatchdog.com. ""Or will you get less for the same fare?"" And who will guard that dedicated overhead bin space for ""Delta Comfort+"" travelers, Hobica asks. Already harried flight attendants trying to negotiate passengers in already crowded planes? Aviation journalist Jason Rabinowitz argues that not much will actually change at Delta. ""The most interesting part of the (announcement) was a true definition of the new Basic Economy fare, which aims to directly compete with low-cost carrier Spirit,"" said Rabinowitz, Routehappy.com's data research manager. The routes the new fare is offered on are now clearly defined, but are still fairly limited."" Travel blogger Christina Saull likes the simplified fare benefits chart but is troubled by that basic fare. ""The lowest fare class doesn't allow advanced seat selection?"" Saull asked. ""For some people, that might not be a big deal, but for a frequent flier who studies seat maps to choose the best seat on the plane, that's a deal-breaker for me. That pricing structure seems Spirit-esque.""","Delta's new fare structure will offer five in-flight experiences .

"(CNN) -- Have you noticed that homelessness isn't worse? Here we are, living through the most protracted joblessness crisis since the Great Depression -- and surprisingly, fewer people are living on the street. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the number of the chronically homeless declined by 30% between 2005 and 2007. You might have expected the numbers to spike again when the financial crisis hit but no. Since 2007, the number of chronic homeless has dropped another 19%. A broader measure of the number of homeless counts the number of people living out of doors on one randomly chosen night. That broader measure has also improved through the economic crisis. Between January 2011 and January 2012, homelessness among veterans dropped by 7%. To what or whom do we owe this good news? In very large part, we owe it to the president whose library opened in Dallas last week: George W. Bush. For three decades, we have debated what causes homelessness and how to deal with it. Is homelessness a mental health problem? A substance abuse problem? A problem caused by gentrification and urban redevelopment? Or something else again? The Bush administration substituted a much simpler idea -- an idea that happened to work. Whatever the cause of homelessness, the solution is ... a home. In 2002, Bush appointed a new national homeless policy czar, Philip Mangano. A former music agent imbued with the religious philosophy of St. Francis of Assisi, Mangano was seized by an idea pioneered by New York University psychiatrist Sam Tsemberis: ""housing first."" The ""housing first"" concept urges authorities to concentrate resources on the hardest cases -- to move them into housing immediately -- and only to worry about the other problems of the homeless after they first have a roof over their heads. A 2004 profile in The Atlantic nicely summarized Tsemberis' ideas: ""Offer them (the homeless) the apartment first, he believes, and you don't need to spend years, and service dollars, winning their trust."" Many old school homeless advocates resisted Mangano's approach. They were impelled by two main objections: . 1. They believed that homelessness was just the most extreme form of a problem faced by low-income people generally -- a lack of affordable housing for low-income people. Focusing resources on the nation's hardest cases would (these advocates feared) distract the federal government from the bigger project of subsidizing better housing for millions of people who did not literally live in the streets. 2. By 2002, the nation had been worrying about homelessness for several decades. Countless programs from state and local agencies responded to some separate part of the problem; tens of thousands of people earned their livings in those state and local agencies, disposing of massive budgets. ""Housing first"" threatened to disrupt this vast industry. ""Housing first"" was comparatively cheap, for one thing: a homeless shelter might look squalid, but it cost a great deal to operate -- more, oftentimes, than a proper apartment with kitchen and bath. The transition to ""housing first"" threatened jobs and budgets across the country. There was only one counterargument to these objections: ""Housing first"" worked. It worked from the start, and it worked fast. It worked so well that the Obama administration has now claimed the approach as its own, even keeping Mangano on the job for the first weeks of the new administration. Bush remains one of the more controversial and less popular ex-presidents. But if in the next days you happen to walk down a city street, take a moment to notice how many men or women are sleeping there. Results will vary from place to place, but on average, there are probably fewer than half as many as a decade ago. The job is not completed yet. But for the first time since the 1970s, the abolition of homelessness has become a real and near possibility. Whatever else you think of the 43rd president, that achievement is part of Bush's legacy, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Despite the Great Recession, fewer people are living on the street .
Frum: Why isn't homelessness getting worse? Because of the policies of George W. Bush .
He says under Bush the simple solution of providing a home (""housing first"") worked .

"(CNN) -- A Saudi man has lost more than 700 pounds (320 kilograms) -- more than half his body weight -- since Saudi Arabia's King ordered him hospitalized in August, according to a Saudi magazine that interviewed him at a hospital. In August, King Abdullah ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari, who then weighed 1,345 pounds (610 kilograms), to undergo treatment in the capital, Riyadh. Shaari, estimated to be in his late teens, was unable to move by himself and was transferred from Jazan in southern Saudi Arabia. Dr. Aa'ed al-Qahtani, head of the medical team overseeing Shaari's treatment, told Sayidaty magazine in a recent interview that Shaari's health is continuing to improve at a steady rate. He has improved heart and lung function, reduced inflammation and improved muscle strength, including the ability to move his feet, he said. A massive custom-made wheelchair was built to help Shaari become more mobile and aid his physical therapy, al-Qahtani said. Shaari still cannot move on his own and needs to use a mechanized pulley to sit on the chair. Before being taken out of his house on a forklift, Shaari had not left his bed for three years, the magazine said. In photos published in the magazine, which has launched an obesity awareness campaign, Shaari is shown smiling and holding up a victory sign. Doctors say his spirits have constantly remained high. Dr. Abdeljabbar al-Yamani, the managing director of King Fahd Medical City, has dubbed him ""the smiling man."" His mother has stayed with him since he was admitted.","In August, King Abdullah ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari to be treated in Riyadh, the capital .

"(CNN) -- Myanmar's former Prime Minister Thein Sein has been sworn in as the country's new president, marking the end of the military body that has governed the Asian nation for decades, state-run Myanmar Radio reported Wednesday. Tin Myint Oo and Sai Muak Kham will serve as vice presidents. The president named 30 ministers and 39 deputy ministers to his government, according to state-run radio. In February, Myanmar convened its first parliament in more than two decades in the capital, Naypyidaw. The lawmakers came into office after elections were held in November for the first time in 20 years. The elections drew fire from critics who said the voting was aimed at creating a facade of democracy. The regime refused to allow international monitors to oversee the race and would not allow international journalists to cover the voting from inside the country. Journalists who reported from inside Myanmar had to do so surreptitiously. The military junta also overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way that critics say was aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. Among those who boycotted the elections was opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, which described it as a sham.","In February, Myanmar convened its first parliament in more than two decades .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal has avenged his two recent defeats to Roger Federer with a victory over his rival in a charity match in Madrid, Spain. Wednesday night's clash was the second of two exhibitions aimed at raising money for the pair's foundations, with Federer winning Tuesday's contest in the Swiss city of Zurich. It was the third time in the last month that the world's top-two male tennis players have met and Nadal's first victory in that period, after Federer won in Switzerland and at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, England. Twenty-four hours earlier the two stars joined forces to raise funds for Roger Federer's foundation, and the ""Match for Africa"" raised $2.6 million for the 29-year-old's charity. Is Nadal's battered body his biggest threat? The 23-year-old Nadal thanked his opponent for his participation in the match and was pleased the duo could use their status to raise money for a good cause. ""I say thank you very much to Roger for coming here to Madrid and supporting my foundation today,"" the nine-time grand slam winner told the ATP Tour's official website after winning the match 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-1. Federer and Nadal net $2.6 million in Zurich charity clash . ""Both of us are very happy that we can finally have this event and raise a lot of money for these kids. I know that with what we're going to raise ... it's not going to be decisive but it will be a help. It's going to be important to improve this world a little bit."" The contest, named the ""Joining Forces For the Benefit Of Children"" match, attracted an all-star crowd to the Caja Magica, including Spain's Queen Sofia. Also in attendance was former world number one Carlos Moya, who announced his retirement from tennis in November after a prolonged struggle with a foot problem.","Rafael Nadal beats rival Roger Federer in Madrid in the second of two exhibition matches .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama wished the nation a happy Thanksgiving on Thursday and also used his weekly address to renew his call for bipartisan cooperation on addressing major issues facing the nation. In the remarks usually delivered on a Saturday, Obama said the first family will have the same kind of holiday experienced by millions of Americans -- filled with friends and relatives, good food and football. ""And just as folks have done in every Thanksgiving since the first, we'll spend some time taking stock of what we're thankful for: the God-given bounty of America and the blessings of one another,"" the president said. He called for Americans to think about those less fortunate and saluted the ""countless"" Americans serving their country and communities, from soldiers on guard around the world to volunteers at local soup kitchens and food pantries. On Wednesday, the first family spent an hour handing out Thanksgiving dinner packages to people at Martha's Table, a local aid organization. Such service is ""emblematic of what Americans have always done,"" Obama said in his weekly address. ""We come together and do what's required to make tomorrow better than today,"" he said. ""That's who we are."" That means supporting the nation's soldiers and working together to help spur faster economic recovery from the recession, he said. ""But we won't do it as any one political party,"" he said. ""We've got to do it as one people. And in the coming weeks and months, I hope that we can work together, Democrats and Republicans and independents alike, to make progress on these and other issues."" Noting his scheduled meeting on Tuesday with congressional leaders from both parties, Obama said it was time for ""a real and honest discussion -- because I believe that if we stop talking at one another and start talking with one another, we can get a lot done."" ""For what we are called to do again today isn't about Democrats or Republicans,"" he said. ""It's not about left or right. It's about us. It's about what we know this country is capable of. It's about what we want America to be in this new century.""","The president uses his weekly address to wish Americans a happy Thanksgiving .

"Brasov, Romania (CNN) -- The ruins of Poienari Castle sit high on a mountain peak with a seemingly never-ending vista looking out over deep gorges, charcoal-gray cliffs and mountain streams. It's a natural paradise, but we did not make the trip to this castle just for the awesome view. Visitors come for its connection to history's most famous vampire, Dracula. The famous book and the ensuing movies are fiction, but since Bram Stoker published his novel in 1897, the world has been looking to Transylvania (in modern central Romania) as ""Count Dracula's"" home. And there is a bit of truth to it. Stoker never visited Eastern Europe, but his famous character is based, in part, on a real 15th-century prince. Vlad Dracula lived from 1431 to about 1476 and ruled Wallachia, which was actually south of Transylvania. As military leader, he was a hero to his people, and he has a place in the Romanian National Military Museum. Another museum explains the name ""Dracula"" is actually a title from the knightly order of the dragon, whose mission was to defend Christianity. Documents he signed ""Vlad Dracula"" still exist. A nickname often associated with him is Tepes, which means impaler, and comes from his brutal application of capital punishment by skewering bodies on a wooden spike. Visiting Dracula's castle . Poienari Castle is not on the main tourist route. In fact, it's pretty hard to get there. Public transportation is infrequent, and the big tourist town in the region, Brasov, is hours away. The woman running our hostel found a friend to drive three of us for 40 euros each (about $55 U.S.). Our guide for the excursion was Daniel Ignat, a 20-year-old bar tender and Brasov native. We piled into his tiny red Opel Corsa for the nearly three hour drive. He carefully speed around hairpin curves, over mountain passes and through farmland that looked like time stood still. Farmers drove horses pulling wooden carts, hay stacks were piled (by hand) outside farmhouses and cows occasionally wandered into our path. In places, the roads were so bad that Daniel had to drive on the wrong side of the road to avoid potholes that looked like they might swallow the car. When we arrived at a communist-era hydroelectric plant, we had to abandon the Opel and climb the final distance to Poienari Castle on foot. Rigorous journey . The signs warn it is 1480 concrete steps straight up. I can't imagine an army hoping to take the castle. It's hard enough taking the modern stairs. The castle entrance is guarded by a single keeper who speaks almost no English. The entrance fee is 5 Romanian lei (less than $2 U.S.). Signs in English and Romanian explain Vlad expanded the castle in 1457. Legend has it he captured the residents of an enemy town and forced them to build the castle as punishment. The structure was never huge, but now all that's left is ruined walls about one-story high. As you walk through the citadel, you can get a feel for how Vlad and his garrisons peered out over the valleys below looking for enemies. Despite its rather well-accepted connection to Vlad, the castle is anything but a tourist trap. We only saw two other people on the beautiful fall day we visited. This is not the place to buy Dracula T-shirts. In fact, the only souvenirs we found were the few postcards the castle keeper offered for sale. Dracula a hero? Most Romanians see Vlad as a bit of a hero, not the evil demon of ""Count Dracula"" fame. As he drove us to Poienari, Daniel told us ""He was our leader. ... He does not deserve this reputation."" In the Middle Ages, brutal punishment and executions, including those like Vlad carried out were common. In fact, one museum suggested Vlad is more of a Robin Hood character, ""merciless with the rich ones that were violating the law, but at the same time, a reliable friend of the poor. For the peasants of Wallachia he was the national hero that served their cause."" Dracula's more convenient castle? Despite a rather tenuous connection with the historic Dracula, the place tourists seem to flock to seek out the vampire is Bran Castle. Still intact, sitting on a cliff with towers and sporting secret staircases, it just looks like it should have a spooky vampire inside. And that's what the touts outside are banking on. Before you even get to the gate, venders are lined up hawking T-shirts, ""Vampire Wine"" and Dracula-shaped coffee mugs. Vlad's armies passed through when fighting in the area, but the museum points out there is little evidence he spent time here. The displays inside the castle are primarily devoted to the Romanian royal family, who used it as a residence in the first part of the 20th century, though one room does recount the history of the legend of Dracula, including bios of Stoker and Vlad. This left one young tourist confused. She stopped me, asked whether I spoke English, and asked in all seriousness ""Do you know where Dracula's bedroom is?"" Bran Castle is less than an hour outside of Brasov. It's on a main road, and the public bus is 8 lei (less than $3 U.S.) round trip. Entry is 20 lei (less than $7 U.S.).","Ruins of Poienari Castle can be found in a rugged, isolated area of Romania .

"(CNN)  -- A federal jury Thursday found a 32-year-old Minnesota woman guilty of illegally downloading music from the Internet and fined her $80,000 each -- a total of $1.9 million -- for 24 songs. Illegal downloads of musical files will cost a Minnesota woman $1.9 million, a jury has decided. Jammie Thomas-Rasset's case was the first such copyright infringement case to go to trial in the United States, her attorney said. Attorney Joe Sibley said that his client was shocked at the fine, noting that the price tag on the songs she downloaded was 99 cents. She plans to appeal, he said. Cara Duckworth, a spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America, said the association was ""pleased that the jury agreed with the evidence and found the defendant liable."" ""We appreciate the jury's service and that they take this as seriously as we do,"" she said. Thomas-Rasset downloaded work by artists such as No Doubt, Linkin Park, Gloria Estefan and Sheryl Crow. This was the second trial for Thomas-Rasset. The judge ordered a retrial in 2007 after there was an error in the wording of jury instructions. The fines jumped considerably from the first trial, which granted just $220,000 to the recording companies. Thomas-Rasset is married with four children and works for an Indian tribe in Minnesota.","Federal jury finds Jammie Thomas-Rasset guilty of illegally downloading 24 songs .

"CNN -- Just so you know, Bart Ehrman says he's not the anti-Christ. Bart Ehrman says most of the New Testament is a forgery but it's still an important body of work. He says he's not trying to destroy your faith. He's not trying to bash the Bible. And, though his mother no longer talks to him about religion, Ehrman says some of his best friends are Christian. Ehrman, a best-selling author and a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is a biblical sleuth whose investigations make some people very angry. Like the fictional Robert Langdon character played by actor Tom Hanks in the movie ""Angels & Demons,"" he delves into the past to challenge some of Christianity's central claims. In Ehrman's latest book, ""Jesus, Interrupted,"" he concludes: . Doctrines such as the divinity of Jesus and heaven and hell are not based on anything Jesus or his earlier followers said. At least 19 of the 27 books in the New Testament are forgeries. Believing the Bible is infallible is not a condition for being a Christian. ""Christianity has never been about the Bible being the inerrant word of God,"" Ehrman says. ""Christianity is about the belief in Christ."" Critic: 'There's a touch of arrogance' about him . Ehrman's claims have found an audience, and controversy. He's a fixture on History Channel and Discovery Channel documentaries on Christianity. He's appeared on National Public Radio, CNN and the BBC and talked about scribes misquoting Jesus on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."" Yet Ehrman's popularity also may be due to a larger trend. The books of people like Elaine Pagels, author of ""The Gnostic Gospels,"" and Dan Brown, author of ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons,"" resonate with people who believe there are parts of the Bible that the church left on history's editing floor. Some scholarly critics say Ehrman is saying nothing new. Bishop William H. Willimon, an author and United Methodist Church bishop based in Alabama, says he doesn't like the ""breathless tone"" of Ehrman's work. ""He keeps presenting this stuff as if this is wonderful new knowledge that has been kept from you backward lay people and this is the stuff your preachers don't have the guts to tell, and I have,"" Willimon says. ""There's a touch of arrogance in it."" Yet even many of Ehrman's critics say he has a knack for making arcane New Testament scholarship accessible to the public. ""He has a gift for clear thinking and an ability to present some complicated things in simple, direct ways,"" Willimon says. Some pastors also say that Ehrman forces them to confront tough questions about the Bible in front of their congregations. ""His take on the scriptures is a gift to the church because of his ability to articulate questions and challenges,""  says Rev. Guy Williams, a blogger who also happens to be a Methodist minister in Houston, Texas. ""It gives us an opportunity to wrestle with the [Bible's] claims and questions."" Ehrman: There was no resurrection . Ehrman says that no one accepts everything in the Bible. Everyone picks and chooses . He cites some New Testament's references to the role of women in church as an example. In the first book of Corinthians, Ehrman says, the Apostle Paul insists that women should remain silent in church (1 Corinthians 14:35-36). In the 16th chapter of the book of Romans, Paul's attitude is that women could and should be church leaders -- and he cites women who were serving as deacons and apostles in the early church, Ehrman says. Ehrman backs his arguments with a deep knowledge of the culture and history of the New Testament world. He's written 20 books on early Christianity and is an authority on ancient manuscripts used to translate the Bible. His claims, though, take on some of Christianity's most sacred tenets, like the resurrection of Jesus. Ehrman says he doesn't think the resurrection took place. There's no proof Jesus physically rose from the dead, and the resurrection stories contradict one another, he says. He says he doesn't believe the followers of Jesus saw their master bodily rise from the dead, but something else. ""My best guess is that what happened is what commonly happens today when someone has a loved one die -- they sometimes think they see them in a vision,"" Ehrman says. ""I think some of the disciples had visions."" Ehrman says he immerses himself in the Bible, though he doesn't believe in its infallibility, because it's the most important book in Western civilization. ""I have friends who teach medieval English,"" he says. ""They don't believe in Chaucer, but they think Chaucer is important,"" he writes in the conclusion of ""Jesus, Interrupted."" The fundamentalist turns agnostic . Ehrman once had a different attitude toward the Bible. He was raised in the Episcopal Church in Lawrence, Kansas, and became a fundamentalist Christian at age 15 when he met a charismatic Christian youth group leader who reached out to him. Ehrman says he later persuaded his parents to embrace a more conservative brand of Christianity. He says he became so devoted to the Bible that he memorized entire sections. He was convinced the Bible was ""God's words."" But Ehrman says he began to develop doubts about the infallibility of the Bible after attending Princeton Theological Seminary to become a college Bible professor. He even began to change his opinion of the Christian youth group leader who helped convert him. The youth leader visited Ehrman's father when he was dying of cancer in a hospital. The youth leader used a bottle of hotel shampoo to ""anoint"" his father, and tried to persuade his father to confess specific sins, Ehrman says. Ehrman says he was angry at the minister for acting ""self-righteous"" and ""hypocritical."" ""For a vulnerable high-schooler who is trying to figure out the world, a personality like that is very attractive,"" Ehrman says. ""They're like cult leaders. They have all the answers."" Ehrman says he later became an agnostic because he couldn't find the answer to another question: How could there be a God when there is so much suffering in the world? An agnostic is one who disclaims any knowledge of God, but does not deny the possibility of God's existence. Today, Ehrman describes himself as a ""happy agnostic."" But some people can't believe an agnostic can be happy, he says. They tell him that they're praying for him. Others say worse. They say he's being fooled by Satan and he's headed to hell. Some say he's the anti-Christ. ""I'm not that powerful,"" he says, laughing. His family, however, feels no obligation to talk to Ehrman about his ideas on the Bible, Ehrman says. His mother, brother and sister remain conservative Christians. He once tried to talk to his mother about his new beliefs, but the discussion proved fruitless. ""My mom is a strong evangelical,"" Ehrman says. ""We talk basketball. We don't talk religion."" Still, Ehrman says he still sends his mother and siblings copies of his latest books. They've never responded, he says. ""I imagine they're hidden in a back room,"" he says. Whether it's his family, critics or students, Ehrman says he has a better handle on why he is so threatening to so many people -- some Christians worry they will make the same decision he has. ""I changed my mind,"" he says. ""My students find me more dangerous that way. I really do know what they're talking about when they stake out an evangelical position.""","Meet a real-life ""Angels & Demons"" professor .

"(CNN) -- After downloading the latest iPhone, iPod touch and iPad operating system, iOS 6, the fun part is excitedly poking around and hunting for what's new. Find subtle design changes, like the phone's key pad, or set up new features, like Facebook integration. You might even use Siri again for the first time in a while to test its improved sports and restaurant knowledge. If you have an iPhone 3GS, 4 or 4S, a fourth generation iPod touch, or an iPad 2 or the new iPad, you can upgrade to iOS 6. Go to your settings screen, tap General and then Software Update. Keep in mind that some features are limited to the most recent models. Here are the biggest changes to look for in the new iOS, good and bad and inbetween. Maps . Apple gave Google's maps data the old heave-ho and redesigned the maps app from the ground up, helped in part by the company's recent acquisitions of mapping companies such as C3. The resulting app is undeniably attractive and well-designed. It's also an unfortunate downgrade from the previous version and the biggest disappointment of the new operating system. The app is missing some of the most useful features from the former iOS Maps app: Google's transit directions and street view images. Some countries have also lost traffic information. In many locations, it also appears to be missing accurate and up-to-date information. iOS 6 users have discovered numerous incorrect maps, showing farmland where there should be cities, incorrectly categorized businesses, misplaced landmarks and street addresses, and generally a lower-level of detail than is found on Google's maps. Massive demand awaits iPhone 5 sale . It's not all take and no give. Apple has added one very much needed feature: turn-by-turn directions. Previously, iPhone users had to download apps like Waze to effectively use their phones for directions while on the road (hitting ""Next"" on the old directions each time you turned a corner was dangerous and tricky). Turn-by-turn is not supported on the iPhone 4 and earlier, the first iPad or any iPad without cellular, or the iPod touch. A not-useful-but-still-super-cool new feature is Flyover, which is available for a select number of areas and cities. This 3D aerial view is a kick to tap and swipe around, circling skyscrapers and cruising down streets like a bird. But unless you actually are a bird, the feature won't be of much practical use for navigation. Flyover is only available on the iPhone 4S and later, iPad 2 and later, and the iPod touch. (If you're outside the U.S., check out this breakdown of what countries are gaining and losing maps features from The Understatement.) Teasingly, there is a public transit icon when you try to search for directions, but it quickly whisks you away to a list of transit routing apps you can download in the app store, most only for one transit system or another. Google's transit directions pulled in data from multiple services -- you could take a city bus to an unrelated train system traveling across state lines. Downloading all the transit apps still wouldn't be as useful as the Google version. Luckily, you can still access Google Maps from Safari to get the transit feature. Google has not yet announced an official Google Maps iOS app, but many suspect it will, just as it did for YouTube after Apple removed the video-service's baked-in app. How to wait in an iPhone 5 line . Siri . After the voice-activated Siri feature was announced last year for the iPhone 4S, it seemed everyone with the latest iPhone was walking around asking their device questions and making requests. A survey by Parks Associates released in March found while 87% of iPhone 4S owners were using the tool at least once a month, most were using Siri mostly for a few basic tasks, primarily making phone calls and sending texts. A new batch of features may broaden their horizons. The most useful addition is Facebook and Twitter integration. You can dictate 140 characters to share on Twitter or an update for your Facebook timeline. Apple has teamed up with some outside companies to improve results. Rotten Tomatoes improves movie reviews, Open Table beefs up restaurant results and makes it easy to make a reservation using Siri. Sports nuts will dig the Yahoo-fueled scores. Other new features include being able to launch apps and get local-focused search results. Are you lining up for the iPhone 5? Photos . The camera is one of the iPhone and iPod touch's killer features (less so on the iPad, if only because holding up a giant rectangle to take a snapshot is cumbersome). New camera features are always one of the more fun updates, and this round has two notable new tools. (Last iOS update we gained the ability to edit photos directly in the Camera Roll and an overlay grid.) First up is the ability to shoot panoramic photos, which are instantly stitched together and saved to your camera roll. There are plenty of apps that already do this exact thing, but having it built into the camera app makes the process easier. In limited testing, it also appears to be incredibly fast when processing the final image, and does a nice job of seamlessly sticking the whole affair together. Panoramic photos go up to 280-degrees and the final image can be as large as 28-megapixels. The feature only works on the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and fifth-generation iPod touch. Shared photo streams are the other major new feature. It is almost awesome, but only for friends also in the Apple eco-system. You can now share specific photos -- say only photos of your cat or baby or cat and baby hanging out -- with one or a group of friends. Your friends can then like and comment on the photos, which are viewable in the Photos app (on phones running iOS 6), in iPhoto on a Mac or on an Apple TV. Private Photo Streams can only be viewed by people with an iCloud account. It is possible to publish a photo stream as a public site for anyone to see, but it does now allow commenting or likes. Reviews are in for iPhone 5 . Mail . The Mail app has always been simple but effective. With iOS 6, Apple is starting to add a few extra bells and whistles, and one key feature that was mysteriously missing. Finally, you can add a photo or video directly from within an email. Previously, you had to start your email from the Photos app or paste an image in. It was always an odd omission. There is a new VIP option for those important emails you can't dare miss. Click on any sender's name and select Add To VIP, and in the future all emails from that address will appear in the special VIP folder. The VIP folder will show up in the Mail app no matter what, even if you don't plan on using it. It's also possible to flag important email. Passbook . This new iOS 6 feature has potential, but it will require some time to see how it takes off. Passbook is like a little purse for your random tickets, coupons, loyalty cards and passes from other apps. Getting on a United Airlines plane? First you'll have to install the United Airlines app, then you can bring up your boarding pass in Passbook and the attendant can scan your screen. In helpful twist, Passbook reminds you of dates and times, and can offer other push notifications such as the balance on a Starbucks account. Passbook is not available on the iPad. There are other goodies in iOS 6, like the Do Not Disturb feature, new sharing options, a ""Remind me Later"" message for ignored calls, new Safari offline reading tool and the ability to set a song as your alarm sound. Timing is everything for iPhone 5 accessory makers .","New operating system update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch has gained and lost features .

"(CNN) -- When Marvel Comics Executive Editor Tom Brevoort told CNN in December that ""something new"" would come out of the recent death of the Fantastic Four's Human Torch, he wasn't kidding. For starters, they won't even be using the name Fantastic Four. On Wednesday, Marvel announced that the team is now going to be called the Future Foundation, debuting in ""FF"" No. 1 in March. Gone are the traditional blue costumes. The team will now be wearing white-and-black costumes (with three hexagons replacing the trademark number ""4,"" as well). And then there's the cherry on top: Reed ""Mr. Fantastic"" Richards, Sue ""Invisible Woman"" Richards and Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm will now be joined by the superstar of the Marvel Universe, none other than Spider-Man (also wearing a new white-and-black costume). Reaction to the news from comic book fans has run the gamut. Here's a sample: . Spider-Man joining ""FF"" makes perfect sense! ""I think it's a great idea,"" said Bob Bretall of the ComicBookPage podcast. ""The association between Spidey and the FF goes all the way back to 'Amazing Spider-Man' No. 1 in 1962."" One of the most memorable examples of this on-again, off-again partnership with the FF involved a very different kind of costume change. In a 1984 issue of ""Amazing Spider-Man,"" the webhead ended up putting on the iconic original Fantastic Four costume ... and they got around the problem of his mask by having him wear a brown paper bag on his head. Bretall thinks that Spidey joining the team makes sense on another level: ""Given that Johnny (Storm, the Human Torch) has long been Spider-Man's best friend as a superhero, it just feels right for him to step in and round out the roster to four."" Comic book historian Alan Kistler agreed: ""Spider-Man is a scientist with a different perspective than Mr. Fantastic, and he specializes in different fields, so it could be very interesting to see how his own expertise rounds out this new Future Foundation. And from another angle, it could be interesting to see how Spidey feels about essentially replacing a person he considered a friend and what kind of pressure this will place on him."" On Twitter, @solidcolt put it this way: "" 'Amazing Spider-Man' is possibly better then it's ever been. And now he's joining (writer Jonathan) Hickman's FF so that third movie is totally forgiven."" Too much Spidey? ""That's enough Spidey! You are everywhere already!"" wrote @kodok_biroe on Twitter. He might be the most recognizable character from Marvel Comics, and it's not hard to imagine why Spider-Man is so ubiquitous. He's even a current member of the Avengers. There's a lot of buzz around the new ""Spider-Man"" film reboot starring Andrew Garfield. And then there's that Broadway musical that made so many headlines before it even officially opened. Still, some fans might be left to wonder: Why Spider-Man? Why not a new character for the team? ""Injecting Spider-Man into the Fantastic Four will probably boost sales, but it feels like Marvel is kind of pimping out the character and spreading him too thin,"" Sean Fallon wrote at Nerdapproved.com. ""Normally, the addition of Spider-Man to a 'team' comic might worry me a bit. Spidey is -- along with Wolverine -- one of the most oversaturated characters in the Marvel Universe,"" G4 TV's comic book guru Blair Butler said. ""But this new version of the Fantastic Four comes to us from Hickman -- one of the most innovative voices working in comics today -- so I'm actually really looking forward to it, white suits and all. And if you've read Hickman's other work, the new title and costumes seem to fit his science-based vision of the Fantastic Four perfectly."" Yes, about those new costumes ... FF's new costumes are true to its roots . ComicBookPage podcaster John Mayo is a fan of the team's new look: ""The new costumes look great."" Kistler, who often blogs about superhero fashion, looked at what makes the FF special in his assessment of the costumes: ""(The FF) spend their spare time looking for other planets and dimensions to explore rather than patrolling for criminals to stop. So the new FF suits work for me as a compromise between customized NASA flight suits and 'Star Trek' uniforms."" White costumes ... really? (And what about Spidey?) ""I'm not too thrilled about the move away from traditional blue, but I'm sure ill get over it,"" Bretall said. ""The new costumes are sleek, if not colorful."" And even though Kistler liked the FF costumes, he is not as thrilled about Spider-Man's look. ""It's off-putting at first. Spider-Man has such a unique costume design, with interesting line work and shape, and now most of that's been removed. Black and white works for the rest of the FF, because it's supposed to symbolize their stark look on reality following the Human Torch's death, but Spidey's faced personal death and tragedy many times and has maintained a colorful sense of humor and the belief that eventually things will get better,"" he said. ""On the other hand, it would be boring to have him wear his classic costume and just add the hexagons to his shirt, so I can accept this as his FF outfit that he wears when he's representing their interests. If he were wearing this in his own comics as well, I'd have a bigger problem with it."" Is this really a permanent change? As Kistler noted not too long ago on Newsarama.com, the FF have had a lot of costume changes over the years, though this one may be the most drastic. There have also been a number of changes with the Fantastic Four over the years, particularly the ""Heroes Reborn"" storyline in the '90s. Which begs the question, how long will these changes last? ""While I am sure I'll continue to enjoy the title as it becomes 'The Future Foundation' for the next year, I fully expect that a year from now, the big news around the title will be that it is reverting to Fantastic Four just in time for issue No. 600,"" speculated Mayo. ""Moreover, there is a strong possibility that issue will feature the heroic return of the Human Torch."" Permanent or not, it will be interesting to see whether these radical changes will ultimately be accepted. Brevoort promises a ""unique, powerful new series that's going to surprise a lot of fans with its combination of mind-blowing ideas and visuals."" If it lives up to that promise, you'll be sure to hear exclamations of ""Excelsior!"" from readers.","Fantastic Four lost a team member when Human Torch was killed in January .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A group of 60 interfaith leaders in California called for Americans ""to rise above the rancorous shouting match"" as they spoke out Friday in favor of a controversial Islamic center near ""ground zero"" in New York. They called for understanding and tolerance and said religious freedom, one of America's most cherished values, is at stake in the controversy that has gathered steam in the past few weeks. ""Such intolerance, in this country of all places, breaks my heart and I believe it breaks the heart of God,"" said the Rev. Anne Felton Hines of the Unitarian Universalist Church. She joined voices with Roman Catholics, Jews, Seventh Day Adventists, Muslims and leaders of other faiths at a news conference held at the Islamic Center of Southern California. Among them was Maher Hathout, chairman of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California. ""I'd like to emphasize this is not an issue for the Muslims,"" Hathout said. ""It is an issue for Americans who want America to be the way it was dreamed by its founders."" The New York Islamic center's leaders say they plan to build the $100 million, 13-story facility called Park51 -- formerly known as Cordoba House -- on property it already owns two blocks from the site of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center. Developer Sharif El-Gamal describes the project as an ""Islamic community center"" that would include a 500-seat performing arts center, a lecture hall, a swimming pool, a gym, a culinary school, a restaurant and a prayer space for Muslims. But some New Yorkers oppose the project, saying that an Islamic center near the site of the attack by Islamic extremists that killed more than 2,700 people is a painful affront. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released August 11 showed nationwide opposition to the proposed facility at 68 percent. The controversy swirling around the proposed center has pitted survivors and families of September 11 victims against each other. Current New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is for it, but a past mayor, Rudy Giuliani is against. Radio talk shows are abuzz with the topic and blogs have been filled with venomous comments about Muslims. A new Time magazine cover story on the topic highlights how the controversy has brought new scrutiny to other examples of anti-Muslim protests happening around the country. It also discusses a new poll that shows that a growing number of Americans believe President Barack Obama is Muslim. The poll was taken before Obama voiced support for the Islamic center. ""The rhetoric against Muslim Americans -- namely, that they are a suspect community, or worse, enemies of the state; their religion is uncivilized and anti-American; they are deceitful; and they aim to destroy our culture and our constitution -- are replicas of attacks against other religious minorities in the past as well as current attacks against ethnic and racial minorities,"" the interfaith coalition said Friday. ""We Americans, whether Muslim or Christian, whether Jew or Hindu, whether of faith or no faith, were all attacked on 9/11 by terrorists who can only be described as criminals,"" it said. ""We oppose the exploitation of the pain and suffering of 9/11 by political opportunists. They only divide our country and undermine the principles of pluralism, religious freedom, and security by fostering hate based on fear.""","A group of Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders urge Americans to rise above the shouting match .

"(CNN) -- The technological revolution is destroying jobs in Europe, according to the founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF), whose annual meeting is under way in Davos. In an interview with CNN's Richard Quest, WEF chief executive Klaus Schwab said not enough is being done about structural unemployment in Europe and that advances in technology are hurting jobs. ""We have such a technological revolution going on at this moment. This will destroy employment. We have to make sure that the destroyed employment is replaced by better jobs and that's not happening at the moment,"" Schwab said. WEF -- held on the remote snowy peaks of Davos, Switzerland -- is where world leaders and business giants meet each year to discuss issues affecting the global economy. Schwab warned that today's policymakers and business community are facing the threat of a ""generational crisis of tremendous dimension."" ""We have to make sure that the global leaders who are coming here, politicians and business leaders, take on again a longer term view because otherwise we have one crisis after the other one,"" he said. Both the U.S. and Europe have been struggling to cope with recessions, low growth and high unemployment since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, a crisis that has reverberated through the global economy for over five years. While the U.S. -- the world's largest economy -- has shown signs of an economic recovery with unemployment falling below 7% for December 2013, many nations in Europe are still suffering from the fallout of a five-year debt crisis. Unemployment across the European Union's 28 member states has remained stubbornly high at 10.9% since May, with jobless rates in countries such as Spain and Greece hovering around the 25% mark, and youth unemployment over 50%, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office. Read more: Lagarde warns against 'complacent' Europe . Schwab said the key to restoring Europe's economy is to close the competitiveness, the measure of a nation's productivity, between member states. ""You could have seen 20 years ago already that something is wrong with Europe because you had the northern countries, particularly Germany, performing very well, the southern countries lagging behind,"" he said. Since the eurozone debt crisis broke out in Greece in late 2009, four countries have requested bailouts from Europe's rescue funds, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus. But Schwab said nations in southern Europe are beginning to show signs of recovery. ""[Competitiveness] should change and we see the first signs in Spain. We see very timid signs in Italy and in Greece. We will have to see what's happening in France."" Read more: Europe feeling the economic winds of change .

However, at a news conference earlier this month French President Francois Hollande said he would tackle the country's high payroll taxes to improve competitiveness.

"(CNN) -- Is there an unspoken rule in Hollywood that celebrity parents can only pick unusual names for their kids? On Instagram on Sunday, Kourtney Kardashian revealed that she and partner Scott Disick went with Reign Aston as the name of their third child, a boy they welcomed on December 14. Over the weekend, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard welcomed their second child, a daughter they named Delta Bell. And that's after the arrival earlier this year of Royal Reign, the daughter of rapper Lil' Kim, and Apollo Bowie Flynn, the son of Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. All of those names are obviously precious to the parents who picked them, but they're not exactly the equivalent of monikers such as Sophia or Jackson, which according to BabyCenter.com, were the top two baby names in 2014. Not every celebrity picks the most unusual name they can think of -- John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, for example, welcomed daughter Hazel this year -- but most of the time it seems the famous are competing in some sort of special baby-name Olympics.

"(CNN) -- Isaac Owusu knows the forests of Kakum National Park in Ghana like the back of his hand. The 360-square-kilometer sanctuary is home to hundreds of plant species, as well as endangered animals including, leopards, elephants, hornbills, African grey parrots and many more. But while Owusu now proudly walks through the sanctuary as a tour guide, he gained his knowledge of the reserve a different way: as a poacher. It was 15 years ago that he decided to go from hunter to protector, but says that his decision to change his ways at first endangered his own life. Fellow villagers and other poachers threatened to shoot him, he says, because he ""let them down."" Now however many more have thanked him for showing that conservation and tourism can provide other ways to make a living from the forest. The national reserve and its tourism industry have created jobs for people from the 52 surrounding villages, which in turn brings more sustainable income to their communities. See also: Ghana: Keeping one of Africa's stars of democracy shining . Kakum was turned into a forest reserve in 1925, designated a national park in 1992 and opened to the public two years later. Within 20 years, it has become a must-see tourist spot in the country, attracting an average of 180,000 visitors every year. For tourists the main draw is the so-called canopy walkway. The series of hanging bridges stretches 350 meters long, connecting seven treetops. The swaying walkway -- reaching as high as 40 meters above the ground -- tests one's nerves, but it does offer a stunning vantage point of the forest's diverse flora and fauna. Just outside Kakum lies farmland, which can lead to conflicts between villagers and wild animals, particularly elephants that wander beyond the park's boundaries and raid the crops. Conservation officials have taught farmers in the area to build chili fences, a low-tech method, around their fields to deter crop-raiding elephants. But few farmers adopt the measures, with many saying they face financial constraints and insufficient knowledge to install and maintain the fences. Plus, old habits die hard. Some of the locals also still treat the forest as their hunting grounds as bush meat is a common source of protein in West Africa. See also: Bamboo bikes turn around fortunes for working women in Ghana . Kakum's challenges echo those of the country. Ghana's rapidly dwindling rainforests and biodiversity face threats from poaching, as well as illegal logging. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common in Ghana, as in other parts of Western Africa. Mineral mining, both large and small in scale, also exacts a toll on the rainforests. While Ghana has seen success in reducing elephant poaching and illegal ivory trade, but it still struggles to clamp down on bush-meat hunting. Increased access to forests has helped create an even bigger market that transcends national borders. By one estimate, bush-meat trade in Ghana reaches $350 million a year. But for now, Ghana -- like many other countries like in the world, from Kenya to Cambodia -- has turned to converted hunters like Owusu to help conserve its precious wildlife.

"(CNN) -- Funerals in Ghana are not only an occasion to mourn. They are also an opportunity to celebrate the life of the dearly departed. Hardly ever a somber, low-key affair, Ghanaian funerals are a social event attended by a large number of mourners, which could reach hundreds -- the more, the better. ""That means the person was very friendly, very charitable, was good to socialize, was having a good communication with the people within the society,"" says Jamima, a family friend who attends the funeral of the 70-year-old Joanna Boafo in the town of Kumasi. Ghanaians may spend as much money on funerals as on weddings, sometimes even more. ""An average funeral should cost between $15,000-$20,000,"" says Kwaku, a funeral planner who is in charge of 30 funeral parties on this one day alone. That includes the obligatory giant, colorful billboards that announce funeral arrangements. The billboards, which may cost from nearly $600 to $3,000, are placed at strategic spots for everybody to see, often dotting the cities' skylines. Most funerals are held on the weekends, most frequently on Saturdays. Mourners, usually dressed in black or black and red traditional funeral clothing, may travel to other towns or villages, and in turn they expect the bereaved families to provide food, drinks, music and dance. The extravagance also extends to the caskets. Coffins have become a statement in Ghana. They are usually brightly colored and elaborate. They may have fanciful shapes that resemble the dead's favorite objects, or represent their profession. Thus, a carpenter may have a coffin shaped like a hammer, or a shoe for a shoemaker. There are also caskets shaped like Coca-Cola bottles and airplanes. Ghanaians revere the dead so much that funerals are at the heart of Ghanaians' social life. Lavish spending on funerals has invited criticism from political and religious leaders. ""We are investing in the dead rather than the living ... and that is bad,"" legislator Alban Bagbin once said. Charles Gabriel Palmer-Buckle, the Archbishop of Accra, said: ""The surest way to remember the dead is not the type of coffins used to bury them nor is not the type of cloth or T-shirt won during their funerals, but doing something positive for the dead which would benefit the living."" Funeral rites also involve some official crying by mourners, as well as praying. The Boafos, like many grieving Ghanaian families, hold a church service for Joanna as well. But the rest of the funeral ritual is purely party time. ""I think she would be very happy,"" says Richard, son of Joanna, as mourners are dancing and having a good time. ""I think if she is anywhere, if my mother is anywhere right now, she will be very happy."" See also: Ghana: Keeping one of Africa's stars of democracy shining .

"(CNN) -- Macedonia is ""frustrated"" by Greece's efforts to block its European Union membership over a longstanding identity dispute, the country's Prime Minister has said. In an interview with CNN, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said that Greece is ""very successful"" in making the Balkan nation look ""guilty"" over the use of the word ""Macedonia"" in its state name. ""Greece is not ready to make a compromise ... so we cannot solve the issue,"" he said. Gruevski said the Greek government is ""rejecting"" Macedonia's advances to open talks and revealed that he tried to contact Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, but his offers were rejected. Gruevski added: ""The international law is on our side and I believe that if Greece decides to respect international law, we can start the negotiations with the EU and we can join NATO immediately."" The name dispute between the two countries has rumbled on since Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 leading to a U.N. accord signed by both parties four years later. The disagreement centers around the use of the name Macedonia as well as symbols and figures used by the FYROM: these are traditionally considered part of Greek culture from the period when the region was part of ancient Greece. The most prominent of these figures is Alexander the Great, Greek king of Macedon, who went on to forge one of the largest empires of the ancient world. In 2011, the Macedonian government unveiled a 39 ft statue of the legendary leader in the central square of the nation's capital, Skopje. The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled in 2011 that Greece was wrong to block Macedonia's bid to join NATO in 2008. The ICJ said: ""Greece, by objecting to the admission of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to NATO, has breached its obligation"" to a 1995 Interim Accord not to block Macedonian applications made under its current name. In response to Gruevski's claims, Konstantinos Koutras, spokesman for the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that a number of Samaras' predecessors had met with the Macedonian Prime Minister, but that they were simply ""photo opportunities and a faÃ§ade."" Koutras said: ""A whole generation in FYROM is being poisoned with bitter feelings against Greece, which is branded as the culprit for all evils their country is being faced with."" He added: ""If Skopje had shown equal degree of commitment, the name issue would have been settled."" When asked whether the government would consider removing ""Macedonia"" from its name, Gruevski said: ""There are many parts of this problem... if there is a dialogue, I believe we can find a solution."" But Kurt Volker, former U.S. permanent representative to NATO, told CNN that while modifying the name is possible, taking ""Macedonia"" out of the name completely is not under discussion. Volker said: ""I think that the Macedonians have moved quite far and I think that they are prepared to make an agreement on a modified name for the country for the purposes of being recognized in international organizations."" However, he added: ""That doesn't go as far as the Greeks have insisted. They wanted to change everything including for the Macedonians to change their constitution. That's just pie in the sky, that's never going to happen."" Macedonia submitted its application to join the EU in 2004 but is yet to open negotiations with legislators over EU status. EU membership would give Macedonia -- a country of just 2.1 million people according to Eurostat -- access to the world's largest trading bloc and representation at the European institutions in Brussels. Macedonia already has free trade agreements with a number of non-EU countries including Switzerland, Norway, Turkey and Ukraine in addition to states within Europe's economic and political union. According to an assessment by the European Commission, Macedonia ""sufficiently"" meets the political criteria to open negotiations. Peter Stano, spokesman for European Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule, told CNN that the Brussels-based legislature has recommended for five years in a row to open accession negotiations with Macedonia. He added: ""Together we are stronger, and especially in the Western Balkans, we contribute to the reconciliation among nations and to guaranteeing peace and reinforcing stability in a region marked by conflicts in a not so distant past."" Gruevski said that membership for all countries in the Balkans will provide ""long term stability"" to the region and ultimately attract more foreign investment. ""Personal income tax is 10%, profit tax is 10%. The other taxes are also very low, so as a package we are offering the best tax package to the companies that are coming."" With low inflation and growth forecast at 2.8% this year, Macedonia could represent a significant opportunity for investors looking to tap southeast Europe. Asked whether Macedonia would have to raise taxes if they gained entry into the EU, Gruevski said: ""We will try not to go up but when the time comes we will see.""

"(CNN) -- A deeply divided Venezuela is mourning its late leader and preparing to pick a new president to replace him. Venezuelan officials called for peace and unity after President Hugo Chavez's death on Tuesday, emphasizing in state television broadcasts that all branches of the government and the military were standing together. Elections will be held in 30 days, and Vice President Nicolas Maduro will assume the presidency in the interim, Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said in an interview broadcast on state-run VTV. Tearing up as he announced Chavez's death after a long battle with cancer, Maduro called on Venezuelans to remain respectful. ""We must unite now more than ever,"" Maduro said. Henrique Capriles Radonski, a former presidential candidate and opposition leader, said Venezuelans should come together. ""This is not the time for difference,"" he said. ""It is the time for unity. It is the time for peace."" Supporters of Chavez poured into a Caracas square soon after news of his death spread. Some wept openly. Others waved flags and held up pictures of the late president. There were no reports of major violence, but there was palpable tension in the streets, as some Venezuelans heading home from work tried to steer clear of Chavez's fervent supporters. Venezuela's military is in a ""process of deploying ... to ensure the safety of all Venezuelans"" and to support the country's constitution in the wake of Chavez's death, said Adm. Diego Molero, Venezuela's defense minister. iReport: Share your thoughts on the death of the Venezuelan president . Venezuela prepares for funeral, elections . Venezuela's government has declared seven days of national mourning, Jaua said. At Venezuelan embassies around the world Tuesday, flags were flying at half mast. Chavez's remains will be taken to a military academy in Caracas on Wednesday, Jaua said. There he will lie in state for three days. His state funeral will be held there on Friday morning, Jaua said. The announcement of Chavez's death came hours after Maduro met with the country's top political and military leaders about Chavez's worsening health condition and suggested someone may have deliberately infected Chavez with cancer. Chavez first announced his cancer diagnosis in June 2011, but the government never revealed details about his prognosis or specified what kind of cancer he had . Shortly before his last trip to Cuba for cancer surgery in December, Chavez tapped Maduro as the man he wanted to replace him. ""He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot,"" Chavez said. Chavez leaves a revolutionary legacy . Maduro made no mention of running for election in his public comments Tuesday, but he is widely expected to be the United Socialist Party of Venezuela's candidate for the job. During Chavez's absence from the political stage over the past three months, Maduro has been front and center. He has spoken at political rallies around the country and delivered updates about Chavez on national television, drawing growing support from Chavez loyalists. Opposition critics have said he was campaigning for office -- a claim the government has denied. Even as Jaua said Tuesday that Maduro would temporarily assume the presidency, some critics questioned whether that was constitutional, since Chavez missed his inauguration and was never officially sworn in. Opposition politicians haven't said who will represent them in the election. But as speculation mounted over Chavez's health in recent weeks, many had turned to Capriles, who lost to Chavez in October's presidential contest. On Tuesday, Capriles called for a national dialogue including all Venezuelans, not just Chavez's supporters. ""Today there are thousands, maybe millions, of Venezuelans who are asking themselves what will happen, who feel anxiety, and including those who feel afraid,"" Capriles said. Chavez supporters, critics react . Word of Chavez's death drew swift expressions of sorrow and solidarity from regional allies. Ecuador and Cuba both announced three days of national mourning to honor Chavez. ""The national government expresses its solidarity in light of this irreparable loss that puts the Venezuelan people and all the region in mourning and at the same time sends its heartfelt condolences to the family of the late champion of Latin America,"" Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement. Bolivian President Evo Morales' voice cracked as he spoke to reporters, describing Chavez as someone ""who gave all his life for the liberation of the Venezuelan people ... of all the anti-imperialists and anti-capitalists of the world."" But longtime critics of the controversial president offered a different take. ""Hugo Chavez was a tyrant who forced the people of Venezuela to live in fear. His death dents the alliance of anti-U.S. leftist leaders in South America. Good riddance to this dictator,"" said U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""Venezuela once had a strong democratic tradition and was close to the United States. Chavez's death sets the stage for fresh elections. While not guaranteed, closer U.S. relations with (this) key country in our Hemisphere are now possible."" Venezuela-U.S. relations surge into spotlight . Just hours before the announcement of Chavez's death, relations between the two countries appeared to be souring, as Venezuelan officials said they were expelling two U.S. Embassy officials and accused them of plotting to destabilize the country. The U.S. officials, both air attaches at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, are accused of having meetings with members of the Venezuelan military and encouraging them to pursue ""destabilizing projects,"" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said. ""We will not allow any foreign interference in our country,"" Jaua said. ""Do not think that the situation of pain over the health of President Chavez will translate into weakness."" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell denied the accusations. Opinion: Chavez used force of personality to win votes, influence leaders . ""Notwithstanding the significant differences between our governments, we continue to believe it important to seek a functional and more productive relationship with Venezuela based on issues of mutual interest,"" he said. ""This fallacious assertion of inappropriate U.S. action leads us to conclude that, unfortunately, the current Venezuelan government is not interested an improved relationship."" After announcing the expulsion of one attache, Maduro -- addressing the media in a lengthy statement -- asserted that someday there will be ""scientific proof"" that Chavez was somehow infected by outsiders. ""An assertion that the United States was somehow involved in causing President Chavez's illness is absurd, and we definitively reject it,"" Ventrell said. It isn't the first time that a Venezuelan government official has implied that a plot could be behind Chavez's cancer. Chavez made the assertion himself in 2011, saying at a military event in Caracas that he wondered whether the United States could be infecting Latin American leaders with the illness. CNN's Shasta Darlington, Mariano Castillo, Rafael Romo, Patrick Oppmann, Juan Carlos Lopez, Ione Molinares and Pam Benson and journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","Official: Maduro will temporarily assume the presidency until elections are held .

"(CNN) -- In front of a packed house at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Joan Baez expressed the spirit of the day: ""Good morning, children of the '80s,"" she said to the crowd gathered for the marathon charity concert Live Aid. ""This is your Woodstock, and it's long overdue."" Skeptics might disagree with Baez -- and many did at the time -- but the heart of the July 13, 1985, show was in the right place, says former MTV VJ Mark Goodman. ""I wind up feeling like I speak in clichés when I talk about this day -- and I lived through the '60s -- but it was a day when we felt like we were making a difference,"" said Goodman, now 58, who was there with the rest of his MTV colleagues. ""And I believe that we did."" Live Aid grew out of concern for the victims of famine in Ethiopia. The crisis sparked ""Do They Know It's Christmas,"" a UK single sung by an all-star cast put together by the Boomtown Rats' Bob Geldof and Ultravox's Midge Ure, and then ""We Are the World,"" an American single spearheaded by Harry Belafonte and manager Ken Kragen. With both songs having hit No. 1 in their respective countries, a movement began for a live show to raise money for the cause. The concert, which took place 25 years ago Tuesday, ran live in both the UK and the U.S.: at London's Wembley Stadium and the now-defunct JFK. The lineup included Sting, Elton John, a young U2, Run-DMC, the Pretenders, Madonna, Bob Dylan and -- on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks to a timely Concorde flight -- Phil Collins. Though Live Aid was far from the first charity show, its success gave birth to other fund-raisers, including Farm Aid and Live 8. It also led to a knighthood for Geldof, today better known for his charity work than his music. Goodman, now a VH1 Classic personality and a DJ for Sirius XM, talked to CNN.com about his memories of the show, its outstanding performances, the crazy rumors and his old employer. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What was it like to actually be there? Mark Goodman: The way the weather has been in the Northeast, that's how it was that day. We got onto the site at 6 in the morning, and it was hot and humid. And that really informed everything that happened, because everybody was running around working really hard. It was just incredibly hot, and they were hosing people in the front rows. CNN: There had been fund-raising shows before -- the Concert for Bangladesh, the one for Kampuchea -- but the level of this was completely different. Goodman: Sure, it wasn't the first time it had happened. But it was gargantuan compared to any of those. The scope of it really was incomprehensible for [the MTV VJs]. We saw the crowd there at JFK, 100,000 people or so, and we knew we were carried in all these places that were sending us feeds, but the real concept of it -- of how many were actually watching -- you really couldn't get your head around it that day. It wasn't until years later that I started to understand how many did actually see it. CNN: What were some of the rumors? I remember hearing that the Beatles were going to reform, that Paul was going to play and George and Ringo would come out, say with John's son Julian. Goodman: I don't recall that particular rumor, but what I do remember -- and this kind of stuff was floating up to us -- was that we were all kind of surprised that Bruce [Springsteen] wasn't there. And so there were some rumors somehow that got started somewhere that, ""It was Bruce's lighting rig up there, Bruce's lighting rig."" How can you tell one lighting rig from another? CNN: What were some of your favorite performances? Goodman: The big one of the day was the Led Zeppelin reunion. I was so shocked in days hence, when I'd speak to friends or family who watched it on TV, [they] thought they sounded awful, and apparently the band thought they sounded awful. I thought they sounded amazing on stage, which is where we were watching. ... Madonna was really amazing that day, I thought, and it was right around the time [her] nude pictures came out, and she made some sort of comment that ""I ain't taking s*** off today."" And even at the end, we were all up there singing ""We Are the World,"" and there were people there who I think didn't wind up getting to perform who were part of that finale. CNN: Do you think shows like this make a difference? There's always the question about, does this money get to the proper place? [The BBC reported in March that millions of dollars went to rebels to buy weapons; Geldof disputed much of the BBC's report.] . Goodman: I don't know the inner workings -- I know, like you, what I read in the newsmagazines -- [but] I have to believe that some of the money gets there. Geldof, I know, gets irate -- and he's no dummy -- he gets irate at the thought that people think that he's stiffing people and that the majority of the money isn't getting to the people who should be getting it.

"(CNN) -- The price of cassava, a root vegetable that is a staple ingredient in Liberian diets, shot up in August. In the Redlight Markets of Monrovia, the Ebola-stricken country's capital, Liberians were forced to pay 150% more for cassava, a basic for flour and bread. It's a small example, noted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, which represents massive economic pain hitting the countries of West Africa. The total cost is now estimated to hit $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors, according to a World Bank report issued Wednesday. Liberia has suffered most in the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,800 people and delivered an economic shock to some of Africa's most vulnerable economies. Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no additional interventions, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report warned. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three countries facing the biggest health crisis -- are also facing huge bills to try and contain the virus.","The biggest Ebola outbreak in history is taking its toll in Western Africa .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai is the new President of Afghanistan, and his rival, Abdullah Abdullah, is CEO, Afghanistan Independent Elections Commission chairman Ahmad Yousuf Nooristani announced in a news conference in Kabul on Sunday. Nooristani didn't disclose the percentage of their votes from the June runoff election. He also didn't take any questions from journalists. Ghani and Abdullah signed a power-sharing agreement earlier Sunday after months of infighting over allegations of voting fraud and manipulation. The U.S. State Department congratulated both candidates, as well as the people of Afghanistan, ""who courageously went to the polls to vote on April 5 and again on June 14, defying Taliban threats to exercise their right to vote and to take their part in advancing democracy in Afghanistan,"" according to a statement. The statement also recognized incumbent President Hamid Karzai for 13 years of ""strong leadership."" The lengthy dispute between Ghani and Abdullah had put off the selection of a successor to Karzai and raised fears of increased instability in the fragile, war-torn country. But the two rivals embraced after signing a deal for a national unity government in a televised ceremony in the capital, Kabul, on Sunday. Under the agreement, Ghani will create by decree the position of chief executive officer for the runner-up. The CEO role will have prime ministerial functions until the constitution can be amended to create a permanent position of prime minister. The deal also calls for the two candidates' teams to share senior government positions equally between them. The political impasse in Afghanistan this year had come as the Taliban continued to mount deadly attacks on high-profile targets and fought fiercely for control of important areas. As the U.S.-led war effort against the militants winds down, most NATO troops are due to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year. 'Three months of squabbling' The presidential election was held on April 5 and was followed by a runoff vote in June after the first round proved inconclusive. The election was aimed at bringing about Afghanistan's first democratic transfer of power, but the accusations of fraud and manipulation put that goal in peril. In July, Abdullah and Ghani had come to an agreement, brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, to accept the result of a nationwide audit and form a unity government. But earlier this month, the two candidates showed signs of backing away from that deal. Kerry described the signing of the deal Sunday as ""a moment of extraordinary statesmanship,"" saying Ghani and Abdullah had ""put the people of Afghanistan first."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the deal ""paves the way for a stable and more prosperous future for the country."" ""The new government will face serious challenges, and I urge the President-elect, the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, and all political actors in Afghanistan to quickly form the government of national unity,"" Ban said in a statement. The State Department statement said that while the audit was able to ""identify fraud that was significant in both scope and sophistication,"" the audit process was unable to resolve all grievances. Nonetheless, the election results are legitimate, and the State Department will support the administration's efforts to make electoral reform a chief priority, the statement said. The White House and the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, Jan Kubis, both expressed support for the new government. But questions remain about how effective the new arrangement is likely to be. ""It took three months of squabbling and political infighting to get to this point,"" Yaroslav Trofimov, the Afghanistan and Pakistan editor of The Wall Street Journal, told CNN. ""It's anybody guess how well they will manage to actually govern together, considering all the bad blood."" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Nana Karikari-apau, Christabelle Fombu and Tom Dunlavey contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The new government will face serious challenges,"" U.N. chief says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Despite protests outside his office and boycott threats, Georgia's governor signed into law Friday one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration measures enacted by an individual state. The measure, which Gov. Nathan Deal inked about a month after it cleared the Republican-dominated Georgia Legislature, allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations. HB 87 also imposes prison sentences of up to one year and fines of up to $1,000 for people who knowingly transport illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime. It also asserts that workers convicted of using fake identification to get jobs could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $250,000. ""This legislation is a responsible step forward in the absence of federal action,"" Deal said after the bill signing. ""Illegal immigration places an incredible burden on Georgia taxpayers."" As they have throughout the debate, leaders in the local Latino community railed against the measure. Among them were several dozen people who demonstrated Friday outside the governor's office at the state Capitol, chanting, ""Shame on you."" The legislation drew threats of lawsuits targeting the bill, as well as boycotts aimed at forcing the government's hand. The group Southerners on New Ground is calling for a national boycott of conventions and vacation travel to Georgia, while a blog entry on the website of the group Somos Georgia warned, ""Veto HB 87 or Boycott! It's your choice, Governor Deal!!"" ""This is the beginning of a road that we'll travel that will take a long time,"" Teodoro Maus, president of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, said Friday in Atlanta. Similar efforts have been pursued -- with some success -- targeting other states that have passed legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration. Nonetheless, anti-illegal immigrant bills can still be found from coast to coast. The National Conference of State Legislatures found that, in 2010 alone, more than 1,400 bills were introduced aiming to give individual states more of a role in immigration enforcement. Of those measures, 208 laws were enacted, 10 were vetoed, and 138 resolutions were adopted. The best-known such effort was in Arizona. Among other things, that legislation would have required local law enforcement officers in Arizona to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants. The U.S. Justice Department sued, arguing that only the federal government has that authority. Last month, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Justice Department and against Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed SB 1070 into law last year. Brewer has asked the Supreme Court to lift the court order that is blocking enforcement of parts of the law. Wade Henderson, the head of the advocacy group Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights, blasted what he called Georgia's ""odious piece of legislation."" He said it was a ""copycat"" of the Arizona law and effectively legalizes ""racial profiling."" ""Georgia's lawmakers have not learned from Arizona's mistakes,"" Henderson said Friday in a statement. ""These laws presume everyone is guilty, contradicting the fundamental American presumption that those accused are innocent until proven otherwise."" The Mexican government added Friday that it ""regrets"" Deal's decision to sign the law. ""The legislators and state executive ignored the many contributions of the immigrant community to the economy and society of Georgia,"" the Mexican government said in a statement. But some who support the Georgia legislation -- including Deal and Phil Kent, a spokesman for the conservative group Americans for Immigration Control -- said it is not about discrimination but rather about protecting taxpayers. ""The illegal immigrants in our state have been swamping our hospitals and schools,"" Kent said. ""It's a very expensive proposition. We just want to make sure that people are welcome here and that they come here legally. And then we can cut back on the illegal immigration."" President Barack Obama's administration has opposed such state-specific measures, including fighting them in court, saying that having as many as 50 different immigration policies (one for each state) would be counterproductive from a law enforcement standpoint and damaging from an international relations standpoint. Asked about HB 87 last month by CNN affiliate WSB, Obama defended the federal government's actions. ""The truth on the matter is we've done more on enforcement than any previous administration,"" the president said. ""We have more border patrols; we have had serious crackdowns on employers who are hiring undocumented workers.""","NEW: Mexico says legislators ""ignored the many contributions"" of immigrants .

"(CNN) -- An athlete who didn't even compete at the Commonwealth Games was the star attraction Saturday in Glasgow. It wasn't just any athlete, mind you, but the fastest man in the world in Jamaica's Usain Bolt. Bolt arrived in Glasgow amid a throng of journalists and photographers and it didn't take long for him to deliver his trademark 'lightning Bolt' pose alongside the Games' mascot, Clyde, and local school children. Bolt hasn't raced in 2014 as he recovered from a foot injury but that's set to change as he said he'll take part in the 4x100-meter relay heats that begin Friday. ""I will be running in the heats,"" the world-record holder in the 100 and 200 meters said in a press conference. ""I think I need the (races) because this is my first run of the season. ""The injury is completely gone. Fitness wise, I have done a lot of training over this past month. I have been really pushing myself. ""I think I am in pretty good shape, but I'm not in running shape. That's why I am running the heats."" The six-time Olympic gold medalist won't be involved in any individual races. He added that he was excited to be making his Games debut after missing the 2006 edition with a hamstring injury and deciding to skip the 2010 Games in India because of how close it was to the 2011 World Championships. Bolt plans on being a tourist, too, if only for a little bit, and expects to see a ""lot of rain"" and plenty of kilts in Glasgow. Grandfather ties record . Meanwhile, England's Mick Gault tied a Commonwealth Games record when he claimed an 18th medal by winning the bronze in the 10-meter air pistol. Gault isn't your typical Games participant -- he's a 60-year-old grandfather. He retired due to illness after the 2010 Games but decided to return one last time. ""I just feel good that a 60-year-old can do that, just do what I've done,"" he told BBC television. ""It's one for England, it's one for the sport, it's one for me, one for the wife and kids who have been through an awful lot. ""The wife's insisted this is my last one. Definitely my last one. ""The stress we go through is horrendous, so job done really.""

"(CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul said Friday he doesn't want to ""create panic"" over Ebola, but stood by his belief that the virus is more contagious that the government is letting on. ""I understand people in government not wanting to create panic, and I don't want to create panic, either. But I think it's also a mistake on the other side of the coin to underplay the risk of this,"" the Kentucky Republican told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview to air in full on ""The Situation Room"" at 5 p.m. ET. Last week Paul, an ophthalmologist with a medical degree from Duke, expressed strong skepticism of the Obama administration's handling of Ebola. He called for the government to consider suspending flights to and from Ebola hot zones in Africa. While flight changes have not been implemented, the government is starting to enforce closer screenings of West Africans at five of America's busiest airports. Doubling down on his stance, Paul said he thinks temporary flight suspensions would be practical. ""I mean, if you want to visit your son or daughter and you're coming from Liberia, couldn't you wait a couple of months? I don't think that that is something so -- of such an immediate necessity that the chance for a worldwide contagion, I think it's not unreasonable,"" he said. CDC director on Ebola: 'Only thing like this has been AIDS' President Obama has said the likelihood of an Ebola epidemic in the United States is small, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has maintained that the virus can only be transmitted through bodily fluids. ""The administration has been saying over and over again, 'Oh, this is only transmitted through direct bodily fluids.' They make you think that this is like AIDS and not very contagious. And then in the next statement, they very quietly say, 'Oh, but if you're within three feet of someone, we call that direct contact.' Well I don't think Americans think standing within three feet of someone is direct contact,"" he said. American Ebola survivor not sure of source infection . The CDC defines close contact as being within three feet of a patient for a prolonged period of time, or having direct brief contact, such as shaking hands and hugging. Walking by a person or moving through a hospital does not comprise contact, the CDC says. However, on CNN, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said that if a person had been coughed on or sneezed on by an Ebola patient, medical professionals would want to ""look at that situation very closely."" ""They also say it can't be aerosolized,"" Paul said Friday. ""But the question people should be asking is, 'Can it be transmitted by someone coughing on you?' I think the virus can be suspended in cough particles. They call that direct contact. But I think most Americans would think that's being aerosolized.""

But days later Snyder apologized for appearing in the ad. ""I made a mistake,"" he said at a press conference Saturday after Kansas State's football game against Oklahoma State.

"(CNN) -- We know that Shakira's hips don't lie, but do they corrupt? That's the argument of one politician in her native Colombia who wants to ban the superstar's latest music video for its ""immoral and vulgar"" content. The offending video is for Shakira's new single ""Can't Remember To Forget You,"" a racy production that features Rihanna. Shakira does her trademark hip-shaking and gyrating in the video, but also shares scenes in bed with Rihanna and smoking cigars. Bogota Councilman Marco Fidel Ramirez said the video should be banned from Colombian airwaves because the smoking and the touching in bed violate a law that prohibits broadcast material that damages the ""moral integrity"" of children. ""I found a video that evidently contains images that in my opinion are not useful for the emotional growth and development of youths,"" Ramirez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Wednesday. The councilman wrote a letter to Shakira, appealing to her role as a mother and asking her to remove the video from the Internet and to consider retracting the song altogether. ""I feel it promotes immorality,"" he told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Ramirez took his campaign to social media, distributing a flier on Facebook and Twitter that warns that the video promotes smoking and lesbianism. (In his letter to the singer, Ramirez explains that he believes that a ""normal"" family is comprised of a man and a woman and children). His comments were met with critics who accused him of censorship, but others supported his stance, saying the video goes too far. ""I think the message that Shakira is sending to the youth and children around the world is a message that sells a lifestyle and promotes a particular orientation, that in my opinion, does not reflect the views of most Colombians,"" Ramirez said. In Colombia, Shakira is more than a music star. She is an important advocate and philanthropist who has a foundation to help impoverished children in Colombia and has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. Ramirez calls himself a fan of Shakira, and argues that precisely because of her talent and fame, she doesn't need sex to sell her albums. She has a social responsibility, Ramirez said, to not repeat stereotypes of women in music. Asked if he would back the ban of dozens of other artists who depict sex, smoking or drinking in their music or videos, Ramirez said Shakira's case is different because so many children look up to her. Shakira has not responded to CNN requests for response to the politician's claims.","Shakira's new music video featuring Rihanna is racy .

"(CNN) -- After crashing in the Tour de Suisse and being overlooked by his team for the Tour de France -- he became the first British winner of the race in 2012 -- Bradley Wiggins hoped relief would come at the Commonwealth Games. ""It's given me another focus rather than just lolling about at home feeling miserable,"" he was quoted as saying by The Guardian. Wiggins indeed won a medal Thursday in the first day of action in Glasgow, but it wasn't the one he wanted. Wiggins and his English teammates could only take home silver, behind a rampant Australia, in the 4,000-meter team pursuit final. It means that while he has triumphed in France and won four Olympic golds, he's never stood atop the podium at the Commonwealth Games. But instead of dwelling on the disappointment, Wiggins was already looking ahead to the Olympics in Rio in 2016. ""It's two years to Rio and you can't win all the time,"" he told BBC Television. ""We've had limited preparation. ""That's the reality of it. We'll look back on this in two years with hopefully gold medals around our necks and say this was the start point for us. That's what it's all about. ""It's going to be two years of graft now and it's so different to the road. I can't underestimate how much work it's going to take."" Despite England's runner-up finish, Wiggins enjoyed his time with his teammates. ""It's been brilliant,"" he said. ""I said to the boys, 'It's like being on holiday.' I got to go back to work Monday morning now. ""It's been just a nice break from everything from the road."" The Australian quartet of Jack Bobridge, Luke Davison, Alex Edmondson and Glenn O'Shea set a new Games record, clocking in at three minutes, 54.851 seconds to better England by about six seconds. Murdoch bests Jamieson . As expected, there was a Scottish winner in the pool in the 200-meter breaststroke. What wasn't expected was that it was Ross Murdoch, not Michael Jamieson. Jamieson finished second at London 2012 and said he wanted to set a world record at the Commonwealth Games. But the Glasgow native was slower than Murdoch in the heats and once again in Thursday's final. He narrowly led Murdoch after 100 meters, though Murdoch won comfortably in the end -- by more than a second over his higher profile compatriot. Murdoch established a Games record time of 2.07.30. Earlier Thursday, Scotland's Hannah Miley defended her title in the 400-meter individual medley. She was both ecstatic -- and tired. ""That was just incredible,"" she was quoted as saying by The Scotsman. ""I literally couldn't feel my legs for the last 50 so, when I touched the wall, I was hoping and praying that I could go fast."" Brothers rule in triathlon . It was billed as brother vs. brother in the men's triathlon. They indeed led the way and not for the first time Alistair Brownlee beat younger sibling Jonny to gold. Alistair, who also won gold on home soil at London 2012, finished in 1:48.50, 11 seconds better than Jonny -- the bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics. They were virtually tied entering the final portion of the triathlon, the run, before Alistair broke away. ""This is the goal I wanted to achieve for the season and I've done it now,"" Alistair Brownlee told BBC Television. ""Now I've done everything I've wanted to do in my career. I don't know what to do now. Maybe I should retire,"" he joked. Farah pulls out . England's Mo Farah claimed gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the Olympics in London, making his 'Mobot' celebration a worldwide phenomenon. But Farah won't be achieving the double in track's two longest races at the Commonwealth Games after pulling out due to a lingering stomach illness. He'll continue to train in France and hopes to return in time for the European Championships that begin August 12 in Zurich. ""I have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games,"" Farah told the England Athletics website. ""The sickness I had two weeks ago was a big setback for me. ""Training is getting better here in Font Romeu but I need another few weeks to get back to the level I was at in 2012 & 2013.

"(CNN)  -- A Saudi judge has refused for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man, a relative of the girl told CNN. The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, who was seeking a divorce for her daughter. The relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib Al-Habib, ""stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty."" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled the girl's mother -- who is separated from the girl's father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, according to Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's lawyer. The girl's father, according to the attorney, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is ""a close friend"" of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to al-Habib for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have been petitioning the government to enact laws that would protect children from this type of marriage, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. ""It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,"" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January quoted in the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. ""A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her."" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. ""We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We should know that Sharia law has not brought injustice to women."" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. ""We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,"" Wilcke said. Wilcke explained that while Saudi ministries may make decisions designed to protect children, ""It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."" Last December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. ""The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,"" al-Harithi said. ""Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed."" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to ""keep us backward and in the dark ages."" She said the marriages cause girls to ""lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.""","NEW: Judge said girl could petition ""once she reaches puberty,"" relative tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Want welfare? Pee here. That's the message that a growing number of governors and legislators, mainly Republicans, are sending to their citizens. In statehouse after statehouse, new laws are being proposed and enacted that require recipients of food stamps, welfare, unemployment and other forms of public assistance to be able to pass a drug test first. The idea, say these policymakers, is to ensure that precious tax dollars won't flow to undeserving free-riders with moral failings. Drug tests, they say, will motivate welfare recipients to clean up their acts and make themselves more employable all around. There are so many things wrong with this. For one thing, it's the height of hypocrisy for limited-government conservatives like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who claim they want government out of people's lives, to champion such intrusive, shaming forms of paternalism. Moreover, these programs typically yield rather few cases of actual ""welfare junkies."" More outrageous, though, is the selective morality at work. When politicians say they want to make public assistance conditional on clean drug tests, they don't mean all public assistance to all people. They mean assistance to the poorest among us. And with dog-whistle signals about ""inner-city"" welfare use, they often mean the brownest and blackest of the poorest among us. That's why I find this drug-testing agenda repugnant. Yet it does prompt a thought experiment. Imagine, for a moment, if we took these moralistic politicians at their word. Imagine if we instituted a policy nationwide that required anyone receiving taxpayer assistance to have to prove to the government that he or she is not using drugs. Then imagine if we meant every form of taxpayer assistance. Are you the chief executive of Citigroup or another Wall Street firm that received many billions of dollars in TARP bailout money? Fill this cup, please. And if you subscribe to the belief that corporations are people because a corporation is an association of persons, then every person who works at Citigroup had better get in line, too. After all, we want to make sure that precious tax dollars don't flow to undeserving free-riders with moral failings. But don't worry, testing financiers should motivate them to clean up their acts. But it's not just Wall Street. Do you own a farm that receives federal payments to support the price of your crops? Did your business ever get a tax break to keep it from relocating? Does your factory pay unusually low electricity rates because of a nearby public power project? You must be a drain on the public coffers. Urination-on-demand is now your civic obligation. And of course, it's not just about the 1% or businesses. Our federal latticework of direct subsidies and ""tax expenditures"" touches most of middle-class America. So, imagine being told you must prove you aren't a drug user before you could claim a home mortgage interest deduction. Before your employer-provided health insurance could be considered excludable from taxes. Before you could receive a subsidized interest rate for your college loan. Welfare -- in the form of subsidies, tax breaks and direct payments -- is everywhere. Sometimes submerged, sometimes visible. The point isn't that welfare is presumptively bad (or, for that matter, good). The point is that because it is everywhere, welfare in all its various forms should be treated alike. So, if we want as a nation to attach a moral fitness test to the receipt of other people's money, let's do it across the board. Indeed, let's start with the premise that moral fitness requirements should be progressive â€” that the more welfare you receive, the more stringent and unforgiving the form of testing you should face. Why don't these preening ""welfare reformers"" ever propose that? Ah yes, because that would require actual political courage. Picking on poor citizens who get a few dollars of cash a day to feed themselves or pay the rent -- that's politically cost-free. Poor citizens don't usually vote. Poor citizens aren't usually visible enough to make others share in their suffering. Poor citizens are, in short, the perfect punching bags for elected officials who want to look like they're tough. But here's the thing that is unavoidable. Poor citizens are still citizens. To say the words ""equal citizenship"" with a straight face, we had all better ask ourselves where each of us would be without public assistance.

"London (CNN) -- Wrapped in heavy coats against the November chill, thousands of visitors crowd onto the paths circling the Tower of London to catch a glimpse of the extraordinary ""sea"" of crimson filling the castle's moat below. The blood-red tide which flows from one of the palace's windows and laps at its ancient stone walls is made of hundreds of thousands of individually handcrafted ceramic poppies. Each of the 888,246 blooms in the artwork, ""Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red,"" represents a life lost in World War I -- one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers killed in the conflict that began 100 years ago. And as Britain commemorates Armistice Day in the war's centenary year, the final poppy will be ""planted"" shortly before 11am on November 11, the time at which the armistice was signed, ending the war in 1918. Once the evolving artwork, which began with the planting of the first poppy by Tower of London Yeoman Warder Crawford Butler on July 17, is ""complete"" a lone bugler will play the Last Post, signaling the start of two minutes' silence in memory of the war dead. Less than 24 hours later, the army of thousands of volunteers who helped put it together will sweep in and begin dismantling it, ""picking"" each flower. The poppies will then be checked, cleaned and packed before being shipped to their new owners -- each has been sold, for Â£25 (about $40), to benefit six armed forces charities. But following widespread calls for the hugely popular installation to remain in place longer, even until 2018, leaving them at the Tower for the duration of the WWI anniversary, organizers said two parts of the display would be kept in place until the end of November. The ""weeping window"" and the ""wave"" of poppies across the path leading into the Tower will then be taken on a tour of the UK, before becoming part of the permanent exhibitions at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester. Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), the organization which runs the Tower of London, tweeted: ""We're pleased to confirm that these two major features of the #TowerPoppies will be going on national tour until 2018."" HRP says in excess of 4 million people -- between 60,000 and 70,000 a day -- are expected to have visited the installation by the time it ends. In a statement, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""The poppy display at the Tower of London has in a very short space of time become a much loved and respected monument. ""We want to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to witness it ... By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation."" The HRP spokeswoman told CNN that the display's creators, ceramic artist Paul Cummins and theater designer Tom Piper, had always intended it to be an evolving memorial. ""That was very much part of the artists' intentions, the transient nature of it, as is the idea that it will then be dispersed, that the poppies will find new homes,"" she said. HRP and Transport for London have warned those heading to the Tower to see the poppies in their last days and weeks that there are likely to be large crowds in the area, and that public transport and Tube stations nearby will be far busier than usual. In order to allow more people to experience it, the artwork has been illuminated until midnight each evening. There are reports that some of those who have bought the blooms are trying to cash in on the enormous popularity of the installation by selling their flowers on internet auction site eBay for more than double their original price. An eBay spokesman told Britain's Daily Mail newspaper that such inappropriate listings would be canceled. Cameron praised all of those involved in the ""extraordinary project,"" which he said had ""brought forward from the British public a huge amount of reverence for those who have given their lives and served our country."" ""The numbers going to see this display have been truly extraordinary,"" he said at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament, adding that money raised from the sale of the poppies was likely to fund valuable work by veterans' charities. Poppies have been used as a way of commemorating World War I for decades -- in Britain, thousands of paper flowers are sold for charity each year to be worn in people's lapels. The flowers grew over the battlefields of northern France and Belgium, inspiring one of the most famous poems written about the conflict, by John McCrae: ""In Flanders fields the poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row ...""

"(CNN) -- FIFA and World Cup host nation Brazil are on a collision course over whether alcohol should be served in stadiums during the 2014 finals. Legislation passed by the Brazilian government in 2003 prohibits the sale of all alcohol in football arenas. And with beer company Budweiser one of FIFA's main sponsors for the tournament, this creates a problem for football's world governing body. Will Africa's new stars shine at Cup of Nations? FIFA has been battling for a change in the Brazilian law, with General Secretary Jerome Valcke currently in the South American nation to press for progress on new legislation. However, some members of the Brazilian Congress are campaigning for the law to remain the same, a situation which is complicating arrangements for the month-long soccer showpiece. FIFA beer battle about cash, not game . The situation looks set to rumble on, although FIFA sent CNN a statement saying it believes the law will be changed very soon. ""The selling of beer in stadiums is part of the fan culture and will also be part of the 2014 FIFA World Cup,"" the statement said. ""It is important to note that the sale of alcohol will be limited to beer only as was done at all previous FIFA World Cups. ""We are confident that we will be able to solve the very few open matters and close the chapter of the 2014 Bill by March 2012, so we can then focus on the operational aspects of staging the FIFA Confederations Cup in 18 months from now and then the 2014 FIFA World Cup."" The statement continued: ""At this point let us stress again that our requirements have not changed since 2007 when President Lula signed the government guarantees and are actually the same as we request from any other FIFA World Cup host in past."" Brazilian Minister for Sports Aldo Rebelo echoed FIFA's statement, telling CNN: ""The FIFA World Cup bill is a compromise the country committed to when it was bidding for hosting the event. ""It is important to note Brazil asked to host this event and at the time we agreed with all the requirements. Our goal was to have the bill approved by end of last year, so in terms of law we are not as far ahead as we are in terms of stadiums. ""We need to move on and fasten up and I am confident that by March we can complete this."" The delay in changing the alcohol legislation is not the first time Brazil and FIFA have seemingly been at loggerheads since the five-times World Cup winners were awarded the tournament. The Brazilian government is in dispute with FIFA over the issue of cut-price tickets for senior citizens and students, while FIFA has still not received the assurances it was seeking over sponsors having their trademarks protected.","FIFA and Brazil at loggerheads over the sale of alcohol at 2014 World Cup .
