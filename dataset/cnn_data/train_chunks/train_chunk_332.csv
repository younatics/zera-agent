"(CNN) -- She's been called ""the nightmare nanny"" for refusing to leave the home of the family that hired -- then fired -- her, but now Diane Stretton is speaking out for the first time. And she says she's not a con-artist squatter, she's a victim. ""I didn't get lunch breaks, I didn't get coffee breaks, I didn't get any holidays. Basically, I was working 24/7,"" she told Los Angeles' KNX 1070 news radio. ""They were the ones that were trying to exploit me, as if I was some poor migrant worker from a foreign country that they could just exploit and work 24/7."" The saga began back in March when Marcella Bracamonte hired Stretton as a nanny to take care of her three children and to help out with household chores. But the relationship soured after a few months, and what happened next depends on who you ask. Bracamonte says she fired Stretton, but Stretton says she quit. ""I wasn't fired, unless you can be fired after you quit,"" she said in the radio interview. ""I quit two days before they fired me. And I gave 30 days of notice, which we had agreed to."" CNN reached out to Bracamonte for reaction to Stretton's radio interview but had not heard back Monday evening. However it went down, a California judge sided with Stretton, ruling that the Bracamontes did not terminate the nanny's employment in a legal manner. Stretton refused to leave the Bracamonte home in Upland, about 35 miles east of Los Angeles, and police told the family they couldn't force her out without an eviction notice. Even the Bracamontes' attorney says the ruling was correct by law. ""She has absolutely every right to stay in the house at this time,"" Marc Cohen told CNN. ""Under the law in California (eviction) can take 30 to 45 days."" The family said Stretton threatened to sue if they tried to force her out. CNN discovered that Stretton is on the California's Vexatious Litigant List, a list of people who continually bring legal action, regardless of merit, against others with the sole intention of harassment. CNN found dozens of lawsuits filed by Stretton in California over the years. There were signs Monday night that the impasse was nearing an end. Marcella Bracamonte told CNN's Sara Sidner that Stretton -- who is currently sleeping in her car, while all of her belongings remain inside Bracamontes' home -- offered to move out over the July Fourth weekend. But Bracamonte said that can't happen. ""We're going to a wedding, it has been planned for a year,"" she said. ""My sister is getting married on a cruise ship and we're going.""

"(CNN) -- As millions of Iranians cast their ballots Friday in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iranian-Americans in the U.S. are also turning out in record numbers to vote. Iranian-Americans say they are excited about the election being held in Iran on Friday. ""I am passionate about voting because of my bloodline,"" said 26-year-old Los Angeles, CA resident Shahdad Kelishadi. ""Even though I am not in Iran, my heart never left Iran, and it is my duty to help Iranians in any way possible if it will bring positive results to the country,"" added Kelishadi. From New York to California, there are 41 designated voting locations in cities across the country where Iranians citizens can cast their absentee ballots and participate in this democratic process. In order to vote, Iranian citizens living in the United States or those who are dual citizens must be over the age of 18 and present a valid Iranian passport. Many young people both in and outside of Iran's borders have played an instrumental role in mobilizing masses of Iranians, encouraging them to get involved in the dialogue around Friday's presidential election. ""For most of us, part of our identity is back in Iran. We want to know that we've done something to make a difference,"" said Kiana Karimi, an industrial design student at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, California. And making a difference they are. In addition to using their savvy technical skills to fuel their political enthusiasm on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, young Iranian-Americans are also taking a grassroots approach to reach members of their local Iranian communities. ""E-mails, phone calls, word of mouth. We are contacting people who want to help Iran to come out and vote on Friday,"" said Kelishadi, who is also the publisher of the Middle Eastern magazine ""Coexistence."" Born in Los Angeles, California, Shahdad -- like many other Iranian-Americans who grew up in America -- hopes that with a new president, the international world will begin to look at Iran and Iranians in a more positive light. ""I am passionate to get the word out,"" said Ehsan Zahedani, a 27-year-old UCLA student and president of the organization Iranian Future Leaders. ""It's time to take action and participate actively in the government that makes decisions that affect my life and my image in the world,"" added Zahedani. Events in Iran leading up to the 1979 Islamic Revolution left a professional, personal and political scar on many Iranian-Americans. Three decades later, they are still at a cultural crossroad. While these Iranian-American youth want to express their national pride and hold on to their ancestral heritage, they also seek to redefine their social image apart from the rhetoric of the Islamic Republic of Iran. ""In the 1970s you had a lot of political activism against the shah, by the students who were here in the U.S.. But then after the hostage crisis, the Iranian-American community took an extremely low profile as tensions between the United States and Iran increased,"" said Dr. Trita Parsi, president of the North American Iranian Council. ""It wasn't terribly uncommon that people changed their names to John and Mo and remained extremely low key about their Iranian background,"" said Parsi. Though Iranian-Americans have historically excelled in business, academia and the sciences, they have traditionally shied away from participating in American politics or other civic activities. In 1997, reformist Mohammed Khatami came into power in Iran. He presented a completely different image of Iran, which gave the Iranian-American community hope that perhaps some change was possible. When the Iranian-American community came under scrutiny after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, despite having no ties to the tragedy, many realized that the strategy of keeping a low political profile was backfiring. Since then, there has been a gradually increasing pace of political participation, said Parsi. According to the 2000 Census and other independent surveys, there are an estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans living in the U.S., with the largest concentration -- about 72,000 people -- being in Los Angeles. Other large communities include New York; New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Seattle, Washington; and Houston, Texas. ""What we are witnessing is a sea change in Iranian political culture and political discourse that cannot be ignored if [incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad comes to power, nor should it be too expecting of massive changes if [challenger Mir Hossein] Moussavi comes into power,"" said Dr. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York City. Every four years the Iranian electorate ups the ante, Dabashi said. Should Ahmadinejad be re-elected, he cannot ignore this massive outpouring, defiance, and condemnation of his policies, added Dabashi.  Watch how high turnout could affect the election » . Still, many Iranians living in America remain hopeful that Iranian-American relations can improve under the Obama administration, seeing Friday's election as an opportunity for progress. ""There has been a change in tone by the American government and I think the Iranian government acknowledges this change. I do believe that with President Obama in office, great change could take place in bettering relations,"" said Pouneh Behin, a prospective voter and a recent graduate of UCLA. But not all Iranian-Americans hold the same sentiments. ""I fully respect anyone who wants to vote, but I don't believe in this election, so I am not going to vote,"" said Dr. Ali Nayeri, professor of theoretical physics at the University of California at Irvine. Nayeri identifies himself as a national secularist. His neutral stance should not be mistaken for indifference, he said. But he adds that none of the four candidates -- Ahmadinejad, Moussavi, Mohsen Rezaie or Mehdi Karrubi -- are in a position to make the appropriate transition that Iran needs in moving into the future. ""When it comes to addressing issues such as Iran's nuclear program or Iranian-American relations, I do not expect to see any drastic changes since the majority of the power in the Islamic Republic of Iran rests in the hands of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,"" said Nayeri. As dictated by the Iranian constitution, at any given time the elected president holds roughly 20 percent to 25 percent of the political power, added Nayeri. iReport.com: Moussavi supporters fill Tehran streets . Yet other Iranian-Americans voters say that despite the potential political changes they anticipate seeing in the next four years, the memories of the Iran they grew up in might only remain a dream in their mind's eye. ""The Iranian culture that I remember may not exist there anymore,"" said Dr. Mitra Sioshansi, a retired Chrysler engineer who has hopes of one day visiting Iran after leaving 28 years ago. But Sioshansi, like many other Iranian women, is optimistic that the increasing involvement of women in Iranian politics will be instrumental in initiating a change both internally and abroad.  Watch how women could influence Iran voting » . Whether they decide to vote or not, Iranian-Americans will be anxiously waiting to see where the fate of their country lies after Friday's elections. ""Whatever political position we may have, be it for the Islamic Republic, Moussavi or Ahmadinejad, we have to recognize the extraordinary grassroots origin of this democratic movement,"" said Dabashi. ""We should celebrate it and be happy to have come from a country that is capable of this incessant march toward democratic ideals,"" he added.","Thousands of Iranian-Americans in the U.S. cast their absentee ballots .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hotel operator Wyndham Worldwide will improve its staff training and procedures after authorities cracked down on gang-led child prostitution rings in California hotels, a probe that drew media and activist attention to the chain, a hotel spokesman said Friday. Wyndham is expanding its years-long efforts to fight child sex trafficking by reviewing its operating practices in partnership with the nonprofit ECPAT-USA (Ending Child Prostitution and Trafficking), said Michael Valentino, director of communications for Wyndham Worldwide. Southern California authorities recently completed an 18-month investigation into allegations that three rival Crips gangs collaborated to prostitute girls and women out of California hotels through Internet-arranged meetings. The investigation resulted in an April federal indictment of 38 people, including suspected gang members and the owners of a Wyndham-franchised Travelodge in Oceanside, authorities said. A CNN story in June prompted one activist to lead a 14,000-signature online petition drive on Change.org, an activist platform, demanding that Wyndham reform its business policies. ""As long as human trafficking and exploitation continue to be supported by those profiting from this tragic practice, we believe no member of the travel and tourism industry can ever guarantee these events will not occur in the future,"" Valentino told CNN in an e-mail Friday. ""However, our shared commitment and partnership with organizations like the Polaris Project and ECPAT help play a critical role in increasing awareness and prevention,"" he said. The Polaris Project is a non-profit, non-governmental group combating human trafficking, and Wyndham has given hotel accommodations through the group to victims of human trafficking, Valentino said. One of the world's largest hospitality firms, with 7,380 franchised hotels and vacation ownership resorts, Parsippany, New Jersey-based Wyndham has also become a member of the Code for the Protection of Children in Travel and Tourism, an industry initiative combating child sex abuse that's funded by UNICEF, Valentino said. ""We have also had human rights policies and training at our company for several years, and have been actively collaborating with ECPAT in reviewing and enhancing our training, policies, and procedures to best adhere to the intention and spirit of the code,"" Valentino said. On Thursday, Change.org posted on its website the headline ""Victory! Wyndham Signs Code of Conduct to Prevent Child Sex Trafficking"" and recounted the online petition drive San Diego native Tim Rosner launched after reading the CNN article, which dealt with a child sex trafficking ring at a Wyndham property in his hometown. ""I'm thrilled to see Wyndham take this proactive step to fight child sex trafficking,"" Rosner told Change.org. The petition asked Wyndham to join the child-protection code initiative and to commit to its six criteria for preventing child sex trafficking and child sex tourism at their hotels. Valentino added that ""it's important to note that in recent years, Wyndham Worldwide has worked with ECPAT, Polaris Project, and other organizations in our shared commitment to the safety of all children."" CNN's Traci Tamura and Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report.","Wyndham Worldwide says it is expanding a years-long effort .

"Salida, Colorado (CNN) -- A rodeo cowboy with a bum shoulder, a middle-aged woman who has trouble sleeping and a handful of snowboarders are all crowded around a shiny aluminum trailer on a sunny winter day. Some clutch X-rays, others look around nervously hoping a neighbor won't spot them as they wait in line for a medical marijuana prescription. If this all seems a little weird, you probably don't live in Colorado, where medical marijuana is the new normal. State-sanctioned marijuana dispensaries now outnumber Starbucks in Colorado. But outside Denver and Boulder, few doctors are comfortable dealing with medical marijuana. Now, residents in rural Colorado towns like Salida can see a doctor who are willing to prescribe medical marijuana aboard two shiny aluminum vintage airstream trailers, which have been converted into mobile doctors' offices. The trailers criss-cross the state, providing exams for new patients and access to medical marijuana for those deemed eligible. It's all part of the Medical Marijuana Assistance Program of America, the brainchild of Vincent Palazzotto, a 37-year-old entrepreneur. ""The doctors are the gatekeepers to make sure the patients have access to the medicine,"" he said.  ""We want to be sure no patient is left behind and it starts with the rural communities."" A doctor must first examine would-be patients and, if the physician signs off, the state of Colorado will issue a card allowing these patients to buy marijuana from dispensaries around the state. An exam costs $100, but Palazzotto said he operates on a sliding scale for patients who can't afford to pay the full price. ""Right now our doctors will see 10% of our patients for free and we can provide a 30 to 50% discount to disabled veterans as well as other folks in need in programs like Medicaid and Medicare,"" said Palazzotto. David Faulk, a 52-year-old tree-cutter, is one of those waiting in line to see if he qualifies for a prescription.  He says the ibuprofen he's been using to treat his chronic pain just isn't enough. ""I just hope to deaden the pain and help my quality of life,"" he said. The mobile clinic has saved him a 300-mile round trip drive to Denver, the nearest place where he could find a doctor willing to write a recommendation for medical marijuana. Ten years ago, Colorado voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing for the medical use of marijuana, but it remains against federal law. Two years ago, the Obama administration signaled that it would no longer go after medical marijuana in states that have legalized it. So, like a modern day gold rush, hundreds of marijuana dispensaries have sprung up in storefronts across the state. Once-vacant warehouses now house elaborate growing operations. Medical marijuana is Colorado's 'green rush' Millions of dollars in taxes have been collected and more than 115,000 people have received medical marijuana cards. As the industry grows, Palazzotto -- a former real estate property manager -- said he ""felt like the patient was being lost in all this."" That sentiment was echoed by Dr. Margaret Gedde, one of the doctors with the Medical Marijuana Assistance Program of America who is seeing patients in Salida. She now works exclusively with medical marijuana patients. After just a year of writing medical marijuana recommendations, she already has 1,500 patients. ""In the last couple of years or so I became aware of what was happening with medical marijuana in Colorado and I looked at marijuana as a medication and was very surprised at how beneficial it was,"" she said. But moving into this new industry has been risky for established doctors. They face the potential of being shunned in the medical community and many fear running afoul of federal law. ""It's been very difficult talking about it,"" Gedde said.  ""I don't think my parents even know, so there is a stigma. But I did make a decision that it was important to talk about this so patients have access."" She believes the situation is changing quickly, and soon she thinks medical marijuana will be widely accepted across the country. ""In Colorado it's much [more] accepted and people are learning the benefits. So many people either have a family member or a friend or have heard about it or themselves have a card so there's more understanding here."" Gedde says marijuana is particularly effective at dealing with chronic pain for patients like Faulk. After asking him a series of questions about his pain and examining his MRI, she approves him. He is eager to try some marijuana, and may even try to grown his own. The tree cutter says hopes the drug will ""help me get through my labor everyday with a little less pain and maybe sleep a little better at night."" ""Can't hurt,"" he says, as he climbs back into his battered pickup truck and drives off.","There are more medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado than Starbucks .

"Buchanan, New York (CNN) -- Stepping into the containment dome of Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 is almost surreal. It's like entering a movie set, but instead of walking by wooden props, we're passing through an 11-foot-thick concrete-and-steel wall. This is the nuclear facility that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to shut down, the long-time target of both anti-nuclear and environmental activists, the nuclear power plant that sits only some 25 miles from New York City. Just a strip of yellow tape warning of radioactive danger separates me, my producer Sheila Steffen and cameramen Rod Griola and Ken Borland from white-uniformed technicians who are removing groups of nuclear fuel rods (204 rods are packaged together in each fuel assembly) and inserting new ones, a month-long process that takes place every two years. Armed guards stand behind us, even after we have cleared three levels of tight security and a radiation briefing. Getting into the White House is easier, far easier. Around my neck are two Indian Point security passes and two dosimeters that will measure the amount of radiation I receive: one will be sent for analysis to a laboratory, the other is an electronic-arming dosimeter, a real-time radiation detector set to beep if I were to receive a dose of 100 millirems per hour. (During our radiation briefing we are told a chest x-ray delivers 8 millirems.) A massive 100-ton steel plug hangs from cables. Below, workers surround the nuclear core, which is underwater. They control machinery that delicately moves the fuel assemblies through a water-filled canal connected to the spent fuel pool, where rods filled with uranium pellets cool down for years. There are nearly 50,000 uranium pellets in each fuel assembly collection of rods. Pumps keep water circulating into the pool so it remains at a temperature of 100-degrees Fahrenheit (compared to the 2,100 degrees that nuclear fuel can reach before it would meltdown). So, keeping the power on here is essential to averting disaster. Indian Point receives its power from the same electric grid to which it contributes. If the power goes out -- and it briefly did only three weeks ago due to a utility technician's error -- backup diesel generators kick in to keep the plant functioning. That's exactly what happened during the recent outage. Each of Indian Point's two reactors have three auxiliary diesel generators, and then there are separately located backups to those backups as well as diesel-driven fire pumps that can keep the spent fuel rod pools filled. It's all designed to avoid the kind of catastrophe that occurred at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plant managers spend lots of time thinking about potential emergencies and how to avert them. ""Our plant is designed to handle the worst natural disaster. Our people are trained. We have many layers of redundancy,"" said John Dinelli, director of operations at Indian Point. The plant is built to withstand at least a 6.0-magnitude earthquake, greater than the region has ever experienced, though researchers at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory warn a 7.0 is not out of the realm of possibility since they have determined the plants is built near the intersection of two active seismic zones. ""We believe that we can handle a (magnitude) 7 earthquake,"" said Joseph Pollock, vice president of operations for Entergy, the plant's owner. ""The theoretically highest predicted earthquake in this area would be of a magnitude where our plant design will be able to withstand that and we would be able to respond and shut the plant down in a safe manner."" In truth, Indian Point's operators say, a severe hurricane is a far more likely event, for which they also have extensive contingency plans. During the month-long refueling process at unit No. 3, the containment dome's hatch remains open. To be prepared for a natural hazard -- or even the possibility of an attack -- Indian Point keeps a giant plug sitting on a massive forklift nearby that plant workers can shove into place within 15 minutes to protect the reactor. Such precautions and procedures are part of Entergy's application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year operating license renewal. Unit No. 3's license expires in 2015, unit No. 2 in 2013. (Indian Point shut down its original reactor, No. 1, in 1974). Back inside the dome, after technicians vertically lift a 12-foot fuel assembly from the nuclear core, they turn it horizontally and move it along a water-filled canal to the adjacent building that houses the spent fuel pool where the assembly is positioned in an upright rack for cooling, which takes years. The pool about 40 feet deep, surrounded by 6 feet of concrete on all sides, and it has a greenish tint to it. Workers stand on metal ramps overhead, prepared to accept the next spent fuel assembly. My electronic arming dosimeter registers a .3 millirem, its first detection of radiation. In a locked, plexiglass-enclosed case not far from the pool sit brand new fuel assemblies fresh from Westinghouse, waiting their turn for a swim to the nuclear reactor core. As precise as the underwater operations are, they are not without flaw. In unit No. 2, Indian Point's other active plant, there has been a relatively small leak during refueling that officials say has let out as much as eight gallons of contaminated water a day into the containment dome area. ""We haven't found the exact location of the leak to be able to do the repair and stop it,"" said Pollock. ""We're working with a couple of firms. Right now there's a technique being used in Germany that we're trying to see if it would work here and we're going through that evaluation right now."" Pollock says the leak is neither cause for concern nor a safety hazard since it's within one of the reactor domes. As we leave the spent fuel pool, we hand in both our dosimeters for analysis before stepping into a device that detects if we've picked up any contaminants on our clothing or shoes. I step in, push my chest against the oversized metal detector style contraption, wait an uncomfortably long 30-seconds, then do the same with my back up against the device. My heartbeat slows as I step through the locked security gate and walk back towards the largest part of the nuclear plant: the power-generating room. This is where the steam that's created from the nuclear reactor flows through huge tubes to turn giant turbines that power the generator that produces the electricity Indian Point sends off to the grid. Each plant generates 1,000 megawatts of power, providing as much as 30% of the electricity for New York and Westchester County. Since unit No. 3 is undergoing refueling, workers are busy maintaining and upgrading the turbines and generator. Both Indian Point plants are pressurized water reactors, as opposed to the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, which is a boiling water reactor. Pressurized reactors aren't necessarily safer than boiling water reactors, they just employ a different technique to harness the heat generated by nuclear fission to produce steam. As the nuclear crisis unfolds in Japan, Indian Point officials say they're hoping for details that might help operations here. ""Undoubtedly we will come back with lessons learned to continue to improve our safety margins and increase them even further,"" said Pollack. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is initiating a safety review of Indian Point and all other U.S. nuclear power facilities, as part of its response to the crisis in Japan.","CNN Correspondent Allan Chernoff and his crew go into a nuclear power facility .

"(CNN) -- How much is playing the same video game for a month worth? To an exasperated parent of an obsessed young gamer, probably not much. But to Justin Chavvarria, it's worth a quarter of a million dollars. The former high school pitcher earned $250,000 as winner of the ""MLB 2K13"" Perfect Game Challenge, a nationwide contest pitting virtual hurlers against each other in the popular baseball video game. Chavarria, 21, of Eugene, Oregon, defeated two other players in a single-elimination tournament during festivities surrounding Tuesday's MLB All-Star Game in New York City. The four finalists all threw perfect games in ""MLB 2K13"" during the qualifying month, but Chavarria and the other three were the most perfect. 2K Sports, the publisher of the game, said they verified more than 2,500 perfect games and used an algorithm to rank perfect games based on degree of difficulty and perfection. A perfect game is one in which a winning pitcher records at least 27 consecutive outs -- a full nine innings -- without allowing a runner on base. 'MLB2K12', David Price and the quest for the perfect game . Chavarria said he played the game for about 30 days before finally getting a perfect game that qualified him for the playoffs. His basic strategy, he said, was to use ""the best (available) pitcher against the worst team."" Chavarria got his perfect game with pitcher Kevin Slowey of the light-hitting Miami Marlins. The real Slowey has never had a perfect game or even a no-hitter in his major league career. He is 42-35 in his sixth year in the big leagues. Chavarria, who was a pitcher in high school and for one year in college, said having a pitcher's mentality helped him devise a game plan against the batters. He also thinks having that mind-set gave him an edge as his perfect game reached the later innings. ""Yeah, it really helped a lot, like when to throw pitches in certain counts,"" he told CNN in an interview. ""It is a video game, so you don't have to be a star athlete or a pitcher in the MLB. It helps to have that knowledge ... to know the art of pitching."" MLB pitcher battles cancer, never quits . For the tournament, Chavarria chose the Texas Rangers as his team, despite the fact he says he's a lifetime New York Yankees fan. He said the Rangers ""had a pretty strong lineup for the past couple of years and I felt comfortable with what they gave me."" ""They've got guys who can hit home runs against lefties and righties,"" he said. ""Their pitching is not bad."" After demolishing his opening-round opponent by a 9-3 score, Chavarria was matched up in the final against Brad Holland of Garland, Texas. Holland used the Oakland A's in his attempt to win the prize, but Chavarria's Rangers were too much. ""I hit a two-run home run in the first inning. That was a lot of pressure gone and I didn't have to worry about it as much (after that),"" he said. Chavarria added another home run later in the game, and his pitching kept Holland's A's off balance as he won 3-1. Chavarria, a student at the University of Oregon, said most of his winnings will go toward tuition and other related expenses. But he added, ""I plan to spoil myself a little bit and my dad and some other family members."" For gamers who are thinking about trying for next year's challenge, Chavarria has a bit of advice. ""Just don't give up. I had plenty of times where I thought this was stupid and I ... (was) never going to get it,"" he said. ""Just keep playing. I got mine in the last week. You just never know.""","Justin Chavarria, 21, of Eugene, Oregon, defeated two other players in a tournament .

"Ishinomaki, Japan (CNN) -- For three days, they had been waiting, waiting, waiting. They were high, dry and alive, but their patience, energy and water supplies were running low. Up to 200 people knew they couldn't venture out on their own, marooned in the Ishinomaki office building after the remnants of a massive tsunami swamped the town, as it did many others in northeast Japan. When Japanese military personnel arrived, to whisk them away in boat after boat after boat -- over scores of trips, two to six people at a time -- they finally knew that survival was at hand. Still, many of their hopes and prayers remained unanswered. ""I have no words"" to describe how difficult it has been since last Friday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake, Mutko Chiva said. ""I'm so scared. I am panicked."" Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Monday about 15,000 people have been rescued, according to Japan's Kyodo News Agency. Yet such success stories -- like what happened Monday in Ishinomaki, a city of about 160,000 northeast of the hard-hit city of Sendai -- are becoming increasingly rare, as time, food and water runs out for those stuck in buildings, covered in rubble or otherwise clinging for life. Japanese TV network NHK showed video of one man canvassing the streets on his bicycle, attached to which he'd written a sign with his wife's name. He carried photos of her, showing them to everyone he met in a desperate attempt to find her. A business owner in Iwate Prefecture choked back tears Monday, as he came upon a worker who had survived the tsunami that had consumed his town. He told NHK that he'd located half of his 25 employees by Monday, but couldn't account for the rest. Chiva, the woman in Ishinomaki, knew that most of her co-workers were safe. She had been working alongside them, inside of the office building, when the quake struck Friday afternoon. But having no cell phone service or other means of communication, she did not know what had happened to her parents. In addition to those working inside, more people had trudged through floodwaters or otherwise sought refuge in Chiva's building -- one of the highest in the northeast Japan town though, despite its locations several miles from the shoreline, still within the tsunami's reach. Japanese authorities knew for some time that people were trapped inside, but could not dispatch rescue crews there due to difficulty in reaching the disaster-ravaged area and the scores of other crises competing for help. By Monday, the military began criss-crossing Ishinomaki's streets in dozens of small rowboats and inflatable rafts, the only way to get around given the omnipresent water. One soldier told CNN that the mission of searching for signs of life in his homeland was emotionally challenging, if undoubtedly important. En route, the troops spotted one woman waving a white towel from a second-floor window. She told them she needed water, but didn't want to leave her home. The soldiers yelled to her, ""We'll come and get you later on. Please wait."" Some evacuated from the office building, like Chiva, ended up going to hospitals to check their health after three days of subsisting on dwindling amounts of food and water. Others said they had no desire to go home, right away -- with one man telling CNN he just wanted to go to a ""safe place."" Many survivors in Ishinomaki and other quake- and tsunami-ravaged communities like it around Japan didn't have a choice to go home: More than 450,000 people whose homes were lost or are inaccessible are now in shelters, according to NHK. Still, heading home was a problem for tomorrow. For now, the challenge of making sense of the tragedy and coming to grips with their grief was more than daunting enough. After arriving at a Red Cross shelter, weakened survivors rescued from Ishinomaki were gently placed on stretchers and carried away. NHK showed a civil defense soldier carrying a woman into a room at the shelter. After he gingerly set her down, the woman rose to her feet with some difficulty and bowed to the soldier, telling him that she was all right. She bowed again and then collected herself to briefly tell her story, paraphrased by an NHK interpreter: . ""She had been waiting for help all night, outside. She had been washed away by the wave. ... The moment she opened the door of the house, the water flooded in. ... She grabbed hold of a tree and hung on, hung on for dear life with the water all around her. A ... floor mat floated by, and she grabbed it and held on to that."" As the woman spoke in Japanese, the interpreter's voice trembled in English: ""Her daughter was washed away. She was washed away, and she has not found her."" CNN's Cameron Tankersley, Brian Todd and Justine Redman contributed to this report.","A woman rescued from a Ishinomaki building says, ""I'm so scared -- I am panicked""

"(EW.com) -- Millions of ""Game of Thrones"" fans are feeling sadness, outrage, and, sure, some perverse excitement after watching Sunday's episode titled ""The Rains of Castamere."" But for Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, such reactions to ""The Red Wedding"" are nothing new. Martin has been receiving exclamatory emails about the disastrous Tully-Frey union for more than a decade, ever since he published his Song of Ice and Fire saga's third novel, A Storm of Swords. Below, the author reveals why Robb had to die, gives his reaction to upset readers and spills the scene's horrifying real-life inspiration. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How early in the process of writing the book series did you know you were gonna kill off Robb and Catelyn? George R.R. Martin: I knew it almost from the beginning. Not the first day, but very soon. I've said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do. Since Song of Ice and Fire so often subverts reader expectations and avoids traditional fantasy storytelling structures, should fans have any real hope that this tale will have a happy ending? As The Boy recently said on Thrones, ""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."" I've stated numerous times that I anticipate a bittersweet ending. EW: What sort of reactions have you received from readers over the years about the scene? Extreme. Both positive and negative. That was the hardest scene I've ever had to write. It's two-thirds of the way through the book, but I skipped over it when I came to it. So the entire book was done and there was still that one chapter left. Then I wrote it. It was like murdering two of your children. I try to make the readers feel they've lived the events of the book. Just as you grieve if a friend is killed, you should grieve if a fictional character is killed. You should care. If somebody dies and you just go get more popcorn, it's a superficial experience isn't it? EW: Why do you think it has such a powerful reaction? Robb wasn't one of your ""viewpoint characters"" in the books and Catelyn wasn't really a beloved personality. [Long pause] That's an interesting question. I don't know if I have a good answer. Maybe the way I did it. There's a certain amount of foreboding leading up to it. It's a betrayal. It comes out of left field. It's at a wedding feast. Robb has made his peace and you think the worst is over. Then it comes out of nowhere. There's also secondary characters killed. Then outside hundreds of Stark people are killed. It's not just two people. To me, that Robb and Catelyn are family makes it worse. And Catelyn has suffered so much and lost so many people around her, and she actually thinks she's lost more than she really has (since she doesn't know for sure that Arya, Bran and Rickon are alive). Then this happens. She also has the moment there to plead. There's also her murdering the hostage. He's not a son that Frey particularly values.* So in the end her bluff is empty. And she does. She carries through. There's a certain power to that too. EW: I'm pretty sure I know the answer to this, but: Have you ever regretted the scene? Martin: No. Not as a writer. It's probably the most powerful scene in the books. It cost me some readers, but gained me many more. It's going to be hard for me to watch it [on the show]. It's going to be a tough night. Because I love these characters too. And in a TV show you get to know the actors. You're also ending that relationship with an actor that you have affection for. Richard Madden and Michelle Fairley have done an amazing job. EW: What do you say to readers who are upset about the scene? It depends on what they say. What can you say to someone who says they'll never read your book again? People read books for different reasons. I respect that. Some read for comfort. And some of my former readers have said their life is hard, their mother is sick, their dog died, and they read fiction to escape. They don't want to get hit in the mouth with something horrible. And you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair. We all want that at times. There's a certain vicarious release to that. So I'm not dismissive of people who want that. But that's not the kind of fiction I write, in most cases. It's certainly not what Ice and Fire is. It tries to be more realistic about what life is. It has joy, but it also had pain and fear. I think the best fiction captures life in all its light and darkness. One of my favorite elements of the scene is you introduce this idea of ""salt and bread."" We accept that as readers â€” Okay, in this fantasy world, people don't harm each other once they eat a host's bread and salt in their home. Then you break your own rule. It's like you're smacking the reader upside the head for being so dense â€” ""Of course they're not going to follow that silly rule ALL the time!"" It was stolen from history. Hospitality laws were real in Dark Ages society. A host and guest were not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies. By violating that law, the phrase is, they ""condemn themselves for all time."" EW: What about the Red Wedding itself? Is that based on history too? The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history. One was a case called The Black Dinner. The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan. He reached out to make peace. He offered the young Earl of Douglas safe passage. He came to Edinburgh Castle and had a great feast. Then at the end of the feast, [the king's men] started pounding on a single drum. They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar â€” the symbol of death. And as soon as he saw it, he knew what it meant. They dragged them out and put them to death in the courtyard. The larger instance was the Glencoe Massacre. Clan MacDonald stayed with the Campbell clan overnight and the laws of hospitality supposedly applied. But the Campbells arose and started butchering every MacDonald they could get their hands on. No matter how much I make up, there's stuff in history that's just as bad, or worse. * Changed to one of Frey's young wives in TV version . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The Kentucky Derby resides on a summit of high-society pomp. But with the clink of champagne glasses, the flutter of feather-bedecked sunhats and the drumming clomp of purebred hooves just weeks away, animal rights advocates may have turned over a rock, revealing an alleged equine hell beneath it. Injured horses compete under peak demands, PETA said. It alleges they are doped against the excruciating pain of worn-out joints, hooves with holes and bleeding lungs. Their handling and training are so grueling, prized chargers drop dead before making it to the racetrack, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said. The group targeted one of America's top horse trainers, Steve Asmussen, and his main assistant, Scott Blasi, in a monthslong undercover operation that included video recorded clandestinely. Though the sting singled out the two men, the group said what it found is ""standard practice"" in the horse racing industry, where ""death and injuries are business as usual."" But an attorney representing Asmussen and Blasi said ""the PETA piece is sensationalism."" Ugly video . PETA backs its allegations with a lengthy report and hidden camera video that the activists posted to YouTube on Wednesday. The images of alleged doping are grueling. They are matched by what appears to be incriminating conversations -- laden with profanity -- with workers who appear disgusted by the suffering of the animals. The videos are edited. Racehorses receive so much medication that they are often called ""chemical horses,"" PETA said. Horses in Asmussen's care received a thyroid drug to ""speed up metabolism,"" muscle relaxants, sedatives and the diuretic Lasix to prevent lung bleeds during overexertion, the group alleges. It did not say whether the treatments were legal or customary. But the group said one of Asmussen's primary veterinarians at New York's Saratoga Race Course said ""basically all"" horses trained by Asmussen are given Lasix. PETA has a reputation for a sometimes puritanical approach to animal rights and protection, and it advocates a vegan lifestyle. The group said it has filed 10 complaints against Asmussen and others working with him in Kentucky and New York. Authorities in those two states are taking the allegations seriously. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and the New York State Gaming Commission have opened investigations based on the undercover operation. ""The behavior depicted in the undercover video and supporting materials is disturbing and disgusting,"" said veterinarian Scott Palmer of the Gaming Commission. Animal welfare activists: Horse racing industry needs reform . Reserving comment . Clark Brewster, the attorney representing Asmussen and Blasi, said PETA's effort ""has little to do with true accusation of wrongdoing and everything to do with condemning the horse racing industry as a whole."" ""PETA seems to suggest in some of the videos that somehow the horses were mistreated,"" Brewster said. ""But if you watch the video where claims of anything improper occurred, it was in front of some of the finest equine vets in the industry. It's impossible to blame the trainers."" The attorney also said the group edited the piece ""to show the most sensational parts."" PETA also accused Asmussen of paying less than minimum wage and hiring undocumented workers. Everything that the trainer did is standard practice in the sport and done under veterinarians' guidance, said Brewster. The recordings and allegations tarnish the shine of two of the country's top horse racetracks. PETA said its activist obtained access to Asmussen by going to work for him, and made the recordings from April to August 2013 at the Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky -- the home of the Derby -- and at New York's Saratoga Race Course. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association -- which describes itself as a broad-based coalition of horse racing interests -- notes there aren't yet uniform rules in the sport to regulate the administering of medication, or enforcement of existing rules and laboratory testing, though there is a movement to make such blanket rules. As to Lasix, for example, a report by a Lexington, Kentucky, lab director Richard Sams pointed out several racing commissions had once banned it only to reverse that position in the mid-1990s. The NTRA said there has been ""significant progress"" toward a program that has been or is set to be adopted in 14 states -- including Kentucky and New York -- approving regulated administration of Lasix by third-party veterinarians or technicians. The New York Racing Association, which conducts racing at the Saratoga Race Course, said it was concerned about the allegations brought to the Gaming Commission. ""The New York Racing Association takes the health and well-being of its equine athletes very seriously,"" the group said. ""We pledge to continue to work in partnership with the Gaming Commission and all industry stakeholders to promote the safety, integrity and transparency of our racing."" Churchill Downs issued a statement expressing concerns about the health of horses. ""This has always been a topic of great importance to us, and we've made long-term and far-reaching commitments to incorporate health and wellness measures for every race, every day,"" it said. The racetrack describes the Kentucky Derby as ""the greatest two minutes in sports."" Former racehorses get a second chance at life .

"(CNN) -- New Kids on the Block singer Jonathan Knight left fans confused and concerned Thursday when he walked off stage in the middle of a concert in New York. According to reports, the five-member boy band was performing a mix of their old hits from the late '80s and early '90s, along with music from their new album, ""10,"" when onlookers noticed that Knight seemed out of place. HollywoodLife.com's Emily Longeretta was in the front row, and wrote on the celebrity website that Knight ""seemed out of it. While the men started their choreographed dances, Jonathan stood uncomfortably in the background -- actually just standing and texting on his phone during the performance."" Billboard.com also reported that Knight seemed ""visibly out of sync."" He didn't join in when NKOTB got fans' arms waving with the memorable 1989 single ""Hangin' Tough,"" and kept to the back of the stage as the other members worked to entertain the crowd. The other members -- Knight's brother, Jordan, plus Danny Wood, Joey McIntyre and Donnie Wahlberg -- put their arms around him for support. Yet when Jordan said his brother was going to sing ""Survive You"" from ""10,"" Knight made an attempt at the song, and then walked off the stage. The rest of NKOTB went on singing as fans chanted for Knight's return, but he never came back. The singer has been vocal in the past about his struggle with anxiety, prompting speculation that that's what he was facing Thursday night. On his Twitter account, Knight appeared to give fans a simple apology, tweeting ""I'm sorry......"" on Thursday evening. Earlier that day, he posted the hashtag ""I feel naked,"" perhaps indicating his state. NKOTB, one of the heartthrob boy bands of the late '80s and early '90s, came off a lengthy hiatus in 2008, and have issued two albums since then. They're also slated to go on a tour this summer with 98 Degrees and Boyz II Men, and Jonathan's performance Thursday had some questioning how many members of the group would make it. But Wahlberg, for one, seemed unruffled. ""To recap,"" he tweeted after the New York event. ""Joe was especially dazzling! Jordan was especially amazing!

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a good idea back in 2008, in the final days of the Bush administration. With almost no opposition, Congress passed a new law to protect immigrant children from sex traffickers trying to bring them to the United States. It required judges to hold hearings for youngsters from countries other than neighboring Mexico and Canada, preventing them from possibly getting turned away at the border. More than five years later, though, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Action Act is having unintended consequences. It contributes to the surge of child migrants from Central America overwhelming the U.S. immigration system. Now some in Congress want to change the law -- a possibility that could bring more unintended consequences. How did a law aimed at sex traffickers play a role in Central American kids coming here? A desire to crack down on the global child slave trade led to the law named for a 19th Century British abolitionist. President George W. Bush signed it the month before he left the White House. It ensured that children who came to the United States got a full immigration hearing instead of being turned away or sent back. The goal of the hearing? To determine if the children had a valid claim for asylum. Here's the catch: The immigration courts are so backlogged that it can take years for a child's hearing date to come around. As they wait, most stay with relatives or friends already in the country, attend school and generally go about their lives. It didn't take long for word to spread to families in Central America: Send the kids, and they'll end up in immigration limbo with little threat of deportation -- all the while getting a decent education. Not in my backyard: Communities protest surge of immigrant kids . Why does it take so long for a hearing? One reason is that Congress has failed to provide enough money for timely hearings, noted Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications and public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute, an independent non-profit. From 2002-2013, Congress increased spending on immigration enforcement by 300%, compared with a 70% increase for the immigration courts, she said. Now the average wait for a hearing is well over a year -- and federal agents have too many cases to chase after everyone who skips a court date. What else is behind the wave of children from Central America? Rampant gang crime and faltering economies in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have pushed a growing number of people to want to leave, especially those with relatives in the United States, the Migration Policy Institute says. Sophisticated smuggling rings flourish with promises to take children through Mexico and across the border into the United States -- even if it takes more than one attempt. Their fee: Several thousand dollars at least. Then in 2012, President Barack Obama's administration stopped deporting some children living illegally in the United States. It was part of a broader effort to overhaul the immigration system that has stalled due to Republican opposition. The policy change applied only to those who had been in the country at least five years, but the smugglers ignored that nuance in their sales pitch. How many children are we talking about? The government says up to 90,000 children will arrive on their own this year, compared with about 39,000 the Border Patrol detained last year. According to Border Patrol statistics, 98% of them come from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The statistics show the influx from Mexico dropped dramatically in the past two years, while the flow from the other three rose. Poll: Most give Obama, GOP in Congress, thumbs down on border crisis . What happens when the kids get here? The goal is to enter the U.S. immigration system, so many approach border patrol agents to get taken into custody when crossing the Rio Grande Valley into Texas from Mexico. If from Mexico, they can be turned back -- what is called a voluntary repatriation -- after an initial screening at the border. All others get held by the Border Patrol for up to three days, then must be turned over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services. During the process, some get bused or flown to holding facilities in other states, leading to protests by local residents unhappy that the immigrants are coming to their town. According to the Migration Policy Institute, 90% of those turned over to the ORR eventually get released into the care of a parent, relative or family friend while they await an immigration hearing. Stories from a desert bus station . Can the 2008 law be changed to help fix the problem? Maybe. Republicans and some Democrats want to change it so all child migrants can be sent back without a full immigration hearing, like those from neighboring Mexico and Canada. Democratic leaders oppose revising the law, saying the government can speed up immigration hearings without any changes. Congress: 12 work days to compromise on border crisis . A plan unveiled Tuesday by two Texas legislators -- Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar -- sought a middle ground. It would stop requiring hearings but allow children to request one, which would have to take place within 72 hours. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada told reporters the proposal was ""too broad,"" adding ""it does more than just address the border problem."" What's the hangup? Another Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said children at immigration hearings must have legal representation. The Cornyn-Cuellar proposal lacks such a requirement, but relies on existing law that calls for the government to seek free legal counsel for the youngsters. Cornyn warned that would prolong the hearing process to ""serve the goal of some of the people who want to come because it would be years before they were ever deported."" The White House says it is open to any formulation that speeds up the process while respecting the rights of the children. What is the government doing about this? Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to deal with the problem, including $1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children in government custody. Another $1.6 billion would bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers, and $300 million would help Mexico and the three Central American governments discourage parents from paying smugglers to get their children to the United States. So far, Republicans are balking at Obama's request, saying they will come up with a smaller plan, including changes to the 2008 law. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday it sent about 40 recent arrivals -- including adults and children -- back to their home country of Honduras. It said more removals to the three Central American nations were expected soon. What if Congress doesn't act? The Obama administration says it will seek ways for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to speed up removals under the existing law. It has transferred resources from other parts of the immigration system to better handle the surge, with a goal of quicker hearings for the children. Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute said faster hearings would resolve cases before the kids get turned over to family or friends in the United States, eliminating a major incentive for coming in the first place.

"Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Police are investigating whether the shootings of five African-Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma, were a hate crime after the weekend arrests of two white suspects in the case, local authorities said Sunday. Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, are scheduled to be arraigned Monday morning. Tulsa police arrested them early Sunday after a series of tips that led investigators to England's burned pickup, a vehicle that matched a description reported at the crime scenes, according to their arrest reports. The shootings left three dead and two wounded. Both suspects are charged with three counts of murder and two counts of shooting with intent to kill, police said. ""We're going to explore any possible motives,"" Police Chief Chuck Jordan told reporters Sunday afternoon. But he said the investigation was still going on, and Jim Finch, the head of the FBI's Oklahoma office, said Sunday that it was ""premature"" to talk about hate crimes. ""We have yet to analyze all the information to understand the motivations of these subjects in this case,"" Finch said. England had written a racial slur on his Facebook page in a post marking the anniversary of his father's 2010 killing. But the entry also noted his girlfriend's recent suicide, and a man at England's home told CNN, ""You don't know what this family's been through."" The shootings began about 1 a.m. Friday in predominantly black neighborhoods in north Tulsa. The first victim, 49-year-old Dannaer Fields, died at a hospital. Two others were shot just three minutes later, but survived and were released from the hospital Sunday, Jordan said. Another person was shot and killed about 2 a.m., while the third victim was found around 8 a.m. next to a funeral home. Jordan identified the other two victims as William Allen and Bobby Clark. Investigators have found a weapon they believe was involved the case, said Tulsa Police Maj. Walter Evans, who led the task force assembled to probe the shootings. But he said investigators did not yet know which of the suspects may have fired the fatal shots. Nor was the relationship between England and Watts clear Sunday. Evans said they were not related, describing them only as ""associates."" Police put out an appeal for tips over the weekend, and there was an ""outpouring"" after a Saturday afternoon news conference, Evans said. Those tips led to England, with one reporting that he was planning to burn a white pickup truck that had been identified at the shooting scenes, according to the arrest reports. Police found the burned vehicle, registered to England, on Saturday evening, leading them to put him under surveillance and get warrants to arrest him and search his home. England and Watts were arrested a few blocks away from England's residence shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday, according to the reports. ""In my 23 years of law enforcement, I don't think I've ever seen any crime as heinous as this,"" Evans said. ""But at the same time, I don't think I've seen such an outpouring of support and cooperation from the community."" Police reports listed the same address for England and Watts, a home in a rural area on the northern outskirts of Tulsa. An arriving couple who identified themselves only as England's relatives said England's father had been shot to death in April 2010, and England had been left to care for his 6-month-old child after his girlfriend shot and killed herself in front of him a few months ago. ""His mind couldn't take it anymore, I guess,"" the man who called himself England's uncle told CNN, adding, ""I guess it just snapped his mind."" Earlier, others at the home hurled abuse at a CNN crew that approached the driveway. One of England's neighbors, 83-year-old Synita Bowers, said England ""is a very nice young man, very well mannered. ""He would help me over here,"" Bowers said. ""When his dogs turn over my trash cans, he comes and cleans it up -- very nice young man."" But on England's Facebook page, a friend warned him not to ""do anything stupid"" after a Friday night message that read ""It just mite be the time to call it quits."" ""I hate to say it like that but I'm done if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later,"" England wrote. And on Thursday afternoon, he noted that it was the second anniversary of his father's death ""at the hands of a f***ing nigger."" ""It's hard not to go off between that and sheran I'm gone in the head,"" he wrote, referring to his girlfriend. The Facebook page was taken down Sunday afternoon. Authorities would not comment Sunday on any possible link between Friday's shootings and the death of England's father. ""When five black people appear to be shot by a white person, then the immediate reaction is there is a racial component,"" Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett told CNN. ""If that's how the prosecution comes out, we certainly support and will help in any manner, shape or form to bring an end to that point of view."" About 30 representatives from four law enforcement agencies -- the Tulsa police, Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI -- had been working around the clock looking for those responsible for the shootings. News of the arrests came as a relief to residents, many of whom had changed their daily habits since the shooting. ""A lot of people in my community were afraid that they couldn't go outside. They didn't know if they could even go to church, didn't know if they could go to the grocery store,"" City Councilman Jack Henderson said. Now, he said, Tulsans ""can feel they are safe"" -- and he said he hoped the cooperation they gave police could encourage others to come forward with information on other still-unsolved killings. ""I get a feeling from my community that there's going to be a better relationship with the Police Department,"" he said. ""The Police Department has shown they can solve crimes, they can solve them fast."" CNN's Ross Levitt, Randi Kaye, Maria P. White, Nick Valencia and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","""We're going to explore any possible motives,"" police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Twice each day, 12-year-old Charlie Bothuell V says in court documents, he was forced to do 100 push-ups, 200 sit-ups and 100 jumping jacks. He told child welfare investigators in Michigan that he'd have to curl a 25-pound weight on each arm and do 5,000 revolutions on an exercise machine, and if he didn't finish in less than an hour, he'd have to do the routine again, according a petition filed in Wayne County court in Michigan this week. The Detroit boy said that he feared being ""in trouble again"" for not completing his work-out routine. Sometimes he couldn't finish because he was in too much pain, he said. Charlie made national news in June when his father Charlie Bothuell IV said his son went missing for 11 days, prompting a search that involved the FBI and that ended bizarrely when the child turned up barricaded in the father's basement. The father was talking live on air with HLN's Nancy Grace when he learned that state police had discovered his son, appearing shocked when Grace told him that she'd just received breaking news about it. On her show, the elder Bothuell became visibly upset. He started breathing hard and clutching at his chest, and told Grace that he had no idea how his son could have been in the basement. ""I checked my basement. The FBI checked my basement. The police checked my basement,"" he said on air. ""My wife checked my basement. I've been down there several times. We've all been checking."" Bothuell added that his home has been searched repeatedly by law enforcement trying to find his son. Police and the FBI also have said they searched several times and didn't see the boy and now indicate he might have moved during the 11 days -- they won't say yet specifically what their investigation revealed. 'Never seen anything quite like this' At the time, Detroit Police Chief James Craig reacted to the discovery of the boy with his own disbelief. ""I've never seen anything quite like this,"" Craig told CNN affiliate WXYZ-TV. ""We found him barricaded in the basement, behind boxes and a large ... drum. There's no way he could have erected this makeshift area of concealment."" This week, Detroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody reiterated how surprised police were that the boy turned up in the basement. He told CNN, ""It's possible"" that investigators ""didn't see"" the boy while they searched the home from attic to basement. The department is reviewing its procedures, he added. A petition, signed Monday, and filed in Wayne County juvenile court describes allegations of abuse that the boy says he endured from his father and stepmother, Monique Arnel Dillard-Bothuell. Neither have been charged; in fact, no one has been charged with anything in the case. Blood found on PVC pipe . Wayne County child protective services opened an investigation of the family June 23 as FBI agents were looking into the boy's disappearance. Petitions seeking state custody of Charlie and his younger siblings were filed this week. They say that on June 23, the father ""disclosed physically disciplining Charlie V with a PVC pipe. An FBI search of the home produced the PVC pipe with which Charlie V was disciplined. It was disclosed that blood was found on the pipe."" On June 25, the documents say, the boy was found in the basement of the Bothuell home. He was taken to a hospital and a doctor examined him, finding a ""half circular scar"" on the 12-year-old's chest. The boy said that scar was a ""result of his father driving a PVC pipe into his chest."" The child was ""also observed to have old scars on his buttocks from being hit with the pipe,"" the document states. Boy says he heard authorities searching . Representatives from the state's protective services agency witnessed two forensic interviews of the boy, according to the petitions, including an FBI interview on July 1. Charlie V made numerous allegations, saying that he was disciplined with a PVC pipe to the point that he was too sore to walk or sit and that he'd been punched by his stepmother who, he said, told him, ""I can make you disappear."" The boy said that the stepmother accused him of lying about whether he'd finished his workout, and put him in the basement on June 14. The boy told interviewers that he showered and put on his pajamas for the evening before entering the kitchen where his stepmother was ""very upset regarding the workout,"" the petition states. ""Charlie V reported Mrs. Dillard-Bothuell's voice was angry. Charlie V felt as if he did not have a choice, so he did as he was told,"" it continues. ""Charlie V followed Mrs. Dillard-Bothuell to the basement. She then led Charlie V to the back of the basement"" and gestured to an area along a wall. The boy said that she told him, ""There, back there, go!"" The petition states the boy said he climbed over a drum and that she added boxes to conceal him, and then went upstairs, called his father and said that the boy was missing, that she'd looked ""everywhere"" for him. Police said it was a 55-gallon drum, clarifying the petition's description as a ""5-gallon"" drum. When the stepmother came down to the basement, the petition says, she would approach the area where the boy was and say, ""Shut up, stay quiet and don't say anything no matter what you hear!"" ""Charlie V reported Mrs. Dillard-Bothuell never brought him food, or anything to drink the entire time he was in the basement,"" the petition states. When the house fell silent, he would run upstairs to grab food. The boy told interviewers that he heard authorities come to the house while he was in the basement. The Wayne County prosecutor's office will decide whether criminal charges will be filed but had no public statement Thursday. A hearing was held in the case Thursday but state authorities would not discuss it, citing their regulations in cases involving children. Developments included a psychological evaluation being ordered for the 12-year-old to determine whether his father can have visitation rights, and discussions of petitions on termination of parental rights. Meanwhile, police told CNN that they have no reasons to disbelieve Charlie's claims. Police Sgt. Woody added that full results of the investigation have yet to be released. Efforts to reach Mark Magidson, an attorney for the boy's father and stepmother, were not immediately successful Thursday afternoon. And police were not commenting on the boy's whereabouts beyond telling CNN that he is living with a relative for the time being. Another hearing is scheduled for July 17.

"(CNN) -- Neil Kookoothe watched quietly as the state of Ohio killed James Filiaggi. Kookoothe, a witness during Filiaggi's 2007 execution, saw the condemned man's face turn beet red as lethal fluid ran through his veins. Beads of sweat glistened on his forehead. Strapped to a table, his chest and stomach heaved three or four times, Kookoothe recalled. Then, at age 41, Filiaggi was gone. ""It's surreal when you know that the state is killing him,"" said Kookoothe, a Roman Catholic priest who counseled Filiaggi in the months before he was executed for killing his ex-wife. ""Jimmy was ready to die."" Over the past 18 years, Kookoothe has witnessed executions of two inmates he counseled on Ohio's death row. He has become a student of state-sanctioned death. The death penalty is entering a crucial period of national scrutiny, Kookoothe said, which may shape its future. ""It's a critical moment,"" he said. Although the number of U.S. death row inmates stands at about 3,100, executions dipped nearly 10% last year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. In the past six years, six states have ended capital punishment, according to the center. The tide of opposition to the death penalty has been rising in the United States for two decades, according to Gallup. Polls show the percentage of respondents opposed to it has more than doubled from 16% in 1994 to 35% in October. Kookoothe views capital punishment through a unique lens. He's seen it up close as a priest, but he also has the perspective of a nurse and attorney. After graduating with a communications degree in the early 1980s, Kookoothe felt drawn to the priesthood. Instead, he ended up at nursing school, later working as a licensed nurse at a Toledo, Ohio, hospital intensive care unit. ""You saw traumas, gunshot wounds and stabbings,"" he said. While nursing during the day, he put himself through law school, eventually moving on to work briefly as an attorney in Indiana. But the priesthood kept calling. ""It was always in the back of my mind,"" he said. He eventually settled on a life in the church, graduating from seminary school. The three disciplines served Kookoothe well in the remarkable case of death row inmate Joe D'Ambrosio. In 1988, D'Ambrosio, an Army veteran, was arrested in the stabbing death of 19-year-old Anthony Klann. He was charged with felony murder. A co-defendant in the case, Eddie Espinoza, agreed to be the prosecution's star witness. According to court documents, Espinoza testified that he, D'Ambrosio and a man named Thomas Michael Keenan, had forced Klann into their truck and demanded that he help them find a mutual acquaintance named Paul ""Stoney"" Lewis, who had allegedly stolen drugs from them. Espinoza testified that, when they couldn't find Lewis, Keenan slit Klann's throat and D'Ambrosio then stabbed him to death in a Cleveland creek. Read Espinoza's police statement . D'Ambrosio, Kookoothe said, had no previous criminal record. He had neither an alibi nor motive. He told Kookoothe he was home alone sleeping at the time of Klann's killing. A three-judge panel convicted D'Ambrosio and sentenced him to death. As D'Ambrosio languished on death row during the appeal process, Kookoothe agreed to look at his case. The priest saw a red flag, informed by his medical training. He was stunned to learn that Klann's knife wounds were inconsistent with Espinoza's story that Klann screamed after his throat was cut. ""If this is wrong, what else might be wrong?"" Kookoothe thought at the time. Read Klann's autopsy report . Kookoothe got a local newspaper reporter, Martin Kuz, interested in the case. Klann's father told Kuz that, shortly before his son's death, Klann had been subpoenaed in a rape case. Kuz told Kookoothe what he had learned. That's when Kookoothe's legal training came in handy. Kookoothe pored through case files looking for information about the rape case. His search revealed a stunning fact: the man accused in the rape case for which Klann had been subpoenaed to testify was Paul ""Stoney"" Lewis, the same man Espinoza said they were looking for the night of the murder. The priest felt like his heart had dropped into his stomach. ""The adrenaline started flowing,"" he said. ""I'm thinking there's no motive for Joe at all. ..."" A U.S. Appeals Court opinion said prosecutors ""failed to disclose that Lewis was being investigated, and had earlier been indicted, for a rape to which Klann was a witness."" A man named Christopher Longenecker testified in 2004 that Lewis raped him shortly before Klann's murder. Immediately after the alleged rape, Klann walked in on the two men, which gave Longenecker a chance to escape, Longenecker testified. Longenecker didn't tell Klann he had just been raped, according to Longenecker. However, Longenecker said Klann knew he was upset. Longenecker told Klann that ""something had just happened,"" according to the testimony. Longenecker testified he suspected Klann understood what had happened. Later, Longenecker was subpoenaed to testify against Lewis in his rape trial, according to court documents, but Longenecker misread the subpoena and missed the trial date. As a result, the rape indictment against Lewis was dismissed. If Longenecker's story had been introduced as evidence in D'Ambrosio's trial, it ""would have ... increased a reasonable juror's doubt of D'Ambrosio's guilt,"" the court wrote. Kookoothe had connected legal dots that pointed suspicion away from D'Ambrosio. It blew the case wide open. During the trial, prosecutors hadn't shared this information with D'Ambrosio's lawyers, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals. ""I didn't see any connection"" between the rape case and D'Ambrosio's case, trial prosecutor Carmen Marino told CNN's ""Death Row Stories."" It's unlikely ""someone would murder another witness to keep them from testifying."" Read the opinion by the 6th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals . Prosecutors also failed to share the opinion of veteran homicide detectives who disputed Espinoza's story, saying Klann was killed somewhere else and his body was dumped in the creek. Read an affidavit from one of the detectives . Both these revelations gave D'Ambrosio's lawyers much of the ammunition they needed to win his freedom after two decades on death row. ""There's never been a formal complaint filed against Mr. Marino,"" said Scott Drexel, disciplinary counsel for the Supreme Court of Ohio, which oversees grievances against judges and lawyers. But the court did cite Marino for alleged ""misconduct"" during a trial against D'Ambrosio's co-defendant, Thomas Michael Keenan. In front of jurors, Marino ""stabbed a large knife into a counsel table"" prompting the court to conclude ""... the prosecutor's pattern of misconduct throughout much of the trial and during closing argument did deprive [Keenan] of a fair trial."" D'Ambrosio's case triggered calls for Ohio to adopt so-called open discovery laws to force prosecutors to share much more case information with defense attorneys. New legislation went into effect in 2010. ""Many exonerations of prisoners on death row and elsewhere have happened because prosecutors failed to disclose important evidence to the defense,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""Open discovery would prevent those problems from happening and preserve the chance for a fair trial in the first place."" The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers lists 14 states as having the ""least discovery in the nation."" They are New York, Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming and Virginia. But there may be a dark side to open discovery laws. Criminals might use the information from prosecutors to learn the identities of their accusers, and then intimidate them before they testify. In Oregon, Clatsop County District Attorney Joshua Marquis supports open discovery laws while admitting their drawbacks. Marquis, a member of the National District Attorneys Association board of directors and a former member of the American Bar Association's Criminal Justice Section Leadership Council, sometimes asks judges to allow blacking out — or redacting — of personal information contained in disclosed files. But redacting personal data, such as witness addresses, can cause problems, too, Marquis said. What if an attorney needs an address to track down a witness for a pretrial interview or to run a background check? In that case, he said, the attorney is out of luck. In Ohio, Joe D'Ambrosio ""was the poster child case for open discovery,"" said Kookoothe. Such laws, he said, would force prosecutors to focus less on winning and losing. ""The issue is not about winning — but about truth-seeking and justice,"" Kookoothe said. ""Open discovery should be the norm in every case, everywhere."" Marquis has a less idealistic point of view. ""Not to disparage defense attorneys,"" he said, but a defense attorney's ""job is not to seek the truth. Their job is to seek the acquittal of their client."" Marquis asked: What should defense attorneys say if their clients want to read those unrestricted reports? ""We have in our possession, often, information that can be really badly misused."" According to a U.S. Court of Appeals opinion, if D'Ambrosio's defense attorneys had gained access to the prosecution's case files during trial, they could have demonstrated enough reasonable doubt to win an acquittal. Instead, D'Ambrosio served two decades in prison under a death sentence. Kookoothe remembered a day in January 2012 when he watched D'Ambrosio clear his final hurdle. A judge had already dismissed all charges against D'Ambrosio. All that was left was waiting to learn whether the U.S. Supreme Court would hear the state's appeal. Kookoothe and D'Ambrosio sat together, ready to live blog their news from an open laptop. Finally, the highest court in the land announced its decision: The justices refused to consider the state's appeal. ""'It's over. It is OVER, Joe,"" Kookoothe remembered saying. ""There is no more appeal, there is no other place to take this. There's no place they can go. You are done. You're free."" ""That,"" Kookoothe said, ""was a great day."" Should more states require prosecutors to share all case files with defense attorneys? What do you think?

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has signed a law that specifically bans so-called ""crush videos"" -- depictions of small animals being tortured to death by humans. The legislation came in response to a Supreme Court ruling this year striking down a broader congressional law dealing with animal cruelty. The Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act criminalizes the creation, sale, and marketing of these specific kinds of videos, which lawmakers had labeled as ""obscene."" Penalties of up to seven years in prison would be possible. The videos mostly depict women -- with their faces unseen -- stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. The videos apparently satisfy a sexual fetish for those who produce and watch them, said animal rights activists who supported the new bill. ""By cracking down on the creation and distribution of crush videos, this bipartisan law effectively protects both animals and free speech,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, one of the co-sponsors of the bill. Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, and Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, also helped draft the legislation. Supporters said the high court ruling opened the door for Congress to craft a ""narrowly tailored"" bill aimed at banning this specific type of commercial activity. ""We are thankful that countless animals will now be spared from intentional torture for sick entertainment and profit,"" said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the United States, which has worked for years to stop the mostly underground activity. The justices by an 8-1 margin struck down a broader 1999 federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfighting and other acts of animal cruelty, saying it was an unconstitutional violation of free speech. That specific case dealt with a Virginia man who sold videos of dogs fighting each other at an overseas location. But the lone dissenter, Justice Samuel Alito focused his attention on crush videos. ""The animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain. Our society has long banned such cruelty,"" he said. The courts, he said, have ""erred in second-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals."" Alito at the time predicted mores crush videos would soon flood the underground market, because the ruling has ""the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos."" Lawmakers had promised to craft bills banning those types of videos. It was unclear if further legal challenges would result, following the president signing it into law. When it came to dog-fighting videos, ""The First Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh its costs,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. He concluded Congress had not sufficiently shown ""depictions"" of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection. Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals, and usually handle prosecutions . Several media organizations had supported Robert Stevens -- the man behind the dogfighting videos -- worrying the federal law could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bullfighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. Stevens has defended his dogfighting videos as educational in nature, and has said the confrontations themselves did not violate any state laws since they were taped overseas. The Humane Society, other animal rights groups, and 26 states backed the government's original high court challenge appeal. If that 11-year-old law had been upheld, it would have been only the second time the Supreme Court had identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. There was no immediate criticism of the president's action, but even this new more narrowly written law may face future legal challenges. The crush videos do not specifically depict a sexual act, and so there may be questions over whether the videos are in fact ""obscene,"" at least by traditional legal and social standards. The justices are currently considering a separate case dealing with so-called ""violent"" video games, and a California law that would ban the sale of such material to minors. The high court is being asked to treat violent material -- as defined by the state-- the same as obscene material, when imposing restrictions on their sale.","President Obama signs bill to ban ""crush videos""

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Will it, or won't it, hold? That's the question following word late Monday that Israel and Palestinian factions, including Hamas, agreed to a 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire proposed by Egypt. Even as they agreed to the cease-fire, set to take effect Tuesday morning, both sides appeared suspicious of one another. ""The onus is on Hamas,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said shortly after announcing on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that Israel had accepted the Egyptian proposal. Under the agreement, the cease-fire will begin at 8 a.m. local time, he said. ""We are entering this with our eyes open. ...We have been burnt more than once."" The sentiment was similar from Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan, who told CNN as long as Israel honors the agreement, so will the Palestinians. ""We hope they can take it and be committed to a cease-fire,"" he said. While Egypt has not released details of the cease-fire agreement, Regev said it was the same agreement that Israel accepted and Hamas rejected three weeks ago. News of the cease-fire comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday to finish the military operation to destroy Hamas' network of tunnels. That operation appeared to be close to an end, with Regev saying Israel will ""cease all our ... military activities, all our offensive operations against terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip."" When asked about the tunnels, he said the issue is solving itself. ""It's winding up anyway,"" Regev said. Earlier in the day, the Israel Defense Forces said there were possibly between one and three tunnels left. Mounting death toll . Both sides have been under fire for a mounting death toll in the conflict, now in its fourth week. More than 1,800 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The United Nations has said of those casualties, civilians account for 70% to 80%. Israeli officials have said 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel have died. The United States urged both sides to honor the cease-fire agreement. ""The United States has been steadfast in our insistence on an end to rocket and tunnel attacks against Israel and an end to the suffering of the people of Gaza,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. On Monday, during a short humanitarian ""pause"" in the fighting called by Israel, residents in Gaza flooded the streets to pick up supplies and check on their abandoned homes. Al Saha, the largest open-air market in Gaza City, was bustling with vendors. One man hung clothes for sale from the burned-out carcass of a bus hit a few days ago by Israeli fire power. Cars jammed Gaza's main thoroughfare, but the atmosphere appeared relaxed, and children played in the street. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 18 people were killed in Gaza during the cease-fire, including an 8-year-old in a strike on a house in a refugee camp in Gaza City. That strike also injured 30 people, Palestinian health officials said, and happened after Israel had started the cease-fire. Israel said that strike did not violate the cease-fire because it happened just two minutes into it and the operation had already been in progress. Hamas had not agreed to the Israeli-declared cease-fire, and at least 53 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel on Monday, according to the IDF. Daniel Mansour, a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative in charge of intelligence-gathering in northern Gaza, was targeted and killed before the cease-fire Monday, the IDF said. He had participated in directing rocket attacks toward Israel, the IDF said. Two attacks in Jerusalem . Police in Jerusalem said they foiled what they described as a terror attack when they shot and killed the driver of an earthmover after it overturned a passenger bus. Police said one pedestrian was also killed and the bus driver was injured. There were no passengers on the bus at the time, police said. The driver of the earthmover was identified as 20-year-old Mohammed Jaabis, a Palestinian from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal alMukaber. Footage broadcast by Israel's Channel 10 showed the earthmover still moving as security forces approached. The video appeared to show shots being fired. The incident happened in the Sheikh Jarrah area of central Jerusalem, near the entrance to a Jewish orthodox neighborhood. Hamas praised the attack and said it was ""a natural reaction to the Israeli crimes against civilians"" in Gaza. In another incident, a man on a motorbike opened fire at an Israeli soldier near Hebrew University, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Rescue workers said the Israeli was severely wounded. An eyewitness on Israel Channel 10 said he heard a gunshot and saw ""a soldier holding his chest. He walked a few steps backwards and collapsed."" International condemnation of Israel and Hamas . France is the latest country to condemn the Gaza operation and strikes on U.N.-run shelters in Gaza. ""How many deaths will it take to stop what has to be called the carnage in Gaza?"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius asked in a statement. He said while Israel has a right to total security, ""this right does not justify the killing of children and the slaughter of civilians."" He also said Hamas carries an overwhelming responsibility in this ""macabre gearing which particularly serves extremism."" On Sunday, the United States and the United Nations used the strongest language yet in condemning the strike on a U.N.-run shelter in Gaza, with Washington calling the attack ""disgraceful."" At least nine people at the school, which was being used as a shelter for about 3,000 people, were killed in the shelling. Israel said it is carefully reviewing the attack. The IDF said it targeted three Palestinian Islamic Jihad members riding a motorcycle in the vicinity of the school, but didn't say if the suspected militants were hit.

"(CNN) -- Collections of beautifully shot images of people's passions -- food, fashions, architecture, etc. -- helped make Pinterest a hit. Now Houzz, the interior-design platform, is turning similar photos into extremely popular mobile apps that tap into the home improvement craze. At its core, Houzz is an addictive, never-ending gallery of luscious images of home interiors and exteriors. Its website and apps are popular resources for people who idly dream of redoing their homes or moving into new ones. Home improvement and design, both the real and daydream variety, is a hot industry right now. Just look at the glut of home improvement and house-flipping shows that fill up channels such as HGTV. The home improvement product market is expected to hit $287 billion in 2013, according to the Home Improvement Research Institute. Houzz gently guides people through the process. You begin by looking at bathrooms, graduate to having a scrapbook of dream bathrooms, then read the Houzz tutorials on bathroom renovation and eventually hire someone through its directory or local experts on bathroom renovation. ""Many times people start on the inspiration side but end up taking actions because of that,"" said Houzz founder Adi Tatarko. ""People became very obsessed with it."" Tatarko and her husband, Alon Cohen, were working full time and raising their two children in the Bay Area when they started a home renovation project four years ago. They had difficulty finding professionals and found that contractors too had their own frustrations with customers expecting too much. ""There was lots of miscommunication in the process,"" Tatarko said. The couple started Houzz in 2009 as a side project, but the next year it went from a hobby to a full-fledged business. The Palo Alto, California-based company now has 120 employees, and its iOS app has more than 100,000 five-star reviews in the Apple App Store. Every month, 15 million people search Houzz by room, style or metro area -- more than half through a smartphone or tablet. The company has a library of more than 2 million images. The sheer volume of photos housed in Houzz means you can spend hours drilling down into your particular project, say, ideas for Mediterranean-style storage closets in Austin, Texas. Browsing high-resolution photos is the initial draw. You can save favorites into Ideabooks for later -- for example, a selection of outdoor wall gardens or midcentury modern living room chairs in a particular shade of yellow. But for Houzz, the money comes when people take action. Interior designers, contractors and architects upload many of the images. There are more than 250,000 such professionals active on Houzz. What makes the app more than just pretty pictures is the information that goes with each image. You can click to see the companies and people who worked on a project, ask questions about how they did certain things or where to find furniture or other products. The people who post images are good about providing answers. There also is a directory of professionals with reviews, sort of an Angie's List but with splashier visuals. Going local is a key part of Houzz's business. If you see a dreamy spread in a magazine such as Dwell, the information disclosing who worked on a house is only useful if you live in that area. Houzz shows examples of work from people close enough to hire, divided into 425 metro areas. A Houzz survey (PDF) of 100,000 people found that 84% of respondents were planning to decorate or redecorate, 40% were considering remodeling or building an addition, and 10% were planning on building a custom home. Online tools are an increasingly important resource for the people diving into these projects and the professionals hoping to get their business. Also, 18% of people said they were renovating to incorporate new technologies into their homes. While free to users, Houzz is making money from brand-name partnerships with big companies such as Kohler and Nest, and through a subscription marketing program for professionals. Investors said they are confident the company will be profitable -- it's raised $48.6 million in funding so far. Tatarko said she hopes Houzz will help more people jump from fantasizing about home improvement to picking up a hammer themselves or a phone to reach someone who uses hammers professionally. ""Our homes are a very significant part of our lives,"" she said. ""I think it (home improvement) was just so hard before, so people just stayed away from it.""","Houzz caters to people who like photos of beautiful homes and dream of improvement projects .

Oh my gosh, my mother keeps saying, 'You couldn't have found anybody better than him to marry my daughter.'"" The people he fought with in the 101st Airborne Division told Rose that he knew when to put aside the goofing and focus on fighting. ""When he was over there, he wore a red bandanna,"" she said. ""And (his fellow soldiers) said when he put that red bandanna around his forehead, he meant business. He was a soldier. And they have a picture of him with that red bandanna on, and the title of it is 'The Soldier.'"" The Soldier's last stand, near the Se San River in Cambodia on May 10, 1970, is documented by the Department of Defense: . ""Even though his platoon was ambushed from all sides by a large enemy force, Sabo charged the enemy position, killing several enemy Soldiers. He then assaulted an enemy flanking force, successfully drawing their fire away from friendly Soldiers and ultimately forcing the enemy to retreat. While securing a re-supply of ammunition, an enemy grenade landed nearby. Specialist Sabo picked it up, threw it, and shielded a wounded comrade with his own body -- absorbing the brunt of the blast and saving his comrade's life. ""Although wounded by the grenade blast, Sabo continued to charge the enemy's bunker. After receiving several serious wounds from automatic weapons fire, he crawled toward the enemy emplacement and, when in position, threw a grenade into the bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy fire, but also ended Specialist Sabo's life."" Comments: Who deserves a Medal of Honor? When Obama presents Rose Mary Sabo Brown with the medal on the pale blue ribbon, it will complete a circle that began 42 years ago right after her husband's death. His unit had recommended him for the Medal of Honor, but somehow it didn't happen. A researcher discovered files about Sabo, and now the earlier oversight has been corrected. Transcript: Obama's remarks at Medal of Honor ceremony . For now, Brown is focused on her late husband and the medal he earned more than four decades ago. ""I've never stopped thinking about him,"" she said. ""My heart is filled with pride that you can't even imagine. It will be an honor to share this with anyone who wants to see it."" Are you a veteran? Who was a hero in your unit, or what kind of heroic action have you witnessed? Please share in the comments below.","Spec.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a brief visit Wednesday to Toluca, Mexico, U.S. President Barack Obama will join his two North American counterparts to discuss environmental issues, security, driving economic growth through trade, and job creation. The North American Leaders' Summit, which has come to be known as the ""Three Amigos"" summit, began in 1992 with President George H.W. Bush. Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will visit Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Here are four issues among friends: . 1. Butterflies and oil: While the Keystone XL pipeline continues to cause friction between the United States and Canada, the monarch butterfly is a sore spot in U.S.-Mexico relations. Monarchs migrate to their breeding grounds in Mexico every year, but Mexican farmers are using a harmful pesticide to kill pesky milkweed plants. Monarch caterpillars depend on milkweed during their breeding season in Mexico. Harper is expected to continue pressuring Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico. The two are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting during the one-day summit to focus heavily on environmental and trade issues. 2. Canada cracks down on asylum-seekers: Pena Nieto's administration has complained loudly about Canada's imposing a mandatory visa rule specifically on Mexican travelers in 2009, facing a growing number of refugee cases where claims were denied. Three nations expected to streamline procedures, data . Harper has said he would like to see the rule lifted, but he says Canada has to reform its own backlogged refugee system first. The Mexican government says the visa requirement is invasive and time-consuming, and blames it for a decline in the number of Mexican visitors to Canada. The Canadian Council of Chief Executives has urged the Prime Minister to lift the visa or simplify the process, making it similar to that of the United States. Pena Nieto and Harper signed an agreement on Tuesday that will expand air travel between the two countries. 3. U.S.-Mexican relationship strong but difficult: The relationship between the two countries goes beyond diplomacy -- there are commercial, cultural, and educational ties that account for more than $1.25 billion of trade and roughly 1 million legal border crossings each day. The U.S. has deported more illegal immigrants under Obama than in any previous administration -- 370,000 in 2013 alone, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Border security continues to be a divisive issue with any kind of immigration reform legislation in the United States. 4. Not everyone's happy with NAFTA: There are issues between Canada and Mexico in in the 20-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Harper on Tuesday called it ""a very unbalanced relationship,"" saying trade flow has tilted toward Mexico and his government would like to bring it back into balance. Midterm pressures weigh on 'Three Amigos' summit .

"(CNN) -- Two weeks. Two gut-wrenching, frustrating, mysterious weeks. That's how long it's been since 227 passengers and 12 crew members boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, destined for Beijing. A routine trip, it seemed, to catch up relatives in time for the weekend, start on a work assignment or just get away. Where they got to, still unknown. An exhaustive search -- covering a mind-boggling 2.97 million square miles, which is nearly the size of the continental United States -- has yielded some clues, but no proof of where the Boeing 777 is or definitively what happened to it. The latest, most notable lead revolved around two large objects detected by satellite Sunday floating on waters over 1,400 miles off of Australia's west coast. The first of several Australian military planes, as well as two long-range commercial jets, resumed their search Saturday morning to find any trace of the objects, amid some skepticism that they or ships in the area ever will and, if they do, that whatever they find will be related to the missing aircraft. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday defended the decision to announce the find, saying Australia owes it to families of those missing ""to give them information as soon as it's to hand."" But he didn't make any promises. ""It could just be a container that has fallen off a ship,"" Abbott said during a visit to Papua New Guinea. ""We just don't know."" On Friday, Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's interim transportation minister, tried to reset expectations for a quick resolution to the mystery after the satellite discovery. ""This is going to be a long haul,"" he said. Search intensifies . After tough weather Thursday, conditions improved Friday to allow flight crews to look with their eyes rather than relying all on radar, said John Young, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response manager. ""That's encouraging,"" he said. ""But we have no sightings yet."" The United Kingdom was sending the HMS Echo to aid a growing international flotilla searching the southern Indian Ocean. Australia is sending a ship, the HMAS Success. And Malaysian and Chinese vessels -- including the icebreaker Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, as reported by China's official Xinhua news agency -- are also steaming to join a massive Norwegian cargo ship diverted there Thursday at Australia's request plus a motley collection of merchant ships heading to the search area. The window for finding the objects in the target area could be narrow. Another round of bad weather like the one that hampered the initial day of searching Thursday could rake the area, according to CNN meteorologists. Locator beacons are also an issue. They are designed to sound for at least 16 more days and could continue to go off for a few more after that, according to the company that believes it made the device installed on the missing plane. But the ocean depths in the search area could make finding them very difficult, experts say. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel -- who talked Friday with Hishammuddin, who is also Malaysia's defense minister -- has ordered the Navy and policy experts to look at the availability and usefulness of U.S. military undersea technology to try to find the plane's wreckage and its data recorders, a U.S. military official said. Hishammuddin has put out a call for underwater listening devices called hydrophones to aid the search. Search continues elsewhere . The United States, which has had a P-8 aircraft working out of Perth, Australia, and Navy ships involved in the search, has so far spent $2.5 million on the entire effort, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren said Friday. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said Friday that he's tasked the U.S. space agency to mine its existing satellite data and also try to capture fresh images that might aid in the search. Its satellites can detect objects as small as 98 feet (30 meters). Countries from central Asia to Australia are also engaged in the search along an arc drawn by authorities based on satellite pings received from the plane for hours after it vanished. One arc tracks the southern Indian Ocean zone that's the focus of current attention. The other tracks over parts of Cambodia, Laos, China and into Kazakhstan. Hishammuddin said Friday that Malaysian authorities were awaiting permission from Kazakhstan's government to use the country as a staging area for the northern corridor search. That clearly signals that Malaysian authorities are not giving up on the possibility the plane could still be found far from the focus of current search efforts. ""Obviously, the search now has taken a global perspective,"" Hishammuddin said. More details emerge . At Friday's daily news briefing, Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said authorities knew of news reports that Flight 370's pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, placed a cell phone call shortly before his plane departed. He said they had passed the information to investigators. The significance of the call was unclear. As to other communications, The Telegraph reported Friday it had a transcript documenting 54 minutes of back-and-forth between the cockpit and ground control from taxiing in Kuala Lumpur to the final message of ""All right, good night."" CNN hasn't confirmed that this reported transcript it genuine, and The Telegraph said Malaysia's prime minister said the transcript wouldn't be officially released. The alleged transcript reported by the Telegraph contains seemingly routine conversations about which runway to use and what altitude to fly at. One unexplained element, according to the British newspaper, is a call in which someone in the cockpit stated the aircraft was at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet -- something that had been done just six minutes earlier. Twelve minutes after that comes the ""good night"" message, at a point Flight 370 was being transferred to Vietnam's control. Another wrinkle: Ahmad Jauhari acknowledged the plane was carrying a cargo of lithium-ion batteries, although he didn't specify the volume of the shipment. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used in laptops and cell phones and have been known to explode, although that occurs rarely. They were implicated in the fatal crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai in 2010, and lithium-ion batteries used to power components on Boeing 787s were blamed for fires in those planes. There's no evidence the batteries played a role in the plane's disappearance, and Yahya said they are routine cargo aboard aircraft. ""They are not declared dangerous goods"" he said, adding that they were ""some small batteries, not big batteries."" Deleted files sought . Malaysian authorities say they believe the missing plane was deliberately flown off course on its scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. But they haven't so far found clear evidence to indicate who might have changed the plane's path and why. The pilot and first officer have come under scrutiny, especially in light of information suggesting a sharp turn had been programmed into the plane's flight management system before one of the pilots gave a routine sign-off to Malaysian air traffic controllers. Plus, question marks remain over data authorities say was deleted from the hard drive of a flight simulator found at Zaharie's home. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation told CNN on Thursday that an FBI team is confident it can retrieve at least some of the deleted files. On Friday, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN files were removed closer to the flight's departure than was previously indicated. Malaysia's Hishammuddin had said items were deleted before February 3, but American investigators now say such deletions happened after that date. Law enforcement officials aren't drawing any conclusions about the subsequent deletions -- or the earlier ones -- just two days into reviewing the hard drive substantial contents. It is still not clear, for example, who erased the files, why they did and what was in them. Investigators are also analyzing websites that Zaharie and the first officer, Fariq Ab Hamid, may have visited recently, the official said on the condition of anonymity. Passengers also continue to be investigated. On Friday, Hishammuddin said Ukraine told Malaysia that background checks on its citizens aboard the plane had come back clear. Families frustrated . The length of the search and the lack of concrete information has angered many family members. Some have accused Malaysian officials of withholding details, or at the very least failing to update them. For the first time since the plane disappeared, Malaysia sent a high-level delegation to Beijing to brief relatives who had opted not to travel to Malaysia to wait out the search. Hishammuddin said the 3Â½-hour meeting went as well as could be expected, but,""Although we answered most of the questions they raised, we could not answer them all,"" he said. ""The one question that they really want to know is the answer to which we do not have,"" he said, ""which is: 'Where are their loved ones, and where is the airplane?'"" Passengers' relatives in Kuala Lumpur were moved from the Cyberview Hotel to another, unspecified hotel because the Cyberview is booked for the upcoming Malaysian Grand Prix race, said a hotel official who prefers to remain anonymous because she is not authorized to speak to the media. Selamat Omar, whose son was on board the plane, told CNN's Kate Bolduan the wait for answers has been agonizing. ""I do feel sad, it's been 14 days,"" he said. ""I'm still waiting for answers from the government. The sadness is still there, but I'm just going to stay strong."" Omar's son, Khairul Amri, has attracted the attention of authorities because of his experience as a flight engineer. Omar said authorities have not contacted him and he is confident his son had nothing to do with the plane's disappearance. What can we tell from fresh leads?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two years after Demi Moore announced she wanted to end her marriage to Ashton Kutcher, their union is legally undone. Kutcher's lawyer filed the document in Los Angeles County Superior Court Tuesday making their final divorce settlement official, according to a court spokeswoman. Kutcher, 35, filed the divorce petition last January -- citing irreconcilable differences -- but Moore, 51, made it clear in November 2011 that the marriage was over. ""It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,"" Moore said in her announcement. Kutcher has been dating his former ""That '70s Show"" co-star Mila Kunis since early 2012, although she initially denied a romantic relationship. He is one of television's best paid performers thanks to the gig he got on CBS' ""Two and a Half Men"" after Charlie Sheen's implosion. Moore and Kutcher began dating in 2003 and married in September 2005 despite a 15-year age difference. In the wake of Moore's announcement of their split two years ago, Kutcher tweeted: ""I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and Light, AK"" The separation, however, came amid reports that Kutcher cheated on his wife on the night of their wedding anniversary. ""As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life,"" she said at the time. ""This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation."" This is Kutcher's first divorce, but the third time for Moore. She was previously married to actor Bruce Willis and rock musician Freddy Moore. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Kutcher's lawyer filed the final divorce settlement Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It's that combination again: Justin Bieber, an automobile, and a mishap. The singer-heartthrob was reportedly involved in an accident in Los Angeles on Monday night involving a pedestrian. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, officers responded to a collision at 8800 Sunset Blvd., in the famed Sunset Strip area of the city. According to TMZ, as Bieber, 19, was leaving a local comedy club with rapper Lil Twist, his Ferrari was surrounded by paparazzi, one of whom got pinned between Bieber's car and another vehicle. A preliminary investigation showed that no crime was involved, the LAPD's Lt. Craig Valenzuela said. He noted that there may have been initial concern that it was a hit-and-run, but preliminary investigations indicated it was not. The pedestrian, who was unidentified, sustained some injuries but they were not life-threatening. This isn't the first time the singer has had driving troubles. Last month police twice responded to reports that Bieber was speeding around his gated Southern California community. Last July, he was involved in a high-speed chase with paparazzi on an LA freeway. And in November he was cited for making an unsafe left turn and having an expired registration. On New Year's Day, the Ferrari was involved in an incident in which a photographer was run over and killed while crossing a busy street after taking pictures of the vehicle. Bieber was not present at the time. A representative for Bieber had no immediate comment on the most recent incident.","Pedestrian injured in incident with Justin Bieber .

"(CNN) -- Three men were sentenced to death Friday for the gang rapes of two women in the Indian city of Mumbai last year, public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said. The men -- Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim and Salim Ansari -- were sentenced to die under an amended Indian law that sets death as the maximum sentence if convicted of more than one sexual assault, according to Nikam. The three were found guilty of gang-raping a telephone operator a month before attacking a photojournalist in a deserted Mumbai mill in August. Five people, including a young boy, were involved in the photojournalist rape case, Nikam said. One of them has been sentenced to life in prison, while the youngest is facing a trial before a juvenile justice board. Those convicted can appeal their sentences to a higher court. Violent crimes against women have been in the spotlight in India since a 23-year-old woman was raped and beaten by several men on a bus in December 2012. The victim later died in a Singapore hospital. The shocking attack provoked outrage across India, leading to calls for improved safety and treatment of women. Since then, the Indian media have intensified their focus on rape cases. Attacks against foreign women have also been reported. The 2012 case prompted lawmakers to change statutes to fast-track the arrest and questioning of anyone implicated in a rape.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities in Mexico revealed additional details Tuesday about an accused American-born drug kingpin detained Monday who they say moved tons of cocaine into the United States. Masked security forces in black uniforms and helmets, rifles in hand, escorted Edgar Valdez Villarreal and some of his accused associates before news reporters and photographers during a news conference Tuesday morning. Valdez is known as ""La Barbie"" because of his blue eyes and fair complexion, but investigators have described him as one of the most ruthless drug traffickers in Mexico. ""The capture of Valdez Villarreal is a high-impact blow against organized crime,"" said Alejandro Poire, a spokesman for Mexico's president on security issues. ""This is an important step in the national security strategy."" Valdez was responsible for smuggling about a ton of cocaine a month into the United States, authorities said Tuesday. They also displayed automatic rifles, ammunition and bags believed to contain drugs -- items they said police seized as they arrested him Monday. Authorities said they're continuing to investigate to try to learn more about Valdez's organization. Investigators arrested six people along with Valdez -- four men and two women, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The six provided logistical help to Valdez in Mexico's Federal District, which includes the capital, Mexico City. Police recovered automatic weapons, nine packets of cocaine and three vehicles in the arrest, Notimex reported. Authorities identified the six who were arrested with Valdez as Maricela Reyes Lozada, 40; Juan Antonio Lopez Reyes, 26; Maritzel Lopez Reyes, 18; Mauricio Lopez Reyes, 25; Arturo Ivan Arroyo, 26, and Jorge Valentin Landa Coronado, 28, the news agency said. Viviana Macias, a spokeswoman for the federal attorney general's office, said Valdez' capture came after a shootout. The arrest, a high-profile win for Mexican authorities, followed intelligence operations in six Mexican states to determine Valdez's whereabouts, Poire said. He was captured in the state of Mexico, which borders Mexico City. Valdez was allegedly a one-time top lieutenant of Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Valdez later joined the breakaway Beltran Leyva cartel, but the leader of that group, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in a shootout with Mexican officials late last year. Beltran's brother Carlos was arrested, leaving Valdez in a fight to fill a power vacuum in one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels. Lieutenants loyal to the cartel's co-founder deny Valdez is the group's leader, federal police have said. Valdez, thought to be the first U.S.-born cartel leader in Mexico, is accused in the United States of attempting to launder money and conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. He is believed to have played a key role in shipping roughly 100 kilograms of cocaine across the border at Laredo, Texas, every week for much of 2005, U.S. authorities have said. In June, U.S. Justice Department officials offered a $2 million reward for information leading to the capture of the alleged cocaine kingpin. His arrest comes on the heels of another big blow against the drug cartels. Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel Villareal, a principal leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, was killed during a military raid in July. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006, according to government figures. The president is under increasing pressure to show results. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Investigators arrested six people along with U.S.-born Edgar Valdez Villarreal .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a Virginia Tech student who disappeared last month during a Metallica concert asked Wednesday for volunteers to help conduct a community search this weekend. Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old education major, went to the concert at the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia, on October 17. Police said they are continuing to follow leads in the case, but have no new information. ""We will stop at nothing until she is found,"" Harrington's father, Dan Harrington of Roanoke, Virginia, told reporters Wednesday. During the concert, Harrington left her friends to use the restroom, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Wednesday, and when she did not return they called her on her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy, Geller said, but told them not to worry about her and that she would find a ride home. There are restrooms inside the arena, Geller said, and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside. Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone, Geller said. At about 9:30 p.m. that night, witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington's description walking on a nearby bridge, Geller said. No further sightings were reported. Harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, Geller said. A friend had driven Harrington's car to the concert, she said, and so was still in possession of the car keys when they got separated. Police would not say whether Harrington was intoxicated. A $150,000 reward has been offered for information leading to Harrington's whereabouts, Geller said. Of that, Metallica contributed $50,000. Authorities have received more than 350 leads since Harrington disappeared, Geller said. She was reported missing the day after the concert, when she did not show up at her parents' home to study for a math exam with her father. Working with police and the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center, the Harringtons organized the community search to begin Friday and reconvene Saturday or Sunday. The couple was joined at the Wednesday press conference by Ed Smart, whose daughter Elizabeth was abducted in 2002. She returned home nine months later after police found her in the custody of suspect Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. ""When a child is missing, you have no idea of what to do and how to move forward,"" Smart said, calling it ""the club that nobody wants to belong to."" ""There isn't a parent out there that would want to be in his position,"" he said of Harrington. ""The importance of it is, there's a girl that is lost out there that needs to be found."" Harrington said he reached out to Smart last week to seek advice on how to go through the disappearance of a child. Smart has been supportive and helpful, he said, and offered to come to Virginia and speak to reporters Wednesday. Gil Harrington spoke briefly. ""Morgan, two-for-one,"" she said, referring to a motto on a Web site set up by the family, www.findmorgan.com: ""I love you too much, forever and once more."" ""We are trying to find you,"" she told her daughter. ""We will never stop. We are trying, honey, hang on. And to the person who has taken Morgan from us, please just let her go."" Dan Harrington said Smart's story had provided them with hope. ""People do come back,"" he said. ""Not everyone is lost. We have to hold out hope that our daughter will return to us."" Smart told reporters he never lost hope that his daughter was alive, but ""that doesn't mean there wasn't doubt at times."" ""I believed she was still out there and felt that she would come home,"" he said. ""That's what we're hoping for with Morgan. We just want to see her come home ... I believe that somebody can help us."" Harrington is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. She was wearing a black Pantera T-shirt, a black miniskirt, black tights and black boots when last seen.","Morgan Harrington was separated from friends at Metallica concert on October 17 .

"(CNN) -- It's a simple thing, really, the rubber and stainless steel band that a well-known CEO frequently wears around his wrist. But the Nike FuelBand that Apple's Tim Cook has been seen sporting at multiple public events is just one clue about a possible deal between Apple and Nike that could be part of the sales pitch when a rumored Apple watch hits the market. Late on Friday (the traditional time of the week for companies to release bad news), came a news report that Nike had laid off much of the team responsible for the FuelBand and would not continue to update the line of wearable gadgets, which measure physical activity and monitor things like heart rate and calories burned. Nike had planned to release a new, thinner FuelBand in the fall, but those plans have reportedly been shelved and the company won't say whether there will be a new one. Nike has said it plans to continue supporting the current FuelBand for the ""forseeable future"" and that new color options will be available. Still, the retreat seems odd for a company that has made its name in sports equipment -- and has led to speculations that Nike may be working on a new partnership with Apple. ""Obviously Apple has enjoyed a healthy relationship with them over the years,"" said Brian White, a Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. analyst who follows Apple. ""Our view has been that the fitness band will largely fold into the smartwatch in the future and most of the players will exit the market. If I were them, makes more sense to partner with Apple, but that is just my opinion."" Nike spokesman KeJuan Williams said in an email that FuelBand remains ""an important part"" of Nike's business. He confirmed there will be a ""small number"" of layoffs and emphasized the company's continuing work on digital products, including partnerships with companies like Apple. ""Partnering with industry-leading tech companies is nothing new for Nike,"" Williams said. ""We have been working with Apple to develop products since 2006, when the two companies introduced Nike+ Running, and Nike has since create Apps for the iOS including Nike+ Training Club, Nike+ FuelBand and Nike+ Move which launched in Fall 2013. ""Building on these successful products and services, Nike and Apple are partnering on emerging technologies to create better solutions for athletes."" Could that partnership evolve into a forthcoming Apple-Nike wearable product? That is still just conjecture at this point. But consider: . -- Already, Apple's iOS system is the only mobile system that can be used with the Fuel Band and its set of apps. -- Cook has sat on Nike's board of directors for the past nine years. And the two companies have already teamed up to create the Nike+ mobile app for iPhones and iPods. -- In September, Apple hired Nike's Ben Shaffer, the man behind the ""Innovation Kitchen"" that created Fuel Band. -- Apple is the highest-profile company that has not yet entered the wearable tech field -- despite the fact that rumors of an ""iWatch"" have been swirling for years. With Google, Samsung and other competitors already selling wearable gear, it would make sense for Apple to get into the game sooner rather than later. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to begin on June 2, and the company has used the event in the past to announce new products. Alternately, Apple has made a habit of introducing a new iPhone every fall, in advance of the holiday shopping season. It would certainly make sense to unveil a new product then as well. Apple did not reply to a message seeking comment for this story.","As Nike pulls back from FuelBand, Apple speculation emerges .

"(CNN) -- Be kind to fans of ""The Good Wife"" today. They're seriously struggling. During the course of Sunday's episode, faithful ""Good Wife"" viewers had to say goodbye to Josh Charles' character, Will Gardner, who was killed in a plot twist no one saw coming. Fans have taken the news so badly that showrunners Robert and Michelle King have been forced to explain why they did it. The Kings, who launched the acclaimed drama in 2009, say in an open letter addressed to their ""loyal"" audience that their focus has always been on ""the education of"" Julianna Margulies' character, Alicia Florrick, a lawyer whose life was thrown into turmoil after her husband's corruption scandal. Over the past five seasons, Florrick has gone from being ""the good wife"" to a woman rebuilding her life and career as a litigator, reuniting with her old law school friend, Will, along the way. So when the two writers were ""faced with the gut punch of Josh's decision, made over a year ago, to move on to other creative endeavors, we had a major choice to make. We could 'send him off to Seattle,' he could be disbarred, or get married, or go off to Borneo to do good works,"" they say of the deceased character. But distance would've been but a ""meager hurdle"" for Alicia and Will. ""To us, there always was a tragedy at the center of Will and Alicia's relationship: the tragedy of bad timing,"" the Kings said. ""The brutal honesty and reality of death speaks to the truth and tragedy of bad timing for these two characters."" Basically, this character's death will ""propel Alicia into her newest incarnation."" ""Death also created a new dramatic 'hub' for the show,"" the Kings continue. ""We're always looking for these turning points -- some event midway through the season that will spin everybody's lives in new directions. These turning points keep the show from slipping into a numbing sameness, and keep the characters fresh: because you see how they react to a completely new status quo."" The unexpected death they just handed down ""in many ways becomes a hub for the whole series, violently spinning everybody in new directions."" So why did they opt to off the guy in such a gut-wrenching way? Well, the Kings say, ""we've all experienced the sudden death of a loved one in our lives. It's terrifying how a perfectly normal and sunny day can suddenly explode with tragedy. Television, in our opinion, doesn't deal with this enough: the irredeemability of death. Your last time with the loved one will always remain your last time. 'The Good Wife' is a show about human behavior and emotion, and death, as sad and unfair as it can be, is a part of the human experience that we want to share.""

"(CNN) -- The Penn State scandal was just starting to reach a rolling boil last month when the Department of Education announced that it would be investigating the school for a possible violation of the Clery Act. A quarter century ago, Jeanne Clery was asleep in her Lehigh University dorm room when she was raped and killed by an intruder. The act came about after Clery's parents discovered that more than three dozen violent crimes had been committed on the campus over the three years before their daughter's murder; yet administrators didn't see fit to disclose this information. In 1990, Congress passed the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, requiring that schools that receive federal funds report crime statistics and make timely warnings to the campus community about crimes that pose a threat to students and employees. Often it takes a tragedy to establish or improve public policy. So it is that the recent flurry of high-profile child sex abuse scandals will surely trigger change and reform. We can start here: suspending the statute of limitations in these types of cases. Laws vary among states, but in most cases, when victims reach a certain age, perpetrators can no longer be charged with these crimes, nor can the accusers seek remedies in civil court. The statute of limitations in New York for bringing civil claims for child sex abuse is five years after it was reported to police or five years after the victim turns 18 . That was also the standard for criminal prosecutions, until it was lifted altogether in 2008 for first-degree rape, aggravated sexual abuse and course of sexual conduct against a child. In Pennsylvania, the criminal statute of limitations extends until the victim reaches the age of 50. But child sex abuse victims must file civil suits before they turn 30 -- and the law was enacted in August 2002, so survivors who turned 20 before the law was enacted are barred from suing their perpetrators. How does this apply to the recent cases in Penn State and Syracuse? If a victim of Jerry Sandusky was born before 1982, he is likely time-barred from bringing action against the disgraced former Penn State football coach. (Given that it was in 1977 that Sandusky established the Second Mile Foundation -- the organization through which, prosecutors allege, he cultivated relationships with victims -- this is significant.) In Syracuse, despite finding the allegations to be credible, prosecutors have already declined to pursue criminal sex abuse charges against former assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine. Why? Because the men accusing Fine of molestation in the 1980s are well into adulthood, and the statute of limitations has long since lapsed. There are various reasons why we have statutes of limitations for crimes, other than the worst felonies, and for torts. Memories fade. Witnesses die. Evidence goes bad. We want to encourage plaintiffs to bring suit as quickly after the alleged injury as possible. Potential defendants should be able to get on with their lives without worrying about getting charged or sued for acts alleged from long ago. If anyone could sue anyone at anytime it would further clog an already congested legal system. In most cases, this all makes sense. Not so for child sexual abuse. The very nature of the crime is predicated on secrecy and shame and manipulation. It often takes years, decades even, for victims to grasp what has happened: that an adult, often a trusted authority figure or a family member, did horribly wrong by them. Regardless of the guilt or innocence of Sandusky or Fine, the obvious complexity and ambiguity of the relationships they had with their accusers, as well as the intense public fallout in the wake of the allegations, offer graphic examples of why alleged victims might feel disabled well into adulthood. Shutting the door on accusers only serves to arm the molesters with still another advantage in what is already an unfair fight. Tammy Lerner knows this first hand. Now 41, she maintains that, as a young girl growing up in Union County, Pennsylvania, she was raped by a favorite relative. Conflicted, ashamed, scared to risk fraying the tapestry of her tight-knit family, she held it as a deeply guarded secret. In the late '90s, she felt that she could no longer stay quiet. As it turned out, several of her cousins claimed to have had similar experiences. Together, they went to the local prosecutor, only to be told they had been time-barred. ""It was just that he wasn't brought to justice,"" says Lerner, who went on to found the Foundation to Abolish Sex Abuse, Inc. ""When he wasn't charged and there could be no civil case, he couldn't be named publically ... Worse than injustice for victims is the paralysis and guilt that we feel over not being able to spare a new generation of kids the horrors of abuse that we experienced as children."" Over the objections of numerous groups -- insurance lobbies, teachers unions, Roman Catholic clergymen-- some states have decided to suspend the statute of limitations for these crimes, a tacit recognition of the unique dynamics of child sex crimes. Delaware recently suspended the statute of limitations for two years, creating a window for those previously time-barred to come forward. More than 100 alleged victims emerged. In California, a similar suspension spurred more than 300 lawsuits, some dating back to episodes from the 1950s. ""It's clear that it can take a long, long time before victims are ready to confront abuse and everything that can come with it,"" says Marci Hamilton, a law professor at Cardozo Law School and a lawyer for one of the accusers in the Sandusky case. ""It's just wrong to have [policy] that favors the predator."" A vast body of research indicates that the effects of childhood sexual abuse often span a lifetime. The opportunity to seek justice should last just as long. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon Wertheim.","Jon Wertheim: Charges of sex abuse can't be pursued once victims reach certain age .

"(CNN) -- Pollution doesn't respect national borders. Outsourcing manufacturing to China may have resulted in less pollution in some parts of the United States, but other regions have lesser air quality because of U.S.-bound Chinese products, a new study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds. ""Pollution from China is having an effect in the U.S., and we need to recognize how that is affecting both our background ozone levels and also particulates that are reaching the West Coast,"" said study co-author Don Wuebbles, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In the western United States, Chinese pollution related to exports contribute up to 12% to 24% of daily sulfate concentrations, the study said. Because of the United States outsourcing manufacturing to China, the eastern United States saw a decrease in sulfate pollution, but an increase was seen in the western part of the nation. Because of pollution from China, the Los Angeles area and other U.S. regions violate national ozone standards one extra day per year, the study said. U.S. consumer goods such as cellphones and televisions are often produced in China. Although Chinese manufacturing isn't causing most of the U.S. pollution, winds called ""westerlies"" can send chemicals across the Pacific Ocean in a matter of days. Valleys and basins in western states can see accumulations of dust, ozone and carbon. ""We know that the efficiency of industry in China is not as it is good in the U.S.,"" Wuebbles said. Higher efficiency of U.S. manufacturing, combined with controls on emissions and outsourcing, have made strides in reducing U.S.-based emissions. Opinion: Pollution could turn China's dream into nightmare . Does that mean that outsourcing manufacturing to China is bad for American public health? The study suggests that for the United States as a whole, there's a net benefit, because the population density in the eastern United States is higher than in the West. But the West still suffers. Sulfate concentrations went up by up to 2%, and ozone and carbon monoxide levels saw slight increases too, in the western United States in 2006, according to the study. Average sulfate, carbon monoxide and black carbon concentrations went down by 0.3% to 0.9% when looking at population-weighted averages. But this all comes at a cost: In the western United States and populous Chinese regions, air quality went down. Smog forces 'blind landing' training on China's pilots . Black carbon has been linked to asthma as well as diseases such as cancer, emphysema, and heart and lung disease. Rain doesn't easily clear it from the atmosphere, so it hangs around and travels far. Researchers found that 36% of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxides, 22% of carbon monoxide and 17% of black carbon from Chinese emissions were linked to producing goods for export. About 21% of export-related emissions from China, for each of these pollutants, came from exports that went from China to the United States. Production of goods for export has rapidly expanded in China, with volume growing 390% between 2000 and 2007, although there has not been as much growth since the global financial crisis. China has generally become a ""large net exporter of energy-intensive industrial products,"" the study said. Behind this economic growth is a rise in combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal, a big culprit in carbon dioxide emissions rising worldwide. Previous research has shown the substantial carbon dioxide emissions that result from Chinese trade, but this study focused on more other air pollutants. Researchers constructed a model using data on economics and emissions. U.N. climate change report points blame at humans . Over the last decade, China has seen a huge increase in the use of coal-burning power plants, Wuebbles said. Coal use for generating electricity is a big part of why carbon dioxide emissions have nearly doubled their rate of growth worldwide, according to a leaked report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, obtained by CNN. High carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations are projected to cause a 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2100. Agriculture, forestry, ecosystems and human health are all expected to suffer as a result of trends in climate change. To decrease pollution from China, Wuebbles recommended increasing the efficiency of manufacturing processes and re-examining energy production. Scrubbers can reduce emissions from coal-burning power plants. ""Consideration of international cooperation to reduce trans-boundary transport of air pollution must confront the question of who is responsible for emissions in one country during production of goods to support consumption in another,"" study authors wrote.

"Editor's note: Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show. Glenn Beck says we should take time to celebrate what's right with America . NEW YORK (CNN) --   A few days before the Fourth of July, I read a column in The Philadelphia Inquirer  that said America didn't deserve to celebrate its independence this year. It claimed that all of our so-called atrocities have shamed the memory of our founding fathers and, as a result, we should cancel our parades, put away our fireworks and all sit quietly while we atone for our sins. I guess that was one way to go. Another way to go would be to fire up the grills, bring the kids to the beach,and gather the family on a blanket to watch as your tax dollars ignite into colorful bursts. I'm guessing that most of us chose the second option. But just because I had fun with friends and family doesn't mean that I believe America is perfect. It just means that, for one day, I chose to celebrate the fact that America is still closer to perfect than any other country in the history of the world. For 364 days a year we talk about high gas prices, crooked politicians, and how much people from one political party allegedly hate everyone from the other. But for 24 hours we get to put it all aside and marvel at how a few brave men risked their lives to stand up for what they believed in. Of course, I would prefer we celebrate that every day, but for now, or at least until that Inquirer columnist gets elected president and bans it, I'll take the one. As someone who works in the media in New York City, I'll admit that I am part of the chorus of people who talk about our problems. But there's nothing wrong with that, so long as you also occasionally take the time to talk about the other side. And that's what I want to do now by asking the question that never seems to be of interest to the mainstream media: What's right with America? Let's start with our much maligned economy. I'm not trying to sugarcoat it, times are definitely tough for an awful lot of families right now. But you know what? We've made it through a depression; we've made it through wars, oil shocks, and major terrorist attacks and we're still standing. In fact, we're not just standing, we're towering over the rest of the world. Our economy is almost as big as the next four largest economies on Earth (Japan, Germany, China and Great Britain) combined. The state of California alone has an economy as large as the entire country of France. Illinois has the same GDP as all of Mexico. New York matches the entire GDP of Brazil. Florida's economy is as large as South Korea's. Texas has a GDP roughly equal to Canada's. Michigan's economy is as large as the entire country of Argentina. It takes a lot longer to turn around an aircraft carrier than it does a dinghy, but the problem we have is with our ship's captain -- the pea-brains in Washington -- not her crew. What's right with America? How about the way we educate our children. Sure, I complain a lot about left-wing professors and how some wealthy private universities hoard their billions while charging obscene amounts for tuition, but the truth is that our universities are always ranked among the best in the world. Students aren't fleeing America to go to college in Japan, India, or China -- it's the other way around. We open our colleges and universities to more than 80,000 foreign professors, scholars and educators a year and we have more students in college right now than those three countries combined. What's right with America? Our world-class universities don't require you to have an elite family name or Rockefeller-type wealth to get in. We don't care about your race, gender or nationality. You just have to be smart enough and work hard for it. What a concept, huh? What's right with America? How about the way we treat the less fortunate? With no help from our government, Americans gave a record $306 billion to charities last year alone. We give twice as much as the next closest country and, relative to the size of our economies, we give 1,000 percent more than the French. What's right with America? It's not just the wealthy who are generous. Two-thirds of American families making under $100,000 a year give to charity. Compassion is ingrained in our culture like no other. What's right with America? How about our supposedly third-world health care system? We spend more on health care per person than Switzerland, Germany, Canada, or any other country you can think of. Do we still have problems? Absolutely, but don't fall for ""the grass is greener"" crowd; every country has health care problems. What's right with America? We love our country. World Values Survey found that 77 percent of Americans are very proud of their nationality. That puts us in a first place tie with the Irish. Australia was next and no one else was really even close. I could go on and on, but my point is that we don't need the so often wished for ""change"" in this country, we just need perspective. While most of us inherently know that we've won the lottery by living here, we don't often think about the reasons why. So, for at least that one day, let's just remember that America still leads the world in the principles that matter most: The rule of law, freedom of religion, equal rights, freedom from an oppressive government and, fortunately for the Philadelphia Inquirer, freedom of speech. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .","Beck disagrees with column suggesting U.S. doesn't deserve to celebrate July 4 .

"(CNN) -- [The following contains spoilers for the December 1, 2013, episode of ""The Walking Dead.""] . Your move, ""Game of Thrones."" The promos all promised a deadly fall finale for ""The Walking Dead"" -- and boy, did it deliver, in one of the most shocking episodes of the series on Sunday night. Midway through the episode -- despite Rick's pleas to the Governor (who has recently been going by the name Brian, though his real name is Philip) to let go of his hostages, Hershel and Michonne, so his group and theirs can learn to coexist in the prison -- Hershel, the wise old doctor, was brutally beheaded by the Governor. Thus began the biggest action sequence since the end of season two, with Rick's group of survivors (including Maggie and Beth, who just saw their own father murdered) in a shootout with the camp the Governor recently took over. As this was happening, the Governor learned that the little girl he swore to protect, Meghan, had recently been killed by a walker, and he shot her in the head without even flinching, to keep her from turning. If Daryl dies, we riot: A chat with Norman Reedus . It was the Governor and Rick in hand-to-hand combat, and as soon as it looked like Rick was a goner, Michonne ran the Governor through with her sword, and Meghan's mother, Lilly -- the Governor's new girlfriend -- later finished him off. If that wasn't enough, we saw Tyreese (who was killed at this point in the comic books) saved by two young girls who had been trained in using firearms by Carol. Speaking of Carol, her closest friend in the prison, Daryl, soon got over his anger at the fact that she had been banished and went to work, using grenades and a walker's body, to take down the Governor's people and his tank, before the members of the group abandoned the prison, before it became completely infested with walkers. The stunned reactions to all of this on Twitter carried through the night, with various (humorous, of course) GIFs of people with dropped jaws and passed out on the floor. Celebrities weighed in as well, with ""Modern Family's"" Sarah Hyland saying, ""I blame @WalkingDead_AMC for Haley crying on #ModernFamily till February because the tears will not stop. Really. I'm ruined."" ""I am going to need a minimum of 6-7 months to get over this episode of The Walking Dead,"" said actress Leslie Grossman (""Popular,"" ""What I Like About You""). ""Speechless,"" tweeted Yvette Nicole Brown of ""Community,"" also a regular on the ""Talking Dead"" post-show. ""I'm going to bed. Watching @WalkingDead_AMC is an hour of pure crazy cardio,"" said Melissa Gilbert. ""I'm exhausted! One question: where's Judith?!!"" Where indeed? The episode ended with Rick and Carl coming upon an empty baby car seat, devastated to see that little Judith Grimes was nowhere to be found. This raised the possibility that she had been killed or somehow, someone (Beth?) was able to rescue her in the melee. But the question remains, why Hershel and why now? (Putting aside the fact that he died in the comic books at this point.) ""It's a very important part of the story that Hershel died; it isn't just shock death,"" executive producer Scott Gimple explained to The Hollywood Reporter. ""We're going to see now with all these things taken away from Rick if he can come back from this. Moving into the next season and a half, the loss of Hershel will be felt and will be this driving element toward Rick's character."" Fans will have to wait until February 9, when the show returns, for the next chapter of the story.","""The Walking Dead"" fall finale features multiple deaths .

"(CNN) -- In 1984, in the midst of Lebanon's civil war, Naji Gebran started hosting regular gatherings at his Beirut beachfront apartment for the purpose of ""musical therapy."" Weary and traumatized from the conflict that had divided their city -- and would claim some 150,000 lives over its 15 years -- people would come to his apartment to lose themselves in a night of jazz, blues, funk, soul, classical and Arabic music. ""They used to come because of the music, to forget the war,"" said Gebran. ""We used to do this for peace."" The party nights were an important outlet, he said, as during the war years there were few other options. ""My friends had nowhere to go,"" he said. There were two or three clubs in Christian east Beirut, the same in the city's Muslim west. ""But they were very constipated. Very good dress, the same music all the time,"" he said. ""It was very commercial, easy listening, everywhere you go."" Beirut has come a long way since then. After dark, the city comes alive: A balmy playground of chic nightclubs, rough and ready dives, stylish rooftop bars. The hip, hedonistic scenes in the fashionable neighborhoods of Gemmayze or Hamra are unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the Arab world -- and can be an unexpected find in a country in which austere Islamic militant group Hezbollah forms part of the government. ""It is the nightlife capital of the region,"" said Naomi Sargeant, managing director of city guide Time Out Beirut. ""It's cosmopolitan and has this East-meets-West feel. I don't think there's anything on par."" A fixture of the Beirut scene is Gebran's nightclub, B018. Opened in 1994, and named for the lock-code on the door of his old apartment, the club has helped to usher in a more cosmopolitan, vibrant nightlife in the aftermath of the war, he said. ""When I opened the club, artists start to go out, lesbians and gays started to go out,"" he said. Beirut's vibrancy is partly an expression of a Lebanese lust for life, a determination to seize the day after having endured years of war and associated traumas, said Sargeant. ""With all the issues you've had here, people just want to enjoy life. It tends to be: let's just live it up today. We can worry about the rest tomorrow."" But it also reflects a cosmopolitan tradition that has long been part of the character of this diverse Mediterranean port city, a thriving trading center for thousands of years and a place where 18 officially recognized religious sects live -- most of the time -- in a state of respectful coexistence. This cultural capital is one of his country's greatest national assets, said Gebran. ""The people are more liberal, more free, they love life. We say this is our petrol, it's our oil."" While liquor vendors in some other parts of Lebanon have been targeted with protests and even violence in recent times, Beirut has a liberal, tolerant attitude towards drinking. ""The tolerance for drinking is very similar to Europe, so you don't have the same issues you do in other countries in the region,"" said Sargeant. Beirut's nightlife was centered in areas where local communities had no issues with alcohol, she said: ""I have seen no evidence of any clashes with any religious groups about the nightlife in Beirut. Everyone coexists."" One distinctive aspect of the city's nightlife was that it was not unusual to see a wide age range of people out enjoying themselves -- even multiple generations of a family. ""In the late '60s and early '70s, Beirut was considered the place to come and party, but when the war happened that got all cut off. A whole generation couldn't go out and enjoy themselves,"" said Sargeant. ""So when the war ended a generation wanted to see their kids go out and enjoy themselves, and the parents themselves want to recapture what they lost from their youth. ""I've seen tables where it's all the parents at one and all the kids on another table."" At B018, the connections and disjunctions between Beirut's war-torn past and hedonistic present are referenced in the very architecture. It looks like a bomb shelter. Situated near Beirut's port in a district known as Karantina, the site was once a slum home to thousands of Kurdish and Palestinian refugees. On January 18, 1976, a massacre by local militias killed hundreds and left the area abandoned. The club was designed by Gebran's cousin, the architect Bernard Khoury. Its striking underground design is, in Khoury's words, ""a reaction to difficult and explosive conditions that are inherent to the history of its location -- and the contradictions that are implied by the implementation of an entertainment program on such a site."" A subterranean club might not seem to make much sense in a city where rooftop bars are the most popular option, but the club's roof opens to make the most of balmy evenings -- or mornings, for the truly dedicated. It is at that point, said Sargeant, the genuine bon vivants are likely to continue partying, heading to beach clubs to the city's north and south for a swim and another drink on a sun lounger. Beirutis are known for making good use of the attractive natural surroundings beyond the city limits; in July and August 2006, the city's social set decamped to the mountains to avoid the hostilities with Israel. This time, war didn't stop them. ""A lot of people packed up and went up to the mountains,"" said Sargeant. ""People were loading their shopping trolleys with cigarettes and whiskey ... The party moved up there."" CNN's Eye On series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile. However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports.

"Washington (CNN) -- Only one percentage points separates Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst in the race to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate. If the election were held today, 49% of likely Iowa voters say they would vote for Braley and 48% say they would support Ernst, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. That means the contentious race is within the survey's overall sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The electorate is far from solidified. Twenty percent of likely voters polled in Iowa said they could change their mind before Election Day in November. The Braley-Ernst race has been one of the most closely watched of the election year. With longtime Sen. Tom Harkin retiring, Democrats are fighting to keep the seat in blue hands and hope that a win in Iowa will keep the Senate in Democratic control. Republicans have other ideas, however, and hope that Ernst -- currently a state senator and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard -- will be able to flip the seat. With a little less than two months until Election Day, the race has already seen millions of dollars spent. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the two candidates had spent almost $6 million as of July. That figure doesn't include the millions that outside Republican and Democratic groups have spent on the race, either. Even with all the money spent, some likely voters are still unaware of each candidate. Six percent of likely Iowa voters are unfamiliar with Ernst, while 9% of voters say they are unfamiliar with Braley. Partisanship appears to trump identity politics in the race, too. Most women are supporting Braley, the Democratic man, while most men are supporting Ernst, the Republican woman. The two candidates are basically flipped with likely male and female voters: Braley is winning 41% of men and 57% of women, while Ernst is winning 56% of men and 41% of women.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Three dancers fired from Cher's tour accuse the singer of covering up an alleged sexual assault by another dancer. The allegations are part of a lawsuit filed against Cher and her touring company in Los Angeles Wednesday. ""These accusations are ridiculous and could not be further from the truth,"" Cher publicist Liz Rosenberg told CNN Thursday. While the complaint alleges racial discrimination by Cher, accusing her of hiring a white, blonde dancer over a more qualified African American, the lawsuit centers on California's whistleblower law that protects employees who are fired for reporting illegal activity. ""Cher was personally involved in the coverup of a sexual assault against a female fan by one of her other male dancers while on Cher's Dressed to Kill tour,"" the suit said. The alleged sex assault happened in a St. Louis hotel on June 3, after a show on the tour, the lawsuit said. A recently-hired dancer invited a female fan to his hotel room, it said. The fan, identified as ""Jenn,"" later complained to another dancer, Jacquelyn Ballinger, that the male dancer pressured Jenn to have sex with him. ""When she refused, the dancer became angry,"" the complaint said. ""Jenn asked for Ms. Ballinger not to leave Jenn alone and for help, to which Ms. Ballinger obliged."" Ballinger later told tour choreographer-dancer Kevin Wilson and dancer Suzanne Easter about the allegation. The three dancers ""made numerous and repeated complaints"" to Cher and tour managers ""regarding the sexual assault of a female fan by an employee,"" it said. The dancers ""were instructed not to tell anyone what had transpired"" and ""informed that management would 'take care of the situation,'"" the suit said. All three dancers were fired a month after reporting the assault ""whilst the dancer whom they accused of sexual assault remained gainfully employed,"" it said. The dancer who allegedly assaulted the fan was put on ""probation"" only after the fired dancers hired a lawyer and prepared to sue, the complaint said. ""The purported reason given for the firing was 'budget cuts,'"" the suit said, even though Cher's tour sold out every show and added more. Read the full complaint filed against Cher . California law imposes penalties on employers for firing people for ""protected whistle blowing activity,"" which includes reporting violations of state and federal law, according to Perry Wander, the lawyer for the three dancers. While it is primarily a whistleblower lawsuit, the complaint also alleges racial discrimination by Cher against African American dancers. It accuses Cher of making a racist comment while reviewing audition tapes for dancers. After watching a ""minority female dancer"" who ""particularly impressed"" the choreographer and tour manager, Cher allegedly remarked ""we have too much color onstage"" and requested a white, blonde dancer. A blond haired, blue-eyed female was subsequently hired,"" the suit said. Wilson and Easter are ""dark skinned African Americans,"" according to the lawsuit. ""The pattern of racism and discrimination continued to permeate the tour when Wilson was prohibited by Cher and tour management from casting any dark skinned African Americans who auditioned, even if they danced better than their white counterparts."" The lawsuit is asking the judge to immediately order Cher to rehire the three fired dancers for the remainder of the tour. It is also asking for at least $10 million in damages. Cher, 68, launched her current tour in March, selling out all 49 shows in the first leg ending in July, according to Billboard magazine. Those shows grossed nearly $55 million from 610,000 fans. Another 30 shows across the United States are on the calendar over the next two months. Q&A: Cher on her tour, Miley and leather jackets .

"(Departures) -- When San Francisco law firm operations director Jeffrey Lais was due for a well-earned vacation, he booked himself a first-class ticket to Munich on Lufthansa. Once aboard the German carrier's A346, he was led to his first-class suite, where a spacious leather seat and ottoman ran the length of four airplane windows and various compartments overflowed with noise-canceling headphones, menus, pajamas and slippers. After a dinner of caviar, prawn confit, duck breast and an assortment of French cheeses, a flight attendant converted Lais's seat into a mattress-topped flatbed—complete with duvet and giant pillows—and showed him how to seal his seat from view with a privacy screen for the rest of the 12-hour flight. There's no doubt about it, first class makes travel better. As airlines stave off bankruptcy by cutting amenities and services to their economy classes, there seems to be a shield around the almighty first class. According to the International Air Transport Association, this is because upper-class passengers, although a small minority among international air travelers, account for almost a third of airline revenues. It's not surprising, then, that recent reports show that cabin modifications, especially those that favor upper-class travelers, are the fastest-growing segment of the airline MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) industry. Departures.com: World's most scenic walks . ""In order to stay competitive, airlines need to keep pace with the rapidly changing demands of corporate travelers,"" says Nigel Page, Emirates' vice president of commercial operations. ""That's why we consistently invest in refining and enhancing our first-class product."" The Dubai-based carrier delivers on its promise—thus far, it's the only airline to offer showers for first-class passengers aboard its fleet of 21 A380 jets. And in-flight showers aren't the only perks offered to today's first-class travelers. Swiss' new first class, launched in 2009, offers a spacious executive desk for one that converts to a comfortable dining table for two (for those who want dinner company); Lufthansa added cabin humidifiers, and trumped the seat-to-flatbed race by adding both a flatbed and a chair to each first-class suite on their 747s. Of course, no matter how opulent the cabins get, the best part of first-class flying may be off the plane. Says Lais, whose personal Lufthansa escort expedited his passage through airport security and passport control, ""As much as the free-flowing caviar and throne-like seat add to the exclusivity of first class, it's the level of on-the-ground attention that makes all the difference."" Singapore Airlines . They might sound like the dimensions of a Super Barbie, but 78-23-35 are the specs for the first-class suites exclusively offered on Singapore Airlines' A380s. They represent bed length, entertainment screen size and seat width (in inches), respectively. Created by luxury yacht designer Jean-Jacques Coste, the suites were an industry game-changer when introduced in 2007. The fully encapsulated cabins, where you can dine on lobster thermidor and rack of lamb, feature beds accented with hand-stitched Italian leather, trimmed in burrwood and topped with a plush mattress and Givenchy bedding. Units in the center of the cabin can be combined to form a double bed, ideal for couples. singaporeair.com . Swiss . What good is a vintage Madame Cuvée and a bone china plate piled with rare Alpine cheeses if you don't have someone to enjoy it with? That's the genius behind Swiss's new first-class cabin. Just when most carriers were adding über-private pods in first, Swiss bucked the trend and created a superior seat with adjustable partitions and room to dine for two. The cabin also features handsome wood paneling and seats whose unique air-cushion technology has won best seat design awards from Global Traveler magazine for the past two years. When dinner is over, adjust the wall partition to allow for privacy. swiss.com . Emirates . Exclusive to the fourteen first-class passengers aboard its A380s, Emirates' Shower Spas afford guests the mile-high luxury of a hot, five-minute in-air shower. Not only do the cabins' two bathrooms have a shower stall, they also have a marble sink, Timeless Spa toiletries and heaps of fluffy towels. The onboard lounge offers snacks like labneh balls and Iranian caviar, while the private suites -- each with a sliding door -- have their own refrigerated mini-bar, adjustable ambient lighting and vanity table with mirror. Massage-enabled leather seats convert to flatbeds, which are topped by plush mattresses after dinner. emirates.com . Departures.com: Top yoga retreats . Etihad Airways . Voted best first class two years in a row by airline-review website Skytrax, Etihad's Diamond first-class suites are arranged in a one-one configuration, each individually sealed off behind Jaali screen--style sliding doors. Inside, you'll find 23-inch entertainment screens loaded with games and the latest film releases, personal mini-bars and chestnut Italian leather seats from Poltrona Frau (Ferrari's leather experts), which convert to a 80-inch flatbed topped with Dupioni silk and cotton duvets. Changing rooms/toilets feature a full-length vanity mirror and amenity kits by Swarovski and La Prairie. etihadairways.com . Departures.com: Worlds top walking cities . Japan Airlines . At first glance, the JAL Suites aboard the carrier's 777s seem to offer nothing new. But a closer inspection reveals a host of discreet high-tech elements and minimalist design details. Leather seats are ergonomically designed, oversized lap trays (where you can tuck into ""anytime"" dishes like Wagyu burgers and udon noodles) are height-adjustable and ottomans double as optional guest seating. Reading lights have six brightness settings, while the mattresses, jointly developed by JAL and Tempur, are designed to evenly distribute the pressure and weight of your body. Throw in the signature Symphony pillows made with their marshmallow-like texture, and a good night's sleep is all but guaranteed. jal.co.jp . Lufthansa . Lufthansa recently trumped the industry's seat-to-flatbed race by halving the number of first-class suites aboard its 747s and giving each a seat and a bed. But first-class cabins on the carrier's A380s go even further by offering the industry's first automated air humidifiers (which regulate cabin humidity for passenger comfort). The serene caramel-and-chocolate-hued suites are equipped with sound-absorbing curtains and noise-neutralizing floor insulation, plus six-and-a-half-foot beds topped with plush mattresses and cozy duvets. lufthansa.com . Cathay Pacific . A private entrance leads to the first-class cabin on Cathay's 777s, where just six tranquil pods create a spacious herringbone layout that optimizes passenger privacy. Inside the pods are wall-mounted vases filled with orchids, wood-grain partitions and ample-sized flatbeds with extra-large pillows. Amenity kits from Ermenegildo Zegna and Aesop sweeten the deal, as do personal closets filled with shoe bags and ""sleep suits"" from Shanghai Tang. cathaypacific.com . Departures.com: World's most opulent villas . ANA . Like those of JAL, ANA's first-class Suite Squares require a second look to be fully appreciated. The high-tech aluminum cubicles, available only on the airline's 777 flights between New York and Tokyo, are laid out in a one-two-one configuration; each features lap rugs made from bamboo fiber, separate cocktail tables, laptop drawers, wood-grain wallpaper and 23-inch touch-screen LCD TVs (which passengers can use to order dishes like spiny lobster dumplings in multicourse Kaiseki menus). First-class washrooms also feature the industry's first in-air electronic bidet toilets. ana.co.jp . Jet Airways . The eight first-class suites aboard Jet Airways' fleet of 777s offer passengers 26 square feet of private space. Hidden behind Venetian sliding doors, each suite contains its own personal light settings and wardrobe drawers for storing necessaries. Chairs come with variable lumbar support and an eight-point massage system and convert to spacious 83-inch beds, where you can actually toss and turn while watching over 100 Hollywood (and Bollywood) movies on the 23-inch LCD screen. If you're still restless, you can poke around the gigantic virtual e-book and audio-book library, or even study a foreign language with a Berlitz Word Traveler course. jetairways.com . Korean Air . Over the past four years, Korean Air spent $200 million upgrading its cabins, which include five A380 jets. In first class, the redesign has meant the comfy, elegant Kosmo Suites -- 83-inch-long compartments encased in wood-grained shells, with leather interiors in cream and sea-green hues. The suites contain personalized storage compartments, reading lights and wide-screen TVs with upgraded AVOD (audio video on demand) systems, plus Bose headphones. koreanair.com .

"(CNN) -- With thousands of jobs lost in the manufacturing sector and some of the highest unemployment rates in the country, the Midwest has taken an especially hard hit during this economic recession. Jobs are available in Wisconsin's brewing industry, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. In December, the Midwest posted the second-highest regional unemployment rate in the country, at 7.5 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Michigan, Indiana and Illinois all were in the top five states for total job losses. But, as CNN's affiliate stations report, there are some bright spots in the picture these days for Midwestern job seekers. Nursing, brewing and transportation promise to bring new jobs to the region. And, like elsewhere, government jobs have taken on a new air of stability in part because of the economic stimulus package. Nursing Dawn Jarvis, of Indiana, became tired of the ups and downs of the real estate industry. So she decided to seek a career in nursing. ""It doesn't dry up like real estate,"" she told CNN affiliate WRTV, of Indianapolis. ""You can take it with you wherever you go."" The station reports that nurses on average make upwards of $30 per hour. As America's population continues to age, health care is expected to be in increasing demand. The Indiana Health Care Association told WRTV that Indiana has the greatest need for nurses of any state. ""We have the highest vacancy rate for long-term care RNs [registered nurses] in the country, and it's significantly higher than other states,"" association president Stephen Smith told the station. ""One of the top professions over the next 20 years is going to be nursing and the health care field in general because of the aging of the population."" Read more about nurses in Indiana from WRTV . Brewing If you ever wondered what will happen to Wisconsin's brewing industry in this sober economy, Carol Nolen has a question for you: . ""What better thing to do than come home at the end of the day and enjoy a beer?"" the president of Capitol Brewery asked CNN member station WKOW. And for a person coming home at the end of a long day of job searching, perhaps even more so. The brewing industry is doing well as others tank, WKOW reports. All of the news from the industry isn't sterling. Some brewery stocks are down on the year, including those of SABMiller, the company that brews Miller products, the station says. But overall, WKOW reports that breweries are making money and keeping people employed. Read more on the brewing industry from WKOW . Transportation Being a school bus driver may not be the sexiest of jobs in the world. But it's better than being unemployed, Ron Reynolds told WISC in Madison, Wisconsin. Driving schools in the area are full, and transportation companies, which normally have trouble filling their rosters, are awash with interest from applicants who seem to be more qualified than in years past, the station reports. Jerry Klabacka, director of Diesel Truck Driving School, told WISC that the industry is hiring truck drivers now, but that could change if companies slow their shipments of goods. The transportation industry in Madison ""is recession-proof in the standpoint that it always needs people,"" he said. ""However, when production goes down in this country, so does freight."" For now, WISC reports that the local transportation sector in the area is seeing ""unprecedented growth."" Read more from WISC . Government Damian Givens attended a recent job fair hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau in Greenwood, Indiana. He told WRTV that it's ""refreshing"" to know that someone is offering jobs. The bureau, which takes a detailed survey of the American public every 10 years, plans to hire 900 people in the area by April 1, and another 1,000 employees next year, the station reports. All of those jobs pertain to the bureau's 2010 survey. Workers will be paid between $11 and $13 an hour, WRTV says. Since the turnout at the jobs event in late February wasn't high, the Census Bureau is still expecting applicants. Watch a WRTV video from the jobs event . ""We think there will be a lot more people, because jobs are hard to come by -- and the census is going to offer that opportunity for people,"" Dennis Sturdevant, of the Census Bureau, told WRTV. Chocolate In Anderson, Indiana, the chocolate maker Nestle is getting headlines for its decision to take a manufacturing plant back up to full capacity this week. ""The plant, which makes and distributes Nesquik and Coffee-Mate, has added hundreds of new jobs to a community desperately in need of positive economic news,"" WRTV reports. Nestle announced it would expand the plant by 880,000 square feet and had 100 more jobs, the station says. Originally, the chocolate maker had planned to add 300 jobs. Indiana's governor touted the 100-job expansion as a success in hard times. See a photo of the plant and read more from WRTV . ""In a worldwide recession, this company is growing ... is succeeding against all those odds,"" Gov. Mitch Daniels said during a tour of the plant, according to WRTV.","The Midwest has been hit hard in the recession, but some jobs are available .

"(CNN) -- As outrage over the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin continues to grip the nation, key questions remain unanswered over what happened the night of February 26 as conflicting accounts are given by witnesses and attorneys for both sides. What is known is that Martin, wearing a hoodie, ventured out from his father's fiancee's home in Sanford, Florida, to get a snack at a nearby convenience store. As he trekked back to the home with a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea, he was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer. Martin was unarmed. Zimmerman has said he acted in self-defense. CNN spoke to a witness to the shooting for a second time Friday, who offered new details about what she saw. Zimmerman's attorneys, for their part, were quick to knock down her statements. Here's what they said: . Who yelled for help? A recording of a 911 call made the night of the shooting captured someone pleading for help. Zimmerman has said he was yelling for help, according to his family members and his account to authorities. Martin's relatives have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is Martin's. ""From the very beginning and I still do feel that it was the young boy,"" the witness, who wants to remain anonymous, told CNN Friday. The witness lives in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred and saw the incident through her window. She described the cries for help as ""devastating, desperate,"" and something ""that will really always stay with me."" When pressed if she could determine who was yelling, the witness said ""it was the younger, youthful voice (rather) than it was the deep voice I heard when they were arguing."" Zimmerman's attorneys jumped on the witness' characterization of Martin as ""the young boy."" ""I'm not sure when she came to that conclusion,"" said attorney Hal Uhrig, noting that when news of the shooting first broke, pictures of Martin as a 12-year-old were the first to circulate. ""The pictures you've put up tonight show a 6 foot 3 boy who was 17 years old,"" Uhrig said, pointing out that teenage boys can have voices that range from high to as low as a grown man. A police report listed Martin's height at six feet. Audio experts Tom Owen and Ed Primeau, who analyzed the 911 recordings for the Orlando Sentinel, said they don't believe it is Zimmerman who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call. They compared those screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier. In that call, in response to the 911 operator's question, Zimmerman described a ""suspicious"" black male, who ended up being Martin. In describing her questioning by investigators, the witness remembered expressing that she should have done something more, in retrospect, after hearing the cries for help. ""The lead investigator said to me kindly, 'Well, if it makes you feel any better, the person that was yelling for help is alive,'"" she recalled. Who was on top of whom during the scuffle? Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk, according to an Orlando Sentinel report that was later confirmed by Sanford police. One of the responding officers saw a wound on the back of Zimmerman's head and a bloody nose, and noted that his back was wet, indicating he had been lying in the grass, according to the police report. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, racially profiled the teen, who was black, and ignored a police dispatcher's directive not to follow him. Zimmerman's attorneys interpret the call differently, and say the operator did not order Zimmerman not to follow. ""I know it was very dark, but I really would have to say that I thought it was the larger person on top,"" the witness said, referring to the heavier build of Zimmerman. Craig Sonner, another Zimmerman attorney, questioned how the witness could determine the identities of those on the ground at that time of night and from her vantage point. ""I think it was dark, and I don't think she's sure what she saw,"" Sonner said. The police investigation: . The Sanford police department has come under intense scrutiny for its actions following the shooting, and protesters have called for the firing of police Chief Bill Lee, who stepped aside temporarily last month amid criticism. The witness declined to characterize her questioning by investigators as ""in depth,"" instead saying ""I just kind of told what I saw and heard."" She noted that when she offered to show the investigators where she saw the scuffle occur, she was told, ""Nah, we don't need to see it."" She added that two phone calls to the lead detective have gone unanswered. Her attorney, Derek Brett, said a follow-up visit on behalf of the state attorney's investigation on Wednesday yielded only 15 minutes of questioning. ""It was very general,"" Brett said, adding that had he been in the investigators' position, he would have had her recount her story again. The state attorney's office declined to comment Friday, citing the ongoing investigation. Sanford police did not respond to requests for comment Friday. What will happen next? A grand jury is expected to convene next week and could take up the case. Whether a grand jury will choose to indict, Sonner said: ""we don't know."" Until now, only friends and relatives of Zimmerman's have come forward to offer his side of the story. Uhrig said Zimmerman ""would love to be able to do that right now,"" but due to threats to his safety and the possibility of charges, he can't. ""There's going to be a time, hopefully in the fairly near future, where he'll have an opportunity to tell the public exactly what happened,"" Uhrig said. Until then, Sonner cautions against jumping to conclusions. ""Everybody wants to know what happened, but we need to take a step back and let the evidence come out,"" he said. CNN's Ashleigh Banfield contributed to this report.","A witness speaks to CNN for a second time, offering new details of the shooting .
She says she is certain it was a younger voice yelling for help .
Members of Zimmerman's legal team question the witness' recollection ."
"(CNN) -- This is a story about a guy who saved a bunch of baby bunnies, then posted the story online hopeful other people would like it. Boy did they ever. People awwww'd so hard on Facebook his story was shared more than 9,000 times. Redditors posted multiple marriage proposals. His videos on YouTube have hundreds of thousands of views. All over a bunch of rabbits so small they didn't even fill the palm of his hand. Joshua Bisnar is a regular user of the social media site Reddit. He's also an active-duty Navy Hospital Corpsman. Judging solely from his previous Reddit posts, one could easily come to the conclusion he regularly performs good deeds, rescues tiny creatures and gets lots of fan mail. Like this one from a second-grader named ""Kenz"" who wrote about month ago, ""I bet you are amazing. ... I treasure you very much."" Kenz, you read our minds. Bisnar first got our attention earlier this week when his rescue of four orphaned rabbits made the front page of Reddit. He introduces the story this way: . ""I live in Camp Pendleton, CA. And as I was raking the volleyball court at the barracks I found a dead rabbit (fully grown). As I continued raking I found a small hole with 4 tiny tiny rabbits in it. I grabbed a box put a few old shirts into it and picked up the bunnies. I researched how to raise them and what to feed them. I made a nice box for them to live in a and bottle fed them until I could [wean] them to eat the local foods. After a couple months I brought them to a wildlife rescue because they were starting to jump out of their box. It was a lot of hard work but I loved the bunnies...."" Did you feel it? Did you feel your icy heart melting? For two months he fed the little critters several times a day using an eyedropper. Once the bunnies were big enough to begin jumping out of the box, he took them to a nearby wildlife sanctuary. ""It was a sad day,"" he said. ""I'm not sure what they are doing now, but I like to think they are fighting off coyotes with the sweet swords and armor I made them and living the dream in Orange County eating the freshest of grasses and meeting all sorts of sexy girl bunnies."" When asked about his recent online fame he joked, ""What I don't like about it is that the fame is getting to my head. I have cut my friends and family off, they keep asking me for money. I see myself as a god amongst men!"" Actress Kristen Chenoweth gives animals a voice . During Bisnar's roughly seven-month tour in Afghanistan in 2012, he posted photos of kittens he rescued and one of a tiny frog he nicknamed ""Crouton."" But as a medic deployed with the Marines, he also had his share of trauma. In one post he describes the smell of burning flesh and blood when a human is injured by an IED, ""You never forget it,"" he wrote. ""We had a number of patients die on us mostly because of the massive hemorrhaging before they got to us,"" he said. That hasn't discouraged him from pursing a career in medicine, something he hopes to complete when he leaves the military in about 18 months. Bisnar told CNN he's been an outgoing animal-lover, eager to talk to strangers since he was a child. And sorry Internet, he also says he eats meat. As for a plan to meet any of the men or women who expressed an interest in meeting Bisnar, he says he would love to meet new friends, but doesn't quite know how to go about it. ""I can't just go on YouTube and be like, 'Hey babe, you said you want to get married so let's do this damn thing.'"" Whatever he does next, we'll be looking for updates on Reddit.

"(CNN) -- Six weeks after he was released from Taliban captivity, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl spent his first day of regular duty working at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas, the army said Tuesday. Bergdahl, like many soldiers at a new assignment, spent much of his day on Monday getting paperwork straightened out, spokesman Don Manuszewski said. The 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants after he disappeared in Afghanistan in June 2009. After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl has undergone counseling and been given medical care at a hospital in San Antonio. On Monday, he began his job with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant. The army spokesman has said that Bergdahl would be assigned a desk job. Bergdahl lives on base, in a two-bedroom unit in non-commissioned officers quarters. ""He's just another soldier in the U.S. Army,"" Manuszewski said. He has two soldiers who are helping him adjust to life at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. Bergdahl venturing off base, rubbing elbows with public . Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while in captivity. Manuszewski wouldn't say how much longer Bergdahl's enlistment would last. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but it quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. Manuszewski didn't comment on the investigation. Bergdahl has yet to be interviewed by the officer investigating his case, Lt. Colonel Alayne Conway said last week. Army general to start investigating how, why Bergdahl left base .","The sergeant will work at the headquarters of a unit based in San Antonio .

"Washington (CNN) -- America's drug war in Afghanistan is failing badly, according to a new report from a U.S. government watchdog. Afghan farmers are growing record bumper crops of opium poppies, an unprecedented 209,000 hectares in 2013, according to a report issued Tuesday by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. This despite various U.S. agencies spending $7.6 billion to try to stop narcotics production in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is the source of 80% of the world's illegal opium, the U.S. government says, yielding $3 billion in sales in 2013, up from $2 billion from the year earlier. According to the report, a big chunk of that money funds the insurgency and terrorism. ""The recent record-high level of poppy cultivation calls into question the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of those prior efforts,"" the report by the SIGAR office says. ""Given the severity of the opium problem and its potential to undermine U.S. objectives in Afghanistan, I strongly suggest that your departments consider the trends in opium cultivation and the effectiveness of past counternarcotics efforts when planning future initiatives."" The report says the 209,000 hectares record in 2013, surpasses the previous mark of 193,000 of opium poppy grown in 2007. The report relies on figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The inspector general report says that areas that were once models for successful counterinsurgency and counternarcotics efforts are now booming poppy producers. The report cites Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan, which the UN declared ""poppy-free"" in 2008, but saw a fourfold increase in opium poppy production between 2012-2013. The inspector general sent the report to the State, Defense and Justice departments, whose agencies fund various anti-drug efforts in Afghanistan. The State Department called the findings ""disappointing,"" but blamed the increase in opium poppy production on shifts in the Afghan government's own security efforts. The Pentagon asked the inspector general to remove Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel from receiving the report because the military plays a secondary role to other U.S. government agencies in thwarting drug production in Afghanistan. ""In our opinion, the failure to reduce poppy cultivation and increase eradication is due to the lack of Afghan government support for the effort,"" Michael Lumpkin, assistant secretary of defense wrote to the inspector general. ""Poverty, corruption, the terrorism nexus to the narcotics trade, and access to alternative livelihood opportunities that provide an equal or greater profit than poppy cultivation are all contributors to the Afghan drug problem.""","Afghanistan has kept growing bumper crops of opium poppies, providing 80% of the world's illegal opium supply.
The report comes Tuesday from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.
U.S. agencies have spent $7.6 billion to stop narcotics production in the Middle Eastern country.
The State Department blames Afghanistan's security efforts for not controlling the spread."

"(CNN) -- Topless ladies? That's so passe. The nation's strip clubs are in a period of peak innovation. Portland, Oregon, laid claim to the first vegan strip club, Casa Diablo. The first drive-through strip club, Climax Gentleman's Club, popped up outside of Pittsburgh (it's now defunct). Now Ohio is home to the first beer-brewing nudie bar. Pinups and Pints is located, appropriately enough, in a strip mall outside of Dayton, and according to the Dayton City Paper, it's the first strip club microbrewery in America. Behind the main stage and stripper pole sits the 15-gallon brewing system, where club owner Scott Conrad makes batches of the club's signature suds. He decided to start the club after taking note of the area's growing beer scene -- and discovering that a liquor license was more attainable for a microbrewery. ""I feel I am definitely creating a niche to the market"" Conrad told CNN, adding that he is ""definitely ahead of the curve when it comes to adult entertainment."" Conrad had no brewing experience going into this venture, but with some trial and error in his garage and help from local craft brewer Toxic Brewing, he is getting some positive feedback on the beer and plenty of support from the area's brewing community. He describes Pinup Pale Ale, the club's first and only offering, as very approachable, appealing to Bud drinkers as well as craft beer aficionados. However, don't expect to see huge stainless steel fermentation tanks on the brewery tour quite yet though; brewing the beer is something that Conrad takes seriously. ""You gotta get good before you can get creative,"" he said. Kevin J. Gray assessed the beer for his Dayton City Paper story and noted, ""Pinup Pale Ale was a solid pale ale, a good start on a new system."" Gray told CNN, ""The Dayton beer scene has exploded in the last two years. Prior to 2012, there were no breweries in the area. Now, Pinups and Pints makes the twelfth microbrewery opening in the greater Dayton area in the last two years."" Dancers are still the marquee act at Pinups and Pints, but according to Conrad, more and more customers are coming in to check out the beer. ""Those who normally would not go to traditional clubs are starting to come here to try the brew, plus enjoy the entertainment aspect,"" said K.C., a bartender and server at the club. ""Personally, I really enjoy the fact I get to come to work and watch the process and all of the hard work put into each keg,"" she added. Conrad finds that his main challenge so far is keeping up with the demand for the beer. He puts in many long days brewing in addition to running the club and finds, ""It is a lot of hard work, but I enjoy the challenge."" Exotic dancers, neon lights and small-batch beers are, so far for Pints and Pinups, a combo just bubbling over with success.","Pinups and Pints owner Scott Conrad noticed a beer boom around Dayton .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Seeking to make the world of autism a little smaller, members of the international diplomatic community gathered Friday at the United Nations World Focus on Autism. Ban Soon-taek, wife of U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, addresses the autism forum. ""Not too long ago, those affected by autism-related disorders were set aside, placed in institutions, or dismissed as untreatable lost cases,"" explains Ban Soon-taek, chair of the Forum and wife of U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. ""Today, sadly this reality is still prevalent in some parts of the world."" Ban called for the professional community and society as a whole to become more involved, compassionate and accepting of this complex condition and stressed the importance of early intervention for every child in the world who lives with autism. CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour moderated the event, prompting first ladies, medical experts and the international community to address the challenges inherent in globalizing the fight against autism. The event was co-chaired by U.S. first lady Laura Bush, who did not attend, and Madame Dorrit Moussaieff, first lady of Iceland. Autism Speaks, an advocacy group created to fund research into the causes, treatments and effective diagnostic tools for autism, presented the program. The group's past efforts led to the U.N. General Assembly's adoption of April 2 as World Autism Awareness Day. It is only the third disease to be given an officially observed day by the U.N., following diabetes and AIDS. The group's current global initiatives aim to provide more trained professionals to diagnose and provide effective early interventions, and for collaboration between countries to conduct more epidemiological studies.  CNN's Christiane Amanpour reports on the U.N. forum on autism » . In the United States, 1 in 150 people are estimated to have an autism spectrum-related disorder. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer of Autism Speaks, estimates the condition is a greater burden on our resources than type 1 diabetes, childhood leukemia and cystic fibrosis combined, costing Americans more than $90 billion annually. For families, she points out, the cost is immeasurable. On a global scale, however, autism rates are largely unknown, because of a lack of research and reliable epidemiological studies and a relative lack of awareness surrounding the condition, Dawson told CNN. The dearth of autism education leads to another global obstacle: social stigma surrounding the disease. In an interview with CNN, Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos, honorary co-chair and wife of Panamanian president Martin Torrijos, said lack of awareness and social stigma are part of the reason autism is diagnosed later in life in Latin America. Panamanians ""don't think that it's a syndrome. They don't have any idea about it because we need more education on what autism is."" At the event, Torrijos discussed the need for more programs such as the Pan American Autism Awareness Initiative, an international collaboration between Autism Speaks and North, South and Central America, first announced in May 2008. The initiative's first purpose is focused on increasing awareness among health professionals and parents alike. Another international collaboration brought about by Autism Speaks and championed at the U.N. event is the Shafallah Center for Children with Special needs in Doha, Qatar. In April 2008 the Shafallah Center, under the patronage of the Qatari Emir's wife Sheikha Moza Bint Nasser Bin Abdullah Al-Missned, joined efforts with Autism Speaks to raise autism awareness in Qatar and the rest of the Middle East. Suzanne Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, characterized the growing number of global initiatives as a sign that identifying a cause and cure for the disorder is potentially on the horizon. ""Autism speaks,"" she says, ""and finally the world is listening.""","Ban Soon-taek calls for society as a whole to become more involved .

"(CNN) -- Homeland security officials on Wednesday abruptly shelved a proposal to build a national database of license-plate scans after criticism from privacy advocates. The proposal, which had been posted online last week by the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, sought a contractor who could establish a searchable database of license plates, with the times and locations where they were spotted by traffic cameras and other sources. But in a statement late Wednesday, the department announced a reversal. ""The solicitation, which was posted without the awareness of ICE leadership, has been canceled,"" said spokeswoman Gillian Christensen. ""While we continue to support a range of technologies to help meet our law enforcement mission, this solicitation will be reviewed to ensure the path forward appropriately meets our operational needs."" It was unclear whether the proposal was dead or was merely withdrawn for revisions. Under the proposal, officers in the field would have been able to use their smartphones to look up a license plate and see every time and every place the vehicle had been spotted by a camera. ""The database should track vehicle license plate numbers that pass through cameras or are voluntarily entered into the system from a variety of sources (access control systems, asset recovery specialists, etc.) and uploaded to share with law enforcement,"" the original solicitation read. The proposed National License Plate Recognition database was to have been used by immigration officers to find and arrest fugitives. Supporters of license-plate scanning, like former New York state homeland security chief Michael Balboni, said it could have been an invaluable tool for finding dangerous suspects. ""What license-plate readers have been used for most effectively is (trying) to do hits against outstanding warrants, against unlicensed drivers, against folks who have shown before that they've been involved in some kind of crime -- that's where the hits come."" But since the solicitation was posted and featured in the Washington Post, privacy advocates have warned that the database sounded like a dragnet that would track the whereabouts of all drivers, including people who have done nothing wrong, and that the records might be held indefinitely. ""The idea is, we want to collect everything on perfectly innocent people and then dip into it whenever we feel like it,"" said Kade Crockford of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""There have already been quite a few cases of abuse. Essentially, the problem is that this is creating a nationwide warrantless location-tracking list."" Opponents also said the tracking of cars would reveal personal information about drivers, like whether they went to church, where they slept at night, or whether they had been to an abortion clinic or a political protest.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement sought bids for a license-plate tracking database .

"(CNN) -- While rescue efforts continue in Sendai, the city that lies just 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of the earthquake epicenter, the long-term future of the metropolis and surrounding area looks uncertain. Kyung Lah has reported from the outskirts of the city on Sunday morning describing the shell-shocked population organizing themselves to clear roads, clean up and assist official efforts in searching for missing people, while fearing more aftershocks and tsunamis. But even when a semblance of normality returns to the city of around one million people the disaster could compound the problems facing the region; namely the flight of young people to larger cities and a rapidly ageing population. ""A trend across Japan has been moving out of the rural areas to Tokyo,"" says CNN correspondent Kyung Lah. ""The area (around Sendai) has experienced a brain drain and economic drainage (as young people leave the area). It was already struggling to keep ahead and to keep the local industries going; agriculture and fishing. The last thing that this community needed was for its infrastructure to be wiped out."" The tsunami's destruction: Before and after . The capital of Miyagi prefecture, Sendai is the largest city in northern Japan, less than a two-hour bullet train ride away from Tokyo. The city lies on the flat, coastal plain between the Ohu Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Most the eastern suburbs of the city hit by the tsunami are low lying with hills in the city center only around 40 meters (140 feet) high. While far from the country's manufacturing heartland that lies to the south and west of Tokyo, Sendai is a regional hub with six universities around the city, which have helped develop the region's technological industries. Miyagi prefecture has tried to diversify its industries away from agriculture and fishing to attract and keep a younger and educated workforce. The regional government also has been trying to make the area's traditional industries of farming and fishing more attractive to a younger population, but across Japan approximately three fifths of farmers are over 65. The destruction of fishing and agriculture infrastructure may compound the difficulties the industries face, although there may be a shorter term boost, says analysts, from the Japanese government greatly increasing public spending to rebuild. For those currently in the city there are more immediate problems of water, food and fuel supplies. Schools and hospitals in Sendai have been turned into shelters, and volunteers were handing out bottles of water, CNN's Kyung Lah reported from the city. ""Somehow we can hang in there,"" says Yasue Schumaker, a native of Sendai who has been living in Hawaii for 15 years, but in the city caring for her mother. ""We don't' have any water, electricity or gas. They've just announced that it could take days to get gas for everybody. We definitely need water and food. I don't think people have enough food or water. People prefer to stay in the car as they're feeling aftershocks. It's very cold."" Dean Irvine contributed to this report .","Sendai is a city of around 1 million people; only 80 miles from 8.9 magnitude quake epicenter .

"(CNN) -- As the Pentagon launched a barrage of airstrikes into Syria late Monday, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, who was an early backer of President Obama's first presidential campaign and his hand-picked chairman to run the Democratic National Committee, says he is concerned about presidential military action into Syria without congressional authorization. ""The point I think is so critical is the President shouldn't be doing this without Congress and ... Congress shouldn't be allowing it to happen without Congress,"" Kaine said Tuesday at a form at the liberal leaning Center for American Progress. Kaine, however, said he is supportive of ongoing talks between the administration and congressional leadership on a possible new congressional war authorization. The House and Senate left town last week so that members could go home to campaign for the midterm elections. Before Congress left, both chambers voted on a narrow measure that gave Obama the authority to train and arm Syrian rebel groups. Congress did not act on a more broad measure that would have given the President the authority to expand its effort against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. While Obama said he would welcome congressional authorization, Republicans and Democrats were split on whether he had authority from existing authorization focused on al Qaeda. Some thought that the President needed additional congressional approval. Most members of Congress expected the airstrikes to occur after they returned home to their districts, and privately, many of them conceded that they were relieved not to have to vote on a controversial topic just weeks before voters were to go to the polls in November. U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIS in Syria: What you need to know . House and Senate leaders said they were open to voting on a new measure giving new parameters for military action against ISIS, but not until after the election. Criticism of the air strikes is bipartisan, ranging from concern over mission creep to waging war unilaterally. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, a tea party favorite, ripped congressional leaders for skipping out on a debate on military action. ""It's irresponsible & immoral that instead of debating & voting on war, congressional leaders chose to recess Congress for nearly two months,"" he said in a tweet Monday night. Anti-war Republican, Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina, who like Kaine and Amash voted against arming the moderate Syrian rebels, said he was ""disappointed"" that the administration carried through with the airstrikes without congressional support. He co-authored a letter to House Speaker John Boehner urging a vote on war authorization. ""This reminds me of the Bush administration,"" he told CNN, referring to another expansion of military action. ""I am not sure how much more we can ask of the military and the taxpayers without Congress having a debate."" While supportive of the strikes, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Democratic House leadership, warned of mission creep, saying in a statement and in a tweet that the House should vote on a new war authorization that precludes any possibility of putting U.S. combat troops on the ground. U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIS in Syria: Who's in, who's out . Obama's supporters . Obama's supporters are usually his detractors. Most of the positive reaction from lawmakers came from those who have been the most strident in their push for military action were the first to respond, and they did so enthusiastically. On Monday, President Obama personally called House Speaker John Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to notify them that the military operation inside Syria would begin in the evening. Boehner said he supports the airstrikes, ""understanding that this is just one step in what must be a larger effort to destroy and defeat this terrorist organization."" Democrats and Republicans who lead key committees approved of the President's move, including House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, who said ""this is one step in what will be a long fight against ISIL,"" another acronym that refers to ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Share your view of the conflict . Before the strikes, Vice President Joe Biden reached out to one of the administration's most vocal critics, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who told CNN's Dana Bash that Biden told him the airstrikes would be ""intense"" and a ""sustained effort."" Graham said he told Biden he was ""very supportive"" of the administration's move and would do what was needed of him to corral Congress if further congressional authorization is needed. Campaign politics . ISIS has emerged as a campaign issue. Senate candidate Scott Brown, R-New Hampshire, released a television advertisement just after airstrikes in Syria commenced. While the ad didn't mention expanded military action into Syria, it tied his challenger, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, to the President, who has low approval ratings in New Hampshire. ""Anyone who turns on the TV these days knows we face challenges to our way of life. Radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country. President Obama and Sen. Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat. Not me,"" Brown says in the ad. Shaheen, meanwhile, continues to insist that a hard line be taken against ISIS, saying she has ""supported and will continue to support aggressive action to destroy ISIL.""

"(CNN) -- When CNN's Mike Rowe visited a bird sanctuary on his new series ""Somebody's Gotta Do It,"" he drew some heat from viewers. Ryan Thompson, of Chandler, Arizona, posted this on Rowe's Facebook account: . ""Hey Mike, love the new show ... I watched the last episode with the cranes and the birds suits (little weird ... but whatever). One question came to mind though -- is that place funded privately or by the government? I kept thinking it's one of those places that costs the tax payers millions each year to keep the doors open."" Another viewer, Panier De Fraises, wrote: . ""You did a disservice to Operation Migration and the whooping crane project on ""Somebody's Gotta Do It."" You came across as bored and disdainful. You say you work for the people who watch you and not the people who pay you -- OK. You're on probation."" Rowe's response: . ""Hi Panier . Fair enough. I've been on probation my whole career, and I'll be grateful to remain there as long as you can tolerate me. But for what it's worth, you're mistaken. I was neither bored nor disdainful of anything I saw at the whooping crane facility. In fact, I was genuinely impressed with Dr. French and his team, and glad to give their program some national exposure. Now it's true - I didn't swoon in their presence, or behave as though I agreed with every single thing I heard. Dr. French was very clear about why he does what he does - he believes the whooping crane has as much right to exist as we do. I doubt that everyone shares that view. Should they? Whooping cranes were nearly hunted into extinction, and left homeless as their natural environment was systematically eliminated by short-sighted Homo sapiens. Personally, that makes me sad and angry. Thus, I'm happy to shine a light on Dr. French's efforts, and pay some money to see the whooping crane survive. But Ryan asks a very fair question. How much? More than the spotted owl? Less than the whales? Should there be a limit on what we spend to save an endangered species? Depending on your worldview, questions like these are annoying. But they are nevertheless important, because we're all in this together. Is the whooping crane more valuable than the snow leopard? What about the desert tortoise? Or The black rhino? Exactly how bad are we supposed to feel when a species exits planet earth? Is it a tragedy? An ecological disaster? Or just a damn shame? Lot's of people are currently worried about overfishing -- specifically, the depletion of the worlds tuna stocks. Some people are worried because they're concerned about the rising price of tuna. Others are worried about its long term viability as a delicious menu item. And others are protesting because they believe it's morally wrong to eat them. The difference is important, because an individuals worldview will absolutely inform their opinion about basic conservation. According to some other show I just narrated for some other channel, there are approximately 8.7 million species on the planet, give or take 1.3 million. (If a 1.3 million delta seems high, consider that the previous estimate put the number of total species on Earth between 3 million and 100 million, which is somewhat baffling in and of itself.) But here's the most intriguing statistic -- of the 8.7 million species now estimated to inhabit the planet, approximately 88% have yet to be discovered, described and cataloged. That strikes me as rather extraordinary. Point is, you could fill a library with what we don't know about biodiversity. And yet, many people have a deep and abiding conviction about the proper way to discuss the plight of endangered animals. You seem offended Panier, because my attitude did not reflect the seriousness that you believe this topic deserves. You weren't alone. But consider -- many others were equally offended because I gave a platform to a man who believes that all creatures on the planet are entitled to the same right to exist as humans. A lot of people told me that with 7,000 children dying every year from hunger, the plight of the whooping crane was not worth my time. Thus, addressing this topic in a light-hearted television show is guaranteed to offend somebody. If you watch the episode again, (assuming I'm still on probation,) I think you'll see that we tried to focus on the human elements -- the simple joy that Dr. French and his team take in their work, and the passion they bring to their job each and every day. Experts call it ""congruency,"" that rare and wondrous state that occurs when your beliefs and your actions line up perfectly, and net out in a vocation or avocation that you truly love. Dr. French is first and foremost, congruent, and thus, perfectly suited for SGDI. Are his efforts worth the cost? Was I disrespectful? Is there no room for levity? Those are fair questions upon which reasonable people might disagree. But one thing's for sure -- the cranes are damn lucky to have the good doctor in their corner. And I wish them both every success."" CNN's Rebecca Angel Baer contributed to this story.","Viewers accuse CNN's Mike Rowe of doing a ""disservice"" to a project aimed at saving whooping cranes .

"(CNN) -- Two weeks after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, finding it remains a global search-and-rescue effort. The bulk of the attention is on the southern Indian Ocean, where a commercial satellite photographed objects that Australian authorities say could be related to the search. Authorities have called the find the best lead yet on where the missing plane might be, and it has prompted a massive search in the area more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) southwest of Australia. So far, they have turned up nothing. What's the very latest? Australian officials say six planes were continuing the search Saturday after nothing was found in the area Friday. Britain's The Telegraph published what it said was part of a transcript of the final communications between the Malaysia Airlines flight cockpit and air traffic controllers. It shows only routine technical chatter. CNN has not independently verified that the transcript is genuine. The CEO of Malaysia Airlines confirmed that the plane was carrying lithium-ion batteries. And authorities said they're aware of a news report that the plane's pilot placed a cell phone call shortly before the flight departed. What's the significance of the phone call? There may not be any, but in a mystery as big as this one, investigators will check out any lead to see if it's important. And what about the batteries? Lithium-ion batteries are the type commonly used in laptops and cell phones, and have been known to explode, although it is a rare occurrence. A fire attributed to lithium-ion batteries caused the fatal 2010 crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai. Lithium-ion batteries used to power components in Boeing 787 aircraft were also implicated in a series of fires affecting that plane. So, in theory, a cargo of the batteries could have caused a fire that led Flight 370 to crash. But Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told reporters the batteries were routine cargo. ""They are not declared dangerous goods,"" he said, adding that they were ""some small batteries, not big batteries."" It's been two days since we saw the satellite photos of floating objects. Why haven't searchers found anything? The area being searched is enormous and remote. Aircraft can stay over the scene just two hours before having to return to base. And given that the objects spotted on satellite could have drifted hundreds of miles since they were photographed Sunday, or maybe have even sunk by now, finding them isn't a simple proposition. Japan is sending surveillance planes, more merchant ships are on the way, and Australia, Britain, China and Malaysia are all sending ships to the area -- a remote region far from commercial shipping and air lanes. Is it possible that the plane would have gone that far? Investigators think so. They concluded the plane flew for hours after disappearing from radar, and calculated a pair of arcs running north and south from the Malay Peninsula for likely locations. Based on those trajectories, the amount of fuel on board and other factors, experts believe the plane could have made it to the southern Indian Ocean. When will we know whether the objects are from the missing flight? Maybe never. Searchers might miss them, or they might have sunk by now. But even if they do find the objects, the process of determining whether they're from the missing flight could still be lengthy. ""We have to locate it, confirm that it belongs to the aircraft, recover it and then bring it a long way back to Australia, so that could take some time,"" said John Young, general manager of emergency response for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, . Could pieces of the plane still be floating? Probably not any big pieces, according to Steve Wallace, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's former director of accident investigation. But pieces of lightweight debris, such as life jackets and seat cushions, can float for days after an aircraft strikes the water, he said. If it's not the plane, what else could it be? Almost anything big and buoyant. The objects were spotted in a part of the Indian Ocean known for swirling currents called gyres that can trap all sorts of floating debris. Among the leading contenders for what the objects might be, assuming they're not part of Flight 370: shipping containers that fell off a passing cargo vessel. There are reasons to doubt that theory, however. The area isn't near commercial shipping lanes, and the larger object, at an estimated 79 feet (24 meters), would seem to be nearly twice as long as a standard shipping container. If it is the plane, would its location tell us anything about what happened on that flight? If it really is the wreckage of the Boeing 777-200, its far southern location would provide investigators with precious clues into what terrible events unfolded to result in the disappearance and loss of the airliner, according to Robert Goyer, editor-in-chief of Flying magazine and a commercial jet-rated pilot. ""The location would suggest a few very important parameters. The spot where searchers have found hoped-for clues is, based on the location information provided by the Australian government, nearly 4,000 miles from where the airliner made its unexpected and as yet unexplained turn to the west,"" Goyer wrote. The first obvious clue is that the airplane flew for many hours. What do the satellite images show? Two indistinct objects, one about 79 feet (24 meters) in length and the other about 16 feet (5 meters) long. Though they don't look like much to the untrained observer, Australian intelligence imagery experts who looked at the pictures saw enough to pass them along to the maritime safety agency, Young said. ""Those who are expert indicate they are credible sightings. And the indication to me is of objects that are reasonable size and are probably awash with water, bobbing up and down out of the surface,"" he said. How old are the images? They were taken by commercial satellite imaging company DigitalGlobe on Sunday. Why did we first hear about them on Thursday, then? Basically, the Australians say, it's because the Indian Ocean is a very big place. The maritime safety authority said it took four days for the images to reach it ""due to the volume of imagery being searched and the detailed process of analysis that followed."" Who is running the search? The Australians are in charge of the search in their area of responsibility, which includes a large area of the southern Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast. Malaysia remains in overall control of the search. How did they know to look in this area? Investigators analyzing satellite pings sent by the plane concluded it was traveling along one of two arcs away from the Malay Peninsula. U.S. officials have said they believe the plane most likely traveled south and crashed into the Indian Ocean. Searchers narrowed the area of interest by calculating the most likely locations based on time in the air, fuel usage and other factors. It's already been 14 days. Are we running out of time to find this plane? The locator beacons attached to flight data recorders are designed to ping for at least 30 days, but will probably keep going at full strength up to five days longer, said Anish Patel, president of Dukane Seacom Inc., the Florida company that believes it made Flight 370's beacons. ""Our predictive models and lab tests show 33-35 days of output before we drop below the minimal values,"" Patel told CNN. ""Depending on the age of the battery, it could continue pinging for a few days longer."" Pinging is one thing. Finding the pings is another. Not only is the area being searched vast, it is deep -- up to 13,000 feet in many places. Given that the pingers can be detected from no more than about two miles away, they could be hard to hear if they're on the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean. Layers of different water temperatures could also make it tough to pick up the sound of the beacons, experts say. LIVE: Latest updates on the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner .

"(CNN) -- Who shouts ""Ebola"" on a crowded airplane? The same person who yells ""fire"" in a crowded theater even when there are no flames. The worldwide panic around the Ebola virus and its mostly deadly consequences is starting to inspire tricksters, hucksters and attention hogs to test the limits of the people around them. While these agitators are finding zero tolerance for that kind of speech, people's daily lives and travels are being disrupted by the fear and panic surrounding the virus. Already, it's cleared a courtroom, emptied a city bus and frightened passengers on several aircraft. It clears the room . Joseph Britton shut down the courtroom at Broward County, Florida's main jail with his Friday morning claim that he had Ebola, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Britton made the claim to Broward Judge John ""Jay"" Hurley, who was holding bond hearings from the main county courthouse via closed-circuit television. The jail was placed on lockdown while Britton's claim was investigated. Officials don't think he has Ebola, but such claims tend to ratchet up the government's response. Britton was taken the hospital to be tested, and the areas where he had been located were being disinfected. Want to bet that Britton, who was arrested Thursday on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and other offenses, may get in even more trouble? Epidemics throughout history . Ebola on a plane .

"(CNN) -- Amazon may be coming out with its own smartphone, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The company reportedly is working with Foxconn to develop the hardware, which will likely run Amazon's version of the Android operating system. A phone isn't as far-fetched of an undertaking as it might seem for the company, which has never made a handset. Amazon already has many of the building blocks it would need to make money off a smartphone, including its own version of the Android operating system, an established app store and well-stocked content marketplaces that could make up a good chunk of revenue for the phone. It also has a pool of loyal customers who trust the brand. Amazon is relatively new to the hardware game. The company's first entry was the Kindle e-reader released in 2007, followed by its Android-powered big brother, the Kindle Fire tablet. Amazon has had more success than many other companies in the tablet market thanks to getting in early and a low price made possible by revenue from books, movies and music. However, the smartphone market is already filled with well-established competitors. Current market leader Samsung shipped 42.2 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2012, according to research firm IDC. Apple was a close second with 35.1 million smartphones, followed at a distance by Nokia and Research In Motion. There are also some challenges unique to selling smartphones. To build a decent device, Amazon will need the right patents so it doesn't end up on the receiving end of costly lawsuits. To that end, the company just hired a new general manager for patent acquisitions and investments, Matt Gordon. Dealing with carriers would be another hurdle. Ina Fried at AllThingsD floated an intriguing theory: Amazon could buy wireless service wholesale from the big carriers and bundle it with the devices, like it does for the Kindle. The rumor that Amazon would unveil a smartphone late this year surfaced in November 2011, when Citigroup's research department predicted the device based on its supply chain checks in Asia. The new report, based on two anonymous sources ""with knowledge of the matter"" supports the original theory floated by Citigroup.","Report: Amazon is working on a smartphone .

"(CNN) -- Most Latinas have goals to graduate and get professional jobs, but challenges including discrimination and gender stereotyping undermine their chances of success, a new survey shows. Many Latinas doubt their  chances for academic and career success, the report found. The discrimination -- sometimes from teachers and fellow students -- affects the young women's self-confidence and performance, leading to lower graduation rates, according to the report released last week by the National Women's Law Center and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.  ""About 80 percent of the students surveyed want to graduate from college and perhaps go further,"" the report said. ""And 98 percent reported that they wanted to graduate from high school. Yet the dropout rates of Latinas are extremely high."" The survey was based on 335 responses received from schools and programs in various parts of the country, with follow-up interviews and focus groups, plus a review of existing research, according to the report.  Out of the young women surveyed, one-third do not expect to achieve their educational goals for various reasons, it said. ""Many Latinas are influenced by family and societal expectations, often based on stereotypes of Latinas as submissive underachievers and caretakers,"" the report said. ""When these stereotypes are internalized, they may cause Latinas to doubt their chances for academic and career success.""  Alarming rise in Latina drop-out rate » . They also face a series of other challenges, including poverty, immigration status, limited English and lack of parental involvement, it said. Most don't attend early childhood education programs because their schools don't have enough resources, according to the report. Students who are undocumented or whose parents are in the United States illegally face anxiety caused by instability, and do not have the financial advantages and opportunities their American counterparts have, it said. Their parents are unfamiliar with the education system and thus do not take part in school activities.  ""Limited English proficiency can make students more likely to fall behind and increase the risk of dropout,"" the report said. ""Moreover, many Latinas lack relationships with role models in the community who can help them to set goals and to envision themselves reaching those goals regardless of their family circumstances."" The report examines some of the reasons for the disparity and lagging performance, and seeks to improve their graduation rates and chances of success. The recommendations include:  -- Congressional investment in Latino children through early education initiatives and child care, and outreach to Latino families.  -- More outreach to Latinas in schools, including providing them with role models.  -- College preparation by schools for Latinas, with funding from Congress.  -- More school measures to stop discrimination in educational programs and activities.  -- School use of comprehensive, age-appropriate material to teach sex education to avoid the rising pregnancy rates among teen Latinas, and additional support for those who get pregnant. At 45 million, Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States, and it has a growth rate twice that of the general population. According to projections, by 2025, one-quarter of American teens will be Latinos.","Survey: Discrimination affects Latinas' self-confidence and performance .

"Washington (CNN) -- The death of Ben Bradlee, the iconic editor of The Washington Post who oversaw the paper's coverage of the Watergate scandal and the Pentagon Papers, saddened the industry he influenced Tuesday night. ""Ben was a true friend and genius leader in journalism. He forever altered our business,"" the two reporters who broke the newspaper's Watergate stories, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, said in a statement. ""His one unbending principle was the quest for the truth and the necessity of that pursuit. He had the courage of an army,"" the two said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When a downtrodden Tunisian street vendor set himself on fire in protest after his vegetable cart was confiscated by officials, this desperate act of self-sacrifice was seen as a catalyst for a revolution that became known as the Arab Spring. Contrast this with China, where almost 80 people -- men and women -- have self-immolated since 2009 in protest against Beijing's poor treatment of Tibet, according to rights groups. Yet details of these cases are often sketchy and difficult to verify, such is the stranglehold China has over the region. As a result the issue has yet to gain real traction internationally. Beijing has consistently rejected claims it is guilty of oppression in the region and insists Tibetans enjoy religious freedom and better living standards under its rule. Yet the self-immolations continue. This week, a 34-year-old father of two burned himself to death in front of a mine in the western province of Gansu, while another 25-year-old man set himself alight near a monastery in neighboring Qinghai province -- which borders Tibet, known by China as the Tibet Autonomous Region. Both cases were confirmed by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. According to the Tibetan government-in-exile and Tibetan rights groups, the victims died chanting slogans calling for freedom for the Tibetan people and the return from exile of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. This brought the number of deaths by self-immolation to 15 in November alone -- the same month that China's political elite ushered in its next generation of leaders during the 18th Party Congress. In their keynote addresses, leaders, both old and new, appeared to strike a conciliatory tone. In his first speech as Communist Party leader last week, Xi Jinping stressed the need for unity in a country where the Party was becoming too distant from the people. This followed predecessor Hu Jintao's comments to Congress delegates that the Party ""should consolidate and develop socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance and harmony so that all ethnic groups in China will live and develop together in harmony."" But activists warn that if the Chinese government continues to tighten its grip on the Tibetan people in the name of stability, it will only create more resentment. They point to the growing list of young victims prepared to take such extreme action, which they say reflects a desperate and painful state of mind for many. The Tibet Autonomous Region is heavily policed by Chinese security forces, with Internet content controlled by local authorities and access by foreign media largely prohibited, making reliable information almost impossible to come by. Pro-Tibetan groups such as the International Tibet Network, say thousands of people have died over the years under China's tenure, through torture, execution, suicides and starvation -- though CNN cannot verify these claims. The groups also claim Tibetans have gradually become the minority population in their own homeland, as Han Chinese -- China's main ethnic group -- have migrated to the region. London-based Free Tibet says the construction of a rail link to Tibet's capital, Lhasa, in 2006 -- part of China's Western Development Strategy (WDS) -- was intended to cement its control over the restive western regions of China, particularly Tibet and Xinjiang, where separatism remains strong. ""The incidents are a clear indication of the genuine grievances of the Tibetans and their sense of deep resentment and despair over the prevailing conditions in Tibet,"" Tibetan leader in exile, Lobsang Sangay, said earlier this year. His government-in-exile has repeatedly called on the international community to intervene to prevent further bloodshed. Chinese authorities insist that self-immolations are isolated incidents and most Tibetans do not sympathize with or support such actions. A senior official from Sichuan, a province with a large Tibetan population that has seen the most self-immolation cases so far, says he knows exactly who's to blame -- the Dalai Lama: the man Beijing calls a ""terrorist."" ""They plot, incite and instigate -- the root cause for such acts is the Dalai Lama clique,"" Li Changping told CNN. ""His loyalists have called those who committed self-immolation national heroes or freedom fighters, vowing to build them monuments and rewarding their families with lots of money."" The Dalai Lama has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence, saying he wants only an autonomy that would offer protection for their traditional Buddhist culture. During an address to Japanese lawmakers in Tokyo earlier this month, he blamed ""narrow-minded Communist officials"" for seeing Buddhist culture as a threat. He then called on Chinese authorities to investigate and address the causes of the recent surge in self-immolations. ""I always ask the Chinese government: Please, now, thoroughly investigate. What is the cause of these sort of sad things?"" Beijing's claim over the region is rooted in history. It says Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th century, when the Mongol empire, which conquered China and formed the Yuan dynasty, also conquered Tibet. Western and central parts of Tibet are administered by China as the Tibet Autonomous Region, while eastern parts of the region fall under China's Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan and Gansu provinces. After several decades of de facto independence beginning in 1912, Tibet was over-run by China's People's Liberation Army in 1950 to enforce the newly-formed People's Republic of China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet. In 1959, thousands of Tibetans surrounded the Dalai Lama's palace in Lhasa â€” the Tibetan capital -- to protect him against what was rumored to be a plot by the Chinese military to abduct him. The gathering turned into an all-out revolt against Chinese rule, which was suppressed by the PLA. The Dalai Lama fled to India, where he has remained in exile ever since. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","Two more Tibetans self-immolated in the past week in protest against Chinese rule .

"New York (CNN) -- A Salvador Dali painting stolen from a Manhattan art gallery last week has been returned to the United States, New York police said. The 1949 painting ""Cartel de Don Juan Tenorio"" was taken June 19 from the Venus Over Manhattan gallery by a man posing as a potential customer, according to a police statement. It is valued at $150,000. On Friday, New York police picked up the painting at customs and returned the artwork to the gallery, Lt. John Grimpel said. ""The gallery believes it to be the original painting,"" Grimpel said. He added that the piece appeared to be in good shape, though it was returned without its frame.

"(CNN) -- An American missionary was fatally shot in Mexico on Wednesday, police said. The preliminary investigation indicated that Nancy Davis, 59, and her husband were traveling on a Mexican highway near the city of San Fernando, Mexico, when they were confronted by gunmen in a black pickup, the Pharr Police Department in Texas said in a statement. San Fernando is south of the border city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state. ""The gunmen were attempting to stop them and the victims accelerated in efforts of getting away from them,"" the police statement said. ""At a certain point the gunmen discharged a weapon at the victim's vehicle and a bullet struck the victim Nancy Shuman Davis on the head.""

"(CNN) -- A doctor who has played a key role in fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone is infected with the disease, according to that country's Ministry of Health. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, Tim Shenk, an agency spokesman, told CNN. Until falling ill, Khan had been overseeing Ebola treatment and isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of the capital Freetown. Citing patient confidentiality, Shenk declined to provide additional details about Khan's condition. The Ministry of Health took to Facebook to deny reports the doctor had died. The ministry ""wishes the general public and all partners working in the healthcare sector to know that . ... Khan is still alive and responding to treatment contrary to social media report of his demise,"" according to a Facebook post. Sanjay Gupta: 'It only took moments' Sierra Leone has had 427 confirmed cases of Ebola and 144 deaths, according to figures released Wednesday by the health ministry. That puts it, along with Guinea, at the center of an outbreak of the virus that has steadily spread through western Africa since it began earlier this year. More than 1,000 people have contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. Ebola typically kills 90% of those infected, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% thanks to early treatment. What is Ebola, and why does it kill? Officials believe that the Ebola outbreak has taken such a strong hold in West Africa due to the proximity of the jungle -- where the virus originated -- to Conakry, which has a population of 2 million. Since symptoms don't immediately appear, the virus can easily spread as people travel around the region. Once the virus takes hold, many die in an average of 10 days as the blood fails to clot and hemorrhaging occurs. The disease isn't contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms include fever, headache and fatigue. At that point, the Ebola virus is spread via bodily fluids. Get the fast facts on Ebola . Health workers are at especially high risk, since they are in close contact with infected people and their bodily fluids. Adding to the danger, in the initial stages of infection doctors may mistake an Ebola infection for another, milder illness. Aside from his work on Ebola, Khan also serves as the lead physician of the hospital's Lassa Fever Program, another fearsome tropical disease. The hospital's official biography page states Khan took on that job when his predecessor died of Lassa Fever.

"(CNN) -- Everyday Americans now have the power to advise congressmen and influence legislation through Project Madison, a new online platform that implements public suggestions on pending laws. Here's the kicker: It was designed by a Republican. Thanks to their pioneering use of the Internet to raise money and mobilize supporters in the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns, Democrats have gained a reputation in recent years as being ahead of Republicans in embracing digital tools. Witness 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain's public comments about his unfamiliarity with e-mail. But since 2010, conservatives have actually begun to outrank their Democrat rivals as technology trailblazers. From introducing a social network for crowdsourced legislation to their recent show of strength on Twitter, Republicans have made strides to rid themselves of the Luddite label. Perhaps the most impressive display of their new tech-savvy direction is Project Madison, the nickname for a crowdsourcing platform that allows citizens to amend individual passages of legislation by adding or striking language. Citizens are encouraged to like or dislike each change, with the most popular suggestions rising to the top. Additionally, individual users and organizations must reveal their identity, so the source of every suggestion is transparent. ""Technology should reduce the size of government,"" Project Madison's creator, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told me recently after launching an effort to expand Project Madison to the entire legislative docket. ""Transparency tells us where government is building up bureaucracy."" The language of small government, reduced regulation, and transparency has helped galvanize conservatives to support the use of technological tools and technology-friendly legislation. Issa and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor were influential in boosting a massive online protest against the regulation-heavy Stop Online Piracy Act, which would have penalized websites that host pirated content and faced near-unanimous opposition from the technology industry. Cantor also appointed a separate technology communications director, Matt Lira, who, among many projects, helped launched YouCut, a digital platform that allows the public to choose which federal programs Republicans will propose to cut. ""Because technology has the potential of making government more efficient, less expensive to run, and more accountable, it's not surprising that the Republicans are ahead of the Democrats in the use of technology in governing,"" says Andrew Rasiej, founder and publisher of Tech President, a blog about the intersection of politics and technology. While both parties in Congress have generally agreed on transparency issues, such as a 72-hour online viewing window before laws are passed, these digital tools of direct democracy have recently been a signature pursuit of Republicans. The glacial speed of Congress can make it difficult to assess the impact of technological advancement, but there are signs these tools are making a difference. Issa's proposed alternative to SOPA, the OPEN Act, adopted some specific suggestions from the online community through Project Madison, including a provision to protect owners of a website domain name from the illicit actions of the person who runs the website. And the DATA Act, a Republican-led bill to let citizens track federal spending online, has passed the House. This GOP commitment to technology has extended to social networks as well. A recent study by Edelman Digital found that Republican members of Congress use Twitter more effectively than their Democratic counterparts. According to the study, conducted over nearly four months in late 2011, Republican lawmakers had nearly twice the Twitter interaction -- mentions, replies, and retweets -- as did Democrats. A study by the University of Michigan, examining the 2010 midterm elections, found similar results. It concluded that ""conservative candidates used this medium (Twitter) more effectively, conveying a coherent message and maintaining a dense graph of connections."" The authors of the University of Michigan study also praised what they saw as impressive consistency across the messages of the Tea Party, the grassroots small-government movement that has managed to unseat powerful Republican incumbents such as Sen. Richard Lugar. Meanwhile, the left-leaning Occupy Wall Street movement has been criticized for an incoherent agenda and is sputtering towards political oblivion. Republicans have made a concerted effort to beef up their social-media presence since 2008, in part by recruiting tech-savvy staffers to train members of Congress in how to use social networks. Unfortunately for them, these digital-messaging skills haven't always spilled over into general campaigning. President Obama's re-election team has hired an army of PhDs to construct the ""Dashboard,"" a so-called Holy Grail of campaign tech that orchestrates volunteer canvassing in real time. The system relays crucial data back to a team of statisticians, who then can reroute the entire organization to optimally target malleable voters. When it comes to the liberal tradition of grassroots organizing, Democrats still may have a home-field advantage. Yet when it comes to actual governing, Republicans have shed their Luddite stereotype. This means Democrats have a reason to up their game as well. Let's hope these innovations spark a high-tech arms race that will raise the bar for how America is governed in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Ferenstein.","A Republican-designed online platform implements public suggestions on pending laws .

"(CNN) -- The trainer at the center of a major horse doping scandal has been charged with multiple breaches of the rules by the British Horseracing Authority. Employed by the ruler of Dubai's prestigious Godolphin operation-- Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum -- trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni has been summoned to attend a disciplinary hearing in central London on Thursday. Testers from the BHA found anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- in 11 samples taken from 45 horses from Godolphin's Newmarket stable in eastern England. Sheikh Mohammed said he was ""locking down"" the stables with immediate effect and ordering an internal review. Anabolic steroids work on horses as they do on humans -- helping to build strength and muscle. Al Zarooni, who has admitted using the banned substances in error, faces charges relating to the use of prohibited substances, keeping medication records and conduct ""prejudicial to horse racing"". In addition to the 11 horses that tested positive on April 9, Al Zarooni in co-operating with the investigating officers also admitted that he had given steroids to four more horses. That quartet were not subjected to testing. ""As these additional horses were not tested and no positive samples exist, no charges are brought in relation to them (prohibited substances) and as such the trainer remains facing the original 11 counts of this charge at this stage,"" said the BHA. ""However, it is appropriate to charge the trainer with breaches of the rules related to medication records and conduct prejudicial to horse racing related to these horses, and therefore the trainer now faces 15 counts of these charges. Earlier this week Al Zarooni said, in a statement by Godolphin, that he had a made a ""catastrophic error."" He added: ""I deeply regret what has happened because the horses involved were not racing at the time, I did not realize that what I was doing was in breach of the rules of racing. ""I can only apologize for the damage this will cause to Godolphin and to racing generally."" Godolphin is one of the world's most successful stables, with more than 2,000 race wins since it was formed in 1992. It has been named Champion British Owner eight times, including last year, while Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed and his family have also taken the title on multiple occasions going back to the 1980s. Meanwhile Sheikh Mohammed pledged to ""lock down"" Goldophin's Moulton Paddocks stables and test every horse at its Newmarket operation. ""I was appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables in Newmarket has violated Godolphin's ethical standards and the rules of British racing,"" he said. Stable lockdown . ""I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. There can be no excuse for any deliberate violation. ""Godolphin is fully cooperating with the British Horseracing Authority to get to the bottom of this matter and take any appropriate disciplinary action. ""I have ordered the Godolphin management to undertake an immediate review of our internal procedures and controls to ensure to prevent any reoccurrence of this type of activity in any stables of mine. ""We will be locking down the Moulton Paddocks stables with immediate effect, and I have instructed that I want a full round of blood samples, and dope testing done on every single horse on that premises. ""I can assure the racing public that no horse will run from that yard this season until I have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean."" Zarooni joined Godolphin in March 2010 and won the St. Leger, one of Britain's five classics, in his first season. But the sanctions now facing the 37-year-old at the disciplinary hearing include substantial fines, the withdrawal of his training licence or a suspension from the sport. Stanozolol was still legal as recently as 2008, when Big Brown won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in the U.S. after having regular injections. His trainer's admission, and the subsequent outcry, led to the drug being widely banned. The BHA said there has only been one other case of anabolic steroids being found in a tested horse in recent years, which was when British trainer Howard Johnson allowed horses to run under the substances in 2008 and 2009. The use of anabolic steroids is now prohibited at all times for any horse registered as ""in training"" under the care of a trainer licensed by the BHA. However, it is still legal for out-of-competition use in Australia, such as helping to overcome injuries. The BHA carries out testing during race meetings and while horses are in training. In 2012, the organization tested 7,182 samples from a total of 90,174 runners -- 14 of which returned positive results. The BHA conducted between 600-700 tests in 2012 while horses were in training.","Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni charged with multiple breaches of horse racing rules .

"(CNN) -- The case of a Christian woman in Sudan who was sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith has cast new light on the plight of persecuted Christians worldwide. Sudan ranks as one of the worst countries for people who practice Christianity, but it by no means is alone. Like people of other faiths, Christians can face discrimination, harassment, arrest, jail time and even death for what they believe. Here's a look at seven terrible countries for Christians: . North Korea . For the 12th year in a row, North Korea tops the list of places where Christian persecution is most extreme, according to Open Doors, a group that ranks countries in order of persecution. The organization estimates as many as 70,000 Christians are imprisoned in labor camps. ""The God-like worship of the leader, Kim Jong-Un, and his predecessors leaves no room for any other religion, and Christians face unimaginable pressure in every sphere of life,"" the group says on its website. ""Forced to meet only in secret, they dare not share their faith even with their families, for fear of imprisonment in a labor camp. Anyone discovered engaging in secret religious activity may be subject to arrest, disappearance, torture, even public execution."" Among those imprisoned is Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American. Pyongyang sentenced him last year to 15 years of hard labor, accusing him of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. He is widely reported to have been conducting Christian missionary work in North Korea. Kenneth Bae worried about his health in North Korean camp . Sudan . Since 1999, the U.S. State Department has tracked the world's worst abusers of religious rights. Sudan has been on the list since its inception. The country has arrested and deported Western Christians suspected of spreading their faith, according to a State Department report. Recently, Sudan also arrested and sentenced a woman to die for refusing to renounce her Christian faith. The 27-year old woman was released after weeks of international controversy over her conviction. She was later detained with her husband and two children, accused of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information. Eritrea . Just four religious groups are officially allowed to openly practice their faith in this African nation; the rest are subject to detention or worse. So if you're not an Eritrean Orthodox Christian, a Sunni Muslim, a Roman Catholic or an Evangelical Lutheran, life could be tough for you here. Harsh detentions for religious dissenters are the norm, according to the State Department report. Members of various religious groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, face retaliation for refusing to participate in military portions of mandatory national service, the report reads. The government is said to penalize Jehovah's Witnesses by denying them government services and entitlements. As of November, 52 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned in Eritrea, according to the Jehovah's Witnesses website. It says none has been formally charged or tried. Saudi Arabia . The oil-rich monarchy doesn't even pretend to respect religious rights for any faith other than Islam. Sunni Islam is the official religion, and the country's constitution is based on the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed. The public practice of any other religion is prohibited, according to the State Department. Open Doors says most Christians in Saudi Arabia are expatriates from Asia or Africa. Last year, Christian migrant fellowships were raided, and worshipers were detained and deported, the group says. Nigeria . Nigeria is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group, vowed in 2009 to rid the nation's north of all non-Muslim influence, including Christians, according to The Voice of the Martyrs, another group that tracks the persecution of Christians. More than 3,000 people have been killed since then, the organization reports. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in recent years and have included the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls. Somalia . Pressure is increasing on Christians in this country, according to Open Doors. ""Islamic leaders and government officials publicly reinforce that there is no room for Christians, and there is a strong drive to purge Christianity from Somalia. The militant Islamist group, al-Shabaab, targets Christians and local communities,"" the group says on its site. The terror group is notorious for prohibiting recreational activities and has banned films, dancing and watching soccer in the past. It had also barred foreign aid organizations from southern Somalia, describing them as Western spies and Christian crusaders. Iraq . Religious minorities, such as Christians and Yazidis, make up less than 5% of Iraq's population. Since 2003, attacks against these minorities by insurgents and religious extremists have driven more than half of the minorities out of the country, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. According to Open Doors, attacks and threats against Christians rose last year as Islamic terrorist groups gained more influence. Militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, are in the midst of an offensive in Iraq. In the northern city of Mosul, the site of one of the first major ISIS victories, witnesses told CNN the group used vehicle-mounted loudspeakers to announce that it had decided to form Islamic Sharia courts in the city. The group also reportedly removed statues of the Christian Virgin Mary, Arab poet Abu Tammam and singer Mulla Othman, witnesses said. Militants' advance threatens Christians in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Neighbors said the house on Vermont Street in Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood had been vacant for years. Three years ago the now-defunct predatory lending bank Countrywide refused to renegotiate the ballooning interest rate on a mortgage filled with hidden clauses and traps. Instead, Countrywide sold the mortgage to Bank of America, which, in turn, initiated foreclosure proceedings. In the East New York neighborhood, one of the poorest parts of the United States, more than 16 per 1,000 homes are in foreclosure, the highest rate in New York City and one of the highest nationwide. Banks are foreclosing on homes at rates far faster than they can sell them.  In a report released this week, the Government Accountability Office, the independent research arm of Congress, found an increasing percentage of homes are going unused due to high rates of foreclosure and unemployment: ""Nonseasonal vacant properties have increased 51% nationally from nearly 7 million in 2000 to 10 million in April 2010, with 10 states seeing increases of 70% or more,"" the report said. In our down housing market, most foreclosed homes sit vacant for years and, neglected by the banks, fall into disrepair and further blight neighborhoods. You can literally walk down any block in East New York and see every sixth house or so boarded up.  One study in Los Angeles estimated that, between 2008 and 2012, all homeowners will lose $78.8 billion in home values due to foreclosure rates and blighted homes in their neighborhoods. Meanwhile, Tasha Glasgow has spent much of the last decade without a home, in and out of New York City's shelter system. Glasgow has an 8-year-old daughter with severe autism and a 5-year-old son. Struggling to find work while struggling to care for her kids, Glasgow thought her luck might change earlier this year when she received a voucher from the New York City government that would allow her to move out of the shelter system. But then, she says, that vital helping hand was abruptly pulled away, the voucher cut by Mayor Michael Bloomberg's recent austerity measures. This brings us to the newest front in the Occupy Wall Street movement: matching needy homes to needy families. This week, Occupy Wall Street organizers moved Glasgow and her family into the vacant Vermont Street home now owned by Bank of America. It only makes sense. Pulling the strings of Washington and using our tax dollars, big banks orchestrated a massive bailout for themselves but continue to offer no relief to homeowners suffering under the bad loans they made and the bad economy they created. In the last several years, homelessness in New York City has jumped 45%. Meanwhile, in 2009 when the unemployment rate in the city was 10.1%, unemployment topped 19.2% in East New York. Those who argue that Wall Street should be coddled while people in places like East New York have to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps have an unrealistic grasp of the depths of America's inequality. How can people like Tasha Glasgow pull herself up by her own bootstraps when she can't even afford boots? So the Occupy movement may be finding its next phase in helping struggling Americans across the United States keep their homes out of foreclosure or occupy vacant homes that have been foreclosed. Eviction defenses and occupations are planned in more than 20 cities. And the idea is catching on beyond organized protests. In Atlanta this week, police and movers refused to evict a 103-year-old woman from her home when the bank foreclosed on it. Of course, if you think foreclosing on a 103-year-old woman (and her 83-year-old daughter) is heartless, ask yourself at what age is it ever acceptable to kick struggling families out of their homes in a bad economy, only to leave the houses vacant and decaying? You can say that's just how banks work, like it or not. But that's the same excuse for why corrupt lenders like Countrywide initiated loans with terms so bad that its managers found themselves under criminal investigation. It's the same excuse for the banks causing the housing crisis and crashing our economy by making bad bets on subprime loans, and then begging the government to cover their losses. This is not capitalism. This is an anti-free market manipulation of our economy to benefit the 1% while hurting the rest of us. The United States economy, as Wall Street has rigged it, violates the principle of capitalism proffered by Adam Smith and the ideal of equal opportunity enshrined by our founders. To ""rescue"" our economy, we let big banks write down their bad debt. So, to rescue homeowners, banks must write down underwater mortgages, helping homeowners adjust the principle of their loans to reasonable, pre-bubble levels, keep families in their homes and stabilize the housing market. Millions of Americans have lost their homes. In 2010 alone, banks filed a record 3.8 million foreclosures. Totals for 2011 are expected to be even higher. Many people are living on the couches of relatives or spending their savings on low-end motel rooms or are homeless. A 2010 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 26 cities found the rate of homelessness had jumped a startling 9%. But the Occupy movement is bringing some hope and opportunity back to our nation, restoring the idea that our economy and our political system can and must work for the 99%. Granted, helping homeowners stop eviction orders and helping homeless families occupy empty, bank-owned homes is a short-term strategy, but one that will hopefully draw public attention to the injustice of millions of foreclosed homes and millions of homeless families, an injustice that banks could easily have addressed if they cared about our nation and our economy a fraction as much as they care about their bottom lines. Anyone who argues the Occupy movement isn't ""clear about its demands"" should talk with Tasha Glasgow. Washington's hands are tied by Wall Street and won't budge to create jobs, force the banks to adjust mortgages and cutour monstrous inequality. So it's up to we, the people, taking empty homes from banks that have already taken too much from all of us and giving them to hardworking and needy families. In doing so, the Occupy movement is not only creating opportunity for more and more Americans but also creating a home for the 99% in a political and economic system that has far too often kicked us all to the curb. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: Vacant building in Brooklyn represents new front for Occupy Wall Street .
She says organizers match foreclosed homes with needy families to redress inequality .
She says banks bailed out by taxpayers coldly foreclose, homes empty, homelessness up .

"(CNN) -- It may not have felt like it in the United States, but the world saw its warmest November on record last month, according to new data released Tuesday by U.S. observers. The global average temperature for November was just under 56.6 degrees Fahrenheit (13.7 C), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. That's about 1.4 degrees F over the 20th century's average and the second-highest November mark on land since records started being kept in 1880, NOAA said. North America was one of the few places that saw below-average temperatures for the month. That may be no surprise to Americans who were traveling over the snowy, slushy Thanksgiving holiday, but it put the continent in rare company. Only southwestern Greenland, north-central Australia and the seas off Tierra Del Fuego saw a cooler-than-average November, while eastern Europe and Asia saw much warmer temperatures for the month. Russia saw a particularly warm November, with parts of Siberia, the Ural Mountains and its Arctic islands recording temperatures up to 14 F (8 C) above an average that dates back to 1891, NOAA said. The data showed no record lows for the month anywhere on the globe. The figures, compiled by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center and NASA, include both land and ocean readings. They were released less than three months after the United Nations concluded that global warming was continuing, and that human activity -- particularly the consumption of fossil fuels, which release heat-trapping carbon dioxide -- is largely responsible. It's a controversial notion politically, but one long accepted by most scientists. November continued an unbroken string of 345 months of temperatures above the 20th-century average, with 37 consecutive Novembers topping that mark, according to NOAA. Longer-term, the global average for September through November was the second-warmest on record, trailing only 2005, and the year-to-date figure of 58.3 F (14.6 C) is the fourth-warmest on record.","November's global average temperature was the warmest on record .

"(CNN) -- A key provision of the health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama came under harsh criticism from the conservative majority of the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The justices debated a hotly contested issue testing the limits of government-mandated contraception coverage, specifically involving for-profit corporations that object to it for religious reasons. The justices appeared divided along ideological lines in a 90-minute oral argument, with the federal government offering a spirited defense of the Affordable Care Act. ""How does a corporation exercise religion?"" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor, summarizing perhaps the key constitutional question at hand. ""This is a religious question,"" said Justice Samuel Alito, suggesting the businesses have such a right. ""You want us to provide a definitive secular answer."" Before the hearing began, hundreds of demonstrators representing both sides of the issue rallied in front of the courthouse on Capitol Hill. The court is reviewing provisions of the Affordable Care Act requiring for-profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. At issue is whether certain companies can refuse to do so on the sincere claim it would violate their owners' long-established personal beliefs. Two separate appeals are being heard together. The outcome was uncertain, but the court could cast preliminary votes later this week. A final written ruling is expected by late June. 5 things to know about Obamacare and contraceptives . The cases involve two appeals from Conestoga Wood Specialties. The companion legal challenge comes from Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based arts and crafts retail giant. The Hahn family owns Conestoga and the Green family owns Hobby Lobby. Both corporations emphasize their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. That includes their leaders' publicly stated opposition to abortion. The cases present a complex mix of legal, regulatory, and constitutional concerns-- over such hot-button issues as faith, abortion, corporate power, executive agency discretion, and congressional intent. Political stakes . The political stakes are large, especially for the future effectiveness of Obamacare, which marks its fourth anniversary this week. The botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal site where consumers can sign up for insurance, has become another political flashpoint. Republicans claim the law, approved by Congress without their support, is unworkable and are campaigning furiously against it in this year's midterm elections. The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves three-pronged rules negotiated last year between the Obama administration and various outside groups. Under the changes, churches and houses of worship are exempt from the contraception mandate. Other nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor, must either offer coverage, or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement. Lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts. For-profit businesses in spotlight . The Hobby Lobby and Conestoga claims are in yet another Obamacare category: for-profit corporations claiming a religion-based exemption. These suits follow the high court's decision two years ago that narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law, a blockbuster ruling affirming that most Americans would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty, the so-called individual mandate. The constitutional debate shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same First Amendment rights as individuals. Three federal appeals courts have struck down the contraception coverage rule, while two others have upheld it. That ""circuit split"" made the upcoming Supreme Court review almost certain. A key issue for the bench will be interpreting a 1993 federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, requiring the government to seek the ""least burdensome"" and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions. Can companies, churches, and universities be included, or do the protections apply only to ""persons?"" ""Our family started Hobby Lobby built on our faith and together as a family,"" Barbara Green, Hobby Lobby co-owner, told CNN after the arguments. ""We believe that Americans don't lose their religious freedom when they open a family business. We were encouraged by today's arguments. We are thankful that the Supreme Court took our case and we prayerfully await the justice's decision."" Vocal backing for mandate . In the arguments on Tuesday, Obama's two appointees to the high court offered the most vocal backing of the mandate. ""Congress has given a statutory entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive coverage,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""And when the employer says, no, I don't want to give that, that woman is quite directly, quite tangibly harmed."" Sotomayor asked the lawyer for the companies: ""Is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it include items like blood transfusion, vaccines? For some religions, products made of pork? Is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis, could an employer preclude the use of those items as well?"" Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, arguing for the administration, said the case was really not about the government or the corporate officers: ""The rights of the third party employees are at center stage here."" ""In the entire history of this country, there is not a single case in which a for-profit corporation was granted an exemption"" on religious liberty grounds, when that would harm the rights of others, he added. Tough questions . Justice Anthony Kennedy -- who may prove the decisive vote -- posed tough questions on both sides. ""The government, through its healthcare plan -- under your view -- is allowing the employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous position, he said at one point to Paul Clement, representing the Greens and Hahns. ""The employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer. Do the religious beliefs just trump? Is that the way it works?"" Clement said there were other ways to ensure an employer did not have to violate her religious beliefs, while still giving workers the mandated coverage. ""Because you have a unique situation here, where their policy is about a government subsidy for a government-preferred health care item, and the question is who pays?"" said Clement. ""The government paying or a third-party insurer paying is a perfectly good least restrictive alternative."" Chief Justice John Roberts wondered whether government's interest was really ""compelling"" as required, when the administration had already granted so many coverage exemptions -- including to houses of worship, religious non-profits, small companies, and grandfathered health plans. He suggested corporate rights extend into a wider range of areas, including allowing companies-- along with individuals-- to bring racial discrimination claims. ""Does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race?"" he asked Verrilli. Kennedy later took issue with the government on another point. ""Under your view, a for-profit corporation could be forced in principle to pay for abortions,"" which is currently not allowed under federal law. ""No. I think, as you said, the law now is to the contrary,"" replied Verrilli, who said most women taking IUDs do not equate that with abortion. ""But your reasoning would permit that,"" said Kennedy, sharply. ""You say profit corporations just don't have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of their shareholders and owners."" ""Isn't that what we are talking about in terms of their religious beliefs?"" added Roberts. ""One of the religious beliefs is that they have to pay for these four methods of contraception that they (corporations) believe provide abortions."" Under the ACA, financial penalties of up to $100 per day per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage. Hobby Lobby, which has about 13,000 workers, estimates the penalty could cost it $475 million a year. Abortion rights groups urged the justices to again uphold a key tenet of Obamacare. ""What I think we saw today was the importance of having (three) women on the Supreme Court,"" said Cecile Richards, President, Planned Parenthood Action Fund. ""What's at stake in this case is whether millions of women and their right to preventive care including birth control is trumped by a handful of CEOs who have their own personal opinions about birth control."" The cases are Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (13-354); and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius (13-356).","Justices appear divided along ideological lines in oral argument .
Hobby Lobby, Conestoga Wood Specialties say they run their firms with Christian values .
Obamacare's contraception coverage requirements violate those values, they say .
Requirements apply to the corporations, not the individual owners, the government says ."
"(CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security has ordered U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to verify, ""effective immediately,"" that every foreign student who wants to enter the United States has a valid student visa, a U.S. government official told CNN on Friday. The memo went out earlier this week as part of an effort to reform the student visa system, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The effort is meant to provide the agency with real-time updates on all relevant information, the official said. News of the memo follows reports that two friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who are now charged in connection with the attack, may have been in the country on student visas that were no longer valid. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both 19 and from Kazakhstan, were charged this week on suspicion of obstruction of justice in connection with the case. They were already in federal custody on suspicion of violating the terms of their student visas when they were charged in the bombings case. The pair started at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in 2011, along with Tsarnaev. Kadyrbayev was not enrolled at the time of his arrest last month. His lawyer, Robert Stahl, told CNN his client had not been attending classes on a regular basis, as required by his visa. Tazhayakov's student status is less clear. According to the university, Tazhayakov is enrolled but was suspended pending the outcome of the current case. At an immigration court hearing this week, however, the court heard that Tazhayakov's status with the school was terminated January 3, according to a U.S. government official. The court also heard that Tazhayakov went to Kazakhstan in December 2012 and was allowed to return to the United States on January 20, despite the apparent lapse in his visa status, the same government official said. That news has outraged U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, head of the House Committee on Homeland Security. ""The fact that a foreign national was able to re-enter the U.S. with what appeared to be a valid student visa, while Customs and Border Protection officers were unaware that his visa status had become invalid, represents a serious hole in our national security,"" McCaul told CNN. ""The front-line CBP officers did not have access to the system that would've informed them of a change in legal status."" McCaul said it indicates ""disconnects"" and problems with information-sharing among Homeland Security agencies. Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Friday he also has concerns about gaps in the immigration system. ""It's surprising that the administration isn't already verifying that any student coming into the country has a valid student visa,"" Grassley said. ""What's more concerning is that nearly 12 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we haven't fixed the problems with identifying visa overstays."" Grassley sent a letter and list of questions Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, asking her about the apparent visa lapse with Tazhayakov and other possible loopholes. CNN's Jake Tapper, Joe Johns and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: Two U.S. lawmakers demand answers about their status .

"(CNN) -- With flights to Paris topping $1,000 these days, travel to France can be très cher. But you needn't cross the pond for that Gallic je ne sais quoi. Here are five enclaves in North America where French culture thrives: . Montreal,Quebec . Settled by French fur traders and later captured by the British, Montreal grew into a bilingual city with dual identities. And while myriad other tonguesare spoken thanks to a thriving immigrant population, it remains the second-largest Francophone city in the world after Paris. You'll hear bonjours and ca vas in every borough, but the most solidly French neighborhoods are east of Boulevard St.-Laurent -- the de facto border that separates it from the largely English-speaking west side. Linger over an espresso at one of the terrasses (patios) that line Rue St. Denis in the Latin Quarter. Then head to the vaunted L'Express, a classic Parisian bistro in Plateau Mont-Royal, where everything from the zinc bar to the tight quarters to the duck confit will spark flashbacks of Montmartre. Go for: The FrancoFolies is a festival celebrating Francophone music with some 250 live acts. June 14-22. Quebec City, Quebec . Founded by French explorer Samuel de Champlain more than 400 years ago, Quebec City, like Montreal, fell to the British crown a century and a half later. Its Gallic culture, however, remained firmly intact. Today, nearly 95% of the residents are native French speakers. The city's gabled roofs, winding streets and ramparts conjure an Old World feel. Vieux-Quebec (Old Town) is the only fortified city in North America north of Mexico. Get the full scoop on Quebec's French heritage at the Musée de la Civilization, where a new exhibition tells the story of Francophones who pulled up stakes to settle in North America with interactive features such as a hallway meant to evoke a departure dock. Around the corner, the cozy Café Le St. Malo, with its exposed brick walls and roaring hearth fire, serves up the kind of rustic fare you find in the French countryside, such as cassoulet (a one-pot dish of white beans and meat such as pork sausage and duck confit) and boudin noir (blood sausage). Go for: Quebecois celebrate the arrival of their ancestors in Canada at the Nouvelle France festival. August 7-11. New Orleans, Louisiana . Claimed by France as part of the Louisiana Territory in 1682, La Nouvelle-Orléans rose from a swamp on the bend of the Mississippi River to become a strategic port city. Named for the Regent of France, Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, the original town developed around what is now known as Jackson Square. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, a mix of nationalities flooded the city, creating the unique French/Creole-infused melting pot that is the Big Easy today. Nonetheless, remnants of its French heritage are evident throughout. For one, snacking on beignets and café au lait at the venerable Café du Monde in the French Quarter is as de rigueur for tourists as taking home Mardi Gras beads. History buffs who can't make it to the Louvre to see one of Napoleon Bonaparte's famous marble bathtubs -- he supposedly signed the Louisiana Purchase while in the tub -- can book Suite 730 at the 100-year-old Le Pavillon Hotel, near the French Quarter, to take a plunge in one said to have been owned by Napoleon (there are three total). A short walk away on Esplanade Avenue, the Degas House, a bed and breakfast and former home of artist Edgar Degas, hosts ""Bottles and Brushes"" evenings, where amateur artists can drink wine, paint and soak up the atmosphere in the studio of the French Impressionist master. Go for: In a nod to New Orleans' Gallic roots, French statesman Charles de Gaulle gave the city a Joan of Arc statue, an exact replica of one that stands in Orleans, which today presides over the French Market and is feted annually with a parade. January 6. Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, French territory . A remnant of France's exploits in Canada, these rocky islands some 15 miles off the coast of Newfoundland were deeded to the republic in 1816 under the second Treaty of Paris after a century-long tussle with England. Settlers eager to work in the islands' rich cod fishery came from Acadie, Brittany and Normandy in France and the Basque country, which includes parts of Spain and France. Another boom came during Prohibition, when smuggling spirits to the U.S. made some islanders rich. Today, the archipelago -- a ""territorial collectivity"" of France -- retains much of the character of its mother country. Most merchants close up shop at midday to lunch with their families at home. The baguettes and croissants are the real deal. The euro is the currency of the land, though many businesses accept Canadian and U.S. dollars.

Expelled by the British from what are now the Canadian Maritime provinces and northern Maine during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), many Acadians settled in south Louisiana, spawning a rich culture and their own dialect, Cajun French, that is still very much alive today. In some pockets, such as the small town of Arnaudville, French rules -- on street signs, in radio broadcasts, political ads and even as the sole language of some residents. At the Vermilionville Living History Museum and Folklife Park in Lafayette Parish, a replica of an Acadian village depicts life circa 1765-1890. For a modern taste of Cajun life, landmark Lafayette restaurants Randol's and Prejean's host live Cajun music and specialize in local favorites such as crawfish étouffée.

"(CNN) -- Pricey tourist trap, cultural experience, or both? A handful of readers took issue with a recent suggestion that Hawaii visitors skip the luau in a list of Hawaii do's and don'ts. And the luau was just one topic in the stream of suggestions CNN.com commenters offered for making the most of a trip to the Aloha State. Here are some of the tips. Agree or disagree? Share your thoughts below. Luau . DO NOT skip the luau, say multiple commenters, in response to one author's advice to give it a miss. ""Shame on you. Don't go to a luau? For goodness sake, how else can tourists connect with even a small part of Hawaiian culture?"" asked a commenter with the handle Stanley Steamer. ""Just try to find one given by a church or as a fundraiser for a community organization -- it will be completely authentic,"" commenter Etian said. ""If you really want to go to a mainstream luau, try the Old Lahaina Luau on Maui or our second choice, the Polynesian Cultural Center's on Oahu,"" sankoji02 added. Another reader also votes for the Polynesian Cultural Center, writing, ""It's equal part comedy act, culture museum and hands on activities like learning to hula, playing native games, crafts, etc."" Safety . DO NOT leave your belongings unattended on popular beaches in Honolulu, ""not even long enough to just dip your toes,"" cautioned reader James C Gray. Another commenter, Kolohegirl, agrees with this advice, especially in Waikiki, but added, ""This is NOT true on the outer islands. You can definitely take a dip away from your stuff and it will still be there when you get back."" DO skip Waikiki altogether, some commenters say. ""Avoid the 'famous' beaches like Waikiki,"" wrote commenter Henry Miller, who uses the tagline ""professional curmudgeon."" ""I lived on Oahu for a lot of years and found the northern and western beaches to be a whole lot less crowded and a whole lot more pleasant."" Adventures . DO check out the free-to-watch surfing contests in late November and December, Lise Quinn recommends. DO take a night dive with the manta rays in Kona on the Big Island, commenter ProfLogie advises. ""Even if you can only snorkel it is like a scene from another planet. Surreal."" DO ride or drive along the road to Hana. Be warned: The legendary route to the historic town on Maui's eastern coast has 620 curves. DO NOT forget to stop along the way to Hana (it'll help stave off car sickness). Kolohegirl girls suggests taking a hike or having a picnic overlooking the waterfalls. ""This is one mistake the tourists always make -- thinking that they have to jam to Hana. The road to Hana IS the adventure."" DO try parasailing. ""Go as high as they can take you, it's the best thing in the world,"" a commenter with the handle AndreaMilnes wrote. ""I've been doing it off Kona since I was little."" DO snorkel at Molokini Crater off the coast of Maui. FLken recommends the Pacific Whale Foundation expedition that includes a stop to swim with sea turtles. DO drag yourself out of bed before the crack of dawn to see the sun rise from almost 10,000 feet above sea level on the top of Haleakala, Maui's highest peak. DO marvel at the Big Island's volcanoes. ""Make the drive down to see where the lava flows into the sea, at night. It is an amazing experience,"" HandBananas wrote. Souvenirs . DO consider big-box stores for bargains on souvenirs. One commenter suggests the Sears at Ala Moana mall in Honolulu for Aloha shirts. ""Biggest selection I've seen!"" Another reader recommends local Goodwill stores for Hawaiian shirts priced from $5. Commenter HandBananas points visitors to Wal-Mart for Kona coffee and macadamia nuts. ""Yes, I know it is Wal-Mart, but it is a lot cheaper than the 2 million ABC stores you find on every corner."" DO NOT use your time in Hawaii to showcase your Hawaiian shirts. ""I've been told by a few locals that only tourists and hotel workers wear Aloha shirts,"" says commenter Martin McCreary. DO try the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet in Honolulu if you're looking for a more unique shopping experience. Lodging . Many commenters endorsed the idea of renting a condo instead of staying exclusively at luxury resorts, and some had other lodging suggestions. ""DO consider a B&B when staying in one location less than a week,"" a commenter with the handle Paul Below advised.""A B&B can be a more local and less expensive alternative to a resort hotel."" DO look into camping. ""I said screw the hotel and camped my entire time in Maui,"" commenter iEatSpam wrote. ""There are camping grounds all over the island and hardly anyone uses them."" Ray LeBlanc agrees, writing, ""Free 3 nights in National Park ... site overlooking the ocean ... humpback whales going by ... trails to a waterfall. Magical."" Logistics . DO rent a car, says one commenter, who also recommends the Andrew Doughty island guidebooks. ""DON'T expect to walk up to a restaurant in Waikiki during peak dining times and get a table with an ocean view,"" Martin McCreary said. DO make reservations. Cultural cues . ""DO take time to enjoy the cultural gems of the islands"" such as the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, says RobertInAtl. A little understanding of the history of Hawaii makes visiting the islands more meaningful, he says. DO say ""aloha"" and ""mahalo,"" advises commenter Dana Bass, from the Big Island. ""Aloha"" is used instead of ""hello"" and ""goodbye,"" and ""mahalo"" means ""thank you."" DO slow down and smile, Bass urges. ""And most importantly, bring the aloha back to the Mainland with you."" Agree or disagree? Share your thoughts below.","CNN.com readers offer useful Hawaii travel tips .
Some took exception with a previous suggestion to skip the luau .

"(CNN) -- I got chills -- not once but several times -- during Tuesday's Google Hangout with five women named to The CNN 10: Visionary Women list. The panel of women from truly diverse backgrounds provided fertile ground for discussion around the theme: What's the future of women at work? Veronika Scott, who has devoted her life to helping the homeless reenter the work world, got personal about growing up in a family ""constantly struggling in poverty"" and watching what it does to parents ""when they're constantly afraid."" ""There's anger. They don't know when they're going to feed their kids next. They don't know if they can afford rent,"" she said. Equally powerful was Molly Cantrell-Kraig, a one-time single mom on welfare now committed to helping struggling women get access to cars so they can work. ""I know what it's like to be there and paying for Christmas presents with food stamps."" And, Victoria Budson, on a lifelong mission to eliminate the pay gap between men and women, spoke movingly about a press conference she attended early in her career about gender bias in the courts. ""I thought, if we can't get justice through the place you're supposed to go to get justice, there isn't justice for women consistently in a meaningful way."" Yep, pinch me now, because when you bring five passionate and community-minded women together who are focused on lifting up the lives of other women, you cannot help but be inspired about the future for our young girls. Here are five takeaways from the chat. 1. Lean on, not only lean in . Mentoring takes many forms, the women said. It may be women who are already in the tech field serving as role models for young girls, said Kimberly Bryant, founder and executive director of Black Girls Code, which teaches coding and entrepreneurship to girls of color. But it can also be girls mentoring each other. ""So the girls that are 9 to 10 become mentors for the girls that are 7 to 8, and the girls that are 13 to 15, and 17 and 18 become the mentors for girls that are in middle school,"" said Bryant. ""And we hope that this pipeline will continue to build, and this network and community of support will continue to build once the girls leave Black Girls Code and go on to college and then enter the work force."" Ari Horie built her entire organization, the Women's Startup Lab, for female tech company founders, around the idea of two people leaning on each other, symbolized by the Japanese pictograph letter hito, which means human. ""Many of the founders might be going through the same things or same stage, but they have very, very different experiences. And (this) is a very safe place for them to really open up. 'Hey, I feel like I'm giving up, I don't know how to do it.'"" With mentors, persistence also pays off, said Budson, executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School. Early in her career, when a former Democratic Party chief in Massachusetts encouraged her to call him about an idea, she did, again and again. ""I must have called him 20 times before he and I connected ... but I kept at it and I think sometimes it takes just thinking it's OK to keep at it."" 2. ""You have to see it to be it"" To many in the audience, one of the most powerful aspects of The CNN 10: Visionary Women is how all 10 women are helping other women. ""So great to see women supporting women instead of impeding their progress by being territorial,"" wrote Tish Howard, a retired principal who is now CEO of an education consulting firm, on my Facebook page. Cantrell-Kraig, founder of the Women with Drive Foundation, believes the way to keep women from getting in each other's way is by showing what happens when they don't. ""Success begets success,"" she said. ""You have to see it before you can be it, and so the only way that you can convince women that supporting women is a good deal is to support other women."" Budson says when she trains students at Harvard or at other locations around the world, she asks them to take a pledge. When someone calls and asks if they know a good person, they pledge to recommend a ""competent, qualified woman,"" said Budson. The second pledge? ""I will not speak ill of other women,"" she said. ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it."" 3. Get men involved . Women supporting women is key, the five innovators said, but so is getting men to understand why it's crucial they support women too. ""What I would really love to see is for every man to look at his seven year old daughter sitting across the table from him at dinner tonight and say I want that little girl to do whatever she wants to do. I want her to walk into any industry she wants to take on and I want her to thrive because I love that little girl,"" said Cantrell-Kraig. On a practical note, Budson added: ""To compete in the 21st century, we are not going to be able to hire just out of 48 or 49 percent of the talent pool."" Horie says she sometimes faces accusations of discrimination from men for having a women's startup lab. ""It is okay for women to come together and find their strength and the support structure. And we're not making a statement against the men."" 4. Risk-taking and femininity are not mutually exclusive . Women can also hold themselves back, the women said. Bryant of Black Girls Code talked of the ""stereotype threat that we internalize as women ... when we enter these environments which are not very diverse, and which lack women, that maybe we don't belong."" Instead, what she says she finds, especially in industries heavily dominated by men, is that women generally come to the table much more prepared. ""We're often more qualified and more competent than our male counterparts by far,"" she added. Cantrell-Kraig longs for the day when skills are viewed as gender neutral. ""I have so many friends of mine who are daring, crazy, analytical ... some of them male, some of them female.... You can be risk-taking and feminine. They're not mutually exclusive."" And, when we see a woman feeling true empowerment, there just isn't anything quite like it. ""One of our women ... she flat out in front of a (television) camera said, 'You should be inspired by me. Don't pity me because I've come from being homeless. You should be inspired by the fact that I am here standing in front of you right now,'"" said Scott, founder and CEO of The Empowerment Plan, an organization providing jobs to the homeless. 5. The personal is powerful . For nearly all of The CNN 10: Visionary Women participating in yesterday's Google Hangout, their professional passions are personal. ""The Empowerment Plan was just me creating something I wish had been given to my parents as an opportunity,"" said Scott, who has built a business teaching homeless women to sew coats for the homeless. She shared a recent success story: a single mom with three kids under the age of 12 who within three months of learning how to sew, moved out of the homeless shelter, found an apartment, and got her kids in charter schools with her youngest learning Japanese. ""That was just the 'Aha!' moment,"" said Scott, realizing she had come full circle. ""I was that kid who was constantly struggling."" Cantrell-Kraig knows exactly how it feels to struggle as a former welfare mom, trying to find a job and complete an associate's degree without a car. ""Who better to tell a woman, 'I know you can do it. I've done it?'"" she said. ""Nobody gets where they are supposed to be by themselves. Nobody."" What do you think are the biggest issues facing women in the work force?

"(CNN) -- When Jaylen Arnold was diagnosed with complex Tourette syndrome, his life changed. Having this neurological disorder -- which causes repetitive, involuntary movements and sounds called tics -- led to frequent teasing and eventual bullying. It motivated him to lead the charge to stop childhood bullying by addressing students across the country with his Jaylen's Challenge Foundation. CNN: How did this all get started? Arnold: In second grade, I was getting bullied a lot for my tics. A lot of my friends got bullied, too. When my mom made the decision to pull me out of that school, I felt like I was leaving behind all the kids that were being bullied, too. I figured if that was just my little second-grade class being bullied, what about the whole world? So I went to my mom and we made Jaylen's Challenge. We talk about Tourette syndrome, how bullying isn't good, and how you can prevent bullying. CNN: So how can you prevent bullying? Arnold: You always have to tell an adult. Maybe you need to find new friends. A bully might pick on you, but he's not going to pick on four or five kids, you know? Bullies don't like ""different."" I used to get asked a lot of questions, and a lot of the time, I would be too embarrassed to tell them about my Tourette's, or I just didn't want to, because it's a long story. So they start imitating my tics or just think I was trying to freak them out or be the class clown. I remember putting on a fake smile and trying to act like I was laughing at them instead of them laughing at me. They would copy me, and it would really hurt. That's how the bullying started. Actor: I hid Tourette's from Hollywood . But, you know, I really can't blame them for being confused or scared, because I wasn't even sure of what was going on myself at the time. If I didn't have Tourette's and somebody came up to me and started twitching or making weird noises, I wouldn't really know what do think about it, either. CNN: I've heard all that extra attention can actually make your ticcing worse. Was that the case for you? Arnold: Yes! It helps when I'm not stressed or when you accept it. When you accept my Tourette's, I don't tic as much. But when you stare or ask lots of questions, I get really stressed and the Tourette's gets worse and I go all over the place. A lot of the time, it really stinks, because I can't do anything. I like to go to a room and go off by myself. But if that's not an option, I try to be really quiet and concentrate on something that keeps me focused. I play a game in my head or think about something. I have to distract my mind from things that set it off, like stress or bullying. CNN: Can you hold the tics in sometimes? That's one thing that confuses people. You can actually control them, but only to a certain extent. Arnold: Sometimes I can control it, but a lot of times, it's just kind of like a rocket ship. You know how it fills up with fire and the gas and then finally it's just like, ""Whoosh!"" So if I have to hold them back, it usually comes out a lot more than it would've if I didn't hold it in. It feels good to finally release it and just get it out. CNN: Is there anything you can't do? Anything you feel like you're missing out on, because of your Tourette's? Arnold: I used to not be able to go to the movies, but I've learned to focus on the movie and they just go away for a while. Plus, no one is staring at me. They're watching the movie. I can ride my bike, skateboard, run. 'American Idol' favorite overcomes Tourette's, Asperger's . But I have to do a lot of things most kids don't do, like having meltdowns and taking medications. Everything else is easy for me, except being quiet. I can't play hide-and-seek. When I try to trick people or fake sleep, I have to turn the other way so people can't see my facial expressions, because my face tics when I try to keep my eyes closed. I can only win if I'm at a high point at least 20 feet away, when I'm not within hearing distance. This one time, I gave myself up, because I was on top of my mom's shelf and somebody was walking past. They were about to walk right by and I let out a little squeak and they got me! I was so frustrated.","Jaylen Arnold is the youngest person ever diagnosed with Tourette syndrome .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new drug to treat bacterial skin infections like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, also known as MRSA . MRSA is caused by a strain of staph bacteria that's become resistant to most antibiotics. It's life-threatening and is often found in hospitals and other health care settings. The new drug, called Dalvance, is taken intravenously. The drug is only approved for use in adults, according to the Chicago-based company that markets the drug, Durata Therapeutics. What makes it different from other MRSA antibiotics is the way it was approved. MRSA can survive for days on planes . This is the first drug labeled by the FDA as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product. QIDP is part of a program that the administration hopes will encourage drug companies to develop new drugs like Dalvance that will fight the epidemic of antibiotic-resistant infections. Any drug designated QIDP by the FDA gets a priority review and expedited review process. If approved the drug also then qualifies for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity. Antibiotic-resistant infections are considered such a threat, in a report released earlier this year the World Health Organization said that these infections could derail the ""very achievements of modern medicine."" The report characterizes the problem as so bad that a ""post-antibiotic era"" is ""far from being an apocalyptic fantasy."" The WHO report says if health trends continue, a time when typical antibiotics don't work on run of the mill kinds of infections is ""a very real possibility for the 21st Century."" Hospitals getting better about MRSA . Antibiotic-resistant bacteria infect at least 2 million people each year, according to the CDC. Of those, at least 23,000 die as a direct result of the infection and many more die as a result of conditions complicated by that infection, mostly in hospital and health care settings. The number of health care spread MRSA cases is declining, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But on any given day 1 in 25 hospital patients has at least one health care associated infection. Most happen to patients who are not in intensive care units. That means you could go into the hospital for a knee surgery and end up leaving with a serious infection that normal antibiotics don't treat. Experts say MRSA became a real problem for the health care system as doctors spent decades over-prescribing antibiotics. Patients who came in for treatments for colds and flus were given antibiotics even though such infections don't typically respond to medication. When you need antibiotics -- and when you don't . Over time, the bacteria that did survive these treatments reproduced and infections that were resistant to antibiotics became wider spread. Outbreaks of MRSA called community-associated MRSA have happened at schools, day care centers, and in gyms, and are typically spread by skin-to-skin contact. Protecting student athletes from MRSA . Staph infections typically start with small red bumps which can turn into painful abscesses that often require surgical draining. The latest tool to fight MRSA, Dalvance, was approved after two clinical trials that included 1,289 adults with this kind of infection. The adults were given Dalvance or another antibacterial drug. Dalvance was as effective as that drug for the treatment of this infection. The most common side effects for people on the drug during the trail were nausea (5.5%), headache (4.7%), and diarrhea (4.4%).

"(CNN) -- It's not a great sign for the music industry when the year's top-selling album is the soundtrack to a Disney movie. So far in 2014, there hasn't been a single album from a music artist that's sold a million copies or more, according to Billboard. While ""Frozen's"" soundtrack has done just fine, with just over 3 million units sold as of October 10, it seems music fans haven't been as eager about albums released by artists. In fact, the two performers who've come closest to reaching platinum-level success in 2014 actually released their albums last year. Beyonce's self-titled artistic smash has gone on to notch 776,000 units so far this year, while Lorde's ""Pure Heroine"" has pushed 754,000. Even the ""Frozen"" soundtrack is a holdover, as it arrived last November. As for 2014 releases, Eric Church is so far the biggest hit. The country star's ""Outsiders,"" which arrived in February, has sold 722,000, closely followed by Coldplay's ""Ghost Stories."" But perhaps not all hope is lost: 2014 still has some major players up ahead. Taylor Swift will release her latest album, ""1989,"" on October 27, and the Foo Fighters' ""Sonic Highways"" is slated for November. And if all else fails, maybe someone can convince Beyonce to drop another surprise album.","This year has seen a lack of platinum-selling albums .

"(CNN) -- New developments in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 over the weekend revealed more details about what happened before the plane went off the grid on Saturday, March 8. But there are still major questions as investigators look for the missing aircraft. Here's a cheat sheet to help you get up to speed on the latest twists in what's become one of the greatest aviation mysteries in history: . What do we know about the plane's altitude during the flight? During the plane's last contact with air traffic controllers as it was approaching Vietnamese air space, it was reportedly flying at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. But military radar tracked it changing altitude after making a sharp turn as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The plane flew as low as 12,000 feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The official, who is not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that the area the plane flew in after the turn is a heavily traveled air corridor and that flying at 12,000 feet would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic. Military radar tracked the flight between 1:19 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. the day it went missing, the source told CNN, but it's not clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet. Why would a plane drop so drastically in altitude? A mechanical problem could explain it, some analysts said. The new details about altitude are ""highly significant,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""It explains so many pieces that didn't fit together before,"" she said. ""Now, if we have a scenario where something happened, the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet, this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic onboard event, such as a rapid decompression, a fire, an explosion. That's what you would have to do, descend, get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane."" But other analysts cautioned that it's too soon to know and unclear whether the new information is reliable. ""We've had so much information come out and so much contradictory information come out, that I caution against jumping to any types of conclusions at this point,"" said Mark Weiss, a former American Airlines pilot and CNN aviation analyst. How they're searching for debris . Was the aircraft's sharp turn programmed? Malaysian authorities said Sunday that the last transmission from the missing aircraft's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System showed it heading to Beijing. That information seems to be at odds with the supposition, reported heavily in many media outlets last week, that someone reprogrammed the plane's flight path before the co-pilot signed off with air traffic controllers for the last time. ""The last ACARS transmission, sent at 1:07 a.m., showed nothing unusual,"" Malaysian officials said in a written update on the search. ""The 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to Beijing."" This new information about the last transmission reduces, but doesn't rule out, suspicions about foul play in the cockpit. And it is more in line with the theory that some sort of emergency on board forced pilots to change course, analysts said, but it's still unclear what happened. Who's looking for the plane now? Countries from central Asia to Australia are searching for the missing plane along arcs drawn by authorities based on satellite pings hours after it vanished. One arc tracks the southern Indian Ocean zone that's the focus of current attention. The other arc tracks over parts of Cambodia, Laos, China and into Kazakhstan. Australia is heading up the search in the southern zone, in an area about 2,500 kilometers (1550 miles) southwest of Perth. Australian navy ship HMAS Success and 10 aircraft are participating in the search Monday. The crew of a Chinese search plane spotted ""suspicious objects"" in the area, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported Monday. The Chinese plane has reported the coordinates of the objects to Australian authorities, as well as to the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong, Xinhua said. If search crews do turn up anything confirmed to be from the plane, they'll soon have more technology to help them. The U.S. Navy is sending a supersensitive hydrophone listening device to Australia to be on standby if debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is found and a search for the plane's voice and data recorders can be done, a U.S. military official said Sunday. The device is pulled behind a ship at slow speeds and is used by the Navy to find downed aircraft to a depth of 20,000 feet. The equipment was moved to JFK International Airport in New York on Sunday and will be shipped to Australia via commercial air Monday, the official said, emphasizing that the move doesn't signal any change in the status of the search. What clues are pointing to the southern Indian Ocean? France's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that radar data from a satellite pointed to floating debris in the Indian Ocean 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) from Perth, Australia. The data were immediately passed along to Malaysian authorities, and French satellite resources will home in more on the area, the ministry said. Satellite images previously issued by Australian and Chinese authorities have also captured possible large floating objects in that area, stoking hopes that searchers might find debris from the missing plane. The satellite image from China, captured March 18, shows an object that's 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet), officials said. Australian-led search teams in the southern Indian Ocean found no sign of it Saturday. Have search teams found anything? Not much, but they did find a wooden pallet as well as strapping belts, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's John Young said. The use of wooden pallets is common in the airline industry. ""It's a possible lead ... but pallets are used in the shipping industry as well,"" he said Sunday. The ocean is full of debris, and experts say that makes spotting possible wreckage more difficult. Is that even the right place to be looking? That depends on who you ask. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, whose country is heading up search efforts in the southern arc, sounded optimistic over the weekend. ""We have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope, no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,"" he said. Analysts said Sunday that the new details about altitude could mean that investigators are looking in the wrong spot. If the plane had been flying at 12,000 feet, CNN aviation analyst Mark Weiss said, it would have burned more fuel than it would at a higher altitude, which could mean projections about where it ended up are off base. ""I don't know that we're necessarily searching in the right place,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""Seeing some wooden pallets floating in the southern sea is not what I would call evidence of an aircraft. So, I think it's quite possible that it could be in another place entirely, and maybe the search needs to be reevaluated."" Can NASA help? NASA is repositioning satellites to help look for the plane, but that could take a couple of days, the agency said Sunday. The space agency said that it will check the archives of satellite data and use space-based assets such as the Earth-Observing-1 satellite and the ISERV camera on the International Space Station to scour for possible crash sites. The resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 meters) or larger. Listening for fading pings .

"(CNN) -- Just when you thought this divorce couldn't get any messier. Weeks after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region, it plans to take custody of dolphins in the nation as well. Not just any dolphins. These highly trained military mammals detect risks such as sea mines or enemy scuba divers trying to slip through. Sea mines are sophisticated weapons that can sink ships and other watercraft. ""The combat dolphin program in the Crimean city of Sevastopol will be preserved and redirected toward the interests of the Russian navy,"" state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday. Dolphins are a crucial part of open-water security. They detect sounds and objects in murky waters that human beings can't, making them uniquely effective at highlighting dangers on the sea floor. Harnessing the military power of animal intelligence . Ukraine was using outdated military equipment for the dolphin program and planned to disband it next month, RIA Novosti said. The Ukraine Defense Ministry told CNN that the nation has an ocean dolphin facility, but declined to provide details, saying they're classified. The dolphin program dates to the 1960s, when Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union, but was handed over to Kiev after independence. The U.S. Navy in San Diego also trains dolphins and sea lions to help protect its assets and find dangerous objects underwater. Tensions between Moscow and Kiev have escalated since Russia reclaimed the Crimea region after a referendum this month that overwhelmingly supported the annexation. The United States and its allies have pledged to isolate Russia for its actions. Ukraine also has combat sea lions that operate under the same base. It's unclear whether they'll be barking allegiances to Moscow or Kiev.

"(CNN) -- In 1981, James Brady was shot in the head and gravely wounded in a shooting that also wounded President Reagan -- despite their both being surrounded by plenty of extremely well-trained ""good guys with guns."" At that time, federal law set conditions, such as a felony conviction or being involuntarily hospitalized for a mental illness, that prohibited a person from possessing firearms. The 1968 Gun Control Act had established record-keeping requirements and regulated interstate transactions of firearms, but there was no federal law requiring proof from a prospective buyer that he or she was not prohibited from possessing firearms. It was, in essence, an honor system. You could purchase as many firearms and as much ammunition as you liked, as long as you signed a form stating that you didn't meet any of the disqualifying conditions. While James Brady started his long road to recovery from his brain injuries, he and his wife, Sarah, began what has been a three-decade endeavor to strengthen America's gun laws and prevent others from becoming victims of gun violence. The Bradys and the organization they have helped lead have been successful in: . --Expanding disqualifiers for firearm possession to include perpetrators of domestic violence . --Advancing laws to prevent gun violence at the state level . --Litigating legal cases to protect the public from unsafe business practices in the gun industry . --Educating the public about how to protect children from being shot . But Brady's best-known legacy will be the federal law he championed and that bears his name, the Brady Gun Violence Prevention Act. The Brady Act was a huge leap forward toward fulfilling the objectives of the Gun Control Act of 1968: keeping guns from dangerous people. It required licensed gun dealers to submit information on the identity of prospective gun buyers to the FBI, which could then determine through searches of databases of criminal records whether the purchaser was prohibited. Through this law, millions of prohibited buyers have been identified and prohibited from purchasing firearms from licensed dealers. What impact the Brady Law has had on public safety is debatable and, in my opinion, very difficult to assess. Because some states had background check requirements in place before the Brady Law, one way to estimate the policy's effects is to contrast changes in homicide trends in these states at the time the law was implemented with changes over the same period in states newly implementing background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers. But the accuracy of the estimates depends on having states that are similar except for the policy change or having states with similar crime trends before the law was implemented. If the pre-law trends differ between those sets of states, you must control for those differences. Those conditions haven't been met in studies of the Brady Law. But I believe the Brady Law is the foundation upon which we should build a complete system for vetting all firearms transactions to keep guns away from people identified by laws as being too dangerous to possess them. Some consider background checks for all gun sales a pipe dream, based on the flawed logic that gun laws won't work when criminals don't obey them. This argument ignores the important linkages between legal and illegal gun markets and what research has shown about the ability of sensible regulations to prevent diversions of guns into the illegal market. We can't directly observe a homicide prevented because of background checks, but we can see what happens in their absence. After Missouri repealed its system for vetting all handgun sales through a permit to purchase background check system in 2007, firearm homicide rates increased sharply while rates declined nationally and in states surrounding Missouri. A study that I conducted to assess the effects of this policy change controlled for a host of other factors that might explain Missouri's spike in gun homicides and determined that Missouri's repealed handgun purchase permit law was associated with nearly 50 additional homicides per year. The last 33 years of James Brady's life were marked by courage and perseverance, not only to regain what gun violence had taken from him, but to curb the nation's extraordinary high level of gun violence. He has been an inspiration to many who are committed to completing what he started, so we can have far more effective policies for keeping guns from dangerous people. If his vision of a comprehensive background check system is realized, we will have many fewer lives lost and damaged by gun violence.","Daniel Webster: In 1981, when James Brady was shot, buying guns relied on ""honor system""

"(CNN) -- Just when I thought my amazement with Pope Francis had run its course, he did it again. In a long interview with an old friend who was writing for an Argentine magazine, the pope put forward a 10-point plan for happiness. From where I sit, it seems, well, pretty damn good if not perfect. Here are Pope Francis' tips for a happy life and my comments on them: . 1. Live and let live. It's an echo of the Pope's earlier remark on gays: ""Who am I to judge?"" Moreover, it's what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount: ""Judge not, unless you want to be judged yourself."" (Matthew 7:1) 2. Give yourself to others. That is, give your money and your time to those in need. Don't just sit around like stagnant water. Give all you have and then some. 3 Move quietly in the world. The Pope quotes from a favorite novel by an early 20th-century Argentine writer, Ricardo Guiraldes, in which the novelist writes that in one's youth, a person is ""a rocky stream that runs over everything,"" but as one gets older, one becomes ""a running river, quietly peaceful."" It's very like the Native American suggestion that one should walk ""in balance and beauty"" on the ground, making the least disturbance. 4. Enjoy leisure. The Pope says that consumerism has brought with it unbearable anxieties. So play with your children. Take time off. And don't spend all your time thinking about your next acquisition. Spend your time well, not your money. 5. Sunday is for families. This is actually one of the Ten Commandments. Honor the Sabbath. (Exodus 20:8) Once a week, give a whole day to meditation, worship, family life, tending the needs of the spirit. This is healthy living. 6. Find jobs for young people. Who would have guessed that job-creation would be on list for happiness? But the Pope is right. Honest, simple work for young people is essential to their well-being. Somewhat surprisingly, in this moment in the interview, the Pope connected job creation to the degradation of our environment: ""the tyrannical use of nature."" He links the lack of good jobs to the lack of respect for ourselves and the Earth itself. So creating jobs doesn't mean ruining the environment. It doesn't mean, as the politicians chant, ""jobs, jobs, jobs."" Good and productive labor is valuable, and it doesn't mean you have to have a fancy job description. You don't have to become rich. You can be ordinary. Happiness lies there. Do good work, create good work for others. 7. Respect nature. This follows from No. 6. ""Isn't humanity committing suicide with this indiscriminate and tyrannical use of nature?"" the Pope wonders. Not surprisingly, this is what Henry David Thoreau, a founding father of the environmental movement, said. ""Most people live lives of quiet desperation,"" he said. He went into the woods, to Walden Pond, because he wanted ""to live deliberately"" and to ""front only the essential facts of life."" A proper respect for nature means that you can't pollute the air, poison the rivers and chop down the forests indiscriminately without suffering greatly. I suspect that a huge amount of the anxiety and suffering that we see around can be closely traced to our wanton misuse of our resources. Just look at any garbage dump and see what is wasted. In a sense, we've wasted our souls. 8. Let go of negative things quickly. The Pope tells us not to complain about people who annoy or frustrate us, to let go of things as rapidly as we can. I have an old friend who used to say, ""Put the bad things in your back pocket and leave them there."" This may sound like escapism or putting your head in the sand, but it's more interesting than that. Life throws rotten things our way each day. People say nasty things to us, often about others. This stuff makes them miserable, of course. It makes us miserable, too. Flush it. 9. Don't preach your religion too forcefully. Proselytism brings on paralysis, the Pope tells us. Wow. I'm a Christian myself, and I don't mind saying so. But each person sees the world before them in his or her own way. The Pope says this. As a teaching, it seems to run counter to the so-called Great Commission (Matthew 28:16-20). Jesus said to get out there and spread the word. But the Pope takes a relaxed view of this activity, preferring that we should teach by example. Perhaps that really is what Jesus would do? 10. Work for peace. The Pope has preached this message from the beginning of his time as pontiff. He has gone to Jerusalem and worked to bring together Jews and Palestinians. He has prayed for peace and worked for peace. He has listened closely to Jesus, who said, ""blessed are the peacemakers."" The Pope asks us to take in refugees, to think innovatively about how to create peace in the world. Jesus, of course, invites us to turn the other cheek when struck. This is a complex teaching. But it's essential to Christian faith. The Pope, once again, calls on us to take the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount seriously. This is very hard but crucial work. Pope Francis has, in this unlikely venue, given us his own Sermon on the Mount, his Ten Commandments for happiness and inner peace. One can only be grateful for his wisdom, which is rooted in a sincere faith, in hard-earned wisdom, and a very practical knowledge of human needs and potentials.","In an interview, Pope Francis laid out 10-point plan for happiness .

"(CNN) -- It's as if he came from the Dark Side of the Moon. Few would have predicted that an 18-year-old Egyptian, who wasn't even born the last time Pink Floyd released an album, would become the cover designer of the British band's latest album ""The Endless River"". However, Ahmed Emad Eldin was plucked from obscurity when a creative agency working for the band saw his design portfolio on Behance, an online notice board for creative professionals. Born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Eldin is a self-taught digital artist, who says he used the internet as a tutor to hone his skills. The offer to create the images for the band, he says, was ""a total surprise."" Featuring a lone figure punting a boat across a sea of clouds, Eldin says the image was created while he was ""thinking about life and nature."" Despite his young age, Eldin says he was a fan of the band before they contacted him and is really excited to work with them. He could only hint that he may be working with the band on future releases or projects. The British band formed in the 1960s but found global fame in the 1970s with progressive rock albums such as ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Animals."" The cover art for ""The Dark Side of the Moon"", designed by Storm Thorgerson, and ""Animals"", with a pig floating above Battersea Power Station, remain some of the most recognizable album covers of all time. ""The Endless River"" will be released in November and is Pink Floyd's first album since ""Division Bell"" in 1994. It is mostly instrumental apart from one song called ""Louder than Words"" and comes from the same sessions that produced the 1994 album. Last year David Gilmour and Nick Mason from the band revisited the music from those sessions and decided that the tracks should be made available as part of the Pink Floyd repertoire. The band state that the new album is a tribute to Rick Wright, ""whose keyboards are at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound"" and died in 2008.","Designer of Pink Floyd's new album is teenager from Egypt .

"(CNN) -- ""I knew America would be like the movies I'd seen,"" says Zoltan Mesko. Born in Romania, and the survivor of a bloody revolution, the New England Patriots star's story could have a Hollywood ending at Sunday's Super Bowl. It has been a long road to Indianapolis for the Patriots and the New York Giants, but no other player lining up at the Lucas Oil Stadium has been on a journey quite like Mesko's. Born in Timisoara, a city with a population of just over 300,000, his early life was spent under the communist rule of Nicolae Ceausescu -- the former head of state who was overthrown and executed following the uprising of December 1989. ""I grew up in communism until I was three and a half years old, lived through a revolution, while bullets were flying through our apartment on Christmas Eve,"" Mesko, now 25, told reporters in Indianapolis, which is hosting the NFL's showpiece for the first time. Though Ceausescu's 22-year reign finally ended, the East European nation's problems were far from over. ""Hyperinflation set in so we couldn't buy anything with our money even though my parents were engineers,"" Mesko explained. ""They were earning the equivalent of $100 a month, each."" In a bid to solve their financial problems, Mesko's father secretly hatched a plot to relocate his family to the United States. ""My dad, kind of behind our backs, applied for a green card lottery in late 1996,"" he said. ""We got the answer that we were one of 55,000 families in the world to be chosen to come over to America."" Mesko arrived in New York City as a foreigner and unable to speak the language, but said he had no trouble adapting. ""Being 11 years old, you're a sponge -- within the summer I had picked up the language,"" he said. ""Was I picked on? No, I think I was accepted very well. Not even because I was in New York City, but because America accepts a lot of people."" After a decade in the U.S. Mesko is now fully schooled in American culture. He played college football in Michigan, going to the Rose Bowl five years ago, and has been in the NFL since 2010. ""We're proud Americans now,"" Mesko said of his family. ""We celebrate every tradition there is."" His family will take part in the one of the great American pastimes when they sit down to watching Sunday's big game, a repeat of the 2007 championship which the Giants won 17-14.

"(CNN) -- It is easy to criticize zoos and aquariums when healthy animals are culled, particularly when they are from endangered species. It's not always easy to understand the logic behind such a decision, but to get a picture of why good zoos take particular actions, one has to understand the context and the alternatives. Wild populations of animals are collapsing at an alarming rate. Since 1997, for example, the population of giraffes in Africa has plummeted by more than 50%, with two subspecies becoming extinct in the wild, and leaving only 240 members of another subspecies in a single population center. This pattern is replicated all over the world; it is driven by our increasing need for natural resources such as palm oil, agricultural land, or living space. Animal reserves in the most vulnerable areas are struggling to protect their animals from the scourge of poachers, while other habitats are destroyed by the effects of deforestation and increasingly climate change, a problem that all of the world's governments acting in concert have been unable to check even slightly. Indeed, governments have been unable even to uphold their obligations under the Aichi Targets to assist in the protection of endangered species and to teach their populations about the value of biological diversity, obligations that have been almost entirely outsourced to zoos and museums. Zoos inherited a legacy of animal keeping from a previous age that did not understand the havoc we are wreaking on the planet. Since the establishment of national and regional zoo associations and the dawning of greater scientific understanding of our effect on nature, zoos have become essentially a last line of defense in the protection of animals. Do we wish that humans would stop destroying the natural habitats of wild animals? Of course; but this is not happening. Our choice then is clear: Do we use the legacy we inherited to protect animals from human activity, or do we leave them to take their chances, knowing that their chances of survival are slim and for many species almost impossible? If we accept that some action is better than none, then we also have to accept that managing viable populations of animals over the long term until their habitats are stabilized requires some difficult decisions, including the culling of healthy animals that won't help the species stay adaptable and immune to disease. It's worth remembering that some of the world's foremost biologists, population biologists, animal geneticists and other experts have thought deeply and philosophically about these choices. Faced with the alternatives, it's not hard to see why they chose as they did. Say we did stop zoos from breeding and transformed them into ""sanctuaries""; Immediately we would need to give up the notion that we can save our most endangered species from extinction -- the infrastructure in the wild just isn't there for some species and in many EAZA zoos we care for species that are already extinct in the wild. Next we would need to decide what to do with the animals: Should we keep them in these new sanctuaries, unable to breed, until they die? Animal rights organizations would like to make sure that nobody enjoys seeing such animals and learning about them from zoo visits, yet these visits are what pay for everything we do, from education through to conservation. Over 1.5 billion visits will be made to EAZA zoos during the Decade of Biodiversity, with all of those visitors learning about nature. Who would be there to offer nature conservation education if zoos did not exist? Zoos in reputable zoo associations worldwide are the fourth largest donors to conservation in the wild; are animal rights groups going to replace the hundreds of millions of dollars that zoos currently donate? No, because ultimately they do not care whether species have a future in the wild. We cannot possibly release all of our animals back into a wild that is under siege, and which they would have to share with wild populations that are as large as their habitats can currently accommodate. Who would carry out the Aichi Target obligations which all European nations have signed up to? Would taxpayers really be willing to foot larger bills to pay for this, or would we, again, face abandoning animals and biodiversity to their fate, without any idea of the consequences this could bring? EAZA strongly believes that the humane and considered response is to make a real effort to save endangered species. We cannot sit on the sidelines pretending that there is a magical solution to the crisis in nature, as animal rights groups do. Serious problems require serious responses. As yet, anti-zoo activists have put forward no serious alternatives; we would be interested to hear them, but we can't afford to wait. READ MORE: While there are zoos, the killing will go on .

"(CNN) -- With more than 6,000 years of history, China's ancient capital of Nanjing has been the birthplace of many of the country's most intriguing traditional arts. Today, a handful of skilled artisans are keeping these endangered practices alive. Sophisticated and elegant yet not exclusive to the wealthy, these six Nanjing art forms offer insight into China's diverse yet dwindling collection of intangible attractions that, for the most part, remain hidden behind studio doors. CNN sent Sun Chen, a Nanjing-based photographer, to visit six studios in the city and talk with the artisans. Engraved Buddhist scrolls . Sitting in a traditional Chinese building with a scenic garden, Nanjing's Jinling Buddhism Publishing House was founded in 1866 by a Buddhist scholar. Today, the building also serves as his resting place. The printing house specializes in engraved Buddhist scrolls utilizing a technique that can be traced to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) -- the technique was recognized as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity by UNESCO in 2009. First, engravers carve Buddhist sutras onto wooden blocks, which are then printed onto paper. The scrolls are then sorted and bound by hand. ""It takes half a month to complete a wooden plate of 800 words,"" says nationally recognized senior engraver Ma Meng-qing, who has worked at Jinling for 33 years. ""Some of the more famous sutras, like the Diamond Sutra and the Heart Sutra, each consist of 16 wooden plates."" The house stocks more than 130,000 plates carved with Buddhist sutras and images. Called the ""Jinling version,"" products from Nanjing are highly regarded among Chinese temples for their accuracy and clear layouts. Jinling Buddhism Publishing House, 35 Huaihai Road, Bai Xia District, Nanjing; open only by appointment . Paper cuts . Drawing a Chinese language character with a single brush stroke is difficult enough -- try swapping the paint brush for scissors. Added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in 2009, paper cutting is a folk art practiced by various ethnic groups in China. But Zhang Fang-lin, aka ""Jinling Holy Scissorhands,"" says Nanjing's creations are unique. ""Flower within flower, theme within theme; roughness with delicacy, rawness with spirit,"" says Zhang. This means smaller patterns and stories are hidden within the larger framework of the artwork. Nanjing's paper-cut artwork is known for its curves and complicated lines, a technique that's been refined by Zhang's family. Zhang is the fourth generation of his family in the business. After China's state television CCTV showcased his work in 2013, pirated versions of his Chinese zodiac designs started appearing all over the country. Legend has it that his skill was challenged only once. He responded by cutting out two circles separately from two pieces of paper. Amazingly, the two circles overlapped seamlessly. In the past, paper-cutting artists were hired to craft art to be placed on wedding dowries as a blessing. Today, paper cuttings are placed on walls and doors during celebrations. Nanjing Folk Custom Museum (Gan's Grand Courtyard), Zhongshan South Road, Bai Xia District, Nanjing . Velvet flowers . Zhao Shu-xian is the only acclaimed velvet flower artist in China. During Sun Chen's recent visit to his Nanjing studio, he was found cutting tiny pieces from a long black stick of velvet, and using them as the noses and eyes of the mini-velvet pandas he was making. ""Master Zhao doesn't like talking about his background, he would rather stick to art,"" says Chen of his visit with the artist. Sharing a similar pronunciation as the word for ""prosperity"" in Chinese, rong-hua (velvet flower) is seen as a lucky charm in China, especially during weddings and festivals. The Chinese word for velvet flowers actually refers to all figures made from thin copper sticks covered with silk velvet. With their delicate and elegant features, they became especially popular as accessories among royal and noble families in ancient China. The folk craft prospers in Nanjing thanks to the generous supply of silk scraps left from making brocade -- another well established handicraft in Nanjing. To make silk velvet flowers, the silk is boiled to soften its texture before being dyed. Then, it's rolled evenly onto thin copper wires. The velvet sticks are twisted into different shapes. Zhao has been making velvet flowers for more than 40 years and is keen to modernize the art's image. So far so good -- Chinese actress Yao Xing-tong wore one of his pieces on her red carpet dress at Cannes in 2012. Nanjing Folk Custom Museum (Gan's Grand Courtyard), Zhongshan South Road, Bai Xia District, Nanjing . Yunjin (Brocade) Nanjing's silk brocade is known as ""yunjin"" in Chinese, meaning ""beautiful as clouds at sunset."" It's extremely difficult to make. A craft dating back more than 1,500 years, silk brocade is still produced with an old-fashioned wooden weaving machine. The four-meter-high machine is operated by two craftsmen at the same time -- one sits on top of the machine sorting threads while another sits at the other end and weaves. A team can produce only five centimeters of yunjin per day. The handicraft is another named to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in 2009. Nanjing Brocade Museum, 240 Chating Dong St., Jianye District, Nanjing . Lantern-making . In the first lunar month of every year, master Cao Zhen-rong and his studio are responsible for creating some 10,000 lanterns for Nanjing's Lunar New Year celebration. Cao started making lanterns when he was 12, under the guidance of his father. ""From sourcing the materials to gluing the lanterns, around 30 procedures are involved in making each lantern,"" says Cao. Since the Southern Dynasty (420-589), the area in front of the Confucius Temple along Qinhuai River has been famous for putting on the most festive lantern show in the country. As a Chinese folk belief goes -- one that Nanjingers proudly recite -- ""Qinhuai's lanterns triumph the world."" Lantern viewing is still one of the most popular things to do during the festival. Each year, Cao and his studio begin working on next year's lanterns on the 18th day of the first lunar month. The staff were in the midst of preparing lanterns for 2015, the Year of the Sheep, during photographer Sun Chen's visit, but he says they were kept under wraps. No sneak peeks allowed. Lanterns are sold in the market around Confucius Temple and can be seen in the area during the Lunar New Year festival. Gold leaf . ""There were gold leaves everywhere in the studio,"" says Sun of his visit to one of Nanjing's gold leaf workshops. ""I have never seen that much gold in my life."" The Jiangning district of Nanjing, where gold leaf is produced, has officially been dubbed ""China's gold leaf city."" Nanjing reportedly produces 70% of China's and 60% of the world's gold leaf. To make the leaves, a gold cube has to go through a dozen processes to reach its 0.12-millimeter thinness. A gram of gold can be hammered into a 0.47 square-meter gold leaf. Finished gold leaves are used to plaster the surfaces of Buddhist sculptures in temples. They also have various uses from architecture to even food. Sun Chen is a photographer based in Nanjing.

But he beat the promising young Brandon Rios last November to revive his fortunes and was back to his peerless best to take Bradley's perfect record. The WBO may mandate Pacquiao to face the winner of the Marquez-Mike Alvarado clash next month although the bigger prize may be a long-awaited clash with American superstar Floyd Mayweather. Contractual and legal wrangles have to date prevented a money-spinning bout between the two boxing icons but Pacquiao's performance in beating Bradley has certainly restored his reputation. A star-studded crowd watched the fight in the MGM Grand Arena and aside from a spell in the fourth round, Pacquiao was in control. Back home in the Philippines, thousands watched the fight on big screens, cheering wildly as their national hero took command. ""The people of the nation are united in cheering on the victory of the nation's fist,"" President Benigno Aquino's spokesman told AFP after the victory. Many Filipino's are still recovering from the devastating impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year and Aquino said Pacquiao was a symbol of resistance in the face of adversity, having himself recovered from the defeats to Bradley and Marquez.","Manny Pacquiao regains WBO welterweight crown .

"(CNN) -- The message will have been heard loud and clear across Europe. Bayern Munich, themselves on the end of a thrashing in the European Champions League semifinals last year, dished out one of its own on Tuesday. The German champions, led by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, raced into a five-goal lead over Italian side AS Roma in their group stages clash, with just 36 minutes on the clock. It was a devastating display of attacking football that left the thousands of fervent fans gathered in Rome's Olympic Stadium shell shocked. Except, of course, for those 5,000 supporters who had made the trip from Germany. Guardiola is aiming for a hat-trick of Champions League triumphs after securing two during his four-year spell at the Spanish giants. And if it carries on like this, Bayern will prove a tough nut to crack in the competition's latter stages. The rout began on eight minutes, Dutch international Arjen Robben cutting inside former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole to bend a shot into the far corner. Mario Gotze, whose winning goal sealed a World Cup triumph for Germany in Brazil, made it two after swapping passes with international teammate Thomas Muller. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski made it 3-0 with a fine header from Juan Bernat's cross before Robben grabbed another, similar to his opener. When Kostas Manolas was adjudged to have handled inside his own area, Muller stroked home the penalty to make it 5-0 in front of a stunned stadium. Things did improve for Roma in the second half as Ivory Coast midfielder Gervinho got them on the scoresheet with a close range header, but it was only a brief respite. Substitute Franck Ribery made it six, clipping the ball into the net after a precise through ball from Robben, before another sub -- Xherdan Shaqiri -- made it seven from close range. It brought back painful memories for Roma of another seven-goal mauling, when it lost by the same scoreline to English side Manchester United back in 2007. Bayern's third win from three outings saw it take firm control of Group E, with Roma second on four points. Roma boss Rudy Garcia said: ""We collapsed tactically and in terms of our aggressiveness. We let them play and they're too good for that. I was the first to make mistakes; it's not the players' fault."" Incredibly, Bayern's 45 minute heroics were bettered by Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk, who raced into a 6-0 lead over BATE Borisov in Belarus at halftime to set a new Champions League record. Shakhtar went on to win 7-0, Brazilian striker Luiz Adriano becoming only the second player to score five goals in a Champions League game, after Barcelona's Lionel Messi. Those 15 goals across two matches helped bump Tuesday's tally to 40 across the eight games, a new record for the continent's most lucrative club competition. News of Bayern's triumph will have provided succor for Manchester City, who were stunned by a late CSKA Moscow equalizer in Group E's other encounter, in Russia. For the second time in a month its 18,600 capacity Arena Khimki was closed to fans after sanctions from European soccer's governing body relating to incidents of racism. A controversial late penalty from Bebars Natcho canceled out goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner meaning the star-studded Premier League holders now face an uphill task to qualify from its group. The match was played out in sub zero temperatures and in front of just a handful of spectators after UEFA decreed CSKA's stadium must be closed to fans for its next three European games. UEFA charged the club with racism for the third time in a year after troubled flared among its fans during CSKA's defeat to AS Roma in September. The first came almost a year ago, when City's Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure was subject to racist chanting from the stands. Toure reacted furiously saying at some point UEFA had to ban a club ""for a couple of years."" CSKA hit back, saying the incident had been ""very exaggerated."" There were no such flashpoints on Tuesday, given only a clutch of people were present to witness another poor European performance from City. It had eased into a two-goal lead inside 38 first half minutes as it looked to register a first win in this season's competition. A ball over the top from David Silva put Edin Dzeko in on goal and he unselfishly squared for Argentina striker Aguero to tap into an empty net. Less than 10 minutes later, Aguero's shot from inside the box fell perfectly for England international Milner to slide in and convert. But as the match wore on City retreated, and after Ivory Coast international Seydou Doumbia had polished off a Ahmed Musa cross, he enticed Aleksandar Kolarov into a clumsy tackle, allowing Natcho to tuck home the penalty. When asked how City had let its lead slip, manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports: ""Because football is 95 minutes, we have scored two goals and had clear chances to score more but we didn't. ""I don't want to talk about the referee. We have nine more points to play and I am confident we will qualify."" Elsewhere, Lionel Messi moved within two goals of Raul's all-time Champions League scoring record with Barcelona's second goal in its 3-1 win over Dutch side Ajax. Neyamr scored the opening goal before the Argentina struck his 69th Champions League goal, Sandro RamÃ­rez adding a late third. English Premier League leaders Chelsea thrashed NK Maribor of Slovenia 6-0 at Stamford Bridge, Didier Droga scoring his first goal for the club since rejoining prior to the start of the season. Eden Hazard netted twice. An 87th minute strike from Uruguay forward Edinson Cavani helped French champions Paris Saint-Germain to a 1-0 victory over Apoel Nicosia in Cyprus. A goal in the dying seconds from Eric Choupo-Moting sealed a 4-3 success for German club Schalke in a epic encounter with Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon. But there was better news for Portugal as Porto registered a 2-1 victory over Spanish outfit Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of Ricardo Quaresma's winner.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Authorities in the northern Mexican state of Sonora have arrested eight people accused of killing two boys and one woman as human sacrifices for Santa Muerte -- the saint of death -- officials said Friday. The victims, two of whom were age 10, were killed and their blood was offered at an altar to the saint, according to Jose Larrinaga, spokesman for state prosecutors. The accused were asking the saint, who is generally portrayed as a skeleton dressed in a long robe and carrying a scythe, for protection, he said. Santa Muerte is a favorite among criminals and the country's drug traffickers. The saint, though not recognized by the Catholic Church, has taken off in popularity in recent years. Details of the case were laid out in a statement from the Sonora State Investigative Police (PEI), which described the cult as a ""Satanic sect."" The first of the three victims was allegedly killed in 2009; the last this month. Their bodies were found in the small mining community of Nacozari de Garcia, some 155 miles (250 kilometers) north of Hermosillo, the state capital. Many of the accused belong to the same family and one is just 15 years old, the PEI said. Authorities said they began looking into the case when one of the victim's families reported him missing. ""Nothing like this has ever happened before in the state of Sonora. And it's not something we're going to allow,"" said Guillermo Padres Elias, state governor.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The web of blame in the South Korean ferry sinking is getting wider, and now the country's president is accepting some of the heat. President Park Geun-hye apologized to the nation Tuesday over the government's initial response to the Sewol ferry tragedy. ""I am losing sleep as there is no news about saving more lives and because there are many families who don't know whether their loved ones are dead or alive still,"" the president said. ""I am at a loss for words for an apology that can be enough to console the pain and suffering even for a little while over insufficiency in efforts made to prevent the accident and also in the initial response to the accident,"" she added. ""I am sorry, and my heart is heavy that so many precious lives are lost because of the accident."" Videos capturing ferry's final moments fuel fresh outrage over ship's fate . Earlier Tuesday, Park attended a memorial in Ansan, the Seoul suburb where hundreds of students on board the ship were from. She talked to family members and laid flowers at the memorial site. ""We'll fix the problems and change our practices so we'll have safer nation and won't let them die in vain,"" Park said. The ferry sank April 16 on the country's southwest coast. The number of dead now stands at 210. Another 92 are still missing. ""All we are asking for is, 'Bring the dead bodies out,'"" a father wailed Tuesday. ""We know they are not alive now."" Images of ferry captain abandoning ship are shocking . On Monday, South Korean authorities arrested three people on suspicion of destroying evidence connected to the ferry sinking. Investigators also raided a Coast Guard office in a probe of how officials handled the first emergency call from a passenger. The director and two other people with the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon office were arrested and accused of destroying evidence related to the probe of Chonghaejin, the company that owns the ferry. The Korea Shipping Association is a trade group that promotes the interests of the country's shipping industry. The site raided was the Coast Guard building in Mokpo, which includes the South Jeolla province emergency center -- a facility that provides 119 services, akin to the 911 emergency service in the United States.

"New York (CNN) -- Several items that once belonged to sporting legends such as Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali and ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson went up for auction Saturday evening in New York, fetching millions of dollars. The auction, organized by the Heritage Auction House, took place Saturday evening at the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York City. The item which brought in the most money was ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson's game-used rookie bat from 1911. The bat sold for an ""incredible"" $958,000, according to Noah Fleisher, a spokesperson for Heritage Auctions. Jackson is remembered today as the biggest star of the 1919 Chicago White Sox to be banned for life from organized baseball for throwing that year's World Series. ""This bat serves as a key piece of evidence for the many millions who believe that Jackson deserves enshrinement in the Baseball Hall of Fame,"" said Chris Ivy, director of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions. Going into the auction, the Heritage House anticipated that Babe Ruth's pocket watch would bring in the most money. Ruth was presented the watch after helping the New York Yankees beat the New York Giants in the 1923 World Series. The watch, which for a time was believed to be lost, was auctioned off for $717,000, according to the auction house. ""As the Babe's personal award for the first world championship in New York Yankees franchise history, I believe that this is the most important piece of New York Yankees memorabilia that exists,"" Ivy said. Boxing gloves worn by Ali in the 1964 fight in which he shocked the world and unseated heavyweight champion Sonny Liston sold for $836,500, Fleisher said. Ali -- who had yet to change his name from Cassius Clay when he first met Liston in Miami -- had previously won a gold medal in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but he didn't become a household name until after beating Liston. Another item that made headlines were shards of the bat that Roger Clemens threw at Mike Piazza during the 2000 World Series after Piazza broke his bat after making contact with ""The Rocket's"" pitch. The shards went for $47,500, according to Fleisher.","""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson's 1911 bat goes for nearly $1 million at auction .

"Trenton, New Jersey (CNN) -- He's baaaaack. The defiant and combative Chris Christie that reporters knew from the past returned in full spring bloom on Friday, now that a report he commissioned cleared him of wrongdoing in the George Washington Bridge lane closure controversy. A few minutes into his first news conference in more than two months, New Jersey's Republican governor flashed his famous cantankerousness at suggestions he was hiding something about the apparently politically motivated traffic jams last September in Fort Lee. ""Colorful,"" he interjected as one journalist asked an extended question. ""Can you get to it already?"" Later, he cut off a reporter to complain she was wrong about the timing of events in December. ""Stop,"" he said, insisting that ""you have to get the facts right if you're going to ask the question."" When the journalist persisted, Christie cut in with ""excuse me, excuse me"" and then moved on by saying ""the premise of the question is so infirm I'm not going to answer it."" Christie's feisty approach had been missing of late, especially during his previous news conference in January that lasted almost two hours as the governor faced questions about the scandal labeled Bridgegate by Democratic foes. Separate federal and state investigations continue, but the report released this week found no evidence that Christie was involved in possible political retribution against Fort Lee's Democratic mayor for not endorsing his re-election. Christie holds first news conference in two months . Christie called the report exhaustive while critics labeled it a whitewash. Regardless of perspective, it gave Christie renewed vigor to face public questioning on the issue during Friday's news conference that lasted just over an hour. The return of his trademark gruffness provides multiple benefits for Christie, who easily won re-election last year in traditionally Democratic New Jersey and now has possible ambitions for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. He tightly managed Friday's news conference, basically telling journalists that he didn't care if they liked his answers or not. More importantly, his tough tactics play well among media-hating conservatives he will need to win the Republican nomination two years from now, if he runs. Some on the political right mistrust Christie because of moderate positions on issues such as gay marriage, as well as his public support for President Barack Obama as they toured the damage from Superstorm Sandy days before Obama's reelection in 2012. ""Now that he's been self-exonerated, it appears that he's decided to dispense with his faux humility of the past few months,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Eleithee said of the governor. One particularly heated exchange involved Bridget Kelly, his former deputy chief of staff whose now-infamous email ""Time for some Traffic problems in Fort Lee"" propelled what was a little noticed local controversy into an outright political crisis for the governor. Christie said he canned Kelly for lying to him, and he decided against meeting with her before the firing to avoid any perception of coercion or intimidation on the matter. When a reporter persisted on the topic, Christie exploded at the premise of the question. ""I don't know whether you can't take notes or you're not listening, but for you to characterize my last answer that I didn't want to ask her because I didn't want to know is so awful that it is beneath the job you hold,"" he said. Christie saved his best for last, concluding the more than hour-long session by sarcastically telling reporters ""it's such a joy and relief to be finally able to come back and interact with you in the kind and gentle way we always have."" ""I'd love to say I missed you,"" he added, ""but I didn't."" CNN's Steve Kastenbaum reported from Trenton for this story, which was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.","New Jersey governor takes on reporters at sometimes heated news conference .

"Washington (CNN) -- We now know President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner agree on at least one thing: In 2014, keeping the political base happy matters more than advancing once-critical policy initiatives. For the GOP speaker, a personal commitment to big immigration changes, including a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers, was sacrificed after it became clear there would be a conservative revolt. The argument from the right: turning out conservatives is the key to 2014 midterm success, and big immigration changes would anger the base. And now the President's counter move: dropping from his new budget an idea he said was essential just a year ago -- a more modest calculation of inflation adjustments for Social Security. Then, it was a critical piece of entitlement reform and deficit reduction. Now, the calculation is simple: liberals hate the idea, and pushing it in 2014 would anger a base the Democrats need in November. When Boehner retreated on immigration, it was the White House and its allies who said he was being shortsighted and putting politics ahead of the national interest. Inside Politics: Boehner says 'never mind' on immigration . Now, the flipside, from Boehner's office: ""The President has no interest in doing anything, even modest, to address our looming debt crisis. ... With three years left in office, it seems the President is already throwing in the towel."" A bit of hyperbole in that last part -- and the speaker has his own immigration flip-flop as a lesson in context: the President on Social Security, just like the speaker on immigration, is only throwing in the towel for this year, hoping it puts him in a stronger position politically next year. A lot can happen between February and November, but the best bet at this early juncture is that Republicans keep their House majority. The battle for control of the Senate is the big 2014 struggle, and the President has made clear protecting the fragile Democratic majority there is his top priority. Organizations focused on deficit reduction and structural budget reforms applauded Obama when he embraced the Social Security shift last year -- it is estimated to save $233 billion over a decade. Those same centrist organizations were quick to criticize his decision to abandon the Social Security change this year as a clear political shift left. ""The withdrawal by the President on this specific issue, and his general pivot away from focusing on the nation's medium and long-term fiscal challenges, reflects a dangerous trend,"" the Campaign to Fix the Debt said in a statement after the White House outlined the budget proposal. CNNMoney: Obama drops controversial Social Security proposal . The so-called ""chained CPI"" shift for Social Security will likely return as a debating point next year anyway, but Obama could face even more choices anathema to liberals if the GOP manages to take control of the Senate. What's the big deal about 'chained CPI'? Mindful of the stakes, it's clear leadership in both parties is moving away from any environment of major policy compromise and toward full scale-election positioning. To that end, Obama on Tuesday attends a 2014 Organizing for Action summit. The organization is the grassroots offshoot of the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaign. The summit goal: try to defy the midterm historical odds and protect Democratic seats.","Both Obama and Boehner dropped high-profile initiatives to keep base happy .

"Gaza (CNN) -- An Israeli delegation has been ordered home from talks in Cairo aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, a senior Israeli official said Tuesday, shortly after the Israeli military blamed militants in Gaza for breaking a truce. Palestinian negotiators placed the blame for the lack of progress in the talks on the Israelis. ""The Israeli delegation is still trying to impose (upon us) what they want, and this would be impossible for us to accept as Palestinians,"" said Azzam Al Ahmad, head of the Palestinian negotiators. The Palestinians introduced their latest position to Egyptian and Israeli negotiators on Tuesday, and are awaiting a response, Al Ahmad said. By late Tuesday, the armed wing of Hamas -- the Qassam Brigades -- said on its website that it had fired 29 rockets into Israel in 20 minutes. The Israel Defense Forces, in response, launched airstrikes and ordered bomb shelters open within a 40- to 80-kilometer range of Gaza. At least three people, including one infant, have been killed, and 52 people have been injured since the breakdown of the ceasefire, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. As rocket attacks and airstrikes resumed, one interpretation of the Israelis leaving Cairo was that they had given up on negotiations. Another Palestinian leader, Izzat Risheq, looked at it another way, saying the Israelis took the newest proposal home with them to share with their government. ""The chances of an agreement are very slim, and the situation is very difficult,"" he said. In the talks, Israel was calling for Gaza to be demilitarized, demanding that Hamas, which controls the territory, and other militant groups lay down their arms. Risheq said Monday that the group's weapons were ""for self-defense"" against Israel. ""But when we have our own Palestinian state with its own national army to protect its citizens, there will be no need for any party to carry any kind of weapons,"" he said. Palestinians say Israel's blockade is throttling the economy of the small, impoverished strip of land and the lives of its inhabitants. Among their demands are the rebuilding and reopening of Gaza's airport and the establishment of a seaport. But Israeli authorities -- who retain control of Gaza's airspace, Mediterranean waters and their shared border -- say releasing their grip on what goes into and out of the territory isn't feasible while Hamas and other groups are still building up their arsenals of weapons. Cease-fire unravels . The rocket fire came only hours after the ceasefire was extended until the end of the day, as Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, struggling to reach a more lasting agreement, reported little progress. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the IDF to respond to the rockets, a senior Israeli official told CNN. An IDF statement shortly afterward said strikes were being carried out against targets in Gaza. Nine Palestinians, including three children, were wounded in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, Ashraf el-Qedra, spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, told CNN. Al Aqsa TV reported airstrikes in northern and central Gaza, as well. The United States condemned the renewed rocket attacks, with a State Department official reiterating the U.S. position that Israel has a right to defend itself against such attacks. ""We hope that the parties can reach an agreement on a sustainable ceasefire, or if necessary, agree to yet another extension of their temporary ceasefire so they can continue in conversations,"" Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman, said. ""But as of right now, today's developments, we are very concerned about and it is our understanding that ... the ceasefire has broken down."" Hamas blames Israel . A thick plume of smoke could be seen rising from a building in southern Gaza apparently hit by an Israeli airstrike. A CNN team on the ground also saw earlier what appeared to be three rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel, leaving smoke trails in the sky. Shortly before the rockets were launched, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said in an e-mailed statement to CNN: ""If Netanyahu does not understand our message and people's demands in Gaza through political language, we know a way to make him understand."" A banner on the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV blamed Israel for violating the truce. The conflict, which began in early July, has killed more than 2,000 Palestinians, leaving entire Gaza neighborhoods in rubble. The violence has killed 67 people on the Israeli side, with militants in Gaza firing roughly 3,500 rockets toward Israel.

"(CNN) -- She was the world's crusader against the trafficking of girls for sex in Cambodia, and she told an extraordinary personal tale: she was a village girl sold by a grandfatherly man into sex slavery. Triumphant as well as beautiful, Somaly Mam won attention from Oprah Winfrey, a New York Times columnist, a PBS documentary, Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2009, and even CNN, which named her a ""Hero"" in 2007. The fame -- and her memoir ""The Road of Lost Innocence"" -- generated millions of dollars for her Somaly Mam Foundation, fighting sex traffickers. But her personal story wasn't true, according to a Newsweek exposé this month. In the wake of the magazine's revelations, Mam resigned this week from her foundation, which had hired a law firm to independently investigate Mam's background when questions arose. The law firm's findings weren't disclosed by the foundation. Mam, whose book says she was born around 1970 or 1971, couldn't be reached for comment, but the foundation still bearing her name issued a statement this week: . ""As a result of (the law firm's) efforts, we have accepted Somaly's resignation effective immediately,"" foundation executive director Gina Reiss-Wilchins said. ""Despite the foundation's heartfelt disappointment, we remain grateful to Somaly's work over the past two decades and for helping to build a foundation that has served thousands of women and girls. ""The foundation's commitment to eradicating the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and girls in Southeast Asia remains steadfast, and we ask that you continue to stand with us in the face of these challenging times,"" Reiss-Wilchins said. Villagers contradict her . A Newsweek story by Simon Marks cited how Mam's childhood acquaintances, village leaders and even a cousin contradicted her autobiography. Residents of the Thloc Chhroy village told the magazine they never saw or met the cruel ""Grandfather"" who turned her into a domestic slave as a child, a rich Chinese merchant who raped her, or a violent soldier whom Mam said she was forced to marry as a teenager. Mam claimed all those experiences in her story of survival. In fact, Mam arrived with a family and lived a normal life in the village from 1981 until 1987, when she finished high school and then took a teachers exam, according to a commune chief, childhood friends, a cousin and a school official interviewed by Newsweek. Furthermore, ""Mam was well-known and popular in their small village, a happy, pretty girl with pigtails,"" Newsweek reported. Those villagers' accounts differed from the horrific personal narrative that Mam told the media and readers of her memoir. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Marks said he spoke with ""to dozens of villagers, former teachers, commune chiefs, who all say that they witnessed Somaly Mam arrive in the village."" ""They say that they saw her arrive in the village with a family, she grew up in the village living a relatively normal life,"" said Marks, who's a contributor to Newsweek. Millions in donations . Mam's foundation attracted such corporate partners as Estee Lauder Companies and Goldman Sachs. Actress Susan Sarandon sits on the group's advisory board. By 2011, the Somaly Mam Foundation attracted $2.1 million in revenue and incurred $3.67 million in expenses, according to its annual report. In 2012, those revenues rose to $2.78 million and the foundation's expenses fell to $2.3 million, its annual report said. That year, the foundation helped thousands of sex workers: 9,269 in Cambodia, 1,356 in Laos and 6,675 in Vietnam, the report said. Many people in Cambodia long doubted Mam's personal story, but they feared her duality: Mam was polished and charming in front of international donors, but was ""tyrannical"" and ""moody"" in the office, even ordering the girls in her foundation to do her personal chores, the magazine reported, quoting named and unnamed sources. False claims by ""rescued"" girls . Some of the girls and young women whom Mam rescued from slavery were used in testimonials promoting Mam's foundation, but at least one of those girls later ""confessed that her story was fabricated and carefully rehearsed for the cameras under Mam's instruction,"" Newsweek reported. Meas Ratha portrayed herself on a French television program in 1998 as a teenager who had been sold to a brothel and was forced to become a sex slave, but last year, Ratha said the foundation chose her to go on television after auditioning her, the magazine said. In fact, Ratha was never a sex slave. Her parents couldn't care for their seven children so they sent Ratha and her sister in 1997 to a refuge center of group called Agir Pour Les Femmes en Situation Precaire, or AFESIP (Helping Women in Danger), whose then president and co-founder was Mam, Newsweek said. Now in her early 30s in Phnom Penh, Ratha told Newsweek she reluctantly agreed to the fake story about being a child sex slave: ""Somaly said that...if I want to help another woman I have to do [the interview] very well,"" she told the magazine. Ratha wasn't the only purported rescued girl telling fictions, according to the magazine. Long Pros claimed a woman kidnapped her and sold her to a brothel, where she was tortured and forced to undergo two crude abortions. Pros alleged an angry pimp gouged out one of her eyes with a piece of metal. Mam rescued Pros, and Pros' story was recounted by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof in 2009. In 2008, he also profiled Mam in a column headlined ""A Heroine From The Brothels."" But Pros' family, neighbors and doctor contradicted her account: A physician performed surgery on a nonmalignant tumor covering her right eye when she was 13, and medical records clearly showed her eye before and after the surgery, Newsweek said. Pros was then sent to Mam's group to be part of a vocational training program, an eye hospital director told the magazine. This week, the foundation ended its relationship with Pros, also as a result of the law firm's investigation into her background, Reiss-Wilchins said. ""We are permanently removing Ms. Pros from any affiliation with the organization or our grant partner, but will help her to transition into the next phase of her life,"" Reiss-Wilchins said.","Somaly Mam drew international attention for her personal tale of surviving sex slavery .
She used that narrative to begin a foundation and collect money to save girls .

"(CNN) -- For some 100 years, tourists have flocked Arenhold Hooper's ostrich family farm in Oudtshoorn, the South African city renowned as the ostrich capital of the world, to ride its long-legged, long-necked birds. Today, however, Hooper's Highgate Ostrich show farm is devoid of both birds and people after tests showed that a major avian flu outbreak in the region has infected his birds. As a result, all of Hooper's 1,500 ostriches have been culled. ""We do not have a business at this stage, our business is closed,"" says Hooper, whose farm has been empty eight months now. ""Tremendously frustrated -- it has been a battle of unanswered questions, it has been sleepless nights, it has been staff concerns, it has been financial concerns. We still do not have the green light so the sleepless nights and the frustration still carries on,"" he adds. Hooper is just one of the hundreds of Oudtshoorn farmers facing tough times after the H5N2 virus was first detected in the region in April -- the strain, officials say, does not pose a threat to humans but could mutate and affect poultry. More from Marketplace Africa: Agriculture must play 'critical role' in Africa's future . Since then, African authorities have imposed an exports suspension of ostrich products and banned restocking until the entire region is declared virus-free. In total, 41,000 ostriches have been culled. Officials say farmers whose animals were culled have received compensation of 50 million rand ($6.5 million) but warn that the impact on the industry, which accounts for up to 80% of the world's ostrich products, is still severe. ""The industry estimates that it is losing more than 100 million rand ($13 million) per month which is very serious,"" says Wouter Kriel, the spokesman for the Western Cape Provincial Department of Agriculture. ""The situation cannot continue indefinitely and we very urgently need to try and get the industry back on its feet again,"" adds Kriel. South Africa is the global leader in ostrich farming. Its industry exports 90% of its output, generates about 1.2 billion rand ($155 million) a year and provides direct job opportunities for 20,000 people in Oudtshoorn. Its main export product is meat, which is particularly popular in Europe for its low fat and cholesterol levels and accounts for more than 60% of the industry's turnover. Other items include leathers, eggs and feathers, used primarily to adorn fanciful costumes of carnival dancers, such as those cramming Rio de Janeiro's streets this week. Read also: Rhino horn trade triggers extinction threat . Anton Kruger, head of the South African Ostrich Business Chamber, the business body representing the industry, says that Oudtshoorn's meat-exporting farms that were spared the virus are also suffering the strain, hit by the European Union import ban on all ostrich meat from the area. ""They still have the ostriches in the farm, they keep on feeding them, they have to keep on paying their workers,"" he says. That is one of the big issues with the other farmers."" Late last month, authorities announced that the seventh round of surveillance for the H5N2 virus were negative. If the next round of tests also yields negative results, then the government can deem the outbreak to be over -- it is only then that South Africa can apply to the European Union, their biggest importer of ostrich meat, to lift their ban and farmers can start restocking. But Kruger says even if the ban is lifted ""it will take at least three years for the industry to recover,"" affecting the livelihood of the area's farmers. ""These are very rural areas with high unemployment figures so should the industry collapse in those areas it would have a very big, socio-economic impact,"" he warns. Read more: Ivory Coast seeks chocolate fairness for farmers . Back in Oudtshoorn, Hooper's staff have started a government-funded retraining program just in case the farm never re-opens again, while those in the industry await the latest test results. Hooper, whose family has been running the farm for five generations, says he is determined that even if there are more delays in restocking, one day he will be able to get people riding his ostriches again. ""It is in our blood to do what we do and we will keep fighting for that,"" he says. ""I will not get out of this industry, I will keep fighting until we get birds back on this property and do what we have been doing for more than 100 years,"" adds Hooper.","South Africa's ostrich industry is facing tough times after a major bird flu outbreak .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II dipped a toe into 21st-century communications Friday when she posted her first tweet. Signing herself Elizabeth R., for regina or queen, she welcomed visitors to a new Information Age gallery focused on the evolution of modern communications at the Science Museum in London. The inaugural tweet was posted to the official British monarchy Twitter feed, which has more than 700,000 followers. And in case anyone had any doubts that the Queen's own hand was behind it, another tweet quickly followed vouching for its authenticity. The 88-year-old monarch has spent more than 60 years on the throne, during which time she has taken other steps to embrace new technology. In 1953, at her own request, she became the first British monarch to have her coronation broadcast live on television. That act prompted a boom in TV sales, with an extra half a million sets sold in the weeks running up to the coronation, according to the British monarchy Twitter feed.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Postal Service Wednesday announced it will stop delivering first-class mail on Saturdays, expecting to save about $2 billion a year. Given the rapid rate of decline in letter mail and the loss of revenues, this is a welcome cost-cutting move. But this change will not make the Postal Service sustainable for the long term. Cost cutting would not have made the horse and buggy business sustainable in the dawning age of the automobile. The same is true of typewriters during the advent of word processors, or slide rules when calculators arrived. There is a natural limit to how far costs can be cut, and to how much that can help the Service survive in the new communications marketplace. The Postal Service's business model needs fundamental change for it to thrive and avoid liquidation. Those reforms must focus not only on reducing costs, but also on allowing the Service to generate new sources of revenue from its existing assets.The experience in other countries suggests that this is possible. Following that lead, the first steps should include corporatization and de-monopolization. First-class letter mail -- by far the Postal Service's most profitable type -- has fallen by a stunning one-third since its 2001 peak, while overall mail volume is down by almost 25%. Revenues have also dropped which, when combined with high costs, have created the Postal Service's own fiscal cliff. The service lost almost $16 billion in 2012 and is now losing about $25 million per day. It has hit the limit of its $15 billion credit line with the U.S. Treasury, and has only enough cash for a few weeks of operations. Given the explosion in cheap, instantaneous, electronic communications, none of this is surprising. Mail delivery is now like offering transportation by horse in the dawning automobile era. Unlike horse transportation, however, it's possible for mail delivery services to remain viable, innovative, self-sustaining businesses even in the electronic age, as posts around the world have shown. For the Postal Service to survive and thrive, however, Congress needs to step up, and soon. Congress must determine what level of physical mail service, if any, is necessary for government to ensure when there are many electronic alternatives. Second, it must decide how it (as opposed to the Postal Service) plans to pay for that service level. Dimensions of such guaranteed service include the geographic area to be covered, what rate will be charged (and whether it will be uniform across areas), and how frequent mail service will be. Congress then needs to free up the Postal Service to become a more commercial entity. But that can't happen unless it also eliminates both of the service's monopolies (one over mail delivery and the other over mailbox use) and changes its organizational structure. Repeal of the monopolies is necessary because the service will never get the freedom to pursue new lines of business aggressively, and thus to generate new revenue, unless it is subject to the discipline of competition. CNN Money: How to build a better postal service . Changes in the service's organizational structure are necessary to attract the management talent and prompt the changes required to become self-sustaining. The first step is corporatization, which makes the service subject to the standard set of corporate laws and norms associated with a large commercial entity. Although it creates ownership shares in the new entity, those shares are not sold to the public. This is distinct from privatization in which shares are created and then sold to investors. Postal corporatization would be a big improvement. It provides managers with more focused incentives and helps to raise the additional capital necessary to pursue new services and lines of business. Focused incentives are critical since the only bright spots in the service's business are in its most competitive, such as parcel delivery. The United States now lags behind most other developed countries in all such reforms. All 27 members of the European Union have eliminated their postal monopolies. New Zealand repealed its delivery monopoly in 1998, Sweden in 2003. Germany and the Netherlands repealed in 2007 and 2009, respectively. The threat of competition associated with monopoly repeal has helped postal services in those countries to become more efficient, more effective enterprises. Other countries are also far ahead on organizational reforms. Germany's post -- now Deutsche Post DHL -- was privatized in 2005 and has become a major player in the global delivery and logistics business. It reformed its compensation structure, brought in managers from other sectors and modernized its delivery network. It operates in 220 countries and is now the world's largest courier company. The UK post -- Royal Mail -- will be privatized this year. One hundred percent of the formerly government-owned post in the Netherlands is now privately owned. New Zealand Post was corporatized in 1987, while all government subsidies were eliminated in 1988. New Zealand Post has become a successful, innovative global company focusing on parcel delivery, logistics and other businesses. There is no reason why the U.S. Postal Service cannot also become a leader in the global delivery sector. It already has a far-flung network of sorting centers and letter carriers that allows it to deliver physical documents to every U.S. address six days every week. Given the size and diversity of the United States, that is an amazing feat. It could use that capability to deliver mail ""the last mile"" in innovative ways, such as assisting new businesses in the area to advertise. It could also tailor its delivery frequency to the demand for home delivery in a particular region. Some mailers may want to saturate an area with mail, while others may want slow, steady delivery. The current ""one size fits all"" approach is clearly inefficient. The Postal Service would also be freed up to seek new revenue by forming alliances with global logistics and courier companies. Moreover, it has a massive portfolio of real estate that includes large buildings in prime downtown locations as well as massive sorting centers throughout the country. Its real estate alone is likely worth tens of billions of dollars. Selectively selling some of those assets would free up resources for the service to pursue new market opportunities. Indeed, it probably has enough assets so that -- if properly managed -- it could recapitalize its core business without a taxpayer bailout. But Congress must act to allow that to happen. As the experience in many other countries shows, there is no reason for the U.S. Postal Service's agonizing decline and impending collapse. If Congress borrows from international experience, and acts decisively to reform postal policy, the venerable U.S. Postal Service can also emerge as a viable company in the Internet age. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick Geddes.","Rick Geddes: U.S. Postal Service won't deliver first-class mail on Saturdays to cut costs .

"Spencer, Iowa (CNN) -- Joni Ernst takes running for Senate literally. Try keeping up with her as she races through a rainy parade. It's a workout. Ernst doesn't march, she sprints -- darting side-to-side, shaking as many hands as possible -- a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard recruiting potential voters for her campaign. The Iraq War veteran and little-known conservative Iowa state senator burst onto the political scene earlier this year with the TV ad of the political primary season. Smiling straight to camera, Ernst says in the ad that she knows how to cut pork because she grew up on a farm castrating pigs. The squealing pigs in the background became a trademark of her campaign. She decisively beat three GOP primary opponents with the support of a broad coalition of Republican groups -- rare in these divided times for the GOP. Still, Ernst's conservative views, combined with her interesting personal story and boundless energy, have made her one of this election yearÂ¹s most high-profile tea party favorites. The problem for Ernst is that while Iowa has its share of conservatives who vote in GOP primaries, and of course its first in the nation presidential caucuses every four years, it is actually a relatively moderate state. And Ernst is running for an open Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Tom Harkin, a venerable liberal in the state and nationwide. With a new CNN/ORC poll showing just a 1-point difference between Ernst and Democratic opponent Bruce Braley, well within the margin of error, it's no surprise that Ernst is trying to moderate her image. When we asked whether she wanted to be a senator in the mold of Ted Cruz, the freshman conservative firebrand from Texas, without missing a beat she replied, ""Oh, no."" ""I'm a senator in the mold of Joni Ernst, just an independent leader who will represent Iowa,"" Ernst told CNN. Ernst says she was harassed in the military . Make issues the issue . Democrats working to elect Braley believe best the way to beat Ernst and keep this seat in Democratic hands is to steer the conversation away from her persona and toward her position on issues, which Democrats argue fall well out of the mainstream of Hawkeye State voters. ""Ernst and the people supporting her don't seem to want to engage and talk about where she stands on the issues,"" Braley said. With primary over, Iowa Senate race gets ugly . Ernst did answer some of our questions about those issues. That includes when she was a state senator and co-sponsored personhood legislation, which would legally mean life begins at conception. It's a position some self-described pro-life voters do not support, but Ernst stands by it. ""I promote a culture of life. I promote life. That's the person I am,"" Ernst told us. One of the practical results of the personhood measure -- life starts at conception -- is that it would likely outlaw some forms of birth control. She tried to distance herself from that notion, telling us, ""Heavens, no."" ""I am someone who supports a woman's right to birth control, absolutely, so to say that is absolutely false and misleading,"" she said. ""So, if women would like to talk to me about those items, I am happy to talk it over. Birth control yes, and promoting a culture of life, yes."" On pocketbook issues, Ernst opposes a nationwide, federal minimum wage, which Braley's campaign thinks is so harmful politically to her that it's running ads and talking about it nonstop. She explained to us that she doesn't believe minimum wage should be a ""one size fits all approach,"" but rather state by state. ""We really do need to have a minimum wage that is set based on local economies. And I think the state is best to do that,"" Ernst said. She said she believes the current minimum wage, $7.25 per hour, is ""appropriate for Iowa, but that's up for our state legislators to decide, and I'm willing to have those discussions at the state level."" When we pointed out that a lot of families live on minimum wage, she replied, ""It's a beginning wage, it shouldn't be the wage they survive on forever."" Ernst: Savvy, rebellious or both? Ernst is the beneficiary of millions of dollars from outside groups funded by the Koch brothers and other big national donors. She has no shortage of strategic help from GOP operatives on a national level, hoping this will be one of the six seats Republicans need to win the Senate. But she doesn't always take the advice she gets. On our three-hour drive from Des Moines to Spencer, we got a call from one of her operatives informing us that our scheduled brief interview was canceled. ""No more national interviews for a while,"" was what we were told. But when we arrived and approached Ernst, instead of avoiding us, she greeted us warmly and answered several questions along the parade route. Whether that was savvy (avoiding unflattering pictures of her running away) or rebellion against Washington advisers, it was a telling level of sophistication for a first-time statewide candidate in a high-profile race. Braley working to repair his image . As for her Democratic opponent, he, too, has a comfort level and natural rapport with voters -- characteristics that fly in the face of the unfortunate image of an out-of-touch Washington insider he helped inflict on himself with a series of early gaffes. The congressman complained about no towel service in the House gym during the government shutdown. And Braley was caught on tape disparaging Iowa's popular senior GOP Sen. Charles Grassley and farmers -- a big Iowa no-no -- by calling Grassley a ""farmer from Iowa who never went to law school."" While walking with us through the quiet streets of his hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, Braley owned those mistakes without being defensive. ""All of us say things that we regret. And if you grow up in Iowa, the important lesson to learn is that if you make a mistake, you take responsibility for it, and that's what I did,"" he told CNN. First lady to campaign for Democrat in tight Iowa Senate race . He brought us to this small Iowa town where his mother still teaches school at 85 and he started a paper route in third grade, facts that Braley hopes can beat back a narrative that Republicans seized on after his rhetorical stumbles: that he's a Washington creature now who can't relate to Iowans. ""I've baled hay, I've worked farms, I was a truck driver, a construction worker. I was a janitor in this town. I learned the value of hard work from the people I grew up here with,"" Braley said. ""They taught me that it's important to respect other people, to be a good listener, and to work hard and fight for people who don't have an ability to be their own voice. And that's what I've done in the House and that's what type of senator I'd be,"" he told us. While Iowa isn't conservative, is certainly isn't ultraliberal. Tom Harkin, feted by the Clintons at his final famous steak fry over the weekend, is a unique public figure in the state -- quite popular statewide despite his openly liberal leanings. Still, Braley told us he would be ""a progressive problem solver in the mold of Tom Harkin."" Congressman apologizes for #TrailofTears tweet . Gender gap, even with a GOP woman on ballot . If Ernst, a 44-year-old mother and stepgrandmother, were to win this seat, she would be the first woman senator from Iowa. But the new CNN/ORC poll shows that 57% of women voters in Iowa support her male, Democratic opponent. The traditional gender gap between the parties still exists here, even with a Republican woman on the ballot. We only had a chance to ask Ernst one quick question about gender along the parade route here -- why she thinks so few of the 20 women U.S. senators are Republican? (There are four GOP female senators). ""That'd is a really good question. You need to ask the voters in all those other states,"" she said abruptly before racing off to shake more hands of potential voters. Finally, a Democrat who wants Obama to come . Like many Democrats on the ballot this year, Braley is weighed down by an unpopular president, whose approval rating here now stands at just 37%. That's remarkable, considering that Iowa is where Barack Obama's big 2008 caucuses win knocked Hillary Clinton off her White House path -- and where Obama beat GOP rivals in 2008 and 2012. If Republicans take control of the Senate for Obama's last two years in office, it would likely sting even more if Iowa elected a Republican and helped deliver that blow to the President. Still, while Democratic candidates in red states keep their distance, Braley does not. ""If the President has time in his schedule to come to Iowa in this campaign, I'd welcome him,"" he said. ""Iowans are the type of people who welcome somebody of significant importance, and that would certainly include President Obama. Even though they may disagree with him, every four years we welcome people of both parties to come and talk about important policy issues, and I think that would be one of the reasons why it would be alright for President Obama to come to Iowa,"" Braley explained. ""Come on, President Obama!"" That was Ernst's reaction when we about her opponent's willingness to host the unpopular Democratic President on the campaign trail here. ""I think that would be wonderful,"" Ernst told us, barely hiding a mischievous smile. In Iowa, DREAMers confront Clinton .

The Duke of Cambridge, the second in line to the throne, is pictured with his wife and son looking out of an open window. The smiling duchess, 32, is holding Prince George on her knee as he focuses his attention on the family pet Lupo, a black cocker spaniel pictured sitting on the duke's lap. Catherine is wearing white, while William, 31, looks relaxed in a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. George sports a light blue jumper with his name written on it, over a white collar. The picture was taken by photographer Jason Bell, who also took the official photos for Prince George's christening, last October. The family will be in New Zealand and Australia from April 7 to 25 but it's unclear what opportunities the public in both countries will have to glimpse the youngest royal in person. Announcing the royal couple's planned engagements earlier this month, the Prince's private secretary identified occasions at which the youngest royal might be present, but kept an element of suspense: . ""George being just a little over eight-months-old by the time they travel, I'm sure you will appreciate that the couple will have to make a final decision on those moments much closer to the time."" Prince George's first official photo was taken by his maternal grandfather, Michael Middleton. It showed Prince William and Catherine -- the latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanket -- on the lawn of her parents' home in Berkshire. New Zealanders may be hoping their country provides the backdrop for an updated version of that photo during the royal tour, after all, Prince William was recorded taking his first steps on the lawn of Government House in Auckland on his first visit, in 1983. Royal itinerary . The Duke last visited New Zealand after the devastating 2011 earthquake in Christchurch. On this trip, the royal couple will visit the city together and stop to remember the 185 people killed. As well as being Prince George's first visit Down Under, his mother Catherine will be making her debut. ""There's no hiding the enthusiasm for the visit by both the Duke and the Duchess. The Duke, because he has been before; and the Duchess because she has never been to either country but has wanted to do so as long as she can remember,"" Kensington Palace said in its earlier announcement. The pair may not always be in complete agreement on their trip, however. Kensington Palace said the Duke and Duchess were ""just a little competitive"" and some of the events on the itinerary will pit husband against wife. The royal couple will board separate Team NZ America's Cup yachts for some informal racing in Auckland and coach rival teams in ""rippa"" rugby, a non-contact version of Rugby Union, in the South Island city of Dunedin. A century after the outbreak of World War I, the tour will also see William and Kate paying tribute to both countries' war dead and visiting military bases. Their last day will be April 25 -- ANZAC [Australian and New Zealand Army Corps] Day, which originally marked the landing of soldiers from both nations at Gallipoli, Turkey, in 1915. In the eight-month campaign fought there, 2,721 New Zealanders and 8,709 Australians died, before the allied forces withdrew. The day is now a tribute to those who have died in all conflicts. The Duke and Duchess will plant a seed from a pine tree at the site of the battle at the Australian War Memorial in Australia's capital city, Canberra, before returning to London. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report .","Britain's Prince William and Kate have released the third official portrait of Prince George .

"(CNN) -- Gmail doesn't cost any money to use, but it's not free. Google's popular online e-mail service, which turns 10 Tuesday, may not charge for its Gmail accounts. But the company is still collecting payment in the form of massive amounts of personal information about the people who use it. With an estimated 500-plus million users, Gmail has grown to dominate the Web-mail world. It has also repeatedly found itself in hot water over privacy. Gmail is facing multiple privacy lawsuits in the United States and Europe, some accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for scanning the content of e-mails. Google reported $16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone. One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users. ""The basic premise of Gmail is, we'll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we're scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant,"" said Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law. Scanning and ads . Gmail looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context, then matches the e-mail up with related ads. A conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class, for example, might trigger an ad for a weight-loss product. Data gathered through e-mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting. What many consumers don't consider is that companies such as Google can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search, maps, e-mail and Google+, its social network. ""Nothing in life is free, and as a result it is important for people to understand what value they bring to a free service of any kind,"" said Behnam Dayanim, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Washington. When people send and receive messages using a free e-mail service, they are sharing details about their interests, who their connections are and what their finances look like. That information might seem mundane on the surface, but when extracted and organized, it's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers. All the major e-mail providers, including Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo, benefit one way or another from offering a free service. The provider might serve up general or targeted ads, generate a user base for marketing other services, or just use the e-mail service to build brand recognition. And while Gmail may have popularized it, targeted ads based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies. It's how social media companies such as Facebook and search engines such as Bing make money as well as a huge number of apps that scrape contact and location information from users. It's also led to a number of similar privacy lawsuits against other companies, including LinkedIn, Yahoo and Facebook. Any company that collects personal information has to advise its customers what it is doing with their information and comply with any relevant privacy laws, Dayanim said. These are usually laid out in the lengthy terms and conditions and privacy policies that customers barely skim before hitting ""agree."" However, many of the details about how exactly Google's program works have been kept confidential. And critics say the service doesn't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers' information. Legal action . When Gmail made its debut in 2004, it was upfront about the fact that it would show contextual ads targeted to match the topic of e-mail threads. People still lined up to be accepted as early beta users of the service because it was slickly designed, included ample amounts of storage, and was excellent at filtering out spam. And it didn't cost anything to sign up. One problem is that not all the people affected have agreed to Google's privacy policy. One group of plaintiffs in a recent class-action lawsuit were non-Gmail users who sent messages to Gmail accounts. Google responded that non-Gmail customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e-mails to people who did use the service. Google has defended its e-mail scanning program by pointing out that it's automated and handled by computers picking out keywords. Google's employees aren't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers' spat. Google also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam, and for features such as Priority Inbox and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories. A federal judge dealt a blow to the case this month, ruling it couldn't proceed as a class-action lawsuit because the different groups weren't cohesive enough. A class-action lawsuit could have cost Google trillions of dollars in damages. A changing landscape . When Gmail debuted in 2004, the rules for collecting user information were looser. But the privacy landscape has changed drastically over the past 10 years. Several U.S. states have passed laws that restrict the use of personal information, the Federal Trade Commission has been more active pursuing privacy violations, and the industry has adopted best practices about what's acceptable. One thing that hasn't changed is the federal law with the biggest impact on how and when companies can share data with third parties. The Electronics Communication Privacy Act is a dusty piece of legislation passed in 1986, long before the era of cloud-based e-mail. Many legislators and technology companies (including Google) have lobbied to have the law updated to reflect the times. Meanwhile, consumers must increasingly weigh the value of using a free e-mail service such as Gmail against their personal privacy.","Google's Gmail has turned online e-mail service into a profitable business .
The company scans e-mails and uses data for targeted ads and user profiles .
Many users don't realize how much their personal information is worth .
Gmail has been the target of multiple privacy lawsuits ."
"(CNN) -- Seattle paleontologists Friday safely removed the largest fossilized mammoth tusk discovered in the region from a construction site, according to the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. The fossil is probably a tusk from a Columbian mammoth, or Mammuthus columbi, which was designated the Washington state fossil in 1998, according to a statement on the museum website. The tusk, 8 feet 6 inches long, appears to be the most intact and largest discovered in Seattle. The fossil was found Tuesday about 7 feet below an AMLI Residential Partners apartment development site, the statement said. Burke paleontologists estimate that the tusk is at least 16,000 years old, but could be up to 60,000 years old. Carbon dating would provide a definitive age. ""The tusk presents a rare opportunity for paleontologists and other researchers to understand the paleoenvironmental conditions present in Seattle during the ice age,"" the statement said. Scott Koppelman, senior vice president of AMLI Residential, said in a prepared statement that the excavation will cause a construction delay, ""but the scientific and educational benefits of this discovery clearly outweigh the costs and delay. This is an exciting discovery for our local Northwest history."" The tusk was taken to the museum, which has paleontology collections that include 25 mammoth fossils from King County, most of which are skeletal fragments and were found in Seattle. Burke paleontologists earlier removed dirt from around the waterlogged tusk with shovels, trowels and brushes, and placed layers of plaster-soaked burlap bandages on one side of the tusk, the museum said in a statement. The plaster was meant to protect the tusk when moved. The drying process could take at least 12 months, during which time Burke conservators will remove the plaster and repair any damage to the tusk. ""Since the tusk is on private property, it could have ended up in a private collection,"" said Christian Sidor, the museum's curator of vertebrate paleontology. ""We are very fortunate that AMLI contacted us to remove and care for the tusk."" According to the museum, contemporary ice age mammals include giant ground sloths (Megalonyx jeffersoni) like one found at SeaTac airport and now on display at the Burke Museum, and extinct bison (Bison antiquus), among others. ""Conditions were much colder and drier than today, and the region was probably covered with grassland and occasional pine trees, akin to the northern edges of modern boreal forests,"" the statement said. Mastodons and mammoths are ancient elephant relatives that once inhabited North America, the statement said. Both became extinct as glaciers receded at the end of the ice ages between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago. Mammoths, which were larger than mastodons and much more closely related to elephants, arrived in North America from Asia about 2 million years ago, according to the museum. ""Columbian Mammoths grew to 12 feet at the shoulder, taller than woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) and about the size of the modern Asian elephant (Elephas maximus),"" the museum website said. ""Their very long tusks curved down from the face, then upward at the ends. Columbian mammoths were herbivores, with a diet that included grasses and conifers. They chewed grass with large, flat, washboard-like teeth that are very similar to the teeth of modern elephants.""","NEW: Fossilized tusk from likely Columbian mammoth removed from construction site .

"Cairo (CNN) -- An Egyptian court on Monday again denied bail to three Al Jazeera journalists who are jailed on terrorism-related charges in a case that has drawn international condemnation from human rights groups. Correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohamed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed were allowed outside a caged dock to address the court in a hearing Monday, each taking the opportunity to deny allegations that they were affiliated with the banned Islamist group Muslim Brotherhood. The three were arrested December 29 at a Cairo hotel room and later charged with joining what the government says is a terrorist group -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- as well as broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. The Egyptian government says they distorted their coverage in favor of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood. The accused have denied the allegations against them, saying they were simply doing their jobs. Fahmy told the court that he and his colleagues worked in public rather than in secrecy, and covered Egypt as they would other countries. He questioned how any journalist could be labeled a terrorist. Their lawyers also took up the issue of Fahmy's health. Fahmy, a former CNN producer, injured his shoulder before his arrest in December while working as bureau chief for Al Jazeera English in Cairo. He has complained about not getting proper medical treatment while in prison and says that because of the lack of treatment, he no longer has full use of his right arm. On Monday, the defense team asked that Fahmy have his shoulder operated on at a hospital. Earlier this month -- nearly three months after his arrest -- he was taken to a civilian hospital for the first time for a shoulder scan. Baher told the court Monday that his wife was in the final stages of pregnancy and he wanted to see his child when he was born. Greste said that he and his colleagues posed no threat or danger inside the country or outside. Human rights groups have criticized the trial, saying the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. The case comes amid a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the military's overthrow of Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, in July. Morsy, who had been a Muslim Brotherhood leader, was ousted after mass protests against his rule. Morsy was elected in 2012, a year after a popular uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule. During Monday's hearing the court, as it has previously, denied the journalists' request for bail. The trial was adjourned until April 10.

"(CNN) -- Season four of ""The Walking Dead"" has featured some of the most brutal scenes in the popular series' history. (Yes, that's a warning for those behind on the show. Spoilers ahead!) There was the gut-wrenching death of Hershel in the midseason finale, but there was also the burning death of David and Karen early on. It was a mystery who killed them, but it soon came out that Carol (Melissa McBride) did it to stop them from spreading a deadly disease through the prison. When Rick learned what happened, he banished Carol from the prison, but she reappeared in the second half of the season. Young sisters Lizzie and Mika were left under Carol's care after their father died, but it became clear that Lizzie had a skewed sense of right and wrong, and she killed her younger sister to bring her back as a walker. Then Carol decided yet again that another survivor was too dangerous to live and shot Lizzie in the back of the head. The reaction to this episode was huge. With McBride at the center of some of this season's more memorable scenes, CNN spoke to her about Carol's evolution and the finale Sunday night. CNN: What was your initial reaction when you learned what Carol was going to have to do this season? McBride: It was surprising to me that Carol was going in this direction, absolutely. But it also made a great deal of sense to me that they would take her in this direction. First of all it's a very interesting arc for this character, considering that she's lost her daughter; she carries so much responsibility for that, and also (she's) trying to navigate this world. CNN: Is this the most challenging acting role you've ever had? McBride: By far. This has been by far the most difficult, and certainly the longest-running. The most challenging and rewarding, for all the same reasons. CNN: There was a powerful response online to the deaths of Lizzie and Mika; did you follow that reaction at all? McBride: Yeah, I was really happy about the responses that came from that episode. Shooting that episode was remarkable and such a great experience. It all just came together in such a wonderful way. People talk about how ""it needs to be earned."" I felt what was necessary in this episode was absolutely earned. The emotional and critical response has been wonderful. The fans have just been phenomenal in their appreciation for that episode. What ultimately happened in that episode was controversial, but I feel like it was handled with such a sensitive approach. The build-up to it was just handled so well. CNN: Have you seen the memes that have cropped up about the scene? The line ""Look at the flowers"" has taken on a life of its own. McBride: People are pasting people's faces over Lizzie's in the flower bed! (Laughs) That's another thing I love about the fanbase: They have a great sense of humor. ... I'm a spoofy kind of person. I appreciate the humor, and it's a great way to offset the devastation that people on the show (are) going through -- it's sometimes very refreshing to see that stuff. CNN: There's a segment of fans who like the idea of Daryl and Carol together. They haven't had too many scenes together this season, but is that something you might be pulling for? McBride: I know that Carol and Daryl have a tremendous bond. Personally, I am living vicariously through the fans, I guess. I enjoy their passion. For some people, watching the show, it's a fun element for them. They're very passionate about their 'ships! CNN: How do you react to the show's massive popularity? McBride: I'm constantly amazed by the amount of different types of people that are aware of the show. After the episode with the girls, a gentleman who is 73 years old -- he said, ""I've never written a piece of fan mail ever, but I had to write how much I enjoyed that episode."" It touched me so much. When I think of how far-reaching this show is, and how big it is, it's like trying to fathom the beginning of time, and I have to stop. CNN: What's your favorite thing coming out of the show? McBride: It certainly has to be the relationships within the cast and crew, and getting to work with the people I do. It's so tremendously fulfilling, and personally getting to play this character has been a dream. CNN: What can fans expect from the season finale? McBride: There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said! Like every finale, (whispers) it's gonna be crazy!","""The Walking Dead's"" fourth-season finale airs Sunday night .

"(CNN) -- A day after raising the possibility of further nuclear tests, North Korea has engaged in provocative live-fire exercises near the South Korean maritime border, leading to an exchange of fire between the two neighbors. Semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Monday that the North had begun the drill just after noon (local time). The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) confirmed that some North Korean ordnance landed in South Korean waters, and that the South responded with fire. The JCS confirmed that the North Korean offshore military exercise began around 12:15 pm (local time) Monday, and said that ""a part of North Korea's shelling reached South Korean side of the NLL and we (South Korea) responded with K-9 self-propelled guns into the North Korean waters above NLL."" The statement is in line with Yonhap's report that the North fired ""several"" artillery shells, to which South Korean military responded with self-propelled artillery fire. The South Korean K-9 howitzers have a 24-mile (40-kilometer) range. It is not clear how many of the shells fired by North Korea reached the Republic's territorial waters. Less than two hours later, South Korean broadcaster YTN and Yonhap quoted the JCS as saying the North Korean shelling had ceased. Warning fax . The reclusive state took the unusual step of informing its neighbor of live-fire drills close to the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the heavily-militarized western sea, also known as the Yellow Sea. Pyongyang sent a fax early Monday demanding the Republic ""control"" its vessels in seven sea border areas of the Yellow Sea north of the NLL. According to Wee Yong Sub, South Korean Defense Ministry vice-spokesperson, the scheduled tests mark the first time -- in recent history, at least -- that the North has announced live-firing exercises above the NLL, which marks the established maritime border between the two Koreas. ""We consider such announcement as a hostile threat and so have activated crisis management operation in case of (military) provocation,"" he said. ""We stress that we are fully prepared for all situations."" He added that there are no immediate signs of nuclear tests being carried out by the North. Nuclear tests . North Korea said Sunday it ""would not rule out"" a new nuclear test as it defended its recent mid-range missile launch that triggered international condemnation. ""(We) would not rule out a new form of a nuclear test aimed at strengthening our nuclear deterrence,"" Pyongyang's foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run KCNA news agency. ""The U.S. had better ponder over this and stop acting rashly."" The statement did not specify what North Korea meant by a ""new form"" of test. Last week, the Stalinist state launched two medium-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast Wednesday, violating United Nations resolutions that prohibits Pyongyang from conducting such tests. The U.N. Security Council condemned the move and is considering an ""appropriate response,"" the council's president U.N. Ambassador Sylvie Lucas said. At a briefing Monday, Wee said: ""We are fully prepared for all provocation, including North Korea's additional launching of missiles or nuclear test under the close cooperation with the U.S."" The military exercises are the latest provocation by the North, and come after a maritime dispute last week was seemingly swiftly resolved. On Thursday, a North Korean fishing boat was seized following an alleged incursion into South Korean waters, and then returned with its three crew members to the following day.

"Davos (CNN) -- Day 1 - Wednesday: ""Now you remember the rules, don't you?"" cautions my colleague Richard Quest, a long time veteran of the prestigious World Economic Forum. ""What happens in Davos, stays in Davos."" ""And the Piano Bar,"" he continues, referring to the notorious late night haunt for the hardcore high-flyers. ""Well, let's just call that a sort of no-man's land."" And so, armed with my crash course in elite etiquette and clutching a coveted, access-all-areas, white badge, I make my way to the lavish surroundings of the Steigenberger Belvedere Hotel -- the epicenter of the Swiss town's corporate party scene during ""WEF week."" First stop, Steve Forbes' do, where the man himself is on ""meet and greet"" duty by the door with his children -- reinforcing the importance of family business. Inside: The very people who make his magazine's eponymous rich list a must-read. After a chance encounter with one of those Forbes list stalwarts, steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, at another Indian tycoon Niraj Bajaj's party downstairs, it's off a Jazz soiree, hosted by insurer Zurich, where Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Terence Blanchard strikes a balanced note as CEO Martin Senn works the room. Before calling it a night, I stop by Munich-based events firm DLD's do where I have a photograph with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in the corridor. On my way in I cross Nouriel Roubini -- aka Dr Doom -- who, judging by the smile on his face, seems remarkably unruffled by the bout of economic optimism at Davos this year. ""I'm so busy. So many meetings,"" he flaps before scuttling off to another nightcap and away from the comical Swiss mountain accordion band about to strike up in their folkloristic costumes. Day 2 - Thursday: Two days of sobering talk on inequality, Iran and Syria certainly haven't sapped the mood. If anything, with 40 heads of state and government now gathered in Davos, the captains of industry have even more swagger, hobnobbing with the creme de la creme of G-20 politicians. After picking the brains of Russia's deputy Prime Minister on Sochi's security during an ice hockey game he was participating in in the Davos arena, it's time to shed the snow boots and dress to impress. At drinks laid on by CNBC and the Financial Times, I spot former EU Trade Commissioner and one-time New Labour spin doctor, Peter Mandelson rubbing shoulders with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. The latter is smiling broadly, a day before the world learns of his $20 million salary for 2013. ""What's been your highlight of Davos this year?"" I ask another senior banker. My mouth falls open when he, in all seriousness, replies ""the new Intercontinental. At least we have a decent hotel to stay in with a proper shower."" ""And the sessions?"" I venture. ""Oh no we never go to any of those,"" he chuckles. Day 3 - Friday: Russia's Farewell party brings the usual clutch of glamorous girls and moneyed men. The band is brilliant even if, as a non-Russian speaker, I can't understand a word of what they are singing. The champagne flows fast, as if it's as plentiful as the nation's oil and gas, while the cloakroom fills up with some of the most ostentatious fur coats I have ever seen. Carl Bildt and his MEP wife cut dashing figures as they head towards the bar. I deduce the Swedish foreign secretary must be the most sociable politician present at Davos this year for I have run into him at no fewer than five evening events already. Next, it's off to McKinsey & Co's bash where Standard Chartered's Peter Sands is mingling among the crowd unaccompanied after his firm's sudden management reshuffle last week. Networking doyenne Carole Stone is in fine form and -- in the absence of any Google glasses- - is game enough to have her picture taken wearing pair of the joke neon ones handed out. Having recently collected a $1.3 million windfall from the sale of her business, Stone has shunned the usual extravagances afforded to most Davos millionaires and informs me she's moving back into the Covent Garden bolt hole where her business originally began. Financial Times columnist Gillian Tett and Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group gather for a group photo and everyone bids the bar goodbye. Day 4 - Saturday: Davos goes out with a bang as more than a thousand guests gather for a black tie dinner. En-route to the venue I'm lucky enough to share a shuttle with an upbeat Avie Glazer, the American chairman of Manchester United, who expresses concern about wage inflation in the market for Premiere League players today. John Kerry's fiery Davos speech seems to have been the talk of the town among four young American biotech entrepreneurs I dine with, each of which it turns out has floated their firm on the Nasdaq this year while markets enjoy all time records. Among other notable movers and shakers: The former head of the UK financial services authority Adair Turner and Columbia University's Spanish economics guru Xavier Sala-i-Martin. As I ready to leave, I remember no trip to this alpine enclave would be complete without catching CNN's own Emerging Markets editor John Defterios striking up a natty tune at the altogether more inclusive atmosphere of the Hotel Europa's ""Piano Bar."" I'm just in time, as it turns out, to catch the crowd singing along to Bryan Adams' ""Summer of 69.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A volcano eruption in Indonesia killed three people and forced tens of thousands more out of their homes, the disaster management agency said Friday. Two died from smoke inhalation while the third was hit by a collapsing wall. Officials had originally reported two deaths due to falling building debris. Mount Kelud in the eastern part of the main island Java has been spewing ash for at least two days high into the air, as a smoke plume has risen from out of its crater into the sky. The government raised its eruption alert to its highest level overnight, and authorities have ordered an evacuation of all residents in a 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) radius of the volcano in eastern Java. At the height of the crisis Friday, 100,000 people evacuated, but that number later dropped to more than 75,000. Seven airports closed due to volcanic ash, which filled the skies and can lead to jet engine problems. Lightning was seen striking the volcano's peak as it spewed debris, according to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. The nation's volcanology agency said other smaller eruptions could happen. Authorities urged people to stay outside the 10-kilometer radius. Pictures from the scene show large black plumes rising over Mount Kelud, raining pebbles and ash on the surrounding area. The military has been called in to help evacuate people from the area to nearby shelters. Mount Kelud last erupted in 2007, but it has recently ramped up activity in the past 10 days. In 1990, an eruption killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds. Indonesia is part of the vast ""Pacific Ring of Fire,"" an area of colliding continental plates where powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur.

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and dozens injured after unrest broke out overnight at an Australian detention center for asylum seekers on a remote island in Papua New Guinea, authorities said Tuesday. Detainees breached fences surrounding the facility on Manus Island, which lies several hundred kilometers northeast of mainland Papua New Guinea, the Australian government said. ""This was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the center and place themselves at great risk,"" said Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison. Order has now been restored at the facility on Manus, a sparsely populated jungle island, he said. Australia operates controversial offshore centers for processing asylum seekers on Manus and the tiny Pacific island of Nauru. Australian authorities say the far-flung detention centers are a way of deterring people from attempting the perilous sea journey to Australia, where immigration is a delicate political issue. But conditions at the facilities have been criticized by human rights advocates, who have reported cases of self-harm, hunger strikes and suicide attempts. Riots and protests have flared in the past among people held in the centers on Manus and Nauru, many of whom end up there after traveling from South Asia and the Middle East in efforts to reach Australia. Rioting asylum seekers on Nauru burned down their shelters at the processing facility last year. The unrest on Manus overnight followed ""low-level demonstrations"" at the center on the island, Morrison said. ""The vast majority of transferees in that facility did not participate in that protest last night, that disturbance,"" he said. ""They were removed for their safety to the oval just down the road, and nonessential staff who were running the center were also evacuated prior to things escalating last night."" Most of those hurt in the riots have been treated locally, but two severely injured people are being transferred to Australia, Morrison said. One of the two suffered a gunshot wound to the buttock, he said. A total of 77 people received medical treatment, and 13 of them had serious injuries, authorities said. The person who was killed suffered a head injury outside the center and died on the way to a hospital, he said. ""The news of a death is a great tragedy,"" Morrison said, expressing his sympathies to the deceased's family and friends.","""This was a very dangerous situation,"" an Australian official says .

"New York (CNN) -- A pregnant woman was killed Thursday after being struck by a privately owned tractor clearing snow in a parking lot, but her baby boy was delivered by cesarean section, authorities said. The nearly full-term boy -- weighing 6.6 pounds -- was in critical condition at Brooklyn's Maimonides Medical Center, where his 36-year-old mother was pronounced dead on arrival after being struck as she was loading groceries into her car. The victim was identified as Min Lin, a Brooklyn resident, police said. Lin arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes of the accident, and the baby was delivered in less than a minute, hospital spokeswoman Eileen Tynion said. Police said the Bobcat compact tractor equipped with a snowplow was backing up and struck the woman about 10:40 a.m. in a parking lot in the rear of Fei Long Market. Her husband was with her. The 42-year-old operator of the private snowplow was being questioned, police said. The incident occurred during New York City's sixth winter storm of the season. The latest storm was expected to dump up to 14 inches on some parts of the city. Fast-falling snow caused tractor-trailers to jacknife and prompted state authorities in New York to ban commercial traffic on Interstate 84, a major east-west highway.

"(CNN) -- The world's chocolate makers may specialize in delivering a sweet taste but the government of the Ivory Coast is seeking to address what it sees as the bitter treatment of the farmers who grow the industry's raw materials. The West African nation was the world's biggest cocoa producer -- which is the main ingredient in chocolate -- between 2009 and 2010, rearing some 1.19 million tons of the crop according to the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Thanks to a mixture of price volatility, internal instability within the Ivory Coast and a lack of protection from speculators however, an ever smaller portion of the billions of dollars of annual revenue the industry creates finds its way back to the country's farmers. While this set up may benefit cocoa buyers and chocolate companies, non profits such as the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) have claimed that it forces farmers to pay low wages and encourages exploitative practices such as child labor. Bittersweet times for Ivory Coast's cocoa industry . But according to Sangafowa Coulibaly, the Ivory Coast's agriculture minister, central government efforts are now being made to make the cocoa production process fairer and more profitable for farmers. ""The profits made from the sale of cocoa have unfortunately not been beneficial enough to the farmers because of poor governance,"" he says. Coulibaly highlights the fact that farmers receive around a 40% share in the price of the cocoa they grow. This, he claims, is not commensurate with the costs the process incurs and in the coming years he hopes to see this figure rise to 60%. He also blames the country's former president, Laurent Gbagbo -- who refused to concede defeat in elections in October 2010, leading to a six month long standoff before he was finally forced from power by military force -- for slowing reforms that will benefit the country's cocoa growers. Now that the political infighting is over and a new government in place however, Coulibaly says that changes will be made to ensure the long term viability of one of the country's most integral industries. ""Things can only get better,"" he says. ""The political crisis is behind us -- the armed conflict is behind us. Ivory Coast has become a country that aspires to be stable,"" he adds. With the Ivory Coast contributing to roughly 40% of global cocoa produce alone, such clear intentions of creating a durable and equitable production process should be good news for the world's chocolate companies, as well as the country's cocoa farmers. But while Coulibaly is adamant that the central government is genuine in its attempts to help farmers, his words are met with a wary skepticism by those at the sharp end of the debate. Toure Dramane is a farmer and owner of a cocoa co-op deep within the Ivory Coast's rural hinterland. He says that unless real changes are made to ensure farmers are paid a fair price for their produce they will be forced to employ children and pay low wages, which in turn will create a variety of long term social and humanitarian problems. The human cost of chocolate . ""It's not our choice; it's imposed on us,"" he says of the price he receives for his cocoa produce. ""We can't transform it. We produce it and we sell. We get the price that is imposed on us. We can't do it any other way."" Dramane says that promises of reform to make cocoa farming fairer and more profitable have been made many times before. He cites a pledge made by the world's leading chocolate companies to help end child labor almost a decade ago. ""[But] in ten years, nothing has been done at all"" to address this issue he says, ensuring he remains suspicious about the new government's proclamations no matter how good they sound. With previous broken promises in mind, Dramane adds that he will reserve judgment about whether conditions will be any different or fairer for farmers until he sees the price he receives for his next harvest.","The Ivory Coast is the world's biggest cocoa producer .

"(CNN) -- The likeness of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs may appear on a commemorative U.S. postage stamp in 2015, only four years after his death. Jobs' name appeared on a list of approved postage-stamp subjects obtained by The Washington Post. Other notable Americans expected to appear on forthcoming stamps include pop icon Michael Jackson, singer James Brown, rocker Jimi Hendrix, talk-show host Johnny Carson, hoops star Wilt Chamberlain, actor Charlton Heston and gay-rights leader Harvey Milk. The document from the U.S. Postal Service's Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee names ""approved subjects"" and says that design work on most of them has already begun. But a USPS spokesman told CNN that the list, dated January 7, is still subject to change. The new subjects are part of an effort by the cash-strapped postal agency to raise revenues by issuing more stamps of pop-culture figures, which are popular with collectors. In November, the USPS released 20 postage stamps honoring Harry Potter, the fictional boy wizard. ""The postal service is looking to bring more timely, relevant, contemporary subjects to stamps ... pop-culture subjects appealing to younger audiences,"" USPS spokesman Roy Betts said. ""It creates excitement."" Next year, the agency also is expected to reissue a stamp of singer Elvis Presley, which became its all-time top seller -- at 29 cents -- when it debuted in 1993. (A first-class stamp now costs 49 cents.) The Postal Service says it issues some stamps to ""honor men and women who have made extraordinary contributions to American society and culture."" It used to be that someone had to be dead for at least five years before they could appear on a stamp, but the USPS ended that rule in 2011 and announced that even living people could be featured. Jobs, who died in 2011, would be the first person from America's computer industry to be honored on a stamp. ""Steve Jobs made major contributions and is worthy of this recognition,"" Betts said. On social media, many Friday were noting the irony of the postal service honoring someone whose products helped marginalize snail mail. Other subjects approved for stamps in the coming years, according to the committee's list: actress Elizabeth Taylor, characters from TV's ""Sesame Street"" and the ""Peanuts"" comic strip, and slain Beatle John Lennon. U.S. stamps typically honor only Americans, but the USPS has begun making exceptions, such as its 2010 stamp celebrating humanitarian Mother Teresa. But Betts cautioned that the list of subjects, which was published Thursday by the Post and widely replicated online, is not final. The names on the list ""still may not appear on a postage stamp,"" he said. ""There are no guarantees."" The 12-member Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee considers about 50,000 ideas a year, mostly from the public. It recommends about 35 new subjects for commemorative stamps each year to the postmaster general, who makes the final decision.","Apple co-founder Steve Jobs may appear on a U.S. postage stamp in 2015 .

"(CNN) -- A Washington think tank celebrated Prince Harry on Monday night for his humanitarian efforts, with the British royal deflecting the praise by offering his own salute to wounded war veterans. Harry was among the guests of honor at the event marking the 50th anniversary of the Atlantic Council, which describes itself as a ""nonpartisan institution devoted to promoting transatlantic cooperation and international security."" The grandson of Queen Elizabeth II arrived around 6:15 p.m. at the Washington Ritz-Carlton in a black tux, with photographers yelling his name and a few girls shrieking as he walked inside. Less than two hours later, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell took the stage to formally present Prince Harry with the council's Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award, an honor most recently bestowed on U2 frontman and activist Bono. Third in line to the British throne, Harry is a captain and Apache helicopter pilot in Britain's Army Air Corps. Powell, himself a longtime soldier and one-time U.S. Joint Chiefs chairman, was quick to point that out. He also joked that thanks to the 27-year-old royal, ""We have a record number of young, single women attending (the Atlantic Council awards dinner) this year. More seriously, Powell cheered Harry -- like his brother, William -- for embracing ""the noble traditions of service to his country and to his fellow human beings."" He singled out their work with veterans through Help for Heroes, Walking with the Wounded and other such programs. ""The loving effort that Princess Diana made to teach her sons the importance of serving others has touched (their) hearts and souls,"" said Powell. ""They have acted together in support of veterans' charities ... and the impact of (that) work is already very, very significant."" Harry then took the stage, admitting it was a ""truly humbling and a little terrifying"" to follow Powell and that he did not ""feel that I have done nearly enough to deserve"" the award. Still, he said he'd accept it ""on behalf of my brother, William, our foundation (and) all those guys on both sides of the Atlantic who work so tirelessly to support our veterans."" He paid special tribute to troops who have been scarred in one way or another while serving their nations, stressing the importance of giving them supporting well after they leave the battlefield. ""They have paid a terrible price to keep us safe and free,"" Harry said. ""The very least we owe them is to make sure that they and their brave families have everything they need through their darkest days -- and, in time, regain the hope and confidence to flourish again. ""For these selfless people, it (is) after the guns have fallen silent (and) the din of battle quieted that the real fight begins -- a fight that may last for the rest of their lives."" Hours before the event, the prince met with injured soldiers at an event at the British Embassy in Washington. It is his first trip to the capital, although not to the United States. He went to the deserts of Arizona and California last year to take part in helicopter training. And it comes after William and his new wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, were met with huge and enthusiastic crowds during their visit last year to the United States and Canada. In addition to Harry, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon received the Atlantic Council's Distinguished International Leadership Award, which was presented by another former U.S. secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. Others honored by the organization, which runs programs focused on security, cooperation, economics, the environment and which centers on the Middle East, Africa and Asia, were Unilever CEO Paul Polman and violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter.","NEW: Colin Powell jokes Prince Harry's presence draws ""record number of young, single women""

"(CNN) -- When Mark Hansen and Jedd Rose decided to start selling their own line of hiking backpacks, Denver seemed the obvious choice for hub of operations. The Mile High City had an existing cut and sew industry with a history of making bags and outdoor gear. Plus, Topo Designs' retro-inspired, functional backpacks are inspired by the active lifestyle for which Denver and the rest of Colorado has earned a national reputation. ""Colorado -- especially Denver -- is a lifestyle choice, a destination for someone who wants to be outdoors and still have the comforts and perks of a city,"" said Rose, who grew up in Wyoming and now lives in Fort Collins, about an hour from Topo's Denver headquarters. Since 2008, Topo Designs has grown steadily, thanks to interest from across the United States and foreign markets like Japan and Germany. Last November, it opened its flagship store in Denver in a development made of reclaimed shipping containers. Topo has also expanded into menswear that bears a similar aesthetic to its bags: simple and functional button-up shirts, jackets and pants that could be worn to work, to dinner or even for a hike in the Rockies. While growing profit margins certainly helped them expand operations, Rose credits a hospitable small business climate with allowing them to open a store much sooner than planned. ""Denver has gone through some big changes in the past four to five years,"" Rose said. ""It's a good time to be here."" Denver isn't a menswear capital, but Topo and other brands based there are drawing attention from beyond Colorado for their style and quality. In the past five years a handful of makers and entrepreneurs have flocked to this city in the Rockies of about 600,000 people, lured by the active lifestyle and its ""small town in a big city"" vibe. Upon arrival, they say they've found a thriving ""Portland-esque"" makers scene, and a market for their goods among the city's growing ranks of young professionals. These kinds of businesses found a foothold in New York, San Francisco, even Portland years ago, but there's a certain Rocky Mountain vibe to those in Colorado, Rose said. ""Sure, you can buy backpacks and shirts elsewhere, but ours have a different spin because we're in Denver."" A place for 'work-life integration' The global nature of fashion and e-commerce allows startups to work from wherever they want. So, why is Denver the place where these entrepreneurs want to be? The active lifestyle was the biggest draw for Eric Powell, founder of Ratio Clothing, which makes custom-fitted shirts for men. ""I don't like the term 'work-life balance' because it separates the two too much; it's more like work-life integration,"" Powell said. ""People here know how to live."" Powell moved from Chicago to Denver in 2011, shortly before the public launch of Ratio, which was borne out of Powell's difficulty finding clothes that fit. Powell started building the business in 2010, combining his technology background as a software developer and his passion for clothing, while he was working full-time as a consultant. When it became clear that his design viewpoint and formula for getting a good fit was finding an audience, he left his job and moved his family to Denver. As a consultant, Powell visited a lot of American cities. But ""Denver was always the city that resonated with us,"" the 32-year-old entrepreneur says. It's big enough so it has a variety of cultural offerings and restaurants, but small enough to get across town without sitting in traffic, Powell said. And, compared to Powell's native Cincinnati, it's a young city full of transplants. It's also affordable compared to other metropolitan areas, which allowed Powell to build his start-up from his home. His business was gaining traction through the online menswear blog community when a customer from Italy in town for business showed up at his home seeking alterations. Powell, who had just returned from a run, greeted him in his exercise gear. ""At that point I realized I had to step up my game,"" he said. He opened his storefront in August 2013 in the Lower Highlands neighborhood, a retail and restaurant hub near downtown Denver. It helps Ratio reach a new audience outside the menswear blogs, he said. Tanya Fleisher and Roy Katz also moved to Denver from Chicago in February 2013. The couple had started their business Winter Session in Chicago, sewing cotton and canvas bags in their apartment. The Colorado natives always intended to return home, and when their business started to grow they decided it was time. After living in big cities for more then a decade -- Chicago, Los Angeles, Mumbai -- the couple wanted to live somewhere they could navigate on a bicycle instead of hopping on the freeway. They easily found an affordable workspace east of downtown on a small strip that used be known as the jazz district, which Roy Katz likens to Chicago's Fulton Market District. They also found a supportive small business community that collaborates on events and marketing rather than working against each other. Winter Session's headquarters' doubles as a storefront and a workspace where the couple and two full-time employees make all of Winter Session's bags and accessories, along with collaborations with other brands. They were even able to convince employee Laura Staugaitis to follow them to Denver. Staugaitis said she was more than happy to leave behind the rat race. She says the laid back maker environment in Denver gives small businesses room to grow. ""It's a very non-competitive environment,"" she said. ""It's a young scene here and we're all working toward the same critical mass, so people aren't as protective of what they're working on."" 'Denver fashion has a personality of its own' Many of these new businesses cater to the elusive stylish man who is willing to pay more for quality goods. His presence has been noted in the fashion capitals, where custom-shirtmakers and curated menswear shops have existed for years. Unlike your rich uncle's menswear store, which might carry bespoke suits from Italy or Brooks Brothers, these stores are more likely to stock waxed cotton jackets, chambray button-downs, shawl collar sweaters or jeans made of Japanese selvedge. Borne of renewed interest in classic American workwear brands -- sometimes called the ""heritage movement"" -- the curated shop is more revival than new phenomenon, said Jesse Thorn, creator of the popular menswear blog, ""Put This On."" ""Men now want to know where their clothes come from in a way they didn't before, and they want to know about the quality of their clothes in a way they didn't before,"" Thorn said. ""That was at the center of the 'heritage movement' before the marketers got hold of it, and it's a sea change in the marketplace. The effects of that change are going to stick around, even after people stop buying defunct workwear brands and opening boutiques that sell colorfully-painted axes."" The rise of casual menswear and national retail contributed to the decline of the men's store in the mid-20th century, but they're becoming hip once again, thanks to increasing interest in American-made products and quality brands from abroad. When 27-year-old Eli Cox opened Berkeley Supply Store on a credit card in November 2012, he stocked it exclusively with American-made brands that he liked: Red Wing boots, Taylor Stitch shirts, Filson coats and Rogue Territory jeans -- clothes with a workwear feel, but a little more refined. In New York and Portland, ""you can't swing a cat without hitting one of these shops,"" Cox said. In Denver, his biggest competition was J.Crew, he said. After closing out his first year in the black, he attributes his success to ""like-minded"" millennials flooding the city in recent years, creating a market for these goods. Other Denver-based outlets are tapping into the Rocky Mountain lifestyle for inspiration. When their shop Armitage & McMillan opens in March, owners Darin Combs and Daniel Armitage plan to stock it with brands they learned about through their work in New York fashion industry, like Steven Alan, UNIS and Fair Ends. But Armitage & McMillan will also include outdoor gear from brands like Saturdays Surf NYC, Mt. Rainier and Epperson Mountaineering. ""Denver fashion has a personality of its own. It's not the Midwest and it's not the West Coast,"" said Armitage. The Denver man is looking for clothes to suit his lifestyle. The childhood friends from Oklahoma lived and worked in Denver before relocating to New York in 2007 to work in fashion. As they watched interest grow in small menswear labels, the more they thought there could be a market for them in Denver. Armitage hopes to reach fashion-conscious men who want to support the brands they read about on menswear blogs, or young professionals who work in places where suit and tie aren't required. ""They don't want to go to mall stores that have a menswear section,"" he said. ""These guys want to go into a menswear shop that feels like a menswear shop and talk to guys about clothing and the history of brands.""","Somehow, Denver has become a hotbed of in-demand men's fashion .
The Denver lifestyle is a big draw for entrepreneurs and consumers .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has urged U.S. President Barack Obama to call off a meeting at the White House with Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama that's scheduled to take place Friday. ""By arranging a meeting between the President and the Dalai Lama, the U.S. side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of China, seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair China-U.S. relations,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement Friday. The White House on Thursday announced the planned meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile. Obama has met with the Dalai Lama twice before, in February 2010 and July 2011. China responded to those meetings with similarly angry comments. Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of being a separatist who foments unrest in Tibet, a region it claims has been part of China since ""ancient times."" The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence. He says he wants only enough autonomy to protect its traditional Buddhist culture. The Obama administration says it supports the Dalai Lama's ""Middle Way"" approach to the political tensions over protests for Tibetan independence. ""The United States recognizes Tibet to be a part of the People's Republic of China and we do not support Tibetan independence,"" said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. ""The United States strongly supports human rights and religious freedom in China."" Concerns over human rights . Over the past five years, at least 125 Tibetans have set themselves on fire, most of them fatally, to protest Chinese rule, according to Tibetan advocacy groups. Beijing has taken a tough line on Tibetan self-immolators, their associates and other forms of protest. Tibetans have been convicted of murder in Chinese courts for ""inciting"" people to set themselves on fire. The frequency of self-immolations declined during 2013, according to the London-based advocacy group Free Tibet. ""We are concerned about continuing tensions and the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China,"" Hayden said. ""We will continue to urge the Chinese government to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, as a means to reduce tensions."" China rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. Beijing has ""lodged solemn representations"" with the United States over the planned meeting Friday, saying ""Tibet-related affairs fall entirely within the internal affairs of China which allow no foreign interference,"" Hua of the Chinese foreign ministry said. A meeting between British Prime Minister David Cameron and the Dalai Lama last year cast a chill over relations between London and Beijing, delaying a visit to China by Cameron. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","The White House announces the meeting will take place Friday in Washington .

"(CNN) -- Every few days since the start of the school year, Scott Bedley has posted a message on Twitter, looking for classes around the country that might want to meet his. His California fifth-graders are hoping to video chat with students from all 50 states and other parts of the world. It's part of the geography game, Mystery Skype: Students gather before a computer and try to deduce each other's locations by asking questions and consulting maps. By early January, Bedley had found several teachers in other states. Then, he received a message from a film director, asking to shoot his class during a Mystery Skype session. Bedley was a little wary -- who sends a request like that to a public school teacher? -- but after a flurry of OKs from parents and Irvine Unified School District leaders, a camera crew arrived. They shot students on both sides of the screen: His students at Plaza Vista Elementary School, and a class from Mexico City. Bedley was delighted; it was his class' first foray into international Mystery Skype, and the video might train and inspire other teachers. Maybe, he thought, it would show up on YouTube some time. About two weeks later, he received a text message that said there were, in fact, plans for the footage. It would be in a commercial -- one that would air during the Super Bowl. The revelation was so short-notice, Bedley was calling parents the morning of the big game to suggest they watch. Until he saw it, he wasn't even sure it could be real. But when Microsoft's one-minute ""Empowering"" ad debuted, there was former NFLer Steve Gleason narrating over footage of a boy romping on prosthetic legs, a woman hearing her children for the first time, a military member witnessing his baby's birth over a computer -- and Bedley's students, waving hello. Weeks after the commercial aired, Bedley still seems dumbfounded. ""You just don't think they're going to come film you for a Super Bowl commercial,"" Bedley laughs. But those couple of seconds, seen by a record-breaking Super Bowl audience and more than 3.5 million so far on YouTube, are just a sliver of what it's like to be Bedley's students. Here's a peek at the real classroom behind the commercial and the teacher at its helm: . He's willing to take risks . Bedley has been teaching for 20 years, 10 of them to fifth-graders, and was named one of the teachers of the year for 2014 in Orange County, California. He says he's a risk-taker inspired by his father, a long-time educator, and his brother, a teacher of the year for nearby Riverside County in 2013. ""I've always been kind of an explorer, somebody that tries some different things,"" Bedley said. He's been lucky to have supportive administrators, he said, but he's also got results to back him up. As he's taken more creative approaches in the classroom, test scores have risen -- and his students like it, too. Take Mystery Skype: It wasn't his idea, but as soon as he read about it, he knew it could hit several state standards his students needed to learn. There could be glitches and pitfalls, but if they're going to learn geography, why not try it this way? ""Just drilling them, that's not always the best in my mind, as far as teaching pedagogy,"" Bedley said. ""I wanted to expose and connect them with kids all over the United States."" Each time they run the exercise, students are assigned particular jobs: Among them, a ""think tank"" tracks maps, fact-checkers confirm what's said, note-takers and runners make sure everyone has the information they need, and ""on-camera talent"" asks and answers questions. A student supervisor watches the whole process and looks for ways they can improve next time. A reporter-blogger documents the process. ""Organized chaos,"" Bedley calls it. He rarely appears on camera. The whole thing takes about 20 minutes and touches on critical thinking and problem-solving his students need, not to mention geography know-how. Students' questions have gotten better as they've practiced more, and they've actually added new rules to make it tougher: No more Googling and guessing based on a city name they spotted in the other classroom. So far, it's working. ""They'll go home and research on their own, without assigning homework or anything,"" Bedley said. His students just finished their 17th state, Minnesota. As a reward for all their hard work, they've recently earned a class pet. (A huge, sometimes smelly, risk, any educator will agree.) It's a tan hamster. Bedley's students named him Hashtag. Don't call him a 'techie' Bedley can understand why teachers and schools are wary of the latest-and-greatest technology: They've heard it all before. ""The technology that was being provided for schools to use to help kids learn was disastrous. We were limited to word processing or 'Oregon Trail,' "" he said of his early years in education. ""The tools available for teachers now are what I wish I would have had my first year teaching."" Now, he's got BYOD (bring your own device) classrooms where students can use cell phones, iPods, tablets or laptops from home, as long as they've passed a course on how to use them appropriately. They have access to a few school computers, and Bedley has raised money or landed grants for big-ticket items, such as iPads, netbooks, a webcam and a desktop computer for the classroom. ""I know (my district) would want to provide the funds, they just don't have them,"" he said. Like a lot of teachers, he relies on free tools, too. He first tried using Skype in 2009, when budget reductions cut back on arts education for his students. He connected his classroom with working artists in other parts of the country, so they could still had a chance to learn. Last year, his students Skyped with docents from Fort Meigs, a War of 1812 battlefield in Ohio. When they revealed the armory, ""the kids just gasped,"" he said. ""Those kinds of moments just drive me to find more learning opportunities."" He's one of nearly 78,000 teachers using Skype in the classroom, the company reports. Sometimes, yes, there are glitches, technical failures and lessons that don't go as planned. Often, he can just hop on Twitter to ask for help, and another teacher will offer up lessons from their own experiences. ""I take little steps to integrate technology,"" Bedley said. ""I don't consider myself a techie at all."" He sees opportunities now . Exploring, risk-taking -- it's actually easier than it used to be, Bedley said. As his school shifts from its former curriculum to the Common Core standards, there's a lot of room for creativity and experimentation in teaching, he said. He teaches science, writing and history, and he'll make sure the material is covered, but he likes to give students options to show what they've learned. When they studied the body's organ systems, students could take a traditional test, or create an infographic using Piktochart software, or record a lesson for another student. They had to share everything they knew about, say, the nervous system. Some students spoke for 10 minutes, and sometimes recalled facts Bedley said even he couldn't remember. ""A lot of it aligns with how they best learn -- they learned way above and beyond,"" Bedley said. ""They felt like they were experts."" He works outside his classtime, too. With his brother, he hosts an online talk show dedicated to education innovation, the Bedley Bros. #EdChat Show. A couple of years ago, he created the Technology Applied Science Fair, a souped-up science fair that asks kids to identify problems and solve them. Since it launched, it has expanded from his school to 10. One student designed a social network for charities in India to share extra resources. Another couple of students, ""great kids who always forget their glasses,"" created a program that would automatically adjust computer screens so they could read, no matter what. ""It's all on my own. If you look at the innovations going on, it's teacher-driven activities,"" Bedley said. ""I love that there are some incredible educators out there, teachers and principals taking the lead rather than letting people outside of education define what we do. ""I really, honestly believe we're in a time that's going to redefine education."" Are you feeling optimistic about the education your children are receiving?

"(CNN) -- Tony Stewart's profession is driving for millions of dollars a year in NASCAR races, but his hobby is racing against amateurs on dirt tracks for trophies. Stewart, 43, started in go-carts when he was just 5 in Columbus, Indiana, 50 miles south of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He rose through the ranks, winning the Indy Racing League championship in 1997 before moving to NASCAR two years later. He's won three championships in NASCAR's top series -- the Sprint Cup -- and he's a co-owner of his racing team. Other drivers started calling him ""Smoke"" because that's what they saw coming from his tires as he steered aggressively through turns on asphalt tracks. While burning rubber wore down tire tread needed late in a race, it added to his reputation as one of the most competitive drivers, both behind the wheel and off the track. Sponsors pay big bucks to display their logos on Stewart's No. 14 car because they know millions will watch it speed around the big track hundreds of times in a single event, as many as three dozen weekends a year. His bad-boy antics, the fights and the words, make him stand out among dozens of other personalities in the sport. Even the fans who boo him are watching. He shows up unshaven on race days in contrast to more polished drivers who are more careful with words and actions to avoid alienating sponsors and fans. Winning, either on NASCAR's asphalt or unsanctioned dirt, is Stewart's goal. As he sacrifices valuable tire tread for track cred, he also puts great passion into his non-paying hobby, carried out at the risk of his big-money professional driving. Why one NASCAR champion loves dirt tracks . ""Being on a dirt track a lot of times is like being on a gravel road,"" Stewart said in a 2006 interview. ""If you go just a little bit too fast the car's going to slide. If you hit the gas too hard, it spins the tires or kicks the rocks up. If you try to stop too fast, you skid, you lock up the brakes. That's what makes driving on dirt more technical."" When he won a dirt track race in Michigan last month, he tweeted to fans as if he'd won the Daytona 500: ""If you haven't heard already, I ran my sprint car tonight and won! Felt great to run it again. Was a 2nd place car but had a little luck :)"" That ""little luck"" was the driver of the lead car crashing. Stewart was leading a 30-lap dirt track race at Southern Iowa Speedway a year ago when his car flipped, breaking two bones in his right leg. It ended his NASCAR Sprint Cup 2013 season 15 races early, costing him and his sponsors a lot of money. The August 11, 2013, race at Watkins Glen, New York, was the first start Stewart missed in 521 NASCAR races since his 1999 debut at the Daytona 500. Ironically, he missed Watkins Glen again this year because of a dirt track tragedy on Saturday. Tony Stewart hits, kills driver at dirt-race track . Stewart hit and killed another driver, Kevin Ward Jr., during a sprint car race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in Ontario County, New York. Video shows that Ward and Stewart appeared to make contact coming out of a turn and Ward hit the wall and was knocked out of the race. Ward, 20, then got out of his car and walked down the track toward the other racers, who had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward pointed a finger and appeared to be yelling. One car swerved to avoid him, but Stewart's right-rear tire appears to hit him as he passes. ""There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,"" Stewart said in a written statement. Why Tony Stewart isn't likely to face charges . Veteran race fans remember a rookie driver who jumped out of his car during a NASCAR race in 1999 after another driver spun his car into him in Martinsville, Virginia. That driver was Tony Stewart. Stewart had traded bumps throughout the race with Kenny Irwin, who had been his dirt-track rival before they both moved up to NASCAR. But the last crash against the wall disabled Stewart's car. Stewart waited on the track for Irwin to circle around under a caution flag. Stewart threw his gloves at Irwin's car, and jumped onto its right side while the car was still moving. Stewart's run-ins with other drivers are legend, including after his car crashed with Matt Kenseth at Tennessee's Bristol Motor Speedway in 2012. Stewart waited in a driving lane on pit road for Kenseth's car to return to the track. Stewart threw his helmet at Kenseth as the car sped by. He told reporters later that he doesn't ""enjoy getting mad like that."" Stewart rushed after driver Joey Logano on pit row after a Fontana, California, race last year. He was angry that the younger Logano had blocked him from passing during a restart. Logano said he was just ""racing hard"" because he thought he could win. Stewart has also had his angry moments with fans and the media. He was investigated, though never prosecuted, for an alleged assault against a female fan at Bristol Motor Speedway in 2002, the year he won his first of three NASCAR championships. NASCAR officials fined Stewart $10,000 and ordered him to get anger management counseling for hitting a photographer after a bad race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2002. Stewart has removed himself from racing for the present in the aftermath of Ward's death. He will not compete in a dirt track race in Plymouth, Indiana, next Saturday as he had planned, the track announced Monday. He has not yet decided if he will race in the next NASCAR Sprint Cup event at Michigan International Speedway next Sunday, his spokesman, Mike Arning said Monday. ""He is grieving, and grief doesn't have a timetable."" August was to have been a celebration for Stewart, the first anniversary of the dirt track wreck that changed his life. He tweeted this message to fans a week ago: ""1yr ago today my life changed. Thank you to everyone that worked so hard to get me back to where I'm at today. It's your life, live it!""","Drivers call Stewart ""Smoke"" because that's what they see from his tires as takes turns .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ukraine announced Monday that it will get rid of all its highly enriched uranium, which can be used in nuclear weapons, within the next two years. The announcement by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich followed his meeting with President Obama before the start of a 47-nation summit on nuclear security. In an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday, Yanukovich said that most of his nation's highly enriched uranium would be gone by the end of 2010. ""The Ukraine has quite a number of power plants and various universities and research institutes where we are trying to understand to best utilize nuclear in a peaceful means,"" Yanukovich told CNN foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty. ""We are working on it. However, we are already taking the necessary step to remove highly enriched uranium from the country. By the end of this year, Ukraine is going to have the larger part of this uranium taken out of the country."" A White House statement said Obama ""praised Ukraine's decision as a historic step and a reaffirmation of Ukraine's leadership in nuclear security and nonproliferation."" ""Ukraine joins the United States in the international effort to convert civil nuclear research facilities to operate with low enriched uranium fuel, which is becoming the global standard in the 21st century,"" the statement said. Yanukovich indicated that the final destination of the highly enriched uranium could be Russia. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the destination had yet to be determined, but he said Russia was likely to be one of the countries to receive such nuclear materials. The White House statement said the United States will provide financial and technical assistance to Ukraine to get rid of its highly enriched uranium. According to Gibbs, the uranium that Ukraine will give up is enough to construct several nuclear weapons. He said Ukraine would convert its nuclear energy facilities to operate on low-enriched fuel. Gibbs said similar announcements by other nations could come during the summit, which comprises 47 nations discussing how to secure nuclear weapons and materials old and new to prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists and rogue states. The United States was prepared to help other nations take similar steps to Ukraine's, Gibbs said. ""The goal is to do all that we can,"" Gibbs said, adding: ""Our assistance and the assistance of our partners and our allies will be important, not just this week but in the coming years."" A White House fact sheet on Monday's announcement called Ukraine ""an international leader on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and a valued partner in implementation of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) since its historic 1994 decision (along with Kazakhstan and Belarus) to remove all nuclear weapons from its territory and to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."" From 1994 to 1996, the document said, Ukraine eliminated all of the intercontinental ballistic missile silos and 5,000 nuclear munitions, including 2,000 strategic-range munitions, long-range cruise missiles and strategic bombers, that remained on its territory following the breakup of the Soviet Union.","Ukrainian president tells CNN most of enriched uranium will be gone by end of year .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of mourners remembered fallen Windermere, Florida, police officer Robert German on Thursday in a moving tribute that elicited both laughter and tears. German, 31, was fatally shot on duty Saturday by two teens who had run away from home, police said. It appears the teenagers later turned the gun on themselves. German's death has profoundly affected the small town, where he was employed as a police officer for five years. Just west of Orlando, Windermere is known for its luxurious homes and close-knit residents. German was one of only 12 full-time officers in the town with about 2,500 people. He left behind parents Tim and Deborah German as well as twin sisters. ""Debbie and I have been complimented routinely this week by many on what a great job we as parents did in raising Robbie: Someone so loyal, fun, helpful, prankish, caring of others -- a hero,"" Tim German said, his voice quavering during the memorial Thursday in Longwood, Florida. ""Son, we love you so much, and we'll miss you dearly beyond earthly measure ... but your legacy of caring, in your Robbie way, will live on through all of us who remember you, knew you, loved you."" Tim spoke with affection about his son's fun-loving, endearing personality that dovetailed with his drive to become a law enforcement officer. For Robert German, that meant working during the day and going to night school. ""He didn't give up. He had a dream, finally got a job at Windermere. He was thrilled and very excited. From that point, we saw him grow again, and he became increasingly service-oriented and caring of others,"" the father said. At the time of his shooting, German had just returned to the force after being on ""light-duty status"" following surgery for an injury he suffered six months earlier. He had responded to a scene involving an autistic person, Windermere police Chief Dave Ogden said, standing before German's flag-draped casket. Recognizing the situation, German ""de-escalated the situation, he went hands-on, and he ended up receiving the injury."" Following the matter, German simply asked after the other individual involved. ""'Chief, I'm OK, but I really hope that boy's OK. I know he didn't mean it,'"" Ogden recalled German telling him. ""But that's Robbie. Without care or concern for himself, he knew the situation."" Investigators are still trying to piece together the events leading up to German's death. Two days before the shooting, Brandon Goode, 18, and Alexandria ""Alex"" Hollinghurst, 17, both of Davenport, Florida, reportedly ran away from home, leaving only letters behind for their families to find. ""To my loving parents, I am sorry for all the pain and misery I have brought you both, not just now but from these past few years as well,"" begins Goode's note, handwritten in neat, even letters. ""I don't want to go through life knowing because of my mistakes that I amounted to nothing and was there fore a disappointment. Don't take that as me putting the blame on you because that is the furthest thing from the truth. Both of you have been so amazing with your constant help and support through my life."" Goode was arrested in February on charges of possession of alcohol while underage and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He had also been arrested in 2012 in an alleged aggravated assault on his mother, according to incident reports from the Polk County Sheriff's Office. ""I love you with all my heart,"" the letter continues. ""Please don't be sad, this is what I want now, I get to die peacefully with the woman I love, the woman of my dreams, my fiancÃ© (yes we were engaged!). I miss you both so much already."" Hollinghurst penned two loving missives addressed to her sister and father, but to her mother, she directed a bitter letter that suggests the two had a turbulent relationship. Once the letters were found, the couple's parents called police to alert them to the teens' disappearances. Using cell phone tracking technology, Kissimmee police officers found the two parked in Goode's car. When the officer asked Goode to step out of the automobile, he ""cranked the vehicle, put the vehicle in drive and sped away,"" according to a Polk County Sheriff's Office incident report. Later, Kissimmee police filed a warrant to charge Goode with resisting a law enforcement officer without violence and reckless driving. Early Saturday, German encountered the duo walking along a street and called for assistance. When deputies responded to the scene, they found German ""lying on the roadway, mortally wounded,"" the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. The deputies performed what is called a tactical rescue, using a patrol car to shield their fallen comrade. That's when they heard two gunshots. Upon searching nearby woods, Orange County sheriff's deputies found Goode and Hollinghurst dead, lying in some brush, from what are believed to be self-inflicted wounds. It's perhaps the lack of any available explanations after Goode's death that will haunt his parents the most. ""We cannot comprehend the senseless loss of Officer German's life, the death of Alexandria Hollinghurst and for our family, the loss of our 18-year-old son, Brandon,"" Ricke and Connie Goode said in a statement issued Wednesday to CNN affiliates WESH-TV and Central Florida News 13. ""Words do not exist to express the measure of our sorrow and sadness. Our deepest sympathy and our heartfelt prayers go out to the friends and family of Officer German. We are so, so sorry to them for what happened and they will be forever in our prayers. We know a community grieves and like everyone else in our community, we ourselves are struggling to understand this most horrific tragedy. We have no answers, only questions.""","Robert German, 31, was one of 12 officers in Windermere, Florida, a town of 2,500 .

"Editor's note: Spoiler alert! If you haven't watched ""Psych's"" series finale, stop reading now. (EW.com) -- After ""Psych's"" series finale on Wednesday, star James Roday spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the ""big get"" and that pitch-perfect ending. The hour revolved around Shawn (Roday) trying to find a way to break the news to best friend Gus (Dulé Hill) that he was leaving him and Santa Barbara to go to San Francisco to be with Juliet (Maggie Lawson). In the end, he did it by recording a message on DVD. If you teared up when it first became clear that Gus was watching a disc, you're not alone. Another great moment was Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) watching his goodbye DVD and deciding not to listen to Shawn admit what Lassie's always suspected (that Shawn's not actually psychic). You may even have gotten a little misty when Shawn hugged his father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), and finally called him for help on a case -- also acceptable. Before we get to the ending, let's talk about those three casting Easter Eggs: Deon Richmond played Gus' boss. ""There's been a runner throughout 'Psych' that maybe Gus played Bud on 'The Cosby Show' as a child, and Deon Richmond is the real Bud,"" Roday explains. 'Psych': James Roday's prized pop culture possession cannot be beat . Billy Zane has been referenced on ""Psych"" more times than Roday can count. ""We've been chasing him for a while, so to have him as the final villain ever on 'Psych' felt really, really right."" And then the ""ultimate gift to our fans,"" he says, was finally seeing Det. Dobson on-screen -- and having him be played by Val Kilmer, another actor who's been regularly referenced on the show. ""We knew the longer the show lasted, the bigger the payoff it would be to finally be able to show who this person was. Val was our first choice, and as you learn in television, sometimes you don't even get your 10th choice,"" Roday says. ""I am eternally grateful to Val for doing this, and I think he will soon discover just how much of an impact it's going to have. But it was awesome. And trivia, it was actually the last thing that we ever shot on 'Psych,' because we did it in Los Angeles not in Vancouver."" The landing of Kilmer is a story in itself. Hill was hanging out with a friend who runs the LA Shakespeare Festival. ""They do these giant celebrity-laden readings every year, and he said, 'You know, Val's done those for us in the past. Val's actually a really good friend of mine. I wonder if he has any idea how many times you guys talk about him on your show.' They were like having brunch, and he said, 'Let's just call him and ask him.' And the next thing Dulé knew, he was on the phone with Val, who of course had never seen our show and had no idea what anybody was talking about. But Dulé, being the proactive guy that he is, just put him right on the spot right there on the phone. What's Val gonna say? 'Yeah, of course, it sounds fun.' But then we actually had to put in the legwork,"" Roday says. 'Psych': Dulé Hill sings for our pop culture personality test . In the end, Gus quit his job and followed Shawn to San Francisco to live a life of adventure. He made it just in time to witness Shawn's proposal to Juliet -- of course she agreed to marry them, mostly Shawn -- and jump in the car to chase after a thief who stole the heirloom engagement ring. ""The proposal scene was sort of hanging over our heads forever. There were so many different versions of how Shawn would propose, or IF Shawn should propose. We didn't want anybody to hate us, but we also needed it to be 'Psych' through and through. We didn't want to cop out and have a proposal just because that's what you're supposed to do. So I feel like we figured out a way to do it that's just a little off and,"" he says, laughing, ""still results in the wackiness that you had come to expect from us. We knew we were never gonna have a wedding. That decision was made a while ago, like we're not gonna go there. But I do think it was important to let everybody know that hey, these two are going to be together, you don't have to worry about that."" These three, James.

"(CNN) -- Most of the big tech companies implicated in the ongoing controversy over secret government Web surveillance insist they turned over data about users to the National Security Agency only after being compelled by court orders. But a new report claims that Microsoft willingly collaborated with the NSA and even allowed federal agents to circumvent the company's own encryption system to spy on users' messages. The latest bombshell from the UK's Guardian newspaper, which along with the Washington Post broke the NSA snooping story last month, says that Microsoft helped the NSA circumvent its encryption to intercept Web chats on its new Outlook.com portal. The Guardian, citing ""top-secret"" documents, said the NSA already had access to pre-encrypted e-mail on Microsoft's Outlook, including Hotmail. The NSA allegedly listened in on numerous video calls made via Skype, which Microsoft bought two years ago. And Microsoft also worked with the FBI this year to give the NSA easier access to its cloud storage service SkyDrive, which has more than 250 million users worldwide, according to the Guardian's report, published Thursday. In a statement, Microsoft immediately denied many of the Guardian's claims, saying the company turns over data on customers only in response to legal requests. ""First, we take our commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously, so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes. Second, our compliance team examines all demands very closely, and we reject them if we believe they aren't valid. ""Third, we only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks, as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate,"" the company said. ""To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product."" News reports, based in part on documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, have described a classified U.S. intelligence system called Prism that examines e-mails, videos, online chats and other data that it collects via requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The revelations about Prism have alarmed everyone from members of Congress and foreign leaders to privacy activists and citizens who organized anti-NSA protests across the United States on the Fourth of July. Like Apple, Facebook, Google, Yahoo and other tech titans linked by news reports to the Prism program, Microsoft has been working in recent weeks to convince customers that it values their privacy and safeguards their personal data against wanton snooping by a government trying to root out terrorists. In lobbying for greater transparency on national security-related requests, Microsoft revealed last month that it had received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national security warrants, subpoenas and other orders in the last six months of 2012. These requests affected between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts -- a tiny fraction of the company's hundreds of millions of users -- and came from local, state and federal agencies, Microsoft said. ""When we upgrade or update products legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request,"" Microsoft said in its statement Thursday. ""There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely. That's why we've argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues.""","A new report from the Guardian newspaper claims Microsoft willingly collaborated with the NSA .

"(CNN) -- When Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu stated that the Russian troops along Ukraine's borders were only conducting ""training exercises"" and have no ""intention to cross Ukraine's borders or to engage in any aggressive actions,"" Ukrainians rolled their eyes. And when President Vladimir Putin told Ukrainians ""Don't believe those who terrify you with Russia, who shout that other regions will follow Crimea. We do not want Ukraine's division. ... We want Ukraine to be a strong, sovereign, and self-sufficient state,"" Ukrainians shrugged. The problem is, even if Putin and Shoigu were being sincere, Moscow has lost all credibility among most Ukrainians and the international community. After three weeks of aggressive Russian behavior and the possibility of existential annihilation, Ukrainians, like Israelis, prefer to think in terms of worst-case scenarios. After all, they blithely assumed Russia would never attack -- and then Russia seized Crimea. They never imagined that Russian officials would treat their country as an object of abject scorn. They never suspected that thousands of Russians would chant anti-Ukrainian war slogans in the streets of Moscow. In each instance, Ukrainians' working assumption of a friendly Russia proved dead wrong. They also never imagined that the Yanukovych regime had so thoroughly permitted Ukraine's defensive capacity to deteriorate, by sacrificing Ukrainian security on the altar of the Yanukovych family's untrammeled accumulation of power and embezzlement of state funds. A political scientist at Kiev's elite Mohyla University has stated that he is not ""not optimistic about Ukraine maintaining the integrity of even its mainland territorial borders"" until the end of March and has evacuated his family from the capital. A friend in Lviv tells me that ""an invasion and war are unavoidable."" An American businessman in Kiev writes: ""I believe we are closer to World War III than we have ever been."" In many parts of the country, Ukrainians have taken to preparing little suitcases with all the necessities -- just in case they have to flee at a moment's notice. Ukrainians' jitters are perfectly understandable. Ukrainian officials say that 80,000 Russian troops and heavy armor are amassed on Ukraine's borders. Putin claims to have the right to intervene anywhere in Ukraine if and when he deems that Russian citizens are being threatened. He and myriad Russian policymakers routinely insist that Ukrainians are really Russians and that Ukraine is an artificial entity. Thus far, Moscow refuses to recognize the democratic government in Kiev and claims that it is no longer bound by the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Because of Russia's occupation of Crimea and Putin's militarist rhetoric, many Ukrainians are certain that war is inevitable. Prime Minister Arsenii Yatseniuk warned Moscow on March 20 that Ukraine's response to a Russian invasion would be vigorous. Kiev has already begun improving its defensive capabilities. On March 17, the Ukrainian Parliament allocated 6.9 billion hryvnia -- about $684 million -- to defense. In the last few weeks, Ukrainian armed forces, tanks and other defensive weapons have been deployed along the country's border with Russia. The number of border guards along Ukraine's southeastern borders has also increased. Kherson province is planning to build a 20-kilometer long ditch along its border with Crimea. A National Guard has been formed, and its ranks are to consist of 20,000 troops. The Ukrainian Security Service appears also to have become more active in Ukraine's vulnerable southeastern provinces. No less important, the population is determined to resist and sales of guns have far outstripped supply. Thinking in more long-term categories, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Volodymyr Ohryzko has even suggested that Ukraine exit the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and initiate the ""process of uranium enrichment."" American provision of non-lethal military equipment and advisers would also go a long way to improving Ukraine's deterrent capacity. Kiev's defensive efforts may or may not be enough to stop a possible Russian attack, but they would certainly make it far more difficult, risky, and bloody -- which may be enough to deter Moscow. Alternatively, these efforts may just induce Russia to seek less frontal modes of undermining Ukraine. After all, any potential Russian assault on mainland Ukraine would rest on three pillars: an invasion by the army, the agitation by pro-Putin ""fifth columns"" within Ukraine, and the diversionary activities of Russian secret agents and special forces tasked with sowing panic, sabotaging transportation and communications, and attacking military bases and arms depots. Although Ukraine appears to have the capacity to neutralize internal threats, a concerted long-term Russian effort at stoking instability could lay the groundwork for a later invasion or, at the very least, divert Kiev's attention from the pressing cause of economic and political reform. While Ukraine's security may or may not be enhanced by most of these measures, the irony is that Russia's definitely will not be -- at least in the medium to long term. Putin's seizure of Crimea may have provided him with the opportunity to beat his chest before adoring Russian crowds, but it will eventually undermine Russian security. Ukraine is and will remain too weak to be a threat. And on its own, no country in Russia's ""near abroad"" can pose a threat. Even taken together, the non-Russians will be weaker than Russia. But Putin's land grab will make all of them inclined to regard Russia as a potentially land-grabbing foe and to promote their own security independently of Russia and outside of any Russian-led blocs or unions. Expect the Central Asians and Azerbaijanis to turn increasingly to China and Turkey, and the Georgians, Moldovans, Ukrainians, and even the Belarusians to head for the West. Also expect the Russian Federation's non-Russian autonomous republics and regions to press for greater autonomy from Moscow. If Putin could just put aside his hypernationalist neo-imperialism and think straight about what's good for Russia, he'd try to nip the problem in the bud. A sober Russia would then withdraw all the forces that are engaged in ""exercises"" along Ukraine's borders and agree to a significant force reduction in Crimea. A sober Russia would also explicitly state that it recognizes the Budapest Memorandum and the current Ukrainian government. That last point is essential. As long as the Kremlin insists that the Kiev government is illegitimate, it will always be able to claim that its behavior toward Ukraine's Russian minority is also illegitimate and, hence, liable to correction by means of Russian intervention. Seen in this light, annexing Crimea has to be one of Putin's worst strategic blunders. Had the province become ""independent,"" there would still have been a theoretical possibility of finding some accommodation with Kiev. After annexation, any dialogue with the Ukrainian government -- and, thus, any resolution of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict -- becomes significantly more difficult. It's perfectly possible that Putin wants the conflict to remain unresolved, on the assumption that it will undermine Ukraine. The problem is that an unresolved conflict will also undermine Russia. As Ukraine and Russia's other non-Russian neighbors are compelled by Moscow's aggression to enhance their security, Russia may soon face a nightmare of its own creation -- non-Russian encirclement. When Russians wake up to the reality after the euphoria of Crimea's annexation wears off, Putin may very well discover that his own security and stability as President are in danger. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexander Motyl.","Alexander Motyl: Ukrainians don't believe Russia's assurances it will not invade .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The gunbattle was so close it rattled the walls. I grabbed my camera and pointed it out the window, looking toward Independence Square. From more than 10 stories up, I filmed the chaos. Protesters were all around, ramming into the lines of police officers. Black smoke hung in the air. Gunfire rang out. I saw a medic shot in the arm. He was helped to safety. I saw at least 20 wounded people carried away. But the gunmen could not be seen. There was panic. People looked skyward, scanning rooftops for snipers. At one point, a crowd of protesters stormed this hotel. They searched, floor to floor, trying to confirm a rumor that snipers were shooting from here. Then there was another rumor about what was in the lobby of this hotel. I clutched my camera and ran down the stairs. Little did I know then that I was about to see even more misery in what would turn out to be the worst day I've seen since arriving in Kiev. As I ran, I noticed bullet holes in the stairwell windows. Three had pierced through a second-floor window. Three more had shattered through another window. And then I saw the bodies. There were five bodies underneath the stairs, lifeless feet peeking out of the white sheets that covered them. There were more bodies lined up just feet from the reception desk. They were wrapped in white sheets and red splotches bled through. A priest paced back and forth. We were told that the priest had blessed the bodies even though people were still trying to find out who the victims were. Protesters went through the pockets of the fallen, searching for identification cards. We were told that the wounded and dying had to be brought to the closest place. That's why this hotel had been chosen. There were no ambulances, just people struggling to drag in the fallen. This happened just hours after the Ukraine government declared a truce in the fighting here that has shocked the world. Clearly, the truce had not held. A day ago this looked like a typical hotel lobby. Now it was a makeshift morgue. I counted 11 bodies. We were told later that in all 13 people had been rushed into this hotel, three of them clinging to life. None of them made it. On the other side of the lobby someone was wiping streaks of blood off the white marble floor. Outside, gunfire still rang out. And they continue to bring in bodies.

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- Surrounded by rubble, children swarm around a public well in this storm-ravaged city, where bodies are still lying in the streets days after a deadly typhoon struck.

""Our house got demolished,"" one woman told CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. ""My father died after being hit by falling wooden debris. We are calling for your help. If possible, please bring us food. We don't have anything to eat."" A man begged for forgiveness because he couldn't save his daughter from the typhoon's wrath. ""We all got separated from each other when the strong waves hit,"" he told ABS-CBN. ""We got separated. I couldn't even hold on to my child."" Another man said he was still trying to find six family members. ""My child has been buried in that island,"" he said. 'I'm going to die' Shirley Lim still remembers the sounds she heard as the storm struck. The wind was so strong, she said, it sounded like someone was crying. ""It's like the movie 'Twister,'"" she said. Speaking to CNN Monday from the city of Coron, Lim said one thought ran through her mind during the storm: ""I'm going to die."" But Lim survived. Many homes in Coron were severely damaged by the typhoon, she said, as the howling winds ripped roofs off houses made of light material like bamboo. Prison inmates threaten breakout . A man stands on a rooftop, threatening to jump. He is one of 672 inmates at a Tacloban prison, where food and water supplies ran out on Monday. Now, the prison's warden says the inmates have given him a warning, threatening a mass breakout in one or two days if they don't get food and water. From the prison's rooftop, the inmate says he is devastated -- but he doesn't mention food or drink. He says he doesn't know what happened to his family during the storm. Desperate victims at airport . Magina Fernandez's voice cracks as she comes face to face with Philippines President Benigno Aquino III at Tacloban's airport. Help, she says, hasn't come quickly enough. ""We need to get the word out,"" she tells him, ""because the Philippine government can't do this alone."" Fernandez was among the steady stream of typhoon victims arriving at the airport, searching for food, water and a chance to escape. She tells CNN she is desperate to leave the city. ""Get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow, now,"" she says. ""This is really, really like bad, bad, worse than hell, worse than hell."" Water, wind and fire create catastrophe . Fear spreads . Richard Young wears a green whistle on a plastic strap around his neck. He has been carrying it since Saturday night when small groups started forming to defend his neighborhood. They stayed up all night, he says, prepared to whistle if they saw any looting. But whistles aren't the only thing they have, he says. Many also are carrying weapons. ""As long as they don't harm my kids, my family, that's OK,"" he says. ""But once we are threatened, we will shoot. All of us, we are ready."" Already, the Filipino businessman says he's been shocked at the looting he's seen in the city -- not just food, he says, but large appliances like refrigerators and washing machines. Thieves, he says, have already ransacked his shop and others nearby. ""We are very afraid. ... In Tacloban we are almost 98% Catholics, and I can't believe they did this,"" he says. ""Nobody would think it's going to be lawlessness."" 'We were just floating' Tacloban City Councilor Cristina Gonzales-Romualdez and her husband, Mayor Alfred Romualdez were at their home facing the Pacific Ocean when the storm surge came, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported Tuesday. Suddenly, water burst into the home and rose so quickly, the people inside had to punch holes in the ceiling and climb to the second floor to avoid being swept away, Gonzales-Romualdez told the network. She found herself worried she would be swept out to sea. ""We were just floating, I was holding on to my kids,"" she said. Bodies everywhere . Days after the storm hit, bodies remain everywhere, some crudely covered, others exposed to the burning sun, CNN's Paula Hancocks reports. Two bodies, one large and one small, lay under what appeared to be a bus shelter below a sign with the phrase, ""I (heart) Tacloban."" Officials tell Hancocks they are focusing on the living, but the bodies pose a health risk to survivors. ""The stench is overpowering,"" she said. Shocked by the devastation . Sebastian Rhodes Stampa knows devastation. The U.N. disaster assessment team chief has been to some of the worst crisis zones in the world. The devastation from Typhoon Haiyan simply took his breath away when he set foot in Tacloban. ""I have to say, I was caught by surprise,"" he said Monday. ""Just getting off the military transport and looking at the airport, it almost wasn't there. It was utterly destroyed."" Traveling the region, he has seen huge boats thrown from the sea well up onto shore, and buildings knocked flat by the towering storm surge. In all, he said, these are scenes of ""appalling devastation and tragedy."" Checkpoints on crucial road . Police checkpoints appeared Monday on the 9-mile (15-kilomter) road from the airport to Tacloban. Officers told Hancocks that desperate residents looking for food and water had been jumping onto trucks leaving the airport. But CNN's Andrew Stevens spent three to four hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the airport road and saw no aid trucks. ""We're still going past dead bodies, we're still going past a shattered landscape,"" he reported. The Marine contingent brought trucks to increase the capacity to bring supplies into the city. Hundreds volunteer to pack aid . At the provincial welfare office in Cebu, hundreds of volunteers pack food and supplies into sturdy white bags. An employee who gives his name as Richard tells CNN's Anna Coren that students, workers and even tourists from Germany had arrived to help. ""I'm deeply touched,"" he said. Hospital without supplies . A hand-drawn sign at the front of St. Paul's Hospital in Tacloban gives a sense of the dire situation there. ""No admissions,"" it says. ""No supplies."" Interactive map of the storm . Without electricity at the large private hospital in this storm-ravaged city, workers used headlamps for light as they performed emergency first aid on victims who streamed in with wounds from flying debris. ""We just can't keep going,"" one doctor says. ""There's just no supplies."" Children ripped from arms . Searching for family lost in the storm . Splintered wood beams cover the ground where roads once connected a neighborhood near the coastline. Here, the storm surge plowed down homes, leaving behind mounds of rubble as far as the eye can see. Authorities pleaded with residents in the coastal area to evacuate as the storm approached. It's unclear how many did, and how many may be missing. Amid the chaos, one man says he is searching for his father, brothers and uncles under the rubble. ""We all tried to leave, but it was too late,"" he says. ""I got separated when the waters started rising. I don't know what happened to them."" Devastation for miles . From the air, the damage to Tacloban is striking. Forests of palm trees were mowed down on hills surrounding the city. Inside the city, the damage is catastrophic. The storm surge shoved massive freight ships ashore. Many buildings were flattened. Those that weren't had large chunks ripped away by ferocious waters and winds from the storm. William Hotchkiss, general director of the Philippines' Civil Aviation Authority, says he's never seen anything like it in decades of flying over the country after storms. He says he fears his country faces more disasters like this in the future. ""The biggest challenge,"" he says, ""is to sort of come up with structures that will take into consideration what they call 'the new normal' -- storms that are maybe as destructive as this one."" How to help . Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . CNN's David Simpson, Tim Schwarz, Brad Olsen, Chandrika Narayan and Catherine E.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- New hope, more frustration. As the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned up fresh potential clues, dozens of anguished Chinese relatives on Sunday demanded that Malaysia provide them with evidence on the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing Boeing 777. Ideal weather conditions gave one Australian aircraft crew the opportunity to detect many objects in the water west of Perth. It spotted four orange items of interest, took photos and sent the coordinates, but Flight Lt. Russell Adams said the crew couldn't determine whether the objects were from the airliner, which officials believe went down in the southern Indian Ocean. The items were more than 2 meters (6.5 feet) long, he said. Authorities will analyze the images and then decide whether to send a ship to the debris location. Adams called the discovery of the four objects one of the ""most promising leads"" searchers have come across. The search resumed Monday, with 10 aircraft and 10 boats set to look for signs of the missing plane. ""We are searching a vast area of ocean, and we are working on quite limited information. Nevertheless, the best brains in the world are applying themselves to this task. ... If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Monday. Speaking from the Royal Australian Air Force base where search teams have been headquartered, Abbott said he wouldn't set a time frame for how long the hunt for the missing plane could take. ""We can keep searching for quite some time to come. We will keep searching for quite some time to come. ... The intensity of our search and the magnitude of our operations is increasing, not decreasing,"" he said. Search efforts Sunday ended with no confirmed sightings of debris from the plane, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. Objects picked up by ships on Saturday turned out to be fishing equipment and other items, officials said. 'We want truth' The family members arrived in Kuala Lumpur and held a news conference at their hotel, imploring officials to be more transparent. ""We want evidence, we want truth and we want our family,"" said Jiang Hui, the families' designated representative. The crowd chanted the same words. ""We are here to call for the following three things,"" he said. ""First, the Malaysian side should provide us with timely and comprehensive evidence and answer the families' questions."" He also asked Malaysia to apologize for releasing confusing information and for announcing on March 24 that the plane had crashed even though there was no ""direct evidence."" Relatives wore white T-Shirts with the words "" Pray for MH370 ... return home safely."" Some wept. ""We are here struck with sadness and urgency,"" Jiang said. ""The meetings recently in China were not fruitful with (Malaysia Airlines) officials."" Mixed messages . Family members have accused Malaysian officials of withholding information since the plane vanished more than three weeks ago. Of the 239 people aboard the doomed jetliner, 154 were Chinese. Last week, relatives were told everyone aboard had died. But Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister, told reporters Saturday he had not closed the door on the hope that there could be survivors. Flight attendant's husband wants to give children answers, but has none . Frustrating search . Beijing has publicly slammed Malaysia's efforts to find the Boeing 777, which went missing March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. And as the frustrating three-week search resumed Monday, China was among the countries scouring the choppy waters of the southern Indian Ocean for signs of the plane. Ten aircraft were set to fly over the search area about 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) west of Perth, Australian officials said. Ten ships were also involved in the search, including the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield, which was fitted with a ""black box"" detector and an autonomous underwater vehicle. On Saturday, crew members aboard a Chinese plane dropped buoys to mark three suspected debris sites, China's state-run CCTV reported. It later said Sunday an orange ""suspicious object"" spotted by a Chinese plane Saturday turned out to be a dead jellyfish. Amid the confusion, Malaysia said it has done its best with what it has. ""History will judge us as a country that has been very responsible,"" Hishammuddin said. Relatives said they hope to meet the transport minister in Kuala Lumpur. They also asked Malaysia to plan meetings with the various companies involved, including Boeing, the plane's manufacturer. Race against time . Experts said the clock is ticking. The batteries on the flight data recorder, commonly referred to as the black box, are designed to last about 30 days. The plane disappeared March 8 -- 22 days ago. ""We certainly have our challenges in front of us,"" said Cmdr. Mark Matthews of the U.S. Navy. ""What we're trying to find is an acoustic emission from one of the pingers on the flight data recorder (and) the cockpit voice recorder. Typically these last, the batteries last about 30 days, usually they last a little bit longer, and that's what we're trying to find. But what is critical is that the teams that are out there searching for the surface debris, they get good position data on that and they feed it back to the oceanographers, to help us determine a probable point of impact for where the aircraft went in."" An American pinger locator and undersea search equipment were loaded onto the Ocean Shield. The ship is set to depart by Monday morning, and will take up to three days to reach the search area. U.S. Navy Cmdr. William Marks told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that his team really needs a conclusive piece of debris to narrow down the search area, due to the range of the pinger locator. ""We have to be careful not to send it in the wrong place, but we also wanted to get it out there as close as we can to what we believe is the right place,"" he told CNN's Candy Crowley. He said if the batteries on the recorders aboard the missing plane run out, the search would require side-scan sonar, one of which has been loaded on a search ship. ""But like I said, without good visual confirmation of debris, which we really have not had yet, it is tough to even go in the general direction,"" he said. 'They're still alive' In Beijing on Saturday, some of the relatives of the missing vented their anguish in the streets. ""They're all still alive, my son and everyone on board!"" yelled Wen Wancheng, 63, whose only son was among the passengers. ""The plane is still there, too! They're hiding it."" He held aloft a banner that read: ""Son, Mom and Dad's hearts are torn to pieces. Come home soon!"" Relatives implored Hishammuddin to redouble efforts to find the plane. ""What they want is a commitment on our part to continue the search, and that I have given,"" Hishammuddin said. ""For me, as the minister responsible, this is the hardest part of my life, at the moment,"" he told reporters. ""Miracles do happen, remote or otherwise, and that is the hope that the families want me to convey -- not only to the Malaysian government, MAS (Malaysia Airlines), but also to the world at large,"" he said. Sea objects . The latest data analysis shows Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. But officials have offered different assessments of exactly where it could have gone down. Investigators shifted the search area Friday after concluding that the plane had been traveling faster and burning fuel faster than they previously had thought. The new search area is closer to Australia's coast, so it takes less time to reach, meaning more area can be searched. It's also marked by calmer waters. Your questions answered .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Looking for that special Christmas gift for the Judy Garland fan who has everything? Consider giving them the U.S. rights to the legendary actress-singer's television variety series. ""This would be a great Christmas gift for somebody,"" said Darryl Payne, a music producer who bought the rights in 1998 from Sam Luft, Garland's former husband. ""The Judy Garland Show,"" which cost CBS $24 million in 1963, is being auctioned this weekend with a starting bid of $1 million. The bidding, conducted online by The Royalty Exchange, is set to end Sunday afternoon. ""You get Judy Garland,"" Payne said. ""She's singing, she's dancing. You get all the biggest stars of that era."" Then-rising star Barbra Streisand sang a memorable duet with Garland in one episode, before the singer filmed ""Funny Girl,"" her breakout movie. The appearance earned Streisand her first Emmy nomination. Garland's daughter Liza Minelli, then 17, was a guest, along with many other entertainment legends: Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, Count Basie, Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, Bob Newhart, Donald O'Connor, Steve Allen, Jane Powell, Peter Lawford, Vic Damone and Jack Jones. While clips of the series have been licensed over the years, the episodes have not been shown on television since the series was canceled in March 1964, Payne said. The buyer can sell DVDs or rebroadcast in the United States the 26 star-filled episodes hosted by Garland for a season on CBS starting in 1963. The new owner could also license the series for streaming online or downloading, Payne said. The remastered digitized video also includes never-before-seen outtakes from the show, Payne said. Garland died of a drug overdose at age 47, five years after the series was taken off the air.

"(CNN) -- Defense attorneys representing accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzokhar Tsarnaev said in a Friday court filing the FBI asked his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, to be an FBI informant and report on the Chechen and Muslim communities in Boston. ""We base this on information from our client's family and other sources that the FBI made more than one visit to talk with (Tamerlan's parents) and Tamerlan, questioned Tamerlan about his internet searches, and asked him to be an informant,"" the defense motion states. But the same court filing says the government denies the allegation and quotes a March 14 FBI statement that says, ""[T]he government has no evidence that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was solicited by the government to be an informant."" Defense lawyers sought FBI documents to confirm their allegation and said it's possible ""Tamerlan misinterpreted the visits and discussions with the FBI as pressure and that they amounted to a stressor that increased his paranoia and distress."" Dzokhar Tsarnaev is scheduled to be tried November 3. He is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the April 15 bombing that left three people dead and more than 250 others injured. The attacks triggered the massive manhunt that led to Tsarnaev's capture. During a manhunt, Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- All goals count, so we're told. But some are more equal than others and this is a rundown of the best 11 of all time. Diego Maradona's second strike against England at Mexico 86 tops our greatest-ever goal list. Some of them are great individual goals, some of them are great team goals, but all of them are outstanding examples of the ball being put into the net. The capitals denote the team the goalscorer was playing for. Let us know if you agree with our list by posting your comments in the Sound Off box below. 1 Diego Maradona, ARGENTINA v England, World Cup quarter-final 1986 . If you're English, the other goal he scored that day sticks in the craw as well as the mind. But for everyone else, Maradona's match-winning genius was never better exemplified by this slaloming run, which started with a drag-back turn and went on to include feints, dropped shoulders and the calmest of finishes. It was later dubbed the goal of the century. Who says players need two feet? 2 Carlos Alberto, BRAZIL v Italy, World Cup final 1970 . The best team goal of all time. A sublime move began in the left-back spot with Brazil's striker Tostao and it would pass through eight of the team's outfield players before ending up in the Italian net. Clodaldo dribbled mazily in his own half, he gave it to Rivelino, who passed it on to Jairzinho up the left. The winger fed Pele on the edge of the area, who held the ball up before laying it into the space to his right. There, the right-back Carlos Alberto was approaching like an express train and he thundered the ball into the far corner. Have we missed one of your favorite strikes out? Leave your suggestions below . 3 Zinedine Zidane, REAL MADRID v Bayer Leverkusen, Champions League final 2002 . A miracle of technique, this goal had Zidane written all over it. A rampaging Roberto Carlos sent over a looping cross from the left which dropped seemingly without danger out of the gray Glasgow sky. But from 18 yards out, Zidane, intently watching the ball's flight, caught it perfectly with his left foot, his shot bending unerringly into the top corner. 4 Marco van Basten, NETHERLANDS v USSR, European Championship final 1988 . Much in the same way Zidane's strike against Leverkusen was a triumph of technique, Van Basten's dipping volley against the Soviet Union took the breath away. Arnold Muhren pumped over a ball from wide on the left and everyone was expecting Van Basten, in space on the far right of the box, to either pull the ball down or head it back into the area. Instead he caught it sweetly, sending the ball arching over USSR keeper Rinat Dasaev's head and into the net from an impossible angle. 5 Michael Owen, ENGLAND v Argentina, World Cup second round 1998 . This was the goal that made Owen a household name. David Beckham found the 18-year-old in space 35 yards from goal and the fearless striker brought the ball under control as he raced towards goal. Shrugging off Jose Chamot's manhandling, he darted to the right of Roberto Ayala and with Paul Scholes approaching to his right to steal his thunder, Owen arrowed his shot over Carlos Roa into the top corner. A star was born. 6 Dennis Bergkamp, NETHERLANDS v Argentina, World Cup quarter-final 1998 . Deep in his own half, center-back Frank de Boer had few obvious attacking options on. Sixty yards ahead of him, Bergkamp was on the move and De Boer picked out his run with a pin-point pass. As the ball dropped over his shoulder, an airborne Bergkamp killed it and moved it inside the challenge of Roberto Ayala in one fluid movement before flicking it with the outside of his right boot high past Carlos Roa. In the last minute the game was won and jaws everywhere dropped. 7 Esteban Cambiasso, ARGENTINA v Serbia & Montenegro, World Cup group game 2006 . Cambiasso's name is in the record books as the goal scorer but the whole Argentina line-up deserves a mention too. A rival to Carlos Alberto's goal against Italy, the ball was shifted effortlessly between dark blue shirts 24 times, in and out of Serbian players, before Cambiasso played a one-two with Hernan Crespo in the box and thumped home. The whole move looked effortless, but goals like that come along once in a blue moon. 8 Lionel Messi, BARCELONA v Getafe, Copa del Rey semi-final 2007 . Perhaps the most amazing thing about this most amazing goal is its similarity to Maradona's second goal against England. Picking the ball up from deep on the right, Messi ran at the Getafe defense, skipping past challenges until faced with the keeper. Forced wide, he kept his head and clipped home from a tight angle. Maradona would have been proud. 9 Zlatan Ibrahimovic, AJAX v NAC Breda, Eredivisie 2004 . There are only a few players in world football capable of scoring a goal of such impudence. Ibrahimovic always believed himself too good for the Dutch league and this goal proved it in a show of immense skill, strength and ball control. The swaggering Swede danced in and out of countless despairing challenges, teasing the NAC defenders and then the keeper, before finally putting them out of their misery. 10 George Weah, AC MILAN v Verona, Serie A 1996 . Goals that see players run the length of the pitch with the ball are always crowd favorites. Saeed Al-Owairan did something similar to Weah for Saudi Arabia at the 1994 World Cup but the effort by Weah, then the world footballer of the year, sticks longer in the memory. Collecting an over-hit corner in his own box, Weah set off for the heart of the Verona defense. It looked liked he'd lost the ball in the center circle but twisted his way out, flicked the ball round the final defender and ran on to slot home. 11 Dennis Bergkamp, ARSENAL v Newcastle, Premier League 2002 . It's crazy to think there's a debate about whether Bergkamp meant this classiest of goals. Robert Pires cut in from the left and threaded a pass to Bergkamp's feet on the edge of the area. In the blink of an eye, the Dutch master somehow back-heeled the ball around his marker, Nikos Dabizas, turned, held off the bemused defender and slotted coolly past Shay Given in goal.","Football Fanzone presents a rundown of the 11 best goals of all time .

"(CNN) -- When celebrating an important anniversary, it's always good to look your best. At least that's the theory behind the latest kit for Spanish football team Cultural y Deportivo Leonesa, whose players donned a somewhat special uniform for a preseason tournament Wednesday. A cross between formal evening-wear and a sporting outfit, the tuxedo-esque strip was specially designed by Danish firm Hummel to celebrate the third division side's 90th birthday. The club will give 10% of the proceeds to charities for mining families based in the region of Leon where it is based, while local children will also receive free football kits and coaching classes. Fan reaction has been mixed since last week's preview, says Hummel's marketing manager Henning Nielsen, but the jersey has garnered worldwide attention for a team which has only once graced Spain's top flight -- back in the 1955-56 season. ""The club wanted to help the mining industry in the region, which is having some really tough times,"" Nielsen told CNN. ""We wanted to go in and explore the club's heritage and find what has local character, and incorporate that into the design. ""The club is celebrating its 90-year anniversary, so instead of having a formal reception with wine and drinks and snacks the club decided to do something ... another way with a bit of character."" The concept of designing a special-edition football kit to carry a special message is far from a new one -- especially in Spain. In 2000, Deportivo Alaves released a shirt that featured the name of every season ticket-holder at the club to show solidarity between the then top-flight team and its fans. Second division club Deportivo Lugo, meanwhile, has released two special-edition kits for the coming preseason that take the appearance of a glass of beer and an octopus -- two delicacies of the Galicia region in northwest Spain where the side is based. La Hoya Lorca has played the last two Segunda B seasons in a broccoli-style shirt which is said to represent the southern Murcia region's reputation for growing vegetables. Even some of Spain's most famous clubs, like Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, have gotten in on the act. Last season Barca's away kit was based on the Catalan flag, while Bilbao's 2011-12 away strip reflected the Basque flag and a few years earlier its ""spilled blood"" shirt was designed by a local artist whose work features in the city's Guggenheim Museum.

"(CNN) -- The art of dodging tossed wedding bouquets had been mastered by Cindy Pollard. At 52, and with plenty of experience celebrating the big day for others, she'd learned how to back into corners and disappear when brides sent those flowers flying. Cindy Pollard, left, and Gayla Snook celebrate their engagement at the Des Moines, Iowa, Pridefest parade. Now, Pollard can dive for them. ""I have seven brothers and sisters, and I've been to all of their weddings,"" she said, her words catching on emotion. ""It's just something you never thought you'd get to do."" Everything changed for this Iowa nurse on April 3, when the Midwestern state's Supreme Court unanimously ruled to overturn a ban on same-sex marriages. On that day, Pollard proposed to Gayla Snook, her partner of 10 years -- three times, just because she could. By lunchtime, the two women were busy planning their wedding, a big blowout scheduled for next summer. Forty years after the Stonewall riots in New York -- the June 28, 1969, demonstrations that marked the beginning of the gay rights movement -- Iowa stands as one of six U.S. states to have legalized same-sex marriages. The others that currently, or will soon, perform such unions are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. Many activists who followed the Iowa case, Varnum v. Brien, to the state's Supreme Court were anticipating the April 3 announcement. But for Beau Fodor, news of the decision on television that morning -- ""between 'Martha Stewart' and 'The View,' "" he said -- came as a complete shock. ""How did this happen?"" the Des Moines designer and event planner remembers thinking before turning the station to compare newscasts. ""Are you kidding me, universe?"" And then, while resisting the urge to pinch himself, the revelation: ""Oh my god. I could be a gay wedding planner."" He and others like him should be plenty busy. According to a study conducted by The Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law-based think tank that researches sexual orientation law and policy, more than 2,900 of the state's same-sex couples will marry within three years and nearly 55,000 out-of-state couples may flock to Iowa for the honor. Fodor, who established Gay Weddings with Panache, wasn't the only one who realized the potential of this new nuptials niche. Web sites offering resource guides to help happy couples (in-state and out) sprouted up, bearing names such as Iowa's Gay Wedding Planner and Iowa Gay Wedding Directory. And wedding officiants, including those who'd been ordained online, began publicizing their same-sex-friendly services. Des Moines' first annual Gay Wedding Expo, held at a downtown hotel earlier this month, was organized by Fodor and brought together 40 vendors ready and willing to help couples realize their dream day. It was there that Pollard and Snook found, for example, their photographer and realized they'd have ""like 106 flavors of cake to choose from,"" Pollard said with the laugh of an overwhelmed bride-to-be. Wedding vendors again came out in force just over a week ago at the 31st annual Pridefest, a Des Moines event organized by Capital City Pride that attracted a record crowd of more than 10,000, officials estimated. Jubilant couples carried signs of gratitude and announcements of ""just married."" For Alisha Hennessy, who was adopted at 8 by Mike Yowell and Hersh Rodasky of Council Bluffs, the Supreme Court decision finally gives her parents --together for 28 years -- what she's wanted for them since she was 10. The two men already had a civil ceremony, and later this summer, they'll receive a blessing in their Episcopal church. ""Now they can do what my husband and I did,"" said Hennessy, 26, a teaching assistant in Omaha, Nebraska. ""And I get to have the privilege to walk my parents down the aisle."" Not everyone in Iowa, however, is feeling the love. Those associated with the Iowa Family Policy Center, for example, are crisscrossing the state to promote the faith-based organization's mission that reads, in part, ""to restore and defend traditional moral principles."" Bryan English, a spokesman for the center, said the Iowa Supreme Court overstepped its bounds, did what only the legislature can do and does not have ""the constitutional authority to alter laws or write laws."" He said that these same-sex marriages are, therefore, not legal and that Iowans should continue to make their opinions known. ""If we're not going to base the rule of law on the Constitution, and we're not going to look to the Bible as a foundation of truth,"" English said, ""what standard are we going to use?"" State Sen. Merlin Bartz, R-District 6, also has made his opposition known. He said he pushed, unsuccessfully, to institute a ""conscience clause"" -- a measure that would allow county recorders the right to refuse same-sex marriage licenses. Bartz feels Iowa was ""hand picked"" by outside advocates -- Lambda Legal, a national organization, filed the Iowa suit -- as fertile ground for a handful of reasons. Among those he mentioned were Iowa's current Democratic leadership and the fact that it doesn't have a ballot initiative option, which is what allowed Californians to vote for Proposition 8, the measure that banned same-sex marriages in that state. He said that he hopes the 2010 elections will change the tide and that the ruling doesn't reflect what Iowans truly want. Not so, said Carolyn Jenison, executive director of One Iowa, a statewide grassroots advocacy and education organization for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. She said that in measuring public opinion, she keeps hearing how ""proud"" Iowans are, and she emphasized that the state, often written off as a ""flyover state or conservative state,"" in fact, has a long history of civil rights leadership. Iowa, for example, ruled against slavery in 1839, desegregated schools in 1868 and, for the first time in the country, granted a woman a license to practice law in 1869, as outlined in a One Iowa brochure. But beyond this tradition and what she described as a ""strong sense of community and fairness,"" she said most Iowans realize that that vows taken by two people won't affect their day-to-day lives and that they have other, more pressing concerns, especially in these tough financial times. Doing their own part to help Iowa's economy are Pollard and Snook, 47, who works with medically and physically challenged adults. While others may be steeped in the bigger picture, they've got a ""growing and growing"" guest list to worry about, decisions on bridal wear to make and party add-ons -- photo booth, or no photo booth? -- to consider. And with two brides making decisions, Pollard said, things can get complicated. When Snook mentioned the idea of having the party at an Elk lodge, Pollard  raced out the door with a down payment for the country club. But on June 5, 2010, these two Newton, Iowa, women will embark on a life as one when they say their vows and promise to love each other always. A white carriage, complete with a ""just married"" sign and pulled by black horses, will ferry them all the way through town and to the reception. ""It's a long journey,"" Pollard said, ""to symbolize our struggle.""","Instead of dodging wedding bouquets, Iowa's same-sex brides can dive for them .

"(Health.com) -- Every few years, there's a new food bad guy in town -- and right now, it's sugar. Some experts have even declared it a ""poison"" that's ""killing us."" Yet could the sweet stuff people have been eating forever really be so terrible? ""We actually need sugar; it's our body's preferred fuel,"" says Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center. ""But we eat too damn much of it."" Naturally occurring sugar -- which gives fruit, some veggies, and milk their sweet taste â€” is perfectly healthy. It's added sugar (sweeteners put in during processing and prep) that we need to not OD on. No need to cut out dessert: The key is to eat strategically. Happily, some major companies are getting on board. In the past four years, cereal brands have cut back on sugar, the milk industry recently lowered amounts in the chocolate milk served in schools, and Walmart is aiming for 10% less added sugar in select foods by 2015. Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day . We turned to experts to clear up the confusion over this tasty temptress. As Katz says, ""There's a role for sugar in our diet. After all, what's the point of being healthy if it's not to enjoy living?"" Is there such thing as a sweet tooth? Yes, sugar love is in your DNA. Researchers have found two sweet-receptor genes that can predict a preference for sweets. How much is OK? The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends most women get no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day. That's about six teaspoons, or 100 calories -- a little less than the amount in one can of soda. Thing is, the average American woman eats about 18 daily teaspoons. Sugar is hidden in unlikely foods, from salad dressing to crackers, which can push you past 24 grams. Read labels; if there's a sweetener in the first few ingredients (some common aliases: evaporated cane juice, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice concentrate, agave nectar, fructose, dextrose, and syrup), look for a brand with a low-or no-sugar option. Health.com: Diet-busting foods you should never eat . Is it really so bad? ""Sugar is an important part of our lives,"" says Dr. Miriam Vos, assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine. ""But a little goes a long way."" The AHA links added sugar to obesity, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In a nutshell, eating too much sugar can cause fat buildup in the liver, which can lead to these problems. It's not all bad. ""There's no need to avoid the naturally-occurring sugars in fruit, vegetables, and low- and nonfat dairy,"" says Rachel K. Johnson, professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont in Burlington. As sweet as some of these things may taste, they contain relatively small amounts of sugar. Plus, nature's packaging comes with essential vitamins and minerals, along with water and fiber that slow the release of sugars into the bloodstream and prevent insulin spikes. Health.com: 23 superfruits you need now . What's up with 'natural' sugars? Sugar in the raw is no better than regular sugar. Agave nectar, alas, is also not great: Its main constituent, fructose, tends to get held up in the liver more than other types of sugar. Some sweeteners, like raw honey and sucanat, have trace nutrients, but they're all the same as white sugar in terms of calories -- and some contain even more calories. Is it OK to use calorie-free sweeteners? Yes! The FDA deems stevia, aspartame (Equal), sucralose (Splenda), and other cal-free sweeteners safe. ""Short-term data suggests they're safer than table sugar,"" says Kimber Stanhope, a nutritional biologist at the University of California-Davis. Faux sugar won't cause blood-sugar spikes or weight gain -- and all the potential health ills. As Stanhope says, ""I use them because I can't afford the extra calories!""

"Holmy, near Ukraine-Russian border (CNN) -- A low hum rises high into the onion-shaped dome of a village church. The priest, shrouded in a gold cape, peers through steel-gray eyes at the small flock standing before him, intoning ancient religious chants. A few miles of forest, swampland and rolling potato fields is all that stands between this community of 2,500 people and Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. In the congregation, tears stream down one lady's face. Hard to tell whether she's moved by the power of prayer or whether she's just plain terrified of the prospect Russian troops could invade. Before he took his vows, Father Mikhail Zorivchak -- an engineer by profession -- was an officer in the Soviet army. He came back to this region after the fall of the Berlin Wall but found no other work except rebuilding churches, including the one in this village. He cannot believe his old comrades will roll into Ukraine, even less that rank-and-file Russian soldiers would heed orders to open fire on their Ukrainian neighbors. But if they do, Zorivchak is preaching to the faithful that there can be no question of turning the other cheek. ""I will preach to our people to defend our homeland from any invader. This is the land of our grandfathers. I'll pray for our army. And if they need me I'm ready to join them to protect our holy land,"" he told CNN. 'Truth is where God is' Zorivchak knows firsthand the might of the Russian military. He served the Soviets at a base in East Germany between 1986 and 1988 building storage facilities for T-80 tanks. But in his new life as a priest, he believes he and the rest of village have two key tactical advantages against advancing Russian armor. ""We know how to fight a partisan (guerrilla) war. We know these forests and swamps like the back of our hand and it will be very hard to fight us,"" he said. ""Truth will win. Truth is where God is and God is on our side,"" he added. Luba Kostroma, who during the week works in the village store, is trying to keep her nerve, hoping and praying for the best. ""Of course I'm praying for peace. But I think the Russians will come in,"" she said. She was at Sunday Mass with her 3-year-old grandson Olexi and her son Igor. Igor Kostroma was a soldier in the Ukrainian army and later served in the police force. He's an army reservist, and if war did break out he would almost certainly be dispatched to the front line. That thought terrifies his mother. ""Every mother worries when her son is mobilized. We understand our young men have to protect the homeland. But it's painful to think that our sons must go to war in the 21st century,"" Kostroma said, her voice rising in a mix of fear and defiance. This talk of facing down a far more powerful enemy may not be mere bluster. The young men of Holmy know they have the lessons of history to live up to. This border region was the scene of a bitter guerrilla campaign during World War II. Ukrainian villagers -- known as ""partisans"" -- fought in small, lightly armed and highly mobile squads against the Germans. In that era, Russian soldiers were their allies. In another village near Holmy, a concrete, wartime monument still stands, emblazoned with a red star and the logo of the USSR. On one side the names of dozens of Soviet troops who died in combat. On the other side, the names of even more Ukrainian partisans who fell. The locals clearly take pride in that legacy. Ukrainian military peers intently across border . Over the past week, Pentagon officials have estimated Moscow has massed around 40,000 troops on the border and that a further 25,000 are deployed a little deeper in Russia's interior. The Ukrainian government's National Defense and Security Council puts the total figure a little higher -- around 88,000. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last week said Moscow had no intention of moving into Ukraine. However, at the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has continued to accuse Ukrainian nationalists of threatening ethnic Russians living in Ukraine -- a pretext he also used to send his troops into the Ukrainian region of Crimea. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Lavrov Sunday for talks in Paris about the troop buildup. In a press conference afterward, Kerry said both men had exchanged ideas and suggestions, but there was no hint Moscow was about to pull its men back. Far from those diplomatic discussions, in a potato field near Holmy, a Ukrainian military unit has spent days monitoring the border region using a mobile radar station and other sophisticated listening equipment. A major, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told us he had seen a huge buildup of Russian troop numbers. He added they had also spotted attack helicopters, tanks and even missile batteries. Digging in . Among the civilian populace, fear is palpable. Preparations for war are gathering pace. On the corner of the square in Holmy, an abandoned Soviet-era village store has been reopened. A handful of locals turned up Sunday bringing supplies of food to donate to Ukrainian troop detachments. Rice, sacks of potatoes, cooking oil and an assortment of home-pickled vegetables were laid out on the ground. It's not clear how many Ukrainian troops have been deployed into the border region. A few armored personnel carriers and tanks can be seen positioned near strategic points along the highway that leads to the capital, Kiev. But many more may be located in the forests. Villages immediately on the border have been declared closed military zones, according to the Ukrainian Border Patrol Service. Outsiders are not being permitted to enter. A CNN team did briefly manage to get in unhindered. In a wooded area just a few hundred yards back from the border, the CNN team found a series of recently dug defensive positions, including trenches and foxholes. There was no immediate sign of troops. A few moments later, a plainclothes border agent arrived and ordered the journalists out of the zone. ""They're troublemakers,"" he told his men, referring to the journalists. But of course, if the Russians do roll in, the trouble will only just be beginning.","Fear of Russian invasion is palpable in the border community of Holmy .

"(EW.com ) -- Is this the face of a beautiful prima ballerina who burns for her beautiful brother — and yearns for revenge against her equally beautiful mother? Lifetime thinks so. EW can confirm that 26-year-old Rose McIver will star as Cathy in ""Petals on the Wind,"" the network's upcoming sequel to its hit adaptation of V.C. Andrews's ""Flowers in the Attic."" McIver will inherit the role from Kiernan Shipka, who played Cathy from ages 12 through 15 in the first film. The novel on which Petals is based picks up immediately where Flowers leaves off, covering a sequence of events that take place over the course of 12 years; Lifetime's movie version will take a different approach, beginning a decade after the events of the first movie. (Which is a good thing, since it means viewers will be spared scenes of Sally Draper seducing a 40-year-old man.) McIver, a New Zealand native, may be known best to American audiences as Vivian Scully on Showtime's ""Masters of Sex"" or Tinker Bell on ABC's ""Once Upon a Time."" As her Facebook page notes, McIver also used to study ballet and jazz dance — which may come in handy when playing dancer-turned-teacher Cathy.

"(CNN) -- Just weeks after the scandal about pictures of Britain's Prince Harry naked in Las Vegas, a magazine has sparked fresh controversy by publishing pictures of Prince William's wife, Catherine, topless while vacationing. The duchess of Cambridge is ""upset"" with the magazine -- a French publication called Closer, a royal source told CNN. Palace officials, threatening legal action, have blasted what they call a ""grotesque"" invasion of privacy. The grainy pictures appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau in Provence, in southern France. They were ""hugely saddened to learn that a French publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner,"" a St. James's Palace spokesman said. These new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of William's mother, Diana, as she fled photographers in Paris 15 years ago. ""The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so,"" the palace spokesman said. ""Their Royal Highnesses had every expectation of privacy in the remote house. It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them."" William, Catherine on high-stakes mission . St. James's Palace officials told CNN they ""believe a red line has been crossed."" The palace confirmed that the couple is taking legal action against the publishers of Closer. The pair remain focused on their Asian tour on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, he added. William, who is second in line to the throne, and his wife are in Malaysia as they carry out a nine-day Southeast Asian tour of Commonwealth nations, which started in Singapore. The photographs cannot be accessed on Closer's website, which shows only the magazine's front cover with heavily blurred images. The photos are featured in the magazine's print copy, which is available in France. Read more about the duchess of Cambridge . The latest furor comes three weeks after the British royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of William's younger brother, Prince Harry, partying naked in his Las Vegas hotel room with a group of girls. Those photographs were widely circulated online but were published in only one UK tabloid, The Sun, after palace officials asked UK media not to run them. The Press Complaints Commission, the UK press watchdog, received about 3,800 complaints from the public but said it was inappropriate for it to take any action without a formal complaint from the palace. The Sun has made clear that it won't publish the pictures of Catherine, however. Editor Dominic Mohan tweeted: ""The Sun has no intention of breaching the royal couple's privacy. The circumstances are very different to those relating to the photos of Prince Harry in Las Vegas."" Laurence Pieau, editor-in-chief of Closer in France, posted several comments on Twitter late Thursday promoting the release of the topless pictures of Catherine. One said: ""The world exclusive of #closer tomorrow is Kate Middleton as you have never seen her ... and as you will never see her again."" Another read: ""For kate middleton to have tan lines she would have to be wearing a swimsuit!"" Interviewed by CNN affiliate BFM-TV on Friday, Pieau defended the decision to publish the photographs, saying, ""We were just doing our job."" The magazine was tipped off about the dates of the royal couple's visit to Provence and sent a photographer, she said. The pair were visible on a terrace from the road. Opinion: British privacy should start with British press . Pieau said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos and that she believes they are not degrading, as ""they are just like any other couple in love."" She described the reaction to the pictures' publication as ""disproportionate"" and slammed the British press as ""complete hypocrites,"" since photos of Harry naked were published by The Sun. Pieau said that there are additional photos that are even more revealing but that Closer is not publishing them for now. The magazine will wait to see if any complaint is made against it, she said. ""I think that what these photos really highlight is the issue of the royal couple's security,"" she added. A string of negative comments from members of the public has already been posted on the French Closer magazine's Facebook page. One, written in French, said: ""Your behavior is unacceptable, you're as bad as the English tabloids. You have gone too far with the photos of Kate topless and it will cost you a lot I hope. Shameful."" It is not yet clear what form any legal action by William and Catherine against Closer magazine, run by an Italian business called Mondadori, might take. But British lawyer Charlotte Harris said the magazine's decision to publish was a clear breach of French legal codes and was out of line with current views on people's right to privacy. ""The perception of the French was that they are less aggressive, that they have a culturally different opinion of where privacy laws should lie. Here they appear to have gone right over the other way,"" she said. French law provides for ""draconian sanctions"" to protect against this kind of behavior, she said, including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines. But even if distribution of the images is contained, Harris said, the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge. French magazine VSD was fined 2,000 euros ($2,580) last week after it published a photo of Valerie Trierweiler, partner of French President Francois Hollande, in a bikini on its front cover, BFM-TV reports. Trierweiler is also taking legal action against other French magazines that published images of her and Hollande in swimwear while on vacation, BFM-TV says. Singapore gives royal welcome to William, Kate . The latest royal controversy threatens to overshadow what has until now been a well-received tour in Asia, undertaken as part of diamond jubilee celebrations for the queen, William's grandmother. The duchess of Cambridge gave her first public speech in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Thursday, at a hospice for terminally ill children and adults. She is the patron of a charity supporting children's hospices in East Anglia, England. The royal couple will be in Malaysia until Sunday before heading to the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. The duchess was very conservatively dressed as she visited a mosque in Kuala Lumpur on Friday. There was also a security scare when a man lunged at Catherine and tried to give her a flower as she and William left a festival of Malaysian dancing in a park in the capital. A man was arrested over the incident, a palace source said. ""The Duchess was getting into the car and the Duke was walking round to the other side of the car when an enthusiastic member of the public tried to give her a flower,"" he told CNN. ""He was very close, right up against the car. He was arrested by local police officers. Royal protection officers were not involved, though they had noticed him in the crowd earlier on. The Duke and Duchess were not in any danger at all at any point."" The French Closer magazine is run by a different company from the publication of the same name in the United Kingdom. Closer UK, published by Bauer Consumer Media, issued a statement distancing itself from the French magazine. ""Closer magazine UK would like to make it clear that the two publications make entirely independent editorial decisions. In this respect the comments made by the editor of the French edition which have reported in the media today do not reflect the opinions of Closer magazine UK. ""Closer magazine UK was not offered any pictures of this nature and certainly has no intention of publishing the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge which have been published in France this morning."" The British media is under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses. The conclusions of an independent judge-led inquiry, which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms, are expected by the end of the year.

"Denver (CNN) -- While an increasingly unpopular President Obama seems to be on a self-imposed Rose Garden strategy this election, one Democrat is in demand on the campaign trail: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She's an unabashed progressive from Massachusetts, a Democrat who thinks Democrats are too timid and a populist who has been called to help in red, blue and purple states. And despite her frequent protests, she's someone that liberals long to see launch a 2016 bid for the White House. Warren is an unusual Washington phenom—a combination of loyal soldier and inside agitator, a star who has no problem taking on her own party. ""What the Democrats have to do is be willing to stand up and fight,"" she tells CNN. Asked if the party hasn't been willing to do that, she responds: ""I just think we can use a little more of that. I think we can use a little more of standing up and saying this is what it's about, and I'm willing to do it."" Warren's job this election season is to gin up a party base that lacks energy, and she's been taking her message to get out the vote to 15 states so far. This weekend, she ventures to New Hampshire to stump for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, locked in a close contest with Republican Scott Brown. The race is personal for Warren: she defeated Brown in 2012 for her Senate seat when he lived in Massachusetts. POLL: Dead heat in New Hampshire Senate race . Warren has also raised money -- about $6 million -- for the party this cycle. But most of all, she's reminding Democrats that they have a large stake in this election. ""The powerful and the rich should get richer and more powerful,"" Warren tells a crowd of several hundred in Boulder. ""That's what it's all about for the Republicans."" Warren is the messenger that President Obama can't be—at least not now. It's been a tricky election year for him: his popularity is on the decline, the world is increasingly dangerous and his Democrats are at growing risk of losing control of the Senate. They're left in a precarious place, trying to figure out the best ways to motivate the Obama base -- without Obama. Enter Warren. In Colorado, where incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall is in a tight race against Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, she plays to the college audience in Boulder. ""The fight comes to you. If you pick up what you've got, and you put everything you can into it, then together you, me, Mark, all of us, that's how we are going to build a future together,"" she says. But she's also been able to play in the red states of West Virginia and Kentucky, where she campaigned this summer with Senate candidates Alison Lundergan Grimes and Natalie Tennant. Warren's rise as a party star is, well, complicated. While the president first tapped her to help create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he did not nominate her as its first chief—worried she could not get confirmed--so she ran for the Senate, with White House backing. But she's not shy about taking on the White House, calling its bailout more of a sell-out. ""You know if President Barack Obama had not been in the White House we would not have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today. This is an agency that has forced the biggest banks in this country to return more than four billion dollars directly to people they cheated, and that's been just three years,"" she tells CNN. But there's a but in there: ""Of course there's a but coming because there's another half to this...He also chose an economic team and when the going got tough, the economic team chose Wall Street. They protected Wall Street over American families, and that's just something I think is fundamentally wrong."" In the past, she has also called former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton— a frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination and an ex-New York senator--too close to the financial sector. ""I have said I worry about everyone who is too close to Wall Street. When I describe what this race is about, it's about who does government work for. I worry everywhere,"" she says in the interview. Not exactly a ringing endorsement, although she has signed a letter urging Clinton to run for the presidency. Even so, she has become the left's anti-Hillary and the Republicans poster child for big government liberalism. She and her agenda star in the conservative PAC American Crossroads videos linking her to Obama. Republicans say she energizes their base as much as she does the Democrats, but she balks at the notion. ""Whoa, whoa, wait, wait because I believe we should have a little higher minimum wage, because I believe women should have access to birth control, because I believe the United States government not be making tens of billions of dollars in profits off the backs of our kids on student loans, because I believe Social Security should not be privatized. That's what I believe in. That's what I am out there fighting for."" She's fighting, she says repeatedly, to keep Democrats in charge of the Senate in 2014. But what about 2016? She is determined not to look beyond this year's election, staying relentlessly on message while her supporters want the 2016 door open: ""You could ask this as many ways as you want.

"(CNN) -- One day, Urooj Khan jumped for joy after scoring a $1 million winner on an Illinois lottery scratch ticket. The next month, he was dead. Investigators initially ruled Khan's manner of death natural. But after being prompted by a relative, the medical examiner's office in Cook County, Illinois, revisited the case and eventually determined there was a lethal amount of cyanide in Khan's system. ""That ... led us to issue an amended death certificate that (established) cyanide toxicity as the cause of death, and the manner of death as homicide,"" Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Steve Cina said Monday. Why did Khan, an Indian immigrant who was described as a well-liked, hardworking and successful businessman, die? And who is responsible? Finding that out is now up to the Chicago police. No arrests have been made. ""We are investigating it as a murder, and we're working closely with the medical examiner's office,"" Chicago police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said Monday. On June 26, Khan was all smiles at a 7-Eleven in the Rogers Park section of Chicago. Surrounded by his wife, daughter and friends, he held an oversized $1 million check and recalled his joy upon playing the ""$3 million Cash Jackpot!"" game, where tickets sell for $30 apiece. ""I scratched the ticket, then I kept saying, 'I hit a million!' over and over again,"" the 46-year-old Khan said, according to a press release from the Illinois Lottery. ""I jumped two feet in the air, then ran back into the store and tipped the clerk $100."" The plan, he explained, was to use the money for his mortgage, paying off bills, a donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and investing more in his dry cleaning businesses. Related: The problems with winning the lottery . ""Winning the lottery means everything to me,"" Khan said. He would have to wait a few weeks to collect his actual winnings, which amounted after taxes to about $425,000. According to CNN affiliate WGN, that check was issued July 19, but Khan never got to spend it. The next night, Khan came home, ate dinner and went to bed, according to an internal police department document obtained by the Chicago Tribune. His family later heard him screaming and took him to a local hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, the paper reported, citing the document. That's where the Cook County medical examiner's office came in, investigating Khan's death because it was ""sudden and unexpected,"" Cina said. At the time, there were no allegations of foul play or evidence of trauma. So, following the office's policy, Khan's body underwent what Cina described as an ""external examination (and) basic toxicology testing,"" neither of which turned up anything abnormal. So the medical examiner ruled that Khan had died of arterial sclerotic cardiovascular disease -- which encompasses incidents like heart attacks, strokes and aortic ruptures -- and that his manner of death was natural, according to Cina. A few days later, a family member approached the doctor who had examined the body ""and said they felt uncomfortable that it was being ruled a natural and they suggested that we look into it further,"" the chief medical examiner said. ""So we did that,"" he added. ""Forensics is not a static field. If new evidence comes to light, we'll revisit cases."" That meant more in-depth toxicology tests. In early September, new screening results came back indicating cyanide in Khan's blood. With that, the official manner of death was changed from natural to pending, Cina said, and Chicago police got involved. In late November, a more detailed blood analysis came back showing ""a lethal level of cyanide,"" and Khan's death became a murder case. Chicago police haven't offered details, including a possible motive, about what they call an ""ongoing investigation."" Talking briefly with CNN affiliate WBBM and the Tribune, Khan's widow described her husband as kind and exemplary. Jimmy Goreel, who runs the 7-Eleven where the winning lottery ticket was sold, offered similarly glowing comments about Khan. ""I would never think that anybody ... would hurt him,"" Goreel told WGN. ""(He was a) nice person, very hopeful and gentle (and) very hardworking.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A national poll suggests that nearly three-quarters of all Americans support the plan to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, even though most respondents said they think the troop movements will lead to an increase in violence in that country.

The poll indicates that 52 percent think the level of violence in Iraqi cities will increase after U.S. troops withdraw, with 32 percent saying things will remain the same and 15 percent saying the level of violence will decrease. If violence does increase, the poll suggests Americans are clear about how to respond: . ""Nearly two-thirds say that the U.S. should not send combat troops back into Iraqi population centers, even if there is a significant increase in the number of violent attacks,"" Holland said. ""Americans seem to believe that once the Iraqis are in charge, it's up to them to solve any future problems."" The war in Iraq remains unpopular, with about one-third of the public supporting U.S. efforts there. The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, with 1,026 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. More than 4,300 Americans have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. The latest deaths happened Monday when four U.S. soldiers serving in Baghdad died of combat-related injuries.

"(CNN) -- Two airplanes came too close to one another while attempting to land at a Detroit airport, a federal official said early Saturday, days after another close incident involving three jets at a Washington, D.C. airport. A Delta flight from Phoenix was coming in to land Friday night at the Detroit Metro Airport as a small regional jet was trying to land, said Elizabeth Cory, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The two planes were separated by approximately two horizontal miles. Standard separation distance is three miles, Cory said, noting that an investigation is under way. CNN first learned of the incident from an alleged passenger who said he could see a regional jet below them from his cabin window. ""Air traffic control was aware that they had a situation where separation was less than they would like,"" Cory said. Both pilots had visual contact with each other and neither plane was at risk of colliding with the other, she added. Friday's incident in Detroit comes a day after federal authorities acknowledged that three U.S. Airways-operated jets at Reagan National Airport came closer than they should have because of an air traffic control ""miscommunication."" Feds investigate 3 planes flying too close at DC-area airport . The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon when air traffic controllers were making adjustments for landing and departing aircraft because of bad weather. The Chautauqua Airlines flight came within 800 vertical feet and .82 nautical miles after takeoff of an arriving aircraft, identified as a Republic Airlines flight, authorities said. The third plane involved was another Republic Airlines flight, which was taking off and came within 2.07 nautical miles and 800 vertical feet of the arriving flight. ""During the switchover of operations, miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1 and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19,"" the Federal Aviation Administration said. ""Tracon,"" or terminal radar approach control, is a reference to a regional radar facility. ""DCA"" is the International Air Transport Association code for Reagan National Airport. ""At no point were the three aircraft on a head-to-head course,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The FAA is investigating and plans to take ""appropriate action to address the miscommunication"" of Tuesday's incident. ""Such near misses and any operational errors are calls to action,"" Rep. John L. Mica, R-Florida, said after the Tuesday incident. ""I'm asking our Aviation Subcommittee staff and FAA to thoroughly review what happened.""

"(CNN) -- Potentially easing a diplomatic standoff with the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday that he'd ordered a partial withdrawal of Russian troops from his country's border area with Ukraine, Merkel's office said. Putin made the comment to Merkel in a phone call about Ukraine, her office said. The Kremlin made no mention of a withdrawal in its description of the call but said the two leaders discussed Ukraine, including ""possibilities for international assistance to restore stability."" Further details about Putin's reported order weren't immediately available. But a withdrawal may ease tensions simmering since Russia annexed Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea this month -- a move that has led to the worst East-West relations since the Cold War. Earlier Monday, Russian media reported that one Russian infantry battalion was being moved from the border area to its base deeper into Russia. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that if reports about Russia removing troops from the border were accurate, ""it would be a welcome preliminary step."" ""We would urge Russia to accelerate this process,"" Psaki said. ""We also continue to urge Russia to engage in a dialogue with the government in Kiev to de-escalate the situation, while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" The news about Russian troops came on the day that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev traveled to Crimea -- the highest-level visit from Moscow since Russia annexed the region -- in part to unveil measures aimed at integrating the peninsula into the Russian economy. Ukrainian and Western officials for weeks have voiced alarm about Russia's reported military buildup on Ukraine's eastern border, which has raised fears that Russian troops would enter the Ukrainian mainland. Russia may have 40,000 troops near its border with eastern Ukraine and another 25,000 inland on alert and prepared to go in, two U.S. officials have told CNN. Moscow has said it had no intention of ordering armed forces to cross over into its neighbor, insisting its troops have been conducting exercises. But Putin has said Russia reserves the right to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine from what he calls threats from Ukrainian nationals -- a reasoning he also used in this month's annexation of Crimea . Putin's conversation with Merkel came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held talks in Paris about ways to defuse the crisis over Ukraine. Kerry told Lavrov that progress depended on a Russian troop pullback from Ukraine's borders but no breakthrough was announced. The West imposed sanctions against some Russian officials because of the Crimea crisis and threatened more if tensions weren't eased. Is Crimea gone? Ukraine: Russian troops 'conducting unclear maneuvers' Amid reports that Russia may have started withdrawing from the border, but before the Merkel announcement, government sources in Kiev told CNN that Russian troops were not backing away but were repositioning their forces farther north. One Ukrainian official said intelligence indicated that Russian troops are ""conducting unclear maneuvers at the Ukrainian border."" Meanwhile, Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass reported Monday that one Russian infantry battalion was being withdrawn from a region bordering Ukraine. That battalion, having finished military exercises, is returning to its base in Russia's Samara region, hundreds of miles away from the border, the outlet reported, citing Russia's Defense Ministry. Details about how many troops are in that battalion weren't immediately available. During a daily briefing Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Evhen Perebyinis said Russia had not told Kiev about the intentions of any military forces in the area. ""At some border districts the troops are withdrawn, in others they approach the border,"" he said. ""We are concerned about this movement of the army."" U.S. official: 'Too soon' to discern Russian intentions . Before Merkel's announcement, a U.S. official said Monday it was too soon to conclude whether Russia was moving its troops away from the Ukraine border. The official was reacting to statements from Ukraine about Russian troop maneuvers. ""We have nothing to back that up one way or the other so far,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Barring any significant withdrawal from the border, the Russians are positioned ""in a way (that) they could conduct a swift movement into Ukraine,"" the official said. Russian Prime Minister in Crimea . Medvedev arrived in Crimea's capital, Simferopol, for talks Monday on social and economic development. ""As a result of entering Russia, not a single citizen of Crimea should lose anything -- they need only to benefit from it,"" Medvedev said in a news conference carried by Russian state television. ""Citizens need to understand that they're citizens of a powerful country."" The Premier met with Crimean officials, including its Prime Minister, the speaker of the regional parliament and mayor of Sevastopol, among others. He said Crimean state salaries and pensions should be raised to Russian levels, as should the pay for military personnel, while compulsory social insurance would be introduced to the region next year. In tense, defiant Ukraine border region, prayers for peace . Economic measures . Unveiling a list of measures for the region, Medvedev also said Moscow would make Crimea a special economic zone. Tax breaks may also be offered to companies, he added, calling for mortgage programs to be introduced to the region and for a review of water supply projects. After visiting a school and children's hospital, Medvedev added that Crimea needed modern medical equipment and reforms in education. He offered to establish a new federal university.

"(CNN) -- One thing's missing from the official version of what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, say some experts and family members: hard evidence. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said the missing plane's journey ended in the southern Indian Ocean, and that the conclusion was based on an analysis of satellite data by a British company and aviation investigation agency. ""We have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived,"" Malaysian Airlines told family members of the missing passengers. The announcement drew howls of grief. But it also provoked skepticism. Hundreds of friends and family members of passengers marched to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing Tuesday to express their anger and frustration. They claimed they weren't being told the truth by the Malaysian government about what happened to the plane after it disappeared from radar on March 8. ""If you find something: OK, we accept,"" said one relative of a passenger. ""But nothing -- just from the data, just from analysis."" 'Something from the seas' ""I suppose I want to see something from the seas,"" said Bimal Sharma, an Indian man whose sister Chandrika was on the plane. ""I don't know why I just want to see some debris off the aircraft and the black box to know what exactly happened because there are too many unanswered questions."" Sharma, who has worked for a long time in the Indian merchant navy, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he had ""sailed those oceans several times myself."" Australian authorities coordinating the search for the plane in a remote area of the Indian Ocean suspended efforts on Tuesday because of stormy weather. Sharma said he hoped the search would continue. ""Just for the relatives to see that there was something -- and it's conclusive evidence,"" he said. Sarah Bajc, whose partner of two years, Philip Wood, was on the passenger jet, said in an e-mailed statement that, without confirmed wreckage, the announcement gave her ""no real closure."" ""I STILL feel his presence, so perhaps it was his soul all along,"" she said of Wood, one of three Americans on the plane. 'Still holding onto hope' The reactions are understandable, said Heidi Snow, the founder of ACCESS, an organization that provides grief support to people affected by or involved in air disasters. ""I think that what we have been hearing is that basically this isn't enough evidence to change the grieving process,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""Some people are still holding on to hope and really need more than these words."" ""They need to see actual parts of the plane and really learn that their loved ones were actually on board by getting some remains back,"" said Snow, who lost her fiancÃ© on TWA Flight 800, which crashed in 1996. ""I am so glad there is some new information coming to them,"" she said of the Malaysian announcement. ""But really, without anything tangible, they are still going back and forth."" Malaysian Acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Tuesday he understood that relatives found it difficult to accept the news without hard evidence. ""Until we can find the debris, and then we can confirm the debris is from MH370, it is very difficult for me to have closure for the families,"" he said. 'Tantalizingly unsatisfying' Aviation experts also expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the information. ""We've been waiting for the shoe to drop for more than two weeks now. And what we got was the most tantalizingly unsatisfying thread of a resolution,"" Jeff Wise, a private pilot and aviation writer, told CNN. CNN Aviation Analyst Miles O'Brien said he wanted to see more information about what was behind Malaysian authorities' announcement. ""There is a saying in science: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" he said. ""Show me. Show me the evidence."" The Chinese government, whose citizens made up about two thirds of the passengers on the plane, says it also wants to know more. ""We called on the Malaysian side to provide further evidence and all the information,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said at a news briefing Tuesday. Portrait of an artist: The Uyghur painter on Flight 370 . 'Nothing is final' An executive from Inmarsat, the British company that carried out the satellite analysis, said the route into the southern Indian Ocean was the ""best fit"" with the pings received from the plane. ""The most likely route is the south, and the most likely ending in roughly the area where they're looking now,"" Chris McLaughlin, a senior vice president at the company, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""But, of course, nothing is final,"" he said. ""We're not earth observation satellites, we're data satellites. So it will require a lot of different skills, a lot of different people, not least the naked eye, to finally confirm what happened to 370."" McLaughlin said the mathematics-based process used by Inmarsat and Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch was ""groundbreaking."" The new calculations underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by Boeing, he said. Arthur Rosenberg, an aviation attorney, said he was troubled by the different language used by the satellite company and Malaysian officials. ""On the one hand, you have the executive from Inmarsat saying 'most likely' and somehow that got booted up to 'beyond reasonable doubt.' I don't agree with that,"" Rosenberg said. ""I am not convinced that they are certain where this airplane is,"" he said. ""I think they have fine-tuned it to a general area, but to say beyond a reasonable doubt this plane went down where they are saying is a stretch."" Malaysia defends announcement . Prime Minister Najib on Tuesday defended the decision to make the announcement, saying it was based on ""the most conclusive information we have."" He told Parliament he didn't want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers -- an accusation Malaysian authorities faced earlier in the investigation into the plane's disappearance. He noted that more answers would only come to light with the discovery of the plane's flight data recorder. ""We cannot verify any theories until the black box is found,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration is proposing to scrap the NSA's bulk collection of all Americans' phone call records. The administration's proposal is eminently sensible. It eliminates the government collecting five years of every Americans' phone records and instead mandates that U.S. phone companies themselves keep those records for only the 18 months that they are required to do so by federal regulations. And most importantly, it proposes that a court order would be necessary to obtain the phone records of individual Americans. This ensures that there is some kind of judicial review before the government can get hold of any American's phone records, rather than leaving this up to the judgment of a small group of anonymous officials at the National Security Agency. The new proposal, first reported in The New York Times, ensures that the NSA is no longer storing vast amounts of data about Americans' calling habits while it still allows the government to access the phone records of terrorism suspects after a judge has reviewed the case. This proposed fix to the system hardly seems onerous. After all, since 1979, judges have only turned down 0.3% of the requests they have received for warrants involving cases of suspected espionage or terrorism. Such a move would, however, assure Americans that there was some sort of due process going on whenever their phone records are examined by the government. This is closer to the spirit of the Fourth Amendment, which guards against ""unreasonable searches,"" than does the present system in which the NSA sucks up vast amounts of phone record information. The Obama administration proposal is particularly welcome in light of a New America Foundation study published in January. The study looked at the government's claims about the role that NSA ""bulk"" surveillance of phone records had in keeping the United States safe from terrorism and found that these claims were overblown. An in-depth analysis was conducted of 225 individuals recruited by al Qaeda or a like-minded group, or inspired by al Qaeda ideology and charged in the United States with an act of terrorism since 9/11. The analysis demonstrated that traditional investigative methods -- such as the use of informants, tips from local communities and targeted intelligence operations -- provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases while the contribution of NSA's bulk surveillance of phone records to these cases was minimal. (Click to go to a database of all these 225 individuals and additional details about them.) So what has been the impact of NSA data collection? The bulk collection of American telephone metadata -- which includes the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls as well as the time of those calls but not their content (under Section 215 of the Patriot Act) -- appeared to have played an identifiable role in, at most, 1.8% of these cases. This finding corroborated that of the Obama-appointed White House review group, which had access to classified materials. That group concluded in December that ""section 215 telephony metadata was not essential to preventing attacks."" Furthermore, our examination of the role of the database of U.S. citizens' telephone metadata in the single plot the government used to justify the importance of the program -- that of Basaaly Moalin, a San Diego cabdriver who in 2007 and 2008 provided $8,500 to Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia -- calls into question the necessity of the Section 215 bulk collection program. According to the government, the database of American phone metadata allows intelligence authorities to quickly circumvent the traditional burden of proof associated with criminal warrants, thus allowing them to ""connect the dots"" faster and prevent 9/11-scale attacks. Yet in the Moalin case, after using the NSA's phone database to link a number in Somalia to Moalin, the FBI waited two months to begin an investigation and wiretap his phone. This finding undercut the government's theory that the NSA database of Americans' telephone metadata was necessary to expedite the investigative process, since it clearly didn't expedite the process in the single case the government used to extol its virtues. The New America Foundation study concluded the surveillance of American phone metadata had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist-related activity, such as fundraising for a terrorist group. That's why the new Obama proposal to end the NSA sucking up of the phone records of Americans going back half a decade is especially welcome.

"(CNN) -- Monkeys taught how to gamble and play video games. People paid to watch grass grow. Swedish massages given to rabbits. Half of $1 million spent on a video game that is now helping terrorists train for missions. And $1 billion spent to destroy $16 billion worth of ammunition. These are just a few examples from the 100 entry-long list in a book detailing government waste, compiled by retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. In the 2014 edition of the ""Wastebook,"" Coburn notes that getting rid of the practice of pork barrel spending is next to impossible. ""What I have learned from these experiences is Washington will never change itself,"" he said. Massages for rabbits . Some of the worst offenses listed in the book: . -- The National Institutes of Health spent $387,000 to give Swedish massages to rabbits with a mechanical machine. Coburn notes that the NIH has a $30 billion annual budget and that the director of the NIH claims an Ebola vaccine would ""probably"" be ready now but for a lack of funding. -- NASA pays Russia $70 million per passenger to send American astronauts to the International Space Station and back. The space agency is spending $3 billion on the ISS this year and will conduct studies, many proposed by elementary students, including one on the ""design and creation of better golf clubs."" -- ""Only someone with too much of someone else's money and not enough accountability for how it was being spent could come up with"" a $10,000 program paying people to watch grass grow. That grass -- saltmarsh cordgrass, which can grow to be 7 feet tall -- was being observed in New Smyrna Beach, Florida as part of a Fish and Wildlife Service program. The National Science Foundation is a favorite target in Coburn's book this year. The foundation spent $171,000 to teach monkeys how to play video games and gamble in order to ""unlock the secrets of free will,"" according to the report. Other examples include $5.2 million for ""voicemails from the future that warn of a post-apocalyptic world,"" $1.97 million for a Facebook page and P.R. for fossil enthusiasts and a $46,000 grant to support the annual Clean Snowmobile Challenge -- a contest to determine who can make the most environmentally friendly snowmobile. The National Science Foundation is also planning on spending $1.5 million to monitor Americans' attendance at science festivals. Another $200,000 will go to a study meant to determine ""why Wikipedia is sexist,"" according to the Wastebook report. The State Department spends $90 million a year on cultural exchange programs, including one such program which sought to dispel a Pakistani journalist's perception that Americans are ""fat, rude, and cold."" It worked. The agencies could not immediately be reached for comment. Expensive destruction . ""The real shock and awe may have been the $1 billion price tag the Pentagon paid to destroy $16 billion worth of ammunition, enough to pay a full years' salary for over 54,000 Army privates,"" said Coburn. The book cites Pentagon officials who said the surplus ammunition has become ""obsolete, unusable, or their use is banned by international treaty."" The book notes a 2014 Government Accountability Office investigation which concluded poor record keeping was the reason the military purchased so much ammunition it didn't need. The Army spent nearly half a million dollars -- $414,000 -- to develop a video game called ""America's Army, "" a version of which terrorists have used to train for missions, according to National Security Agency e-mails sent in 2007 and leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Department of Defense is spending $80 million on a real-life ""Iron Man"" suit. The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) would need 365 pounds worth of batteries to power the suit, according to the ""Wastebook."" Congress ended this fiscal year with a debt under a trillion dollars for the first time since 2008, according to the Wastebook report, but Coburn notes that the deficit still added $486 billion, or half a trillion dollars, to the national debt, which is ""quickly approaching $18 trillion."" Of the entries listed in his book, Coburn, who will retire in 2016 after serving two terms, asks, ""Is each of these a true national priority or could the money have been better spent on a more urgent need or not spent at all in order to reduce the burden of debt being left to be paid off by our children and grandchildren?""","Coburn: Getting rid of the practice of pork barrel is next to impossible .

"Gainesville, Florida (CNN) -- The University of Florida has temporarily suspended its chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity after learning about a hazing incident involving fraternity members, a university spokeswoman said. University President Bernie Machen, in an e-mail to students, called it a ""serious physical hazing incident."" University authorities learned about the incident on Saturday, school spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Tuesday. ""We believe the incident took place several weeks prior,"" she said. ""The hazing incident is currently under investigation with the University of Florida police."" Dave Kratzer, Florida's vice president for student affairs, said, ""This was not a case that we know of that anyone went to the hospital -- thank goodness."" ""It's not in the realm of seriousness on the far end of things, when you think about what could have occurred with hazing, and we want to stop it now,"" Kratzer told CNN. When contacted by CNN, Alpha Phi Alpha referred all questions to the university. Later Wednesday, a statement released by the executive director of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. said it issued a cease-and-desist order against the local chapter and will investigate the incident cited by the university and cooperate with police on any criminal investigation that may occur. ""We recognize that hazing is a persistent social scourge that has proven time and time again to be difficult to eradicate and too dangerous to tolerate,"" the statement said. ""Alpha Phi Alpha does not condone hazing! Alpha Phi Alpha has embraced programs, which provide leadership tools to recognize, prevent and address hazing."" The statement concluded with declarations in capital letters: ""We cannot say this enough: HAZING IS DANGEROUS and ILLEGAL and must STOP! Alpha Phi Alpha has no place in its membership for the violence and brutality that accompanies hazing. HAZING IS ILLEGAL!"" The historically black fraternity dates back to 1906, when it was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. According to its website, Alpha Phi Alpha ""has a zero tolerance level in regards to hazing/pledging and strongly prohibits these illegal activities in any form."" The alleged hazing incident happened off campus, according to Machen's e-mail to students, obtained by CNN. ""As that investigation proceeds, I want to reinforce the university's prohibition against all forms of hazing -- and ask each of you to help us guard against this dangerous and destructive behavior,"" Machen wrote. ""Hazing is specifically prohibited by UF regulations, and it is also classified as a crime in Florida. We cannot tolerate hazing on our campus or in our university community, and anyone found responsible will face the gravest possible consequences, including expulsion and criminal penalties."" Machen did not provide any specifics about the incident, and he urged anyone who has experienced or witnessed any hazing incidents to contact campus police. Kratzer said there had been no previous reports of hazing incidents involving the fraternity. The Florida chapter has only a small organization at the university and no house, he said. An e-mail from the university's Office of Sorority and Fraternity Affairs sent to the university's fraternity and sorority members said Alpha Phi Alpha would be placed ""on interim suspension pending the outcome of a formal hearing."" ""Alpha Phi Alpha has been a strong member of the Florida Greek Community for many years,"" the e-mail stated. ""While we are all disappointed to learn of such allegations, we all need to respectfully allow our Greek Conduct process to take place before making decisions or speculations of the fraternity's responsibility in this matter. We will share information with the community as and when that is appropriate."" The incident comes less than a month after four students at Florida A&M University were arrested after the hazing-related death of the school's drum major in November. Robert Champion's death prompted FAMU's board of trustees to approve a three-part plan to tackle the issue of hazing on campus, including an independent investigation panel. FAMU is located in Tallahassee. The FAMU incident prompted Florida Gov. Rick Scott to order all state universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies in December. Scott also asked all university presidents to remind their students, faculty and staff ""how detrimental hazing can be."" Kratzer said University of Florida authorities have worked for some time to eliminate hazing, and there has been a ""heightened concern"" since the death at FAMU. ""I would like to stress this is not the norm for us, and we want to educate all our students that the world has changed -- don't allow anyone to do this to you,"" he said. However, students at the university said hazing still occurs at fraternities and sororities. ""You know fraternities are still going to do this. It's part of their culture, its imbedded in what they do in their initiation process and it's still wrong,"" said sophomore Jenny Rivero. ""You can't escape it."" Cece Benitez, also a sophomore, said hazing has become a cyclical activity. ""I know a lot of fraternity brothers who would say that why they do it is because it was done to them,"" Benitez said. ""And people who get hazed, for now (it) kind of sucks, but they are going to do it to the ones that come in later on, and I feel that should not be part of the initiation process for becoming a brother or sister.""

"Peach County, Georgia (CNN) -- The strange, twisted metal Erector Set-looking apparatus is known in farming circles as a pivot. It might also be called a life-saver or, at the very least, a farm-saver. Because if you're a farmer and you have a pivot -- a farming word for irrigation system -- then you're probably not feeling the effects of the drought that is now plaguing more than 60% of the U.S. ""We've put in a lot of pivots in the last five years for people that never did have it before,"" said Elton Sharp of Sharp Irrigation Systems in Georgia. ""It hurts us to see their crops burning up because we know that they're losing money."" Sharp says his irrigation business has doubled in the past two years. The summer is supposed to be his slower season, but not recently. Typically, he says, the summer season is busy with repairs, but the past couple of years, his company is doing more installations in places like a soybean field in Marshallville, Georgia. His business is booming. ""We're not normally still behind putting up pivots. We're still putting them in for this year's crop,"" he said. No drought aid for farmers as Congress breaks for summer . More than half of all U.S. counties have been designated disaster zones, the Department of Agriculture reported, blaming excessive heat and a devastating drought that's spread across the Corn Belt and contributed to rising food prices. According to the agency, only 27% of U.S. farmland has irrigation systems. They're expensive, running well over $100,000, depending on the size of the field that needs watering. But it appears to be a necessary investment for farmers struggling to deal with harsh heat and little rain. Betting on the gift of rain from Mother Nature is a lot like rolling the dice. ""Once a crop is growing, during each week, it has specific water requirements,"" said Jim Reid of Reid Brothers Irrigation. ""If those water requirements are not met that week, then the yield is diminished."" Little hope for worsening drought in U.S. Plains . Reid's crews are working six days a week, almost 12 hours a day, to install and repair watering systems for farmers. On this day, he and his crew are working on a cotton field, connecting a new well to irrigation pivots on the other end of a cotton field. The farm's surface water is drying up, so Ron Everidge needed a well drilled to help guarantee a return for his money on his cotton. ""It's a debt to me, but it's a benefit to me to have a commodity to sell,"" he said. ""This is my insurance."" Nearby, at Lane Southern Orchards in Fort Valley, peaches are nearing the end of their harvest -- and what growers say has been a great year. They're getting paid almost 50% more for their fruit this year. ""These peaches are really full of sugar 'cause of the lack of rain, the lack of water,"" orchard owner Duke Lane said. ""You can taste the difference."" But even these peaches couldn't count on rain. Lane's orchard has irrigation on about 70% of its land. ""Everybody is realizing that water enables us to have a better number at the end of the season,"" Lane said. The drought, they say, has resulted in a smaller, sweeter peach that will allow Georgia to live up to its nickname as the Peach State. Too much water and rain can hurt the fruit, because it promotes rot. This year, there was little worry about that.

"(CNN) -- Renee Zellweger looks different than she did 10 years ago. Big deal—who doesn't? Maybe she had plastic surgery. Maybe a little lipo, too. Or maybe her new look, at 45, is truly courtesy of her living a healthier, happier life away from the constant media glare, as she reportedly told People Magazine. Considering how mean-spirited some of the response has been since Zellweger showed up at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards much slimmer than we remembered, who could question the effect time away from the vitriol can have on a person? Kelly Wallace: Why so quick to pick apart Zellweger's looks? Zellweger only spoke with People after the huge fuss the media made about that Elle event, she said, because ""the folks who come digging around for some nefarious truth which doesn't exist won't get off my porch until I answer the door."" I would think the real headline is ""Public dissatisfied about Renee Zellweger's happiness."" Because that's all she talked about: being happy. At peace. The face and body we associated with her for all these years was, in her words, a byproduct of having ""a schedule that is not realistically sustainable and didn't allow for taking care of myself."" Makes sense to me. I can't tell you how many former NFL players I have come across who look nothing like the men I saw on the field—significant weight loss, clean-shaven, hell, just being clean for a change. And dare I say healthier. It is possible for people to change without going under the knife. And it is possible to be happy in your own skin, even if you do opt for plastic surgery. More than 15 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2013. I think it's safe to assume not all—if any—were done on Zellweger. In fact, it's downright hypocritical for anyone in a country that has been known to spend $1.4 billion a year on over-the-counter teeth-whitening products to get bent out of shape if someone does change his or her appearance. Face it, we're all nipping and tucking in our way. Our sense of what is beautiful has been redefined by a diet of Photoshopped images -- and 45-year-old actresses who feel they must nip and tuck and not look their age in order to be cast. Those who dare to not join in may be called ""less classically beautiful"" in the eyes of The New York Times, who tried to pin such a slight on Viola Davis, the star of ""How To Get Away With Murder."" I was reminded of the slight in the show's most recent episode as Davis' character removed her wig, fake eyelashes, and makeup on camera. There she was completely untouched for the world to see. And the fact that doing so is considered ""brave"" says more about our culture's warped sensibilities than Davis' beauty. Of course, the backlash over Zellweger's new look has little if anything to do with her. For some reason, we want her to answer for something that at the end of the day is none of our business. We want to know why her face appears different, why her signature puffy cheeks are gone. Unfortunately, that she says she is now happy and taking care of herself does not resonate. We apparently want her to say she had plastic surgery. Tell me: Who's the superficial one here?","LZ: Many buzzed that Renee Zellweger looked different when she appeared at Elle event .

"(CNN) -- The Indian city of Mumbai exploded into chaos early Thursday morning as gunmen launched a series of attacks across the country's commercial capital, killing scores of people and taking hostages in two luxury hotels frequented by Westerners. Deepak Chopra says extremists could be reacting to Barack Obama's gestures toward Muslims. CNN's Larry King spoke with author Deepak Chopra about the situation. Larry King: Let's go to Dr. Deepak Chopra, the physician, philosopher. His new book is ""Jesus: A Story of Enlightenment."" Where were you born in India, Deepak? Deepak Chopra: I was born in Delhi, but I have been in these hotels many, many times. I have stayed there, so I know the scene; I know the restaurants. I have been trying to get in touch with my friends and relatives, some of whom I have spoken to, some of whom I can't speak to. The lines are jammed. We're texting each other. A friend of mine from Egypt was in the restaurant at the Taj hotel when the firing started, and somehow she managed to avoid the fray, hid in a basement and is now holed up in a room which is right next to the Taj hotel and is waiting to be told what to do. The situation is complex, Larry, because it could inflame to proportions that we cannot even imagine. It has to be contained. We now recognize that this is a global problem, with only a global effort can solve this. And you know, one of the things that I think is happening is that these militant terrorist groups are actually terrified that [President-elect Barack] Obama's gestures to the rest of the Muslim world may actually overturn the tables on them by alienating them from the rest of the Muslim world, so they're reacting to this. You know, this is Obama's opportunity to actually harness the help of the Muslims. You know, there's 1.8 billion Muslims in the world. That's 25 percent of the population of the world. It's the fastest-growing religion in the world. We cannot, if we do not appease and actually recruit the help of this Muslim world, we're going to have a problem on our hands. And we cannot go after the wrong people, as we did after 9/11, because then the whole collateral damage that occurs actually aggravates the situation. In India, this is particularly inflammatory, because there's a rise of Hindu fundamentalism. We saw what that did in Gujarat, where, you know, Muslims were scorched and they were killed, and there was almost a genocide of the Muslims. India has 150 million Muslims. That's more Muslims in India than in Pakistan. So this is an opportunity right now for India and Pakistan to recognize this is their common problem. It's not a Muslim problem right now; it's a global problem. ... King: Do you think that this is just the beginning, that there's a potential impact, or more? Chopra: There is a potential impact of a lot more carnage. But it can be contained. And right now, one of the questions, you know, after I heard Barbara Starr talking about how coordinated this is, that there are militant groups that cross international boundaries, is who is financing this? Where is the money coming from? We have to ask very serious, honest questions. What role do we have in this? Are our petrodollars funding both sides of this war on terrorism? Why are we not asking the Saudis where that money is going that we give them? Is it going through this supply chain to Pakistan? It's not enough for Pakistan to condemn it. Pakistan should cooperate with India in uprooting this. They should be part of the surgery that is going to happen. It's not enough for Indians to blame Pakistanis. Indians should actually ask the Pakistanis to help them. And it's not enough for us to worry about Westerners being killed and Americans being killed. Every life is precious over there. We have got to get rid of this idea that this is an American problem or a Western problem. It's a global problem, and we need a global solution, and we need the help of all the Muslims, 25 percent of the world's population, to help us uproot this problem. King: What does India immediately do? Chopra: India at this moment has to contain any reactive violence from the fundamentalist Hindus, which is very likely and possible. So India has to condemn that by not blaming local Muslims. They have to identify the exact groups. And the world has to be very careful that they don't go after the wrong people. Because if you go after the wrong people, you convert moderates into extremists. It happens every time, and retribution against innocent people just because they have the same religion actually aggravates and perpetuates the problem. King: Are you pessimistic? Chopra: I think Mr. Obama has a real opportunity here, but a challenging opportunity, a creative opportunity. Get rid of the phrase ""war on terrorism."" Ask for a creative solution in which we all participate. King: Is it because the war on terrorism really can never be won because the terrorists (inaudible)? Chopra: Because it's an oxymoron. It's an oxymoron, Larry, a war on war, a war on terrorism. You know, terrorists call mechanized death from 35,000 feet above sea level with a press of a button also terror. We don't call it that, because our soldiers are wearing uniforms. They don't see what is happening, and innocent people are being killed. So, you know, terror is a term that you apply to the other. King: Thanks, Deepak Chopra, as always, extraordinarily enlightening.","""This is a global problem,"" author Deepak Chopra says .
Barack Obama must use chance to get Muslims' help, he says .
Officials must not go after the wrong people, Chopra says ."
"(CNN) -- Chadwick Boseman has every reason to feel good as ""Get On Up"" opens in theaters. Reviews are strong for the Tate Taylor-directed James Brown biopic as a whole, but critics have been particularly pleased with Boseman, who's managed to transform himself into the late Godfather of Soul. ""Whatever else one may fault about 'Get On Up,' one thing that's faultless is its star, Chadwick Boseman, who plays Brown from age 16 to 60 with a dexterity and invention worthy of his subject,"" praised Variety. Entertainment Weekly, which thought ""Get On Up's"" PG-13 take is too sanitized, was quick to add that ""the best thing the movie has going for it is Chadwick Boseman's live-wire channeling of Brown."" Such words are likely comforting for Boseman, who, after portraying baseball icon Jackie Robinson in 2013's ""42,"" was hesitant to take on another biopic, let alone one for a man as seminal as James Brown. ""When I first saw the script, I was like, I'm not even going to open it up and read it. There's no way I'm playing James Brown,"" he told the ""Today"" show, adding that he knew the work it would take to accurately portray The Hardest Working Man in Show Business. The CNN 10: Chadwick Boseman, and nine more ""Fresh Faces"" ""I had to do a lot of soul-searching before I took it on,"" Boseman admitted to EW. ""Because to me, nobody should be playing James Brown."" According to The Hollywood Reporter, director Taylor, who had another summer hit in 2011 with ""The Help,"" spent two months convincing 32-year-old Boseman to take the part. ""I realized that first and foremost, I had to find a brilliant actor,"" Taylor told THR. ""It's easy to gravitate toward the costumes and the dancing, but I just realized that somebody was going to have to play a 63-year-old, and that's what I had him read for. So I just searched for an actor with skill, and Chadwick was the guy."" To a certain extent, telling Brown's story wasn't dissimilar to telling Jackie Robinson's. In both instances, Boseman had to put in hours to effectively portray game-changing talent. Those dance moves you've seen him do in the ""Get On Up"" trailers? The result of five-hour practice sessions five days a week, not to mention what he put in during his downtime. ""I was obsessed with it,"" Boseman told ""Today."" The effort appears to have paid off as ""Get On Up"" opens Friday, and some are already eyeing Oscar season. ""As much as I hate using the O word seven months before the Academy Awards,"" said Time magazine critic Richard Corliss, who credited Boseman with ""carrying and lifting 'Get On Up' to its most impressive heights,"" ""I'm obliged to predict an aisle seat for Boseman on Oscar night.""","Chadwick Boseman portrays James Brown in the biopic ""Get On Up""

"(CNN) -- Police in Tucson, Arizona, arrested 16 people Saturday night after rowdy crowds threw bottles, beer cans and firecrackers at officers following the Wildcats' overtime loss to Wisconsin. Wisconsin beat Arizona 64-63 on Saturday night and earned a spot in the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Arizona was the No. 1 seed in the West Region and Wisconsin the No. 2 seed. About 20 minutes after the game ended, several hundred people blocked a road on the University of Arizona campus, said Sgt. Pete Dugan. When they refused officers' orders to disperse and began lobbing objects, police used pepper balls and canisters, Dugan said. Police reported some damage to property. Those arrested were charged with resisting arrest, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. The Arizona-Wisconsin game was the second of two games Saturday in the NCAA tournament. In the first game Saturday, Florida defeated Dayton 62-52 in the South Region to earn a Final Four berth. The Final Four games will be played Saturday, April 5.

"(CNN) -- The increasingly slapstick global steeplechase in pursuit of Edward Snowden, the former American contractor who leaked top-secret details of surveillance programs, looks like a cross between ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""The Bonfire of the Vanities."" Nobody, except perhaps Snowden himself, is coming out of this well. While the CIA's Public Enemy Number One plays Captain Marko Ramius, keeping stumm beneath the (radio) waves in the Moscow transit zone, Very Important People are making themselves ridiculous in vintage Tom Wolfe style. High on the list is John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State. Huffing and puffing, Kerry warned China and Russia of ""consequences"" if, as seems probable, they have conspired to deliberately thwart U.S. justice by twisting the long arm of the law. Like too many American politicians, Kerry seems to believe ""the law"" is what the White House counsel and U.S. Justice Department deem it to be on any given day, and that this made-in-America ""law"" applies inexorably to every country and every corner of the world. Wrong, John. It's like invading somebody else's country without a U.N. Security Council resolution, or entering a home without a warrant. Not advisable, unless you relish hand-to-hand combat and endless sarcasm. Quite what Kerry's ""consequences"" may be is not specified -- but the idea sounds arrogant to foreign ears. Perhaps the U.S. will retaliate by ordering the secret hacking of Chinese government data banks? Wait a minute. Hasn't that been done already? To Asian eyes, Snowden is a new, more useful kind of Quiet American. Having picked his brains or pockets or both, Hong Kong happily let him go. Russia says it feels ""threatened"" by U.S. criticism. This is as close as Sergei Lavrov, Moscow's dour foreign minister, has ever got to making a joke. If Putin and pals can stiff Obama on Syria and Iran, they can certainly ""lift"" a tale-teller and endure a cyber-tiff or two. These are tears of laughter, not pain. Crowing Chinese comments about how the heroic Snowden has ""torn off Washington's sanctimonious mask"" give a clue to what is going on here. So, too, does the uppity behavior of tiny Ecuador and Iceland. If these international minnows dare challenge the pomp and majesty of Imperial America, how stands the Empire now, Caesar? Fraying at the edges, is the answer. Admit it. For Obama et al, it's a ""pants-down"" day. L'affaire Snowden has provided a glorious field day for all those ""surrender monkey Commie pinko crypto-Marxist long-haired G8-loathing eco-friendly global-warming anti-free market anti-capitalist anti-McDonald's (anti-stereotype)"" anti-Americans who just love to hate the ""Land of the Free."" It's surprising how many of them there are these days. Perhaps it has something to do with Guantanamo. For sure, the Beijing Politburo has no problem with detaining people indefinitely without charge. After all, they've been doing it for years. But it comes hard from a global superpower that is constantly lecturing China and everybody else about the inviolability of human rights. Perhaps it's a Bradley Manning thing. There's a lot of sympathy out there for the pint-sized soldier who dared to share the State Department's incredibly tedious cables, then got treated worse than a mass murderer. Every country has its own experience of U.S. bullying. In Britain, the case of Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon, accused by the U.S. of the ""biggest military computer hack of all time"", became a cause celebre. In the end even Britain's sycophantic Cameron government was obliged, by force of public opinion, to throw out the U.S. extradition demand. Where could Snowden go next? Perhaps it's the way the U.S. ignores its friends' environmental and resource concerns. Perhaps people in the global village are growing less tolerant of a domineering, one-size-fits-all philistine culture. Iran has a pithy catchphrase for it. It calls America the ""Global Arrogance."" Or perhaps it's a ""white man's burden"" thing. That's the phrase the British used to morally justify their empire-building. They were doing good, or so they told themselves, annexing all those countries and subjugating their peoples. Geopolitically speaking, Washington took over where London left off, post 1945. Except the US equivalent phrase is ""right man's burden"". That is to say, we (that's the imperial Washington 'we') are (always) right, and you (lesser mortals, sadly benighted) are (always) wrong. The world watched this attitude play out in Afghanistan and Iraq (intervention to make America's streets safe) and now in Syria (non-intervention to make America's streets safe). Pity all those displaced and terrorised Middle Easterners, but hey, we fixed Osama didn't we? Strange that sense of triumph over the killing of the 9/11 mastermind was not universally shared. Extra-judicial assassination, drones, killer robots, extraordinary rendition, black ops, wet ops, psy-ops, silly ops... The world is a bit tired of all this American posturing, grandstanding, and self-serving banditry. So now it's cyber-ops, but wholly unofficial, courtesy Mr E. Snowden. It would hard to accept it is real, if you didn't suspect it was virtual. Rather than decry it, many applaud it. The White House is furious at the non-cooperation it has received. But has it occurred to them that maybe not just the Russians and the Chinese, but those soft, liberal Europeans and all the other neutrals also don't like the idea of being spied on by an out-of-control transnational agency beyond the reach of the law, any law, anywhere? Obama and Kerry can talk about security until they lose signal. Right now, the rest of the world is talking sovereignty, privacy and individual rights. And enjoying the moment when the big guy takes a fall. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Tisdall.","NSA leaker Edward Snowden has hidden in Hong Kong and Moscow airport .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the creatures most likely to be spotted swimming down London's River Thames, hippos will be far down the list. Until now. Thanks to Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, eagle-eyed visitors to London might just spot the three humps of an enormous hippo appearing from the Thames' murky depths. Hofman is known for his super-sized, colorful works of art, most recently the enormous inflatable rubber duck that floated around the waters of cities like Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Auckland and Osaka. Earlier this year, Hofman was asked to create a piece of artwork by the organizers of Totally Thames, an annual festival that celebrates London's famous river. He says he started by researching the history of the river, and eventually came across studies on hippo evolution that revealed its waters were awash with the large creatures hundreds of thousands of years ago. The result was an artwork he's christened with a pun almost as heavy as one of the beasts he's been studying: ""HippopoThames."" ""I wanted to use the hippo to get people out of their homes, away from the Internet and the TV, and to explore London with a new perspective."" Not that creating a giant replica of an ungainly water mammal in one of the UK's busiest waterways is an easy business. Cocktail of ingredients . ""I was thinking about the history, but I also had to think about practicalities,"" Hofman says. ""We needed to make sure it could fit under various bridges as it had to be towed into place, so it's a cocktail of ingredients: the history of London, cost and the size of the space available."" Like several of Hofman's other pieces, ""HippopoThames"" was inspired by everyday objects -- in this case a children's book that the artist's parents gave him for their grandchild. ""One page had an illustration of a hippo and I saw it and thought that it could work really well. So the installation is something which is partly inspired by a found object,"" he says. It's a process Hofman has used in the past, chiefly the enormous cuddly toys that formed his 2009 exhibition at The Hague and the ornament-like sparrow statues he created for Belgium's Rock Werchter music festival. ""'These pieces were inspired by children's toys or items picked up from flea markets I've visited -- mass-produced toys and animal ceramics,"" he says. ""It's not just about the animal -- it's about the outer skin. I'm all about beauty and the design of an object and I like to use and change these found objects by giving them different skins. ""I love the fact that so many of them are made in China and Taiwan. ""They're sent to the U.S. and Europe and they're in the hands of children for just a few minutes. I have a love for these objects and the way they get circulated around the world."" Settting is also key. ""I have a love of beautiful places -- both urban and rural, and I like to show them in their natural state,"" the artist explains. Giant yellow bunny . Hofman claims an enormous yellow bunny he installed in the town of Orebro, Sweden, helped highlight a largely forgotten statue it was sited next to. ""The bunny was removed after three months but afterward, more people started to visit the spot. That's the B-side of my installations: they give the public space back to the people who then see it with a new perspective."" Hofman's work has taken him all over the world and certain destinations have left their mark. ""I love Sao Paulo,"" he says. ""I love the people. ""Every morning you wake up and you meet people who become your friends. ""It's a concrete jungle where, as a human, you're downsized, but I like the strength and the love of the people and the way they live together."" The West African country of Senegal also makes his list of favorites, as does the Swiss town of Bern, largely because of the way residents interact with its river in the summer. ""It's the biggest artwork you can make - it's a social, natural thing and it changes people's perspective of the city."" Different nationalities react to his work in different ways, he says. ""In Europe, the first question will be about the cost. In Asia and South America people will ask, 'what is it and why is it there?'"" No more ducks . ""In Asia, people work six or seven days a week, perhaps two jobs a day. They'll have Sundays off and they make the most of their spare time. ""In those rare moments they enjoy life to the max and are more open to certain things. ""If people have less spare time they feel they should make full use of it. ""In Europe, people work hard but they have more spare time and there's a different pace. People tend to be more spoiled."" Florentjin's own spare time on the sidelines of the London festival is likely to spent in one of the city's pubs, he says. ""I love the pub life in London, as well as the parks. If you step into any pub, people will talk to you. ""It's quite open, and they have a wonderful sense of humor -- you can have a great evening socializing."" Hofman says ""HippopoThames"" will be his final water-based project. It appears that the popularity of his most recent project was a double-edged sword. ""After the rubber duck it was hard to come up with another water-related installation,"" he says. ""People just want another duck!"" Tamara Hinson is a freelance travel writer based in the UK.","Artist Florentijn Hofman's latest work is part of a festival celebrating London's River Thames .

"(CNN) -- For his 2010 book ""A New American Picture,"" artist Doug Rickard used photos he gathered from Google Street View to give viewers a voyeuristic peek into several of America's most economically distressed neighborhoods. The point was to draw people's attention to the places we read about in the news — and comment about from the comfort of our own neighborhoods — but never actually visit. Now, Rickard is following that work up with a new book called ""N.A.,"" where he continues to mine the Internet for views of America that are anything but idyllic. This time, he snatches frame grabs from videos that were made on cell phones and uploaded to YouTube. What he ended up with is a jumble of violence, exploitation, joy rides, drugs and other illegal activities. It is a view of a country struggling with a shifting economic and cultural landscape, one where technology can create or amplify crisis and where cyberbullying, revenge porn and ""slut shaming"" have gone viral. ""The range of search terms for the work was huge but largely tied to the broken elements of the American economic spectrum,"" Rickard said. ""The search terms really started with simple city names and evolved. ""I started finding that due to the nature of YouTube, much of what was posted was predatory in nature and I needed to evolve the work to include that dynamic of the 'predatory act.' I determined quickly that 'crackheads' or 'girls passed out' or 'hood fight' were search terms on YouTube that would bring up massive amounts of content that people were uploading."" Abusive behavior exploited by technology is not a new story, but Rickard becomes a predator among the predators, hunting for images to tell this dark American tale. He said he also used keywords such as ""police harassment,"" ""racial profiling"" and ""gang stalking"" to amass his images. The book is not a photojournalistic document — the lack of captions and context asks us to create our own narratives. The printed text in the book includes a poem created using comments from YouTube. And the low resolution of the frame grabs mostly protects the identities of the subjects and gives the visceral imagery an impressionistic gloss. Rickard acknowledged that the images show ""elements of social media and technology that aren't pretty,"" but he said the series is also about YouTube as medium and the way it has become ""a platform where people have a voice — it is an immediate stage with reach."" He said the intimacy of the medium coming right from someone's hand fascinates him. This point of view simply wouldn't be available to a photographer on the scene. ""I was the stranger in the car, a fly on the wall,"" Rickard said. ""They didn't know I was with them that night."" He was a silent partner in the flow of data streams that thrive on predatory behavior — both the participants who exploit the vulnerable, and the viewers who encourage them with comments and ""likes."" ""Usually the YouTube posters were looking to get 'hits' or 'likes' from the uploads and trying to get laughs,"" he said. ""In many ways, that dynamic was bringing out acts that were incredibly callous, such as paying people on the street to do pushups or cartwheels or showing the writing of the word 'fag' on the face of a young girl that was passed out. I wanted to try and get at this dynamic itself."" Rickard found that the streams that were most voluminous tended to be brutal, as though the technology itself was encouraging impulsive and dangerous behavior. He said ""N.A."" is about our habits surrounding modern technology, but that it also comments on race and poverty. For poverty-stricken African-Americans isolated in deteriorating neighborhoods, the American dream may be an impossibility — the ""N.A."" could stand for ""not applicable"" or perhaps ""need not apply."" ""'N.A.' speaks to an inversion of the American dream, an American facade, an American illusion,"" Rickard said. He said there is ""a chasm that has been built like a fortress as relates to opportunity ... a deep division — economic, geographic, cultural, political — in America that many whites prefer to deny and ignore."" Rickard hopes the book will be a wake-up call on issues of race, economic injustice and technology, saying, ""It is this America that I see in my mind, not the land of the free.""","For his latest book, Doug Rickard snatches frames from uploaded cell phone videos .

"(CNN) -- Politician, human rights campaigner and longest-serving first lady; Eleanor Roosevelt was a force to be reckoned with. Initially famous for her marriage to her fifth cousin once removed -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who served four terms in office -- Eleanor showed she was different to many other first ladies of the era. Not content simply to accompany her powerful spouse at events, Eleanor held her own press conferences, spoke at national conventions and remained active in politics even after her husband's death. Her achievements include serving as the first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights and chairing John F. Kennedy's Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. A new documentary of seven episodes by Ken Burns, which aired on PBS stations in the U.S. in September, focuses on three members of the Roosevelt family; Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor. The series, called 'The Roosevelts: An intimate history,' started airing in the UK on Sunday October 19 and can be seen on the next six Sundays on PBS America (Sky 534 and Virgin 243.)

"(CNN) -- Big in Japan. It's a phenomenon well known to generations of rock bands, elevated from relative obscurity at home to apparent god-like status in the Land of the Rising Sun. Met at the airport by screaming fans, groups struggling to get in their own charts get an unexpected -- and often career-reviving -- taste of Beatlemania, Orient-style. This weekend, it's going international -- ""Live at the Budokan"" on tour, in Longchamp. Thousands of enthusiastic Japanese will invade Paris for an event that some say has become the crowning jewel in a new national obsession. It's not pop music, but horse racing -- a sport that has emerged from a murky association with underworld gambling to become an aspirational pastime for a younger generation of Japanese racegoers and a rival to the likes of baseball and football. ""Many years ago, horse racing had a kind of bad reputation but there has been a big change in perception among Japanese citizens,"" Fumitaka Tsuruoka, the Paris representative for the Japan Racing Association, told CNN. ""It is true that horse racing still offers betting but it is loved by many people as a sport, which they could be enthusiastic about."" A party of some 5,000 horse-racing-mad fans is traveling to the French capital to see if their nation can finally end its hoodoo in one of the sport's premier events -- the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The passion and desire to win European racing's richest prize -- with a purse of â‚¬4 million ($5.4 million) -- is almost verging on an obsession, but it is an obsession with good reason. Japan has come agonizingly close to winning the big prize at Longchamp on numerous occasions. The most recent attempt was Orfevre, who last year had been a frontrunner only to be upstaged by the unfancied Solemia. One of Japan's most famous horses, Deep Impact, was backed at 1-2 to win in 2006 only to falter rather dramatically, while three years later El Condor Pasa had boasted a lead of five lengths but was beaten on the line by Montjeu. L'Arc is effectively the jewel missing in the crown of Japanese racing, the likes of the Dubai World Cup and Melbourne Cup already conquered long ago, and it is an event that will be watched on television by some 30 million people in Japan alone, nearly a quarter of its entire population. Tsuruoka, however, insists his nation's love of the race is ""not an obsession."" ""It's just it is the most famous and desirable overseas race in my country and a lot of Japanese people and the horse connections have a great ambition to win the race,"" he said. ""The Japanese have made a lot of efforts to catch up with European and American racehorses for more than 50 years since the first overseas challenge in 1958, and one of the goals is to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. We are almost there."" Japan, as has been the custom in recent years, can aspire to victory this year. Last month, Orfevre won the Prix Foy at Longchamp for a second successive year and and is top of many bookmakers' odds lists for Sunday. Fellow contender Kizuna, sired by Deep Impact, triumphed over in another Group Two race, the Prix Niel on the Arc distance of one-and-a-half miles at the same venue. For the Japanese punters, backing their own horses is a source of nationalistic pride. They betted so heavily on Deep Impact that the seven-time Japanese Grade One winner was an overwhelming favorite at the 2006 Arc. ""I heard they had bets of about â‚¬500 each on Deep Impact and, had it won, the story goes they wouldn't have even cashed it in as they wanted to keep the memento,"" says Ed Dunlop, who has enjoyed more success than most as a foreign trainer on Japanese soil. The Briton is best known for Snow Fairy, which in 2010 and 2011 enjoyed back-to-back victories in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup in Kyoto, and his family has long been interlinked with Japan -- his father John was among the first foreign trainers to be invited over. Dunlop says the obsession with horse racing in Japan is not solely the reserve of the Arc, with passion as fervent -- in fact, even more so -- for its domestic races. ""It's enormous compared to what we're used to,"" he explains. ""Horses have huge followings and jockeys too. You'll see posters of them out there, which you'd never see in the UK for a second. At the Japan Cup (the biggest race on the calendar), there's 100,000 people there. The atmosphere is like nothing I've heard before. The noise is genuinely unbelievable."" It is a sentiment echoed by jockey Ryan Moore, winner of this year's English Derby on Ruler of the World, who likened it to another sport. ""It's the one time when it feels like you're inside a football stadium,"" he says. ""There's just a crazy amount of shouting. It seems like it's like that every day on the track. ""When you get off the plane and the bus, you have people trying to get pictures, sign autographs, books and stuff like that. It's stranger when it's like half past 10 at night. Japanese jockeys are used to it as they get it a lot."" The perception of horse racing in Japan has changed, pushed by the sport's national ruling body the JRA. In the past, it was seen to be the domain of the Yakuza, controlled by organized crime syndicates. The change in perception has led to a much younger racegoing public in Japan than generally seen in Europe or the United States, for example. Jane George, a director of the International Racing Bureau which looks after the Japan Cup on behalf of the JRA, describes those fans as ""producing an atmosphere like I've never seen before."" ""As the starter goes up in a lift to his starting position, there's chanting and everyone hits their racing cards together,"" she says. ""You can't help but get goosebumps from it."" Race meetings are incomparable to Europe. Only taking place on Saturdays and Sundays, as opposed to week-long schedules in many countries, the racing starts as early as 10.30 in the morning. The card usually consists of 10 races, with a break in the middle and usually a jumps race amid the array of flat racing on show. And such is its popularity, fans will camp out the night before to get tickets for the day's action. All of it is run centrally by the JRA, with a stipulation that each trainer can oversee just 30 horses each. Increasingly, the caliber of horses is on the rise, with the Yoshida family in particular leading the way in buying the top horses across the globe -- starting in 1990 with American colt Sunday Silence, which sired Deep Impact among others. ""Over the past 20 years, they've been buying English Derby winners and they've now got some of the finest bloodstock in the world,"" Dunlop says. ""They've got very good horses and they're becoming increasingly hard to beat. As a result, it's very hard to win there."" The lure of Japan to trainers like Dunlop is obvious, with the pots on offer usually enormous. ""You can only race there if you're invited over by the JRA and they pay for all your expenses to get there and while you're over there,"" he says. It is similar for jockeys too, and Moore is more familiar than most with the machinations of the Japanese horse-racing world, having first ridden there in 2006. ""You get 5% of the racing purse, which is generally half of what you'd get in Europe, but the prize money is so much higher,"" he says. ""It's probably the best-run horse racing in the world. You never see any horses that are non-runners, no-one's overweight and there's never any hiccups. ""You can only ride there for three months at a time and only six foreign jockeys can be there at any one time. The standard of horses is as good as anywhere in the world. ""But being there is a very difficult culture. It's about as alien from us as a culture as you can get. Everyone's very helpful and the language isn't an issue as you have an interpreter with you the whole time. Sometimes it can be quite lonely out there as there's not too many people speaking English. But the standard of racing is top class."" While Moore and his foreign peers can expect to be mobbed there, it is nothing in comparison to Japan's own riders -- in particular Yutaka Take, who will ride Kizuna on Sunday. His first Arc ride was on board White Muzzle in 1994, when the general consensus was that he did not have a good ride and finished sixth. He was then second on Deep Impact in 2006 when again he should well have won and was also third on Sagacity in 2001. Tsuruoka says the 44-year-old ""is akin to a David Beckham in Japan,"" such is the adulation, adding that ""he has been quite big in contributing to the development of horse racing in Japan over the past 25 years."" Should Take win on Kizuna, it would be doubly poignant. The horse's name literally translates as ""ties"" or ""bond,"" and he was named in the wake of the 2011 tsunami by owner Shinji Maeda -- the colt in turn has become an equine hope for the nation. After his most recent win on Kizuna, Take said: ""I really appreciate being able to ride a horse with a name that carries so much emotional power and also because of the reason why he was called Kizuna. It gives me great pride to be given this responsibility."" Should Japan's most celebrated jockey win riding a horse with arguably the most emotional baggage in memory of the 18,000 people that lost their lives, it will be the ultimate way for the nation to celebrate breaking its duck in Paris.","Japan bid to end their Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe hoodoo at Sunday's big race .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five U.S. service members were killed when a helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan, a U.S. official said early Tuesday. The chopper went down Monday in the Daman district of southern Kandahar during a rain storm, said Jawid Faisal, a government spokesman for the province. There was no enemy activity in the area at the time of the incident, according to a statement by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, did not offer additional information about the victims. It was the first coalition helicopter crash with fatalities since September, when two separate crashes killed a total of 11 coalition service members. One occurred in early September, killing two; the other in the third week, killing seven service members and injuring two more. There were no reports of enemy fire in either of those incidents. There have been 18 coalition deaths in 2013, including two U.S. service members who were killed Monday by an assailant wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform. The deaths come just after newly installed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited Afghanistan on his first overseas trip since his confirmation and as coalition members draw down their forces in the nation where war has been ongoing since 2001. In August 2011, a helicopter went down killing at least 30 U.S. service members, the single deadliest loss for U.S. troops in the Afghan war. Insurgents shot down the CH-47 Chinook, which was carrying 25 U.S. special operations forces. Some the those who died belonged to the same covert unit that conducted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, though they were not the same men, a military official said at the time. 3 killed when Navy plane crashes .

"(CNN) -- Muslims are a very diverse people. Although they share timeless universals that weave them together into a common fabric, it would be dishonest to paint them with a broad brush. A sophisticated and elegant civilization built over fourteen centuries stretching from Spain to China, it was brought to its knees in a crescendo of upheaval during the 30-year period between the two world wars. The stabilizing institutions native to Islamic society would never recover -- imported, European-style nationalist ideologies would seal their fate. Amid this severe instability, no new post-industrial revolution thought could flourish and no space would be allowed for the intellectual framing of a contemporary yet ""rooted"" identity. Making sense of the scattered pieces that remain would be a daunting task for even the best hearts and minds, let alone those who find themselves in the unenviable position of representing Muslim communities across the continents they span. So it is with a great deal of deference to contributions and sacrifices offered up at precious price that I proceed to suggest that we have a problem. There is a vacuity in our leadership vision and the time has come for a change in course. Community leaders both East and West have been unable to articulate a clear direction for Muslims that illustrates a positive, authentic identity that is engaged as a participant in global society. For 10 years now, the discourse of Muslim religious leadership has been limited to a single mantra. We continue to be reminded what Islam and Muslims are not. Not extreme, not violent. We seem to be constantly trying to convince our fellow non-Muslim citizens and neighbors that Muslims are no different than them -- nothing unique, nothing authentic, nothing remarkable. Will the time ever arrive to talk about what Islam is and Muslims are, as opposed to only what they are not? Can we not talk about what unique and authentic contributions Muslims can bring to the global table? There are many Muslims throughout the world who would love to express how they, too, in their own unique way, are earning their keep in our great cosmopolitan societies. Can we know how Islam informs and inspires these contributions? Current discourse from Muslim leaders appears to acquiesce to the faulty premise that extreme and violent tendencies are rampant among the mainstream Muslim population. While it is true that a minority fringe of individuals have allowed their political and human rights frustrations to carry them beyond the pale of Islam's normative teachings -- violating the very principles of the religion they invoke -- in so doing, their acts of terrorism cannot justifiably be branded ""Islamic."" What they are, then, is criminal. Criminal in international law, criminal in Shariah law. The vast majority of Muslims have never accepted this behavior. Not in the name of Islam, and not in any other name. The question remains, is there anything more to Islam and Muslims than what they are not? Is there going to be a discourse that uplifts this silent and peaceful majority; that paints a hopeful future of possibilities for them? Responsibility, accountability, and discipline form the bedrock of effective leadership. Its substance, however, is vision and clarity about where the community needs to go and how they will constructively engage with the world around them. From here, communication becomes essential. But that articulation must be the product of listening, caring, and conversance with local contexts. One of the most important vocations of the leader is to empower those he or she leads to achieve the goals outlined in the vision. This entails a robust program for succession planning. All of this however, must be effectively grounded in fidelity to the universal principles of cultural and doctrinal continuity. Though leaders are often benign and well intentioned, the problem is one of effectiveness. Muslim leaders have been unable to articulate a vision for an effective way forward on behalf of their community. The situation is by no means hopeless; the substance of restoration is ready to hand. However, it requires a modicum of honesty, far-sightedness, and resolve. Any such vision will have to be at once grounded in the roots of Muslim identity and positively engaged with the greater society. There has been, as of yet, no systematic deliberation or collective discussion across community boundaries and affiliations aimed at fleshing out viable solutions based on a thorough situation assessment. Answers and solutions are arrived at haphazardly without significant reflection. This frequently leads to contradictions at a future point in time; further contributing to the alienation of the Muslim mainstream. One of the key causes contributing to such confusion is the conspicuous devolution of classical Islamic institutions. The original institutions, native to Muslim society -- whether religious or civil -- had always provided a balancing effect to the community, securing the integrity of self-understanding, memory, and praxis -- thereby facilitating balanced and responsible citizenship. The disequilibrium stemming from their neglect and decay is a direct contributor to the phenomenon of extremism. For decades, Muslim elites have pursued a policy of disassociation from classical Islamic institutions and sometimes even the religion itself. This has led to the neglect of core institutions causing them to fall into a state of disrepair. However, despite this, Muslim elites have been unable to de-link themselves from the source of their identity as Muslims -- the religion of Islam itself. It means the neglect and marginalization of native institutions inevitably comes back to haunt them. The absence of grounded authenticity has been a missing lynchpin to the success of solution-aspiring initiatives. It is imperative that new solutions demonstrate how they are grounded in the roots of the timeless world view of Islam. This must be achieved in a way that is recognizable to the Muslim mainstream or it will never gain traction amongst the grassroots. There persists a tendency to not allow psychological, moral, or intellectual space for new energy to emerge. Along with the voice of emergent generations of Muslim youth, non-Arab and non-Asian Muslims continue to be conspicuously absent or underrepresented in national and international leadership circles and events, even in Europe and the Americas. There now exist whole generations of Muslims who have come of age in an environment where modernity, technology, representative government, free speech, and even gender relations are familiar territory and not overwhelming or confounding phenomena. With the right credentials and given an opportunity, they are the natural candidates to negotiate the challenge of making sense of Islam in the current post-modern cosmopolitan context without sacrificing continuity of identity. To date, however, everyone is forced to wait around for the old leadership to continue playing catch up.","Leaders in East and West unable to find way for Muslims to show a positive identity, says Jihad Hashim-Brown .
For past decade Muslims have only talked about what they are not -- extremists and terrorists, he says .
A new generation needs the chance to make sense of Islam in today's globalized world ."
"Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) -- The familiar sound of beating drums still fills the stadium as the United Arab Emirates begins its new football season, but matches are kicking off a lot later this summer. With league play starting bang in the middle of Ramadan, officials have scheduled games to start well after ten o'clock at night to accommodate fasting players. By the time crowds fill Al Nahyan stadium, players on Abu Dhabi's Al Wahda football team have had a chance to pray and break their fast. According to team captain Haider Aili, players have grown skilled at refraining from food and drink all day in accordance with the Islamic holy month's tradition. ""We're used to that since we were young,"" he told CNN. ""And we're very lucky that we're in a Muslim country so our federation and all of the atmosphere is provided for us."" Hatem Jemaa, the Al Wahda Club team doctor, told CNN that players are physically changed by Ramadan's restraints. The league has to allow for fasting's lingering effects. ""From the second week until two weeks after Ramadan, we see the change,"" Jemaa said. ""You have the decrease of the performance. They cannot make a lot of work. They're tired and we must adjust the training."" That attitude of accommodation isn't prevalent worldwide, as matches and training typically continue through the heat of day. So, many professional Muslim players face a dilemma -- to eat and drink, or not. One of Iran's biggest soccer stars has been kicked off his team for refusing to fast, according to his team's website. Steel Azin Football Club's star player Ali Karimi was fired because ""respecting God's laws and honoring the sacred laws of Islam are of the utmost importance to Steel Azin,"" the report said. Real Madrid midfielder Mesut Ozil also chose to focus on his job at the expense of Ramadan's traditions this year. ""Because of my job I cannot follow [Ramadan] properly,"" he told CNN. ""I do it only the few days I can, only when I have a free day. But other than that it's impossible, because you have to drink and eat a lot stay at peak fitness."" Karimi and Ozil aren't necessarily straying from the rules of their faith, according to a new fatwa, or religious decree. Al Azhar University in Cairo, one of Islam's leading authorities, has declared that professional athletes can be excused from fasting if their livelihood is at stake. Travelers, pregnant women, the ill and the elderly are already exempted. With or without a fatwa, star European players like Inter Milan's Sulley Muntari and Sevilla's Freddie Kanoute choose to fast through grueling training schedules. In America, too, basketball and American football players observe the holy month. A high school football team in Michigan has even moved its pre-season practices to run until 4am, accommodating its many Muslim players. Fordson High's head coach Fouad Zaban told local TV news station and CNN affiliate WDIV that the unconventional schedule is an experiment aimed to protect the health and safety of student athletes. For doctors and team managers, health during Ramadan is a cause for concern. Al Wahda's Jemaa says the rapid changes in hydration required by fasting increase the risk of injury. ""In Ramadan, we don't eat and we don't drink, so we must give more hydration and more electrolytes,"" he said. ""Every day, we give the players what they need.""

"(CNN) -- An Oregon sheriff says he will not enforce any federal regulation that President Barack Obama lays out in his package of gun control proposals Wednesday. Linn County Sheriff Tim Mueller joins several other public officials across the nation who have decided to square off with the White House even before it outlines what its plans are for expanded measures. Mueller sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden this week saying he won't enforce any federal regulation ""offending the constitutional rights of my citizens."" He won't permit federal officers to come to his county to enforce such laws either, he said. Mueller's defiant stand exploded into a groundswell of support. His letter -- posted on the department's Facebook page -- earned more than 59,000 likes and shares -- and was growing by the minute. Over the weekend, Sheriff Denny Peyman of Jackson County, Kentucky, said that he too would disobey any directive from the administration. He told residents in a town hall meeting that the sheriff has more power than the federal government. ""They need to go back and study that. We are a commonwealth. I can ask federal people to leave, they have to leave. I can ask state people to leave, they have to leave,"" he said. But Wednesday on CNN, Peyman said he would enforce laws approved by Congress. ""If it goes through Congress, if it becomes law, if it goes that way, yeah, I'd enforce the law,"" he said. In Texas, a lawmaker said this week that he will introduce legislation that would make it illegal to enforce a federal gun ban. ""At some point there needs to be a showdown between the states and the federal government over the Supremacy Clause,"" Republican Rep. Steve Toth told WOAI 1200-AM. ""It is our responsibility to push back when those laws are infringed by King Obama."" New York passes first gun control bill since Newtown . Local officials don't get to make that call, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""A sheriff does not get to decide whether laws are constitutional,"" he said. ""Unless a court invalidates a law, he's obligated to enforce it."" In any event, local police wouldn't be responsible for enforcing federal gun laws, CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan said. ""The FBI will be enforcing them, treasury agents will enforce them. It won't be local police who would be out making sure federal gun regulations are enforced,"" he said. Obama's proposals Wednesday largely draw on the work of a task force chaired by Biden. An official familiar with the process said the president's proposal will include universal background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Other recommendations by Biden's panel include tougher enforcement of existing laws, legislators briefed by the vice president said Tuesday. Support surprises sheriff . In Linn County, the support for Mueller's letter caught the sheriff's office by surprise. ""Sheriff Tim Mueller is humbled and amazed at the support people near and far have expressed to his letter. Thank you!"" said a post on the department's Facebook page. A post by Jill Leiser Crowley of Eugene expressed the opinions of many. Senator: Obama acting like a 'king' ""Thank you for standing up for our Constitutional Rights!!!"" it said. ""You are doing the right thing for the people of Linn County - I can only hope other counties will follow!!!"" But Karin Hunt, another Oregonian, questioned the sheriff's stance. ""I would expect (an) officer to enforce the laws of Oregon and the U.S.A. whether he agrees with the law or not,"" she said. ""That's taking the law into your own hands."" The White House knows it can expect a fight. ""Part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, 'Here it comes, everybody's guns are going to be taken away,' "" Obama said Monday. Getting any legislation passed may prove to be difficult. The influential National Rifle Association, among other gun rights groups, has vowed to fight tooth and nail against any new gun restrictions -- like an assault weapons ban, which the group's president, David Keene, predicted Sunday wouldn't make it through Congress. Polls support change . Although some officials have come out against new gun control laws, Americans as a whole are looking for some sort of change after the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings last month that took the lives of 20 grade school children and seven adults. By a 51%-45% margin, Americans questioned in a new Pew Research Center poll said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights. And by a 52%-35% margin, a new ABC News/Washington Post survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month's massacre. However, the polls showed continuing divisions along political and gender lines. Still, one Oregon resident warned against passing laws that would conflict with the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. ""Constitutional changes must be made properly with Congressional and judicial approval, and by a majority of the citizens of the USA, not by the order of a tyrant in Washington D.C.!!!"" said Rick Carter of Pendleton. ""I stand with the brave Sheriff!"" The battle lines could not be clearer.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ann Rutherford, who played Scarlett O'Hara's little sister Carreen in the 1939 classic movie ""Gone with the Wind,"" has died at age 94, a close friend said Tuesday. She suffered heart problems and was hospitalized three months ago following a collapse, friend Anne Jeffreys told CNN. After struggling with deteriorating health, Rutherford died at her home in Beverley Hills, California, on Monday, Jeffreys said. ""Annie was a wonderful person, very philanthropic, and always trying to do something for somebody. A very funny lady, she said very funny things. She was one of a kind,"" said Jeffreys, who was with Rutherford when she died. Catching the 'Wind' in Atlanta . Born in 1917 in Vancouver, Canada, Rutherford got off to an early start in show business. She made her stage debut in 1925 and appeared on screen for the first time in 1935, according to a biography posted on IMDb.com. She came from a family of performers -- her father, John Rutherford, was a former Metropolitan Opera singer and her mother, Lillian Mansfield, was an actress, it says. Aside from her role as Carreen O'Hara, she won considerable fame playing the character Polly Benedict alongside Mickey Rooney in the ""Andy Hardy"" film series in the 1930s and early 1940s, the website says. After leaving the MGM studio, Rutherford played Gertrude Griswold in ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" and Donna Elena in ""The New Adventures of Don Juan,"" and then appeared in a number of television shows. She retired after her last movie role in 1976, the IMDb website says. But it is for her role in David Selznick's Civil War epic ""Gone With the Wind"" that perhaps most people will remember Rutherford. Actress who played Bonnie Blue Butler in 'GWTW' dies at 76 . She maintained a connection with the film in the decades that followed its release and appeared up until last year at events hosted by the ""Gone With the Wind"" Museum in Marietta, Georgia. ""In her last years here, 'Gone With the Wind' really kept her going,"" Jeffreys said. ""She received thousands of fan letters for 'Gone With the Wind.' And she donated things -- a script that she had gotten, a tea set that they used in the film, a necklace, things like that. ... It really was wonderful for the last part of her life, because she was in great demand."" Rutherford is survived by a daughter, Gloria May, who lives in San Francisco, and two grandsons, Jeffreys said. At 75, 'Gone with the Wind' still attracts fans, cash and controversy .

"(CNN) -- Ludogorets Razgrad may only have been founded 13 years ago but on Wednesday it stood on the brink of the biggest result in its brief history. The Bulgarian club, transformed by multi-millionaire businessman Kiril Domuschiev, stood a mere 13 minutes away from a draw with European champions Real Madrid. In front of a packed National Stadium in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, the Spanish side's superstars -- including Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez, Gareth Bale -- were on the verge of a major embarrassment. But Carlo Ancelotti's side aren't Champions League holders for nothing and France striker Karim Benzema got them out of jail in the nick of time with a goal that sealed a 2-1 win. Football: Beyonce crazy for PSG? The minnows had gone ahead, Marcelinho converting from a corner after just 6 minutes to send an already excited crowd into raptures. Just four minutes later Javier Hernandez -- on loan from English club Manchester United -- won a penalty but Ronaldo's effort was saved by Vladislav Stojanov. Ironically, it was defender Cosmin Moti who gave the Portuguese the chance to make amends 15 minutes later after bringing down the world player of the year inside the area. Moti had been Ludogorets' hero when it made the group stage, going in goal after its goalkeeper was sent off and saving two penalties against Romania's Steaua Bucharest in the playoff. But Moti could only watch on as Ronaldo found the bottom corner to restore parity. Ludogorets gave as good as it got in an open second half but just as it looked as if the match was destined for a draw, Benzema finished neatly from a right wing cross. The other match in Group B saw English Premier League club Liverpool beaten 1-0 by FC Basel in Switzerland. Marco Streller scored the only goal of the game, pouncing on a loose ball inside the penalty area to slot into the roof of the net from close range. Raheem Sterling wasted Liverpool's best chance while striker Mario Balotelli was again kept quiet. Captain Steven Gerrard told Sky Sports: ""They wanted it more and we were second best against an OK team. We made it easy for them. We wanted at least a draw and I expected us to win so I'm very disappointed.""

The striker, signed by Arsene Wenger from Manchester United on transfer deadline day, struck first on 22 minutes after a through ball from another new recruit -- Alexis Sánchez, signed from Barcelona. Poor defending from the Turks allowed Welbeck to double his tally eight minutes later, as he raced onto a misplaced header from Felipe Melo and finished into the bottom corner. Sanchez ensured Arsenal went into the break leading by three as he cut inside and found the same corner Welbeck had moments earlier. And England forward Welbeck completed his first treble for his new club with a neat finish on 52 minutes, dinking the ball over Fernando Muslera from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass. Arsenal were reduced to 10 men when goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny brought down Burak Yilmaz in the area, the striker slotting home from the spot after substitute David Ospina had come on. Webeck told Sky Sports of his first senior hat-trick: ""The manager has shown a lot of faith in me and I'm delighted to repay him. ""I'm playing up front in my favored position and I'm going to do everything I can to help the team."" Wenger, celebrating his 18th anniversary as Gunners boss, added of the striker: ""It was a great performance -- he has the instinct of a goalscorer and finished well the work of the team."" Elsewhere, a double from Adrián Ramos helped German outfit Borussia Dortmund to a 3-0 victory over Anderlecht in Belgium, Ciro Immobile grabbing the other goal. A late goal from Arda Turan sealed victory for Spanish champions Atletico Madrid over Juventus. It was the first goal the Italian champions had conceded this season. Hakan Calhanoglu, Stefan Kiessling and Son Heung-Min got the goals as Bayer Leverkusen defeated Benfica 3-1 in Germany. A double from Markus Rosenberg helped Malmo to a 2-0 victory over Greek club Olympiakos in Sweden, while French side Monaco and Zenit St Petersburg drew 0-0 in Russia.","Real Madrid eke out a narrow away win over Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets .

"(CNN) -- To explore a site inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List is to see a place of outstanding universal value. And with more natural and cultural wonders added to the prestigious preservation list over the last few days, there are now more than 1,000 sites to visit all over the world. The UNESCO World Heritage Committee has been considering new sites at a meeting in Qatar since June 15. New World Heritage Sites include the earthen remains of a Louisiana civilization dating back to 3700 B.C., Myanmar's Pyu ancient cities (Myanmar's first-ever site), and evidence of the end of the age of dinosaurs at the cliffs of Stevns Klint in Denmark. Trading routes that crossed modern borders across South America and Asia were also inscribed on the list. The Qhapac Nan, the Andean road system, runs through Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. A 5,000-kilometer section of the Silk Roads known as the routes network of Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor crosses through China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. In addition to being of ""outstanding universal value,"" an inscribed site must also meet at least one of 10 criteria such as ""representing a masterpiece of human creative genius,"" containing ""exceptional natural beauty"" or being an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement. Other new sites include the Okavango Delta (Botswana); the Grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc (France); Rani-ki-Vav (India); Caves of Maresha and Bet Guvrin in the Judean Lowlands (Israel); the vineyard landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato (Italy); Namhansanseong emergency capital city (South Korea); and Saudi Arabia's historic Jedda, the Gate to Makkah. UNESCO has been gradually adding to the World Heritage List since 1978. Click on the gallery or go to whc.unesco.org/en/newproperties to learn more about other newly named sites. Sites in danger . The West Bank village of Battir, a few miles outside Bethlehem, was named to the World Heritage List, and at the same time, it was added to another UNESCO list for sites in danger. The hills where Battir's ancient terraces are located date back some 2,000 years to Roman times. Some of the terraces are irrigated for market garden production and others are planted with grapevines and olive trees. The landscape is in danger of being damaged by Israel's plans to build a barrier through the area. The wall ""may isolate farmers from fields they have cultivated for centuries,"" according to a UNESCO press statement. Australia gets time to keep Great Barrier Reef off endangered list . In addition to Battir, the committee added two other sites to the List of World Heritage in Danger last week. One is Bolivia's city of Potosi, which is threatened by mining operations. Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve was added to the danger list because of widespread poaching that has caused a serious decline in the wildlife populations there, including a 90% drop in the elephant and rhinoceros populations since 1982. At the same time, Tanzania's ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani and ruins of Songo Mnara were removed from the danger list due to improved management and safeguards. Getting on the list . Nations sometimes spend years developing their pitches to qualify for the World Heritage List, and they must convince the UNESCO committee that they will protect their sites and support them financially. Explore Yellowstone and 11 more of the first World Heritage Sites . The United States doesn't have much sway over UNESCO decisions anymore. That's because the U.S. government withdrew its dues and other financial contributions to UNESCO in 2011 after the agency admitted the Palestinian government as a full member representing a country. After failing to pay its dues for two years, the United States lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 per the agency's rules.","UNESCO has named new World Heritage Sites around the world .

"(CNN) -- What could possibly draw 500,000 spectators to a Taiwan harbor front in the midst of typhoon Usagi threats? A giant inflatable rubber duck, of course. After stirring up a duck craze in Hong Kong in May and June, the 18-meter inflatable duck created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman arrived at Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan last Thursday. Some 500,000 people showed up to see the duck within five days, including on Saturday, when officials suspended the exhibition due to the expected arrival of Usagi. Kaohsiung City's love affair with the bird was kindled in 2009 when government officials went to see it on show in Osaka. More: 40 Taiwanese foods we can't live without . ""When we found out the rubber duck was coming to Hong Kong this year, we sent Hofman photos of Kaohsiung City and our mayor sent him a letter,"" said Zeno Lai, director general of the Kaohsiung Government Information Bureau and also the event's spokesperson. ""By the time we met Hofman in Hong Kong in June, he said more than 300 cities had contacted him for the next exhibition, including more than 20 cities in Taiwan,"" said Lai. How Kaohsiung City won the duck's heart . According to Lai, Hofman was persuaded to bring his rubber duck to Kaohsiung by the city's tremendous enthusiasm for the unusual display. Hofman has been gratified by the royal treatment he and his duck have received in Kaohsiung, said Lai. ""We understand there were minor technical issues with the duck when it was in Hong Kong and Beijing, so we tested everything at least three times,"" said Lai. ""We have already drafted emergency plans in case of bad weather or of harm being inflicted by visitors."" More: Fowl play? Giant rubber duck drowns in Hong Kong . The duck, which had to be assembled in Taiwan rather than floated all the way there or flown, is inflated by a new air pump made by the Kaohsiung event team. ""The rubber duck usually takes more than an hour to be inflated,"" said Lai. ""But in Kaohsiung, it only takes seven minutes."" The team has promised to pass on its new techniques and any lessons learned to other Taiwanese cities set to receive the duck. The yellow bird will be docked at Kaohsiung City until October 20, before floating to Taoyuan and Keelung in northern Taiwan (that's apparently not too far for a big duck to float) later this year. The spectacle is expected to lure more than 3 million visitors to the harbor and generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the city. Kaohsiung City has a population of about 2.3 million people, so many spectators from outside the city will be making the trek just for the duck. After the duck's first week in the city, final attendance figures are likely to exceed initial estimates. Find more on Hofman and his famed fowl at the duck's official website.

"London (CNN) -- The defense in the Oscar Pistorius murder case rested Tuesday, bringing to an end the latest phase of a trial which has lasted longer than the athlete's relationship with Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he killed. Closing arguments will begin August 7, the judge ordered. The long delay may be because of the length of time it will take the legal teams on both sides to review the transcript of the case, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. It's thought to be as much as 4,000 pages long, covering a case that ran for 39 days between March 3 and July 8. Pistorius, 27, admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, but he says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. Prosecutors say the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate, who was 29. Following closing arguments, the judge will have to decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or deliberately murdered his girlfriend. If Judge Thokozile Masipa does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know that Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to Phelps, the CNN legal analyst. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion.","Closing arguments will begin August 7 .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid ended Barcelona's unbeaten start to the La Liga season with an emphatic 3-1 victory at the Bernabeu in the first El Clasico of the season on Saturday. Luis Suarez started his first competitive game for the Catalan club after completing a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup but was powerless to stop a frequently rampant Real Madrid side. Suarez, who arrived from Liverpool for â‚¬82.5 million ($105 million) in the summer, immediately showed what offensive bite he could offer his new employers when he provided an assist for Barcelona's opening goal in the fourth minute. His looping cross from the right fell at the feet of Neymar who then sprinted unchallenged along the 18-yard line before drilling a low shot past Iker Casillas. Messi could and perhaps should have doubled the lead in the 23rd minute when Suarez again slung in a dangerous low ball from the right. But the Argentine, who needs one goal to equal Telmo Zarra's all-time La Liga scoring record of 251 goals, contrived to shoot directly at Casillas who deflected the ball behind. It proved to be a costly miss as the home side grew in stature and after some near misses -- Benzema hit both the post and the bar with separate attempts -- Real got their reward when Gerard Pique used his arm to block Marcelo's cross from the byline. The referee pointed to the penalty spot and Cristiano Ronaldo duly scored, sending Claudio Bravo the wrong way and ending the Barcelona keeper's record run of 755 minutes without conceding a goal. The home side carried the momentum into the second half and took the lead five minutes after the break when Pepe headed home from a corner before Karim Benzema finished off a superb move in the 61st minute. It was a goal that exemplified Real's hunger and counterattacking qualities as the ever industrious Isco stole the ball from under the noses of Andres Iniesta and Javier Mascherano on the left touchline. The 22-year-old then slipped the ball to Ronaldo who in turn squared to James Rodriguez who then offloaded a perfectly weighted ball into the path of Benzema who finished the move in style. There was still time for Barcelona to come back but it was the home side who perhaps should have extended their lead as the visitors pressed forward. Suarez was replaced by Pedro in the 69th minute but a pair of fresh legs in attack failed to kick-start a revival. Victory for Carlo Ancelotti's side sees them move up to second place in the table, one point behind Barcelona who remain on 22 points. ""We didn't lose our head after losing the early goal,"" Ancelotti said. ""I liked many things about the team, above all the high tempo we played with. The team recovered well with just two days rest after Wednesday and played very well,"" he added referring to the Champions League trip to Liverpool in midweek. For Suarez, the return to action left a ""bittersweet"" taste in the mouth. ""I am very happy to return to playing, it is a great relief to have this time behind me,"" the Uruguayan said. ""The feeling is bittersweet because of the result but this team has lifted itself many times before.""

"(CNN) -- With the sweltering summer bidding adieu and pleasant autumn temperatures setting in, now's the time to explore New Delhi. Travelers to the Indian capital may hesitate to try the city's famed street foods, fearing the notorious ""Delhi belly."" But skip the street food scene and you miss an essential part of the Delhi experience. Here are seven street delicacies among Delhi's endless choices, including a mix of vegetarian, non-veg and dessert. Ram laddoo . Desperate for an energy boost after a tiring shopping session? A plate of ram laddoo is your fix. Ram laddoo (""laddoo"" is a name for sweet flour balls) are savory, deep-fried moong balls served with chili-coriander sauce and garnished with grated radish. Served in silver-colored, throwaway plastic bowls, one serving of six-to-seven balls is a great power snack or even lunch. Best to try it at the make-shift ram laddoo stalls, sometimes on a bicycle, that are strewn across town. If you aren't lucky enough to see one, try it at Lajpat Nagar main market. Chaat . Sitting under a tiny tin-roofed shop in and downing deep-fried potato patties floating in a blend of yogurt, spicy green and red sauces served in leaf bowls is a definitive Delhi experience that even hardcore locals can't get enough of. Chaat is a collective term used to describe savory street dishes in India, especially these three: aloo tikki (described in the gallery above), dahi bhalla (cutlets of skinless black lentil-like gram submerged in yogurt) and papri chaat (a hybrid of aloo tikki and dahi bhalla with salty, plain biscuits thrown in). Many Delhi chaat addicts flock to a narrow alley behind the Union Public Service Commission's office near Khan Market (Humayun Road, Pandara Flats, India Gate, New Delhi, India). Prabhu Chaat Bhandar's (Dholpur House, Shahjahan Road, Khan Market, New Delhi; open daily 11 a.m.-9 p.m.) range of chaat options do the trick for a satisfying dinner. Parantha . Located in a remote corner in old Delhi's Chandni Chowk area, Paranthe Wali Gali (Lane of Paranthas) is home to some of Delhi's best-known parantha joints. The chapati's stouter, fancier cousin, parantha is a pan-fried flatbread generally stuffed with vegetables, such as mashed potato, grated cauliflower and radish. It's a popular breakfast item in Delhi's Punjabi households. Paranthe Wali Gali offers innovative parantha options. As you plonk down in one of the Gali's tiny, crammed restaurants, you'll find a number of delicious offerings: Indian rabri (sweet yogurt) parantha, mirch (red pepper) parantha, and lemon parantha (prepared from lemon zest, and probably the best this street has to offer). Samosa . Samosa is chaat's close competitor for the title of ""Definitive Delhi Street food"" title. (If there was such a thing.) It is to India, perhaps, what momo dumplings are to Tibet and bagels are to certain parts of the United States. As most people know, samosas are deep-fried, triangular pastry pockets, packed with potato, peas, lentils and sometimes meat. Although they're often served as an appetizer at Indian restaurants around the world, they can be paired with chaat for a full meal. Great places to try samosas in Delhi include Rewari Sweets (Sadar Bazar, Gurgaon, India; +91 124 232 1826; open daily 8 a.m.-8:30 p.m.) and Bengali Sweet House (27-33, Bengali Market, Connaught Place, New Delhi; +91 11 2331 9224; open daily 8 a.m.-11 p.m.). Kebabs . Traveling to Delhi and not trying the kebabs? Not done. A legacy left behind by the Mughals, who invaded India in the 16th century, the grilled meats served on skewers make the best on-the-go protein meals. You can typically choose among mutton or chicken kebabs. The Chandni Chowk and Hazrat Nizamuddin areas house some of the best kebab outlets in Delhi. If you aren't up for the large crowds in these bustling locations, you can take refuge in the more accessible Qureshi's Corner in Greater Kailash II (8, Narmada Shopping Complex, Alaknanda, New Delhi; +91 11 2602 0563; open daily 7-11 p.m.). Chola bhatura . No snack this, chola bhatura is for people with huge appetites. Fluffy, plain, flour bread combined with a chickpea curry, garnished with chopped onion and served with a tangy mango pickle, chola bhatura is a Delhi meal staple. It works both as a lunch and dinner item. Baba Nagpal Corner in Lajpat Nagar is arguably the best chola bhatura area in New Delhi. But if you find yourself in Karol Bagh or Rajouri Garden, you could hop into any of the numerous chola bhatura shops. Faluda kulfi . After consuming mouth-burning delicacies it's kulfi time. Kulfi is India's local ice cream, made with milk and a smattering of dried fruits. There are 57 varieties in all. The queen of them all is faluda kulfi (faluda is a popular rose milk flavor dessert drink with vermicelli noodles). The trusted Krishna Di Kulfi in Pandara Road Market serves kulfi with the heavenly faluda, a beverage consisting of rose milk and vermicelli.","If you haven't tried these street foods, you haven't been to Delhi .

"(Departures) -- In 1829, Englishman George Stephenson brought to life the first steam-powered locomotive — named Rocket — and marked the birth of train travel. Fast-forward 183 years, and today's jet-setting lives are lived at breakneck speed. One can climb aboard a Gulfstream G550 jet in Miami and make it to Seoul, South Korea, in a bit less than 15 hours for an impromptu business meeting. But when it comes to luxury train travel, finding the fastest route between two points is not the goal. It is more about settling back in one's seat and savoring the experience, one station at a time. The train trips on this list are diverse, encompassing varied cultures within epic journeys, like a four-week excursion through Africa with stops at the pyramids and Victoria Falls, or a two-week Trans-Siberian sojourn through Russia that crosses eight time zones and travels a quarter of the way around the world. Departures: Riding the Ferrari train . Not all cover thousands of miles. Micro journeys -- such as a day trip through the thick, green vegetation of Peru to climb the steps of Machu Picchu -- can be just as eye-opening. And some trips are about a sense of place, offering a comfortable feeling that you may slip into when, say, sipping whisky aboard a train rolling through the Scottish Highlands. T. S. Eliot once said, ""The journey not the arrival matters."" After embarking on these train adventures, we think you'll agree completely. All aboard: Railroad adventures for every budget . Al Andalus, Andalucía, Spain . This 800-mile trip aboard the Al Andalus, through the homeland of Pablo Picasso and Federico García Lorca, is nothing short of romantic. The train winds its way through some of southern Spain's most iconic medieval cities — Seville, Córdoba, Granada, Ronda and Cádiz. They are areas where hard-fought religious battles resulted in today's cultural kaleidoscope, a tightly woven fabric touched by Moorish and Catholic influence. Best of all, traveling from the glittering Alhambra palace in Granada to the palm-lined squares and wide streets of Jerez in an original 1929 Wagons-Lits carriage lends a sense of old-world glamour and history. $3,220, including meals; luxurytrainclub.com. Departures: World's most beautiful bridges . Eastern & Oriental Express, Singapore to Bangkok . Luxury is second nature on the opulent Eastern & Oriental Express, as evidenced by the open-air observation car at the back of the train for taking in panoramic views of the countryside and a resident pianist performing in the bar car. The seven-day, six-night Fables of the Hills journey zips through the mist-covered Cameron Highlands and past Bukit Merah, home to one of Malaysia's largest freshwater lakes, with an opportunity to disembark and taste the teas and strawberries grown in the hills. Guests can later take in dramatic views of the River Kwai as they pass over the historic Tham Kasae viaduct built along the mountain. $9,200, including meals; orient-express.com. How we'll travel in 2022 . Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express, Moscow to Vladivostok, Russia . Travelers aboard the Golden Eagle's two-week Trans-Siberian expedition are in for a wild ride. They will cover 6,000 miles, crossing eight time zones, traveling a quarter of the way around the world in the process. But with luxurious amenities like a Champagne welcome reception, heated floors and dedicated butler service, guests can settle into their seats and focus on taking in the uniquely Russian scenery — from the Ural Mountains dividing Europe and Asia to the classic wooden architecture of Irkutsk — as Tchaikovsky symphonies play gently in the background. Don't miss the freshwater seals at Lake Baikal. $21,020, including meals; luxurytrainclub.com. Departures: World's most bikeable wine regions . Hiram Bingham, Cuzco to Machu Picchu, Peru . This is one of the shortest trips on our list — just three and a half hours each way — but it packs a punch. Those who board the Hiram Bingham receive a warm towel and are asked to sign a leather-bound guest book. After brunch, spectacular sights (like the snowcapped Vilcabamba Mountains) begin to unfold outside the windows as the train zigzags along switchbacks through the agricultural terraces of the Incan city of Jaquijahuana. Then it is on to the cloud-laden Urubamba Gorge, thick with green vegetation, before finally arriving at Aguas Calientes, just a bit more than a mile from the famous lost city of Machu Picchu, with its more than 3,000 steps looming in the distance. Meals and tea are enjoyed at Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge Hotel. $350, including meals; orient-express.com. Departures: Amazing private safaris . Pride of Africa, Cape Town to Cairo . This 28-day excursion through South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Uganda and Egypt doesn't confine itself to land travel (there is a luxury air safari and lake cruise included), but the adventure's crown jewel is its majestic Pride of Africa train. Guests will take in a broad swath of Africa, from a visit with chimpanzees in Uganda to a tour of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx in Egypt to the rushing waters of Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe — a sight so powerful, explorer David Livingstone said the falls must have been ""gazed upon by angels in their flight."" Back onboard, guests can relax in leather seats and enjoy fine South African wines in the lounge car. And for the adventurous set, the train provides complimentary goggles in the event one should want to stick his or her head out the window. The trip is a rare treat, departing only once every two years, and sets out next in January 2014. From $6,200, including meals, laundry and excursions; rovos.com. Departures: Top Alaska cruises . Royal Canadian Pacific, Canadian Rockies . This is a trip so regal, it attracts royalty, in the form of Queen Elizabeth II, who traveled in a Royal Canadian Pacific train shortly after her marriage to the Duke of Edinburgh. The six-day, five-night excursion, which begins and ends in Calgary, scales the Spiral Tunnels of Yoho National Park, during which the Royal Canadian climbs 1,070 feet in 10 miles of track along a narrow mountain pass. Perilous? Perhaps. But the views of the Rocky Mountains afforded by this near-vertical trek are some of the most spectacular in the world. Other highlights include the opportunity to lounge by the emerald waters of Lake Louise in the unspoiled wilderness of Banff National Park. $8,145, including meals; luxurytrainclub.com. The Royal Scotsman, Scottish Highlands . The Royal Scotsman's Highland Journey begins and ends in the capital city of Edinburgh. From there, the train heads north through the former Kingdom of Fife, filled with fishing villages and rolling green pastures, and then onward and upward to the rugged crags of the famed Highlands. At night, a local clansman tells tales of Scottish history, and an informal whisky tasting allows guests to get acquainted with Scotland's national drink. The second day is filled with activities in the Rothiemurchus Forest, home to wild hare, osprey and red deer. Guests can shoot clay pigeons or fish before the night winds down with a tour of Strathisla, one of the oldest working distilleries in Scotland. $4,020, including meals; royalscotsman.com .

"(CNN) -- After months of protest, sudden and dramatic events have swept across Ukraine, boosting some and diminishing others. With questions swirling about where the president is, who's in charge and what will happen next, to say there's uncertainty about the future of this country of 44.5 million is an enormous understatement. But some early winners and losers seem to be emerging from the chaos that shook Kiev last week as security forces and protesters battled to a bloody standstill that left dozens dead and earned the rebuke of Western powers. Losers . President Viktor Yanukovych: His own party abandoned him as lawmakers voted unanimously to oust him from office. He's facing criminal charges stemming from the deadly crackdown on protesters last week. Russia: Russian officials were mostly sidelined last week as European foreign ministers negotiated the peace deal that ended the violence. Ukraine's opposition appears to be steering the country toward Europe. But Moscow still retains some bargaining chips: supply lines that provide most of Ukraine's natural gas, a huge naval base in the autonomous Ukrainian republic of Crimea and heavy Russian influence on culture, language and business in eastern Ukraine. Eastern Ukraine: This hotbed of pro-Russian sentiment hasn't seen the sort of rabble-rousing that's upended much of the rest of the country. But that doesn't mean the people who live here aren't thinking about it, reports CNN's Fred Pleitgen. ""Certainly, there are a lot of pro-Russians in the east of the country who are very afraid of what might happen next, who are afraid that their culture, their heritage are in danger, who feel that the Russian language -- which has always had a special status here in Ukraine -- might be in danger of becoming marginalized as well,"" he reported Monday from Kharkiv. Winners . Yulia Tymoshenko: The former revolutionary leader and prime minister, freed from prison after the peace deal was signed, has clearly gained in the past few days. She had been imprisoned since 2007 on what Western observers and many Ukrainians felt were politically motivated charges related to a gas deal with Russian provider Gazprom. She took a position of honor on the Independence Square stage Saturday, setting herself up as a possible presidential candidate. ""Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator,"" she told protesters Saturday after her release. ""There'll be no Ukraine but the Ukraine you want. And I'm the guarantor of that Ukraine."" Ukraine's opposition: They took over Kiev's Independence Square for months, held their own against much more heavily armed security forces and then flooded across Kiev to take control when those security forces vanished in the wake of the peace deal. Still, the mood in Kiev was somber as protesters honored those killed in last week's fighting. ""This is a lesson for our country and a lesson that will help us to prevent this from happening ever in this country again,"" one protester said. European Union: Europe is riding high in the wake of the peace deal largely brokered by foreign ministers from Poland, Germany and France who traveled to Kiev to help solve the crisis. It's unclear what's next for the European Union and Ukraine, which until late last year were discussing a trade deal that focused on economic modernization in return for long-term aid. But EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton was in Kiev on Monday to talk.","Ukraine's sudden political transformation helps some, hurts others .
Looking shaky: Ukraine's missing president, Russia and its allies in the country's east .

"(CNN) -- Attempting to advance his nation's peace progress with insurgents, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said unofficial negotiations with the Taliban have been taking place and hopes the formation of a peace council will further those efforts. ""We have been talking to the Taliban as countryman to countryman, talk in that manner,"" Karzai told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in an interview scheduled to air Monday night. ""Not as a regular official contact with the Taliban with a fixed address, but rather unofficial personal contacts have been going on for quite some time."" In excerpts of the interview released Sunday, Karzai also spoke on the High Peace Council, an initiative headed by former Afghan President Buhanuddin Rabbani and tasked with boosting negotiations with Taliban insurgents. ""The Taliban, those of whom who are Afghans and the sons of Afghan soil, who have been driven to violence by various factors beyond their control and beyond ours caused by circumstances in Afghanistan, we want them to come back to their country,"" Karzai said. ""They are like kids who have run away ... from the family. The family should try to bring them back and give them better discipline and incorporate them back into their family and society. President Rabbani assuming chairmanship today of the peace council is exactly in that spirit."" However, the Afghan government will work against groups like al Qaeda, he said. ""But those who are a part of al Qaeda and the other terrorist networks who are ideologically against us or who are working against Afghanistan knowingly and out of the purpose of hatred and enmity -- those of course we have to work against. Whether they are against Afghanistan or whether they are al Qaeda and the terrorist war against the United States or our neighbors in Pakistan, those of course cannot be accepted."" Karzai's remarks about the unofficial contacts with the Taliban came when the president was asked about a Washington Post report that secret high-level talks between the government and the Taliban were underway. ""Now that the peace council has come into existence, these talks will go on, and will go on officially and more rigorously, I hope,"" Karzai said. The Afghan president denied a report that he has been diagnosed as manic-depressive in a book by veteran Washington journalist Bob Woodward. In his book ""Obama's Wars,"" Woodward cited U.S. intelligence reports. ""He's on his meds; he's off his meds,"" Woodward quoted U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry as saying about Karzai. ""The only medication that I have taken is an antibiotic called Augmentin,"" when suffering from a cold two years ago, Karzai told King. He said from time to time, he also takes vitamin C, multivitamins and Tylenol, ""when I have a headache or when I'm tired."" He denied being manic-depressive, calling the story ""rather funny."" Asked about the planned drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan next summer, and relations with President Barack Obama, Karzai said, ""Relations with President Obama are very good"" and the two are in regular contact and had a video conference about five days ago. ""The relation with the U.S. government is generally good,"" he said. ""There is a strategic relationship between us, partnerships toward an objective -- that's security for us and security for the United States and the rest of the world.""

"New York (CNN) -- The ex-boyfriend of a swimsuit designer whose body was found at a chic New York hotel has been indicted on one count of murder in connection with her death, according to a statement from the Manhattan District Attorney's office Tuesday. Nicholas Brooks, son of ""You Light Up My Life"" composer Joseph Brooks, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday afternoon to one charge of second-degree murder, and is next expected in court February 8, according to Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. If convicted, Brooks could face 25 years to life in prison. The bruised body of Sylvie Cachay, 33, was discovered at the Soho House club and hotel on December 9, police said. A guest staying on a lower floor of the hotel reported to hotel management that water was leaking through the ceiling of that guest's room, according to court documents. A hotel employee investigating the source of the leak entered Cachay's room and discovered her body submerged in water in an overflowing bathtub, the documents said. Her death was later ruled a homicide, according to New York medical examiner spokeswoman Grace Brugess. But Brook's attorney, Jeffrey C. Hoffman, said last month his client believes at least one other person had been in the room. ""I believe he is, in fact, not guilty,"" Hoffman said. According to court documents, police said the only person in the hotel room with Cachay, besides Brooks, was a hotel employee who delivered ice and was inside for about one minute. Brooks escorted the employee into the room and remained after the worker left, police said. Authorities said they relied on interviews with hotel employees and surveillance videos from the location. Police said they are investigating a time frame in which the killing occurred. Cachay's body sustained bruising on the neck and bite marks, police said. An autopsy indicated that the designer suffered injuries that were consistent with neck compression, court records show. Cachay suffered internal hemorrhaging, injuries to her scalp and cuts to her lips and mouth, the documents said. ""Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke,"" said publicist Kate Godici. ""She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten.""","NEW: Brooks pleads not guilty at his arraignment .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona put a turbulent few months behind them by sweeping aside Elche 3-0 at the Nou Camp in their opening game of the Spanish season. Lionel Messi was the standout player as he scored twice and Barcelona dominated despite having Javier Mascherano sent off and playing the whole of the second half with ten men. The omens initially were not good for Barcelona. The club ended last season empty handed under Gerado Martino. The club's president Sandro Rosell had to resign over alleged irregularities surrounding the Neymar transfer. And star striker Lionel Messi has been embroiled in allegations of tax avoidance. Black cat = bad luck? But, more importantly, a black cat somehow found itself in the stadium a minute after kick off and delayed the match. It evaded several tackles before nonchalantly walking off the pitch on its own terms. A steward managed to grab the cat as it attempted to enter the stands and received several scratches for his troubles. Messi, perhaps taking a leaf out of the feline invader's playbook, evaded several challenges of his own to fire Barcelona ahead before half time. But a few minutes later Barcelona were down to ten men when Mascherano brought down Elche striker Rodrigues. He was the last defender and, deservedly, received a straight red card. But you wouldn't have known that it was Barcelona down to ten men given their second half performance. They enjoyed 79 per cent of possession as Messi added a second. There was also a goal for 18 year old La Masia graduate Munir. The whereabouts of the black cat is currently unknown. The underdog's underdog . Meanwhile arguably one of the biggest underdogs in the history of top level Spanish football started life in La Liga with a shock victory. A few months ago it wasn't even clear whether SD Eibar -- a club from a Basque town of just 28,000 people which had never played in the top tier of Spanish football before -- would even be allowed to play. The club appeared to fall foul of some idiosyncratic financial rules. Despite being self-sustaining and completely free of debt -- unlike a host of other Spanish clubs -- Eibar faced the prospect of relegation to Spanish football's third tier. Idiosyncratic . A 1999 decree requires every team to have a capital equal to 25 per cent of the average expenses of all sides in the second division, excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest. It meant Eibar had to raise â‚¬1.7 million ($2.3 million) if they wanted to play in the top division. But a social media campaign allowed the club to raise the necessary cash to compete, a campaign that Basque rivals Real Sociedad probably wish had failed. The two met in a Basque derby on the first day of the season, but it was Eibar that snatched a historic 1-0 victory thanks to Javi Lara's first half free kick.","Barcelona stormed to an easy 3-0 win against Elche .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For at least 10 minutes, it looked as if it could have been a fairytale night for the home side. Within only the first few minutes, Hong Kong's league winner Kitchee found itself in the jarringly unfamiliar position of being a goal to the good against star-studded French football champion Paris Saint-Germain. Natural order reasserted itself shortly after, however, with PSG winger Hervin Ongenda scoring a well-taken goal as the crowd erupted. It was the first of six for the Ligue 1 side, including a hat-trick for star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. As the wisdom of arduous preseason tours is being questioned in some quarters, especially as exhausted players return from the World Cup, PSG was in bullish form here in Hong Kong, and its growing popularity in evidence. Indeed, wading through the crowds before kickoff, it was almost impossible to tell which team held home advantage in Tuesday's match, with PSG replica shirts -- mostly sporting the number 10 and Ibra's name splayed across the back -- easily outnumbering any other sartorial choices. ""This is the first time I've seen them live,"" says Calvin Lee, a finance professional who wears his navy-blue PSG jersey over his white business shirt. ""I've been a fan for around two years, ever since they started buying up international stars."" Regular trips . The Asia preseason tour has become an annual ritual for many of Europe's top teams, although this year many English high-flyers, having won over Asian fans through years of visits, are instead turning their attention to that other great untapped market, the United States. The popularity of English teams in Hong Kong, as in so many other Asian markets, far outstrips that of their European neighbors, even Champions League winner Real Madrid and fellow Spanish giant Barcelona, as well as German titleholder Bayern Munich. ""It's exciting to see these matches live (in the stadium),"" says 16-year-old Mok Lui Ngai, who is wearing a PSG replica shirt with Beckham's name on the back, a throwback to when the English superstar played half a season in the French capital. ""I'd also come and watch if it was Arsenal or Manchester United, though."" It is through tours like PSG's mini-excursion into Hong Kong, and onto China, that the marketing departments of these clubs hope to redress this balance. Playing catch-up . ""We are quite lagging behind the English Premier League clubs and you need to catch this distance so I think it's important to be here, even though it's a long (way to) travel,"" PSG's executive vice-president of business operations Frederic Longuepee tells CNN. It's not just the clubs that are targeting Asian fans as the financial future. The French league moved this season's traditional opener, the French Super Cup, in Beijing, echoing the Italian FA's decision to hold its version, the Supercoppa, abroad in recent years. It is the the first time the French curtain-raiser has gone to Asia. Previously, the trophy winners had met in Canada (2009), the U.S. (2012) and Africa (2010/11/13). These games, featuring the league and domestic cup winners, are a step up from preseason friendlies like PSG's match against Kitchee. Saturday's TrophÃ©e des Champions clash with cup-winning Guingamp presents an opportunity for PSG to cement the allegiance of soccer fans in the Chinese capital. Despite the travel time from France, and the relative lack of recuperation time that the players have had in this World Cup year, Longuepee says it makes ""perfect sense"" to serve up an exhibition match in Hong Kong, en route to Beijing. ""Since the French Ligue 1 decided to come to Asia to play the French Super Cup it makes sense to come earlier,"" he says. ""To come here and to meet with our partners and sponsors."" Tours criticized . This year, there has been criticism of the demands of summer tours from other top managers, including English side Arsenal's Arsene Wenger and new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal. PSG's head coach Laurent Blanc, however, argues that the commercial aspects of the club's summer plans do not interfere with his players' fitness, or their preparation for a grueling season ahead. ""It was always ... a good opportunity for the squad to come to Asia, especially Hong Kong, ahead of the Champions' Trophy (Super Cup) in Beijing so it was all planned, there is no problem at at,"" the 1998 World Cup winner told CNN. He also said that the team didn't need to stoop to scrapping for the allegiance of fans in Asia. ""Without any (arrogance), PSG is one of the greatest football teams in Europe, so it's already (a jewel) of the football world ... there's nothing to pretend, nothing to compete."" Visiting fans . While other top managers bemoan the travel time and physical demands that these tours put on their squads, PSG is a relative newcomer to the Asian market and welcomes the opportunity to meet potential devotees -- and convert some undecideds. ""It's part of being a great football club,"" says Longuepee. ""You have to come and see your fans, otherwise you cannot expand and you cannot compete."" He added that there were further plans to travel to the Middle East, home of the club's wealthy Qatar backers, in the French season's winter break, a time traditionally reserved for teams to recuperate. And with a 6-2 scoreline to take to Beijing for next week's French Cup, and a host of potential fans who will be increasingly likely to tune into PSG's French and Champions' League games next season, overseas detours like this aren't going away any time soon.","French Ligue 1 champion beats Hong Kong's Kitchee 6-2 in a friendly in the Asian city .

"(CNN) -- Europe's star soccer clubs have booked a summer holiday to the United States -- but this is strictly business not pleasure. Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Arsenal and Manchester United are among the footballing giants crossing the Atlantic. These pre-season tours of North America are nothing new but the timing could not be better. Europe's big clubs are coming to tap into a zeitgeist that has seen a new ardor for soccer sweep the country. since Team USA's heroics at the 2014 World Cup. ""It's the perfect time to go,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger -- whose team are making the trip for a one-off game against the New York Red Bulls Saturday -- told the club's Arsenal Player channel. ""It is the first time since I (started to) go to World Cups that I've been stopped by so many American people. ""I can tell you something I'm completely convinced of -- before people didn't know who you were, but now every American guy I met knows Arsenal, knows England and knows the Premier League."" This summer's football fiesta in Brazil certainly fanned the flames of soccer in the United States. Team USA's draw against Portugal in the group stages became the most-watched soccer game in U.S. history when it attracted 25 million television viewers, according to Nielsen figures. Those statistics put soccer ahead of baseball's 2013 World Series average of 15 million viewers on Fox while the NBA Finals delivered a similar figure for ABC. Even after the U.S. team's dramatic extra-time defeat to Belgium in the last 16, which attracted 23 million viewers, the TV audience stayed tuned. A new record of an estimated 26.5m fans watched the final between Germany and Argentina. ""A lot of people still ask 'when is soccer going to make it in the United States?' I think it has,"" Daniel Wiersema, a fan from Austin who traveled to watch the U.S. team at the World Cup, told CNN. ""Compared to 2010, we saw significant interest the very moment the tournament kicked off and then a swelling interest as the U.S. progressed through the group and elimination stages. ""At the World Cup in Brazil the U.S. had a home field advantage because there were so many American fans at the games. ""On social media the followers and likes for Major League Soccer (MLS) has grown hugely and U.S. Soccer held viewing parties in Chicago that were so big they had to move them to Soldier Field (home of the NFL team Chicago Bears)."" With memories of the World Cup final still fresh, European clubs are landing on U.S. shores this week to stoke the glowing embers. Champions League winners Real Madrid, of Spain, English clubs Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United join Italian giants AC Milan, Inter Milan and Roma as well as Greek side Olympiacos in making a transatlantic trek. They are across the pond to vie for the International Champions Cup with matches played on the road from the University of California in Berkeley to Miami's Sun Life Stadium . German champions Bayern Munich and English Premier League side Tottenham are among other clubs hitching their wagons to road trips across the U.S. ""There have been three ages of overseas football tours,"" Professor Simon Chadwick, founder and director of the Centre for International Business of Sport and a professor at Coventry University Business School, explained to CNN. ""Firstly, tours were about easing players back into the football season after the summer break; then, they became PR vehicles for clubs seeking to build profile and presence around the world. ""But we are now in the third age, where strategic development of key target markets and long-term fan engagement are important. ""The short-term financial gains are likely to be less important than the long-term value of playing such matches. ""If an American becomes a lifetime Manchester United fan following a tour game, the lifetime flow of income from them is potentially very significant for a club."" The incentives for the touring clubs might be obvious but these habitual pre-season tours interrupt the regular MLS season, which unlike the domestic leagues in Europe, runs from March through October. With Europe's finest flaunting some of the world's biggest names, is there any danger that these high-profile tours are in danger of inhibiting the domestic game? ""You could say on one hand it's a distraction because it's in season and that these teams need to focus on their domestic season,"" adds Wiersema, who is also the founder of the Free Beer Movement which aims to build American soccer through social events. ""You wouldn't see Man United or Chelsea taking time off in the middle of the Premier League campaign to cash a check. ""But it's the unique position of U.S. soccer that we have a different season and a unique position that we need the profile of the global leagues to increase the local one. It's a double edged sword."" Megan Hession from Blakely Advisors, who organize high performance training camps and manage players' affairs, thinks MLS simply can't compete with European football. But, as she told CNN, there is a silver lining: ""I believe most of the MLS franchises are doing all of the right things to maximize attendance and brand recognition because no one does that better in sport than American clubs. ""I believe this World Cup has been somewhat of a game changer -- at least in the short term -- for football as I cannot remember such a high level of patriotism and overall interest from Americans."" Hession believes the loosening of MLS's designated player rule, which allows franchises to sign stars that would ordinarily be outside their salary cap, is vital in helping it attract valuable expertise. ""So long as the MLS can expand the DP rule and get more players out here, and coaches and trainers, who will make the American's better players in the long run, there's no reason we can't produce a Cristiano Ronaldo."" Many of the World Cup stars may well be on show on U.S. shores in the coming weeks. The MLS All Star game against Bayern Munich in Oregon on 6 August will pit American World Cup heroes Matt Besler, DeAndre Yedlin, Kyle Beckerman, Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey against some of Germany's World Cup winners including goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and midfielder Thomas Muller. Bayern, winners of the German Bundesliga, also boast U.S. attacker Julian Green in their ranks. He became the USA's youngest World Cup scorer after his goal in the defeat to Belgium. Attracting players of this quality to the MLS regular domestic league is arguably the key to driving the U.S. domestic league to a level closer to its global counterparts. ""MLS is on its way with big names like U.S. internationals Bradley and Dempsey coming over,"" Carisa Donahue, who traveled to watch Team USA at the World Cup in Brazil on her honeymoon with new husband Shane, told CNN. ""It's tough because there are some good names playing here but it's often players at the end of their careers. ""If we got some European or South American players who were in their prime they could help to bring the MLS to global standards."" Wiersema agrees: ""It's easy to be cynical about these tours in the short-term and say the European teams are just here for a pay day but from an American perspective I see it as inspirational. ""Seeing clubs with such a rich history allows us as Americans to dream big. ""Someday I want my local American soccer team to have the same international respect as a Manchester United. ""It's a worthy goal to think that MLS can one day be on a par with the Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga and Serie A."" The European visitors may well cash in on its imports this summer but, over time, it could be the U.S. who is exporting soccer back to the world.","A host of Europe's top soccer clubs are heading for America to prepare for domestic seasons .

"(CNN) -- To be a champion you must win a title -- but to become a Formula One legend you must win races at Monaco. ""Monaco is very special -- it is magical,"" Alain Prost, a four-time winner at Formula One's most prestigious grand prix tells CNN's The Circuit series. ""You can be a great driver without winning at Monaco but it is much better to have won here."" Only three men have triumphed in the principality more often than Prost -- his great rival Ayrton Senna took six victories, while Graham Hill and Michael Schumacher claimed five each. ""If you want to be considered as a great, very often you'll hear people say, 'Oh, I know Alain is a world champion but he won at Monaco four times and Ayrton has won there six times,' says the Frenchman, who ended his career with four world titles compared to the late Brazilian's three. ""You always operate within your parameters. I won the French Grand Prix six times and nobody cares about that,"" he adds. ""It is always more important to win at Monaco."" First run in 1929 and a fixture in the F1 calendar since 1950, the Monaco Grand Prix is the most glamorous race in the F1 calendar. Home to some of the world's richest and most famous celebrities -- including many sports stars -- because of its favorable tax laws, Monaco plays host to some of the biggest names in the racing world. The picturesque city-state on the French Riviera has been transformed this week to accommodate 200,000 fans all aiming to grab a view of the cars from the grandstands, hotel balconies and terraces -- as well as the luxury yachts moored in the harbor. The course, which is overseen by the Automobile Club de Monaco, requires two months to complete and calls on the expertise of 200 construction workers to build 1,100 tonnes of grandstands, 900 tonnes of pit garages and 21 miles of safety barriers. Prost still revels in the excitement that's generated on race weekend -- something he says is unparalleled across the racing world. ""First of all it's a race, but it's the atmosphere of the whole thing which I enjoy,"" the 59-year-old says. ""My parents live close to Monaco, in Cannes, and I have a lot of friends near too. ""There's also the atmosphere, which feels very French but it's more than that, it's the only grand prix where you feel something special."" While the circuit at Monaco is one of the most challenging, it is the demanding nature of life off the track during race week which can often prove more difficult. Drivers are expected to entertain sponsors, attend parties and galas, while there is the usual pre-race hype to deal with too. It is a week unlike any other in the racing calendar. Practice sessions start a day earlier on Thursday, meaning a gap -- often filled by duties to sponsors -- before Saturday's qualifying session. ""There are a lot of parties at Monaco and it's not the sort of place where you can say, 'OK, tonight, I am going to go to sleep and wake up late,' "" Prost reveals. ""You need to stay in good shape and keep your concentration. ""You can have some parties, but you are always meeting people during the four days in the lead up to the race. ""The biggest quality you need for this track is concentration and you need that concentration for all four days."" Nelson Piquet, a three-time world champion who had more retirements at Monaco than podium finishes, described negotiating the tricky street circuit as ""like riding a bicycle around your living room."" But Prost, who won there three years in a row from 1984-86, remembers it more fondly. ""Every year, you arrive here, you go into your car, you go up to the Casino, you try to accelerate and every time, every year I had the same feeling: 'How am I going to be able to drive this, the car looks so big for the corner and the speed and the power...?' ""And slowly you get used to it, in only a few laps, but it looks like you have a plane, you have a jet. But you change slowly and you start to dominate the car, and that is when you have the biggest pleasure. The only time I had this 100% control was '86."" That year he started from pole position, set the fastest lap during the race and headed off his McLaren teammate Keke Rosberg -- father of current Mercedes star and Monaco resident Nico -- while Senna was third. But it is his failure to claim victory in 1993 which still nags at Prost -- a race where he was hit with a stop-go penalty to deny him yet another success. Having again started from pole position, he was too quick out of the blocks and then, after serving his punishment, he stalled and dropped to 22nd place. Despite the circuit being notoriously difficult for overtaking, Prost made his way up the field but had to settle for fourth as Senna triumphed for McLaren in what would be his final race at Monaco -- he died the following year at Imola driving for Prost's former team Williams. It was also Prost's final outing at Monaco -- he decided to retire at the end of that season. ""I will never forget that one,"" he recalls. ""That was my win, you know.

"(CNN) -- Azerbaijan's capital Baku might have an ancient heart, but it is getting a remarkable modern face. Funded largely by money from oil and gas exports, the city has become one of the most vibrant places on the planet for grand designs, with numerous head-turning projects towering above low-rise Soviet-era apartments and medieval walled city. One ground-breaking work of public planning is known as ""White City"" -- an optimistic title and flip of Baku's old moniker of the ""Black City""; a title gained because of oil-related pollution. On a 220-hectare site that was formerly a storage hub for the industry, ground is being cleaned up and prepared for offices, hotels, homes and facilities for 50,000 Baku residents and 48,000 workers. Across the country improvements are being made in infrastructure. Within five years in Baku more roads, new parks, a new transit system, water supplies and internet connections will all be in place. Already dominating the skyline are the iconic Flame Towers that are close to completion, plus the Baku TV Tower. Joining these soaring landmarks are some even more eye-popping structures; the towers of Crescent Place and the Hotel Crescent, designed by South Korean architecture firm, Heerim Architects and Planners. The firm won the rights to build the two projects, as well as the 39-story Crescent City and 38-floor future headquarters for the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), through an international competition. ""(Azerbaijan) is considered to have the will and economic power based on high-growth that can widely accommodate new architecture designs,"" wrote a spokesperson for Heerim. ""Many clients in Azerbaijan are actively accepting creative designs... that will provide great advantages to their national development."" When completed in 2015, Hotel Crescent will stand on the banks of the Caspian Sea, its 33-stories housed in a vast, down-turned crescent. A sister project was proposed called the Full Moon Hotel that would have brought something resembling the Death Star from ""Star Wars"" to the Caspian coastline. The White City project may take decades to complete and be less radical in its design, but it and other projects in the city shows a commitment to give the Azerbaijan capital more than just a clean up.","Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, is undergoing a major face-lift .

"(CNN) -- There is a new man tasked with fulfilling Brazil's World Cup destiny. But for a nation still smarting from the pain of that humbling 7-1 semifinal defeat to Germany, the announcement that Dunga is back in charge might raise a few eyebrows. The 50-year-old is a legend in the country after making 91 appearances for ""A Selecao"" and leading the side to World Cup glory as captain in 1994. And yet during his previous four-year spell as coach of the national team, he could only take Brazil to the quarterfinals of the 2010 tournament, as they lost to Netherlands. Dunga replaces Luiz Felipe Scolari -- the country's 2002 World Cup winning coach, who resigned after overseeing a heartbreaking conclusion to the 2014 installment. After that pummeling by eventual winners Germany -- Brazil's biggest ever World Cup defeat -- they were then beaten 3-0 by Netherlands in the third place playoff. Such a dramatic conclusion left the nation in shock and Scolari, who took responsibility for the horror show against Germany, stepped down last week. Now Dunga is determined to put a smile back on the fans' faces. ""I am immensely happy -- thank you for your confidence in me,"" he said in a press conference, after taking control of the five-time world champions. ""The fans are very down right now but they are right behind the team which means so much to them. ""I am not here to sell a dream, we must get down to work. We must get results and forge a side for 2018. This team is very young. We must find the way to blend new players with those who have more experience. ""We have to work conscientiously. And not just the players, but the press and the fans too."" Adenor Leonardo Bacchi -- known as Tite -- was thought to be a frontrunner for the job but the manager of Sao Paulo-based side Corinthians has been overlooked. That might be related to the recent appointment of Gilmar Rinaldi as Brazil's new technical director. He was goalkeeper in that successful 1994 team skippered by Dunga. The president of Brazil's Football Confederation, Jose Maria Marin, said of Dunga: ""He was world champion, captain of a world champion side. ""He has what it takes to lead the Brazil team. The numbers show he absolutely has the ability to take charge."" Dunga spent 60 matches in charge of Brazil in his first stint as coach between 2006 and 2010, winning 42, drawing 12 and losing six. He was criticized for the style of play he employed, and the squad he chose to take to South Africa at the previous World Cup. Brazil was dumped out of the tournament in the last eight after a 2-1 defeat to Netherlands, leading to Dunga's sacking shortly after. But arguably, the state of the nation's soccer is in far worse shape this time around after a chastening experience on home soil. Ever since Brazil won the right to host the tournament, its fans wanted the team to erase the memory of the last World Cup they hosted back in 1950. Then, they were beaten 2-1 by Uruguay in the deciding match, a defeat which provoked a spell of national mourning. Another was induced by that semifinal mauling. Shorn of its two best players -- Barcelona striker Neymar through injury and defender Thiago Silva because of suspension -- a shellshocked Brazil were 5-0 down at halftime. By the end of its 7-1 defeat, the crowd were booing them and applauding Germany. Many of the players left the field in tears at the final whistle. And Dunga said Brazil must adapt to the differences in the world game quickly. ""Football has changed,"" he added. ""It changes every moment and every day. ""We like to talk here about talent and playing off the cuff. But we also praise German organization. So we have to harness our talent with planning."" Dunga also made reference to Nelson Mandela, who was a pivotal figure in taking the World Cup to South Africa in 2010 before his death in December last year. ""Nelson Mandela had everything against him,"" he said. ""He did not have a weapon and yet brought about change. ""I hope to have (even) one percent of his patience. I am not thinking about me but about the team. If the team is doing well then I'm happy."" Football: Germany captain quits .","Dunga is appointed the new national coach of Brazil .

"(CNN) -- The National Park Service is investigating reports of graffiti and other vandalism in at least 10 National Park sites throughout the western United States. One move that could get the vandal caught? Showcasing their ""artwork"" on social media. Photos have surfaced in online hiking forums of what appears to be a woman painting graffiti in scenic locales. The art includes colorful images of faces in profile and is signed with the phrase ""Creepytings 2014."" Images of the graffiti were apparently posted on Instagram. Park Service officials declined to discuss cases still under investigation but a representative posted on Reddit looking for more photographic examples of the graffiti. Redditors are rallying to help. And other social media outlets aren't so quiet. Don't make these stupid travel mistakes . A California hiking website, Calipidder, first reported seeing social media posts about one person's paintings on National Park land. That led Modern Hiker to post several pictures of paintings that it said are by the roaming vandal. The National Park Service would not name any potential suspects. ""While we can't discuss details of a case under investigation, we take the issue of vandalism seriously,"" said the park service, in a statement. ""National parks exist to preserve and protect our nation's natural, cultural and historic heritage for both current and future generations. Vandalism is a violation of the law and it also damages and sometimes destroys often irreplaceable treasures that belong to all Americans."" Naturalists and hiking enthusiasts are taking to the web to decry the defacement of National Park land. Someone has even launched a WhiteHouse.gov petition encouraging officials to throw the book at the alleged vandal for violations of federal law. ""There are forums for artistic expression in national parks because national parks inspire artistic creativity. These images are outside that forum and outside the law,"" the National Park Service said in a statement. Visiting national parks could cost more . Calling the graffiti in question art is too kind, says art critic Ariella Budick. ""This is appalling -- worse than graffiti,"" says Budick, art critic for the Financial Times. ""I'm not impressed by the art, but frankly, even it were Leonardo it would be wrong."" The affected parks are Yosemite National Park, California; Death Valley National Park, California; Crater Lake National Park, Oregon; Zion National Park and Canyonlands National Park, both in Utah. There may be additional damage, which has yet to be confirmed, in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona; Sequoia Kings Canyon National Park and Joshua Tree National Park, both in California; Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado; Bryce National Park, Utah.","National Park Service investigates reports of graffiti by an artist .

"London (CNN) -- After a renewed push for leads in the case of missing British girl Madeleine McCann, authorities in the United Kingdom are turning to Portuguese officials for help. A letter sent by the Crown Prosecution Services to authorities in Portugal on Friday is requesting permission to conduct interviews in connection with the girl's 2007 disappearance from her family's holiday villa in the resort town of Praia da Luz. Pedro do Carmo, the deputy national director of the Judiciary Police in Portugal, said Portuguese authorities have not yet received the letter, but he noted the latest lines in the Scotland Yard investigation focus on three people. Do Carmo declined to provide the nationalities of those three people, who he said have not been detained. The development in the case comes roughly three months after new police sketches were released of potential suspects and UK police appeared in a TV appeal for information. The program prompted a flurry of tips, and police in Portugal announced that same month that they would reopen the case. Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared while she was on holiday with her family in June 2007. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide. The two police forces' investigations have run in parallel since October. Do Carmo said Portuguese police have been in constant contact with authorities in the UK. Detectives have been investigating a spike in break-ins in the area in the weeks before Madeleine disappeared, two of them in the same block where her family was staying.

"(CNN) -- According to NSA documents published in Glenn Greenwald's new book ""No Place to Hide,"" we now know that the NSA spies on embassies and missions all over the world, including those of Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, the European Union, France, Georgia, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Venezuela and Vietnam. This will certainly strain international relations, as happened when it was revealed that the United States is eavesdropping on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone -- but is anyone really surprised? Spying on foreign governments is what the NSA is supposed to do. Much more problematic, and dangerous, is that the NSA spies on entire populations. It's a mistake to have the same laws and organizations involved with both activities, and it's time we separated the two. The former is espionage: the traditional mission of the NSA. It's an important military mission, both in peacetime and wartime, and something that's not going to go away. It's targeted. It's focused. Decisions of whom to target are decisions of foreign policy. And secrecy is paramount. The latter is very different. Terrorists are a different type of enemy; they're individual actors instead of state governments. We know who foreign government officials are and where they're located: in government offices in their home countries, and embassies abroad. Terrorists could be anyone, anywhere in the world. To find them, the NSA has to look for individual bad actors swimming in a sea of innocent people. This is why the NSA turned to broad surveillance of populations, both in the United States and internationally. If you think about it, this is much more of a law enforcement sort of activity than a military activity. Both involve security, but just as the NSA's traditional focus was governments, the FBI's traditional focus was individuals. Before and after 9/11, both the NSA and the FBI were involved in counterterrorism. The FBI did work in the United States and abroad. After 9/11, the primary mission of counterterrorist surveillance was given to the NSA because it had existing capabilities, but the decision could have gone the other way. Because the NSA got the mission, both the military norms and the legal framework from the espionage world carried over. Our surveillance efforts against entire populations were kept as secret as our espionage efforts against governments. And we modified our laws accordingly. The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that regulated NSA surveillance required targets to be ""agents of a foreign power."" When the law was amended in 2008 under the FISA Amendments Act, a target could be any foreigner anywhere. Government-on-government espionage is as old as governments themselves, and is the proper purview of the military. So let the commander in chief make the determination on whose cell phones to eavesdrop on, and let the NSA carry those orders out. Surveillance is a large-scale activity, potentially affecting billions of people, and different rules have to apply -- the rules of the police. Any organization doing such surveillance should apply the police norms of probable cause, due process and oversight to population surveillance activities. It should make its activities much less secret and more transparent. It should be accountable in open courts. This is how we and the rest of the world regain the trust in the actions of the United States. In January, President Obama gave a speech on the NSA where he said two very important things. He said that the NSA would no longer spy on Angela Merkel's cell phone. And while he didn't extend that courtesy to the other 82 million citizens of Germany, he did say that he would extend some U.S. constitutional protections against warrantless surveillance to the rest of the world. Separating espionage from surveillance, and putting the latter under a law enforcement regime instead of a military regime, is a step toward achieving that.","Author Glenn Greenwald's new book shows that NSA spies on many embassies .

"(CNN) -- Adam ""MCA"" Yauch, a founding member of the pioneering rap band Beastie Boys, died Friday after a nearly three-year battle with cancer, the band's publicist said. A torrent of Twitter messages from entertainers lauded Yauch, 47, as a visionary musical artist, filmmaker and humanitarian. ""He stood for integrity as an artist. What a loss. He was a very good man,"" said actor Ben Stiller. Yauch revealed in 2009 that he had a cancerous tumor in a salivary gland. As a result, the band canceled its scheduled concerts and delayed the release of an album. Watch Yauch announce he'd been diagnosed with cancer . ""I started feeling this little lump in my throat, like you would feel if you have swollen glands or something like that, like you'd feel if you have a cold, so I didn't really think it was anything,"" he said then in a video to fans. Yauch, a self-taught bassist and vocalist, underwent surgery to treat the tumor that year. The Chart: Salivary gland cancer rare with few known risk factors . The Beastie Boys, who blended punk and rap, burst on the music scene in 1986 with the album ""Licensed to Ill,"" which included hits such as ""(You Gotta) Fight for the Right (to Party""), an anthem to teen angst; ""Brass Monkey"" and ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn."" The group came together for the first time to play at Yauch's 17th birthday party, its publicist said. Yauch was the oldest of the Beastie Boys, an only child who grew up in Brooklyn Heights, according to Current Biography magazine. The band, which also featured Michael ""Mike D"" Diamond and Adam ""Adrock"" Horovitz, sold more than 40 million records and had four No.1 records. The Beastie Boys' success in hip-hop was notable at a time when the music form was dominated by African-American performers. ""The group's music crossed genres and color lines, and helped bring rap to a wider audience,"" said Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy. Yauch was unable to attend the band's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last month. Horovitz read Yauch's acceptance letter. Marquee: Remembering The Beastie Boys' greatest hits . Under an alias, Yauch directed several Beastie Boys videos, including ""Intergalactic"" and ""So What'cha Want."" Yauch converted to Buddism in the 1990s after visiting Nepal and hearing the Dalai Lama speak in Arizona, he told the Buddhist magazine Shambhala sun in 1995. ""It just seemed like Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism -- because that's mainly what I've been exposed to -- was a real solid organization of teachings to point someone in the right direction,"" the magazine quoted him as saying. ""Some real well thought out stuff. But I don't know, like, every last detail about Buddhism."" Marquee: Celebs react to the loss of Yauch . The conversion led him to have second thoughts about the bawdy party-boy image the band portrayed in the 1980s, he told the Boston Globe in 1998. ""I didn't realize how much harm I was doing back then and I think a lot of rap artists probably don't realize it now,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. ""I said a lot of stuff fooling around back then, and I saw it do a lot of harm. I had kids coming up to me and saying, 'Yo, I listen to your records while I'm smoking dust, man.' And I'd say, 'Hey, man, we're just kidding. I don't smoke dust.' People need to be more aware of how they're affecting people."" As a Buddhist, Yauch became an advocate for Tibetan freedom. He founded the Milarepa Fund, which helped raise money for the effort, and organized charity concerts involving the Beastie Boys and other acts, including the first Tibetan Freedom Concert in 1996. Several similar concerts followed. The Milarepa Fund also organized a 9/11 benefit concert for residents deemed least likely to get aid from other sources. Yauch also founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, which was active in independent video distribution. Its founder directed the basketball documentary ""Gunnin' For That #1 Spot,"" released in 2008. ""Adam was incredibly sweet and the most sensitive artist, who I loved dearly,"" said music impresario Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam, which released ""Licensed to Ill."" ""I was always inspired by his work,"" Simmons said. ""He will be missed by all of us."" Yauch is survived by his wife, Dechen; a daughter, Tenzin Losel; and his parents, according to the band's publicist. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- Gun violence is a public health threat to our children. My husband, Sean Palfrey, and I are pediatricians. We are not specialists or experts in the field of injuries, but we are, sadly, all too familiar with the devastating impact of guns in children's lives. Firearms have claimed the lives of patients, friends and family members. The shooting this week of a 6-year-old boy by his 4-year-old neighbor, who apparently had gotten hold of a loaded .22-caliber rifle from his home in New Jersey, reminds us that gun-related tragedies are daily occurrences in America. Last December, in the days after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, my husband and I wanted the public to know that gun injuries are too common in our children's lives. We wanted doctors and nurses to redouble efforts to help families decrease the threat that guns pose to children and to offer hope and encouragement that there really are positive things we can do to increase our children's safety. So we wrote an article for the New England Journal of Medicine . For the article, we didn't have to look far to discover that guns are as much a threat to our children and grandchildren as infectious diseases and other health disorders. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6,570 people ages 1 to 24 died from firearm injuries in 2010. That's 18 people every day and a staggering seven a day for children ages 1 to 19. In 2010, firearms caused twice as many deaths as cancer, five times as many as heart disease and 15 times as many as the recorded infections. Protecting children from gun violence is not a political decision, it's a public health imperative. Guns kill teenagers who get into scuffles over weighty and trivial matters. They kill sad boys and girls who make the impulsive decision to end it all right now, and can because they have the lethal means right in their hands. And they kill little children who play act what they see adults doing around them or on television or the internet. In October, a committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on firearm-related injuries. The statement included technical background research and statistics, asked questions about how and why kids get their hands on guns and came to the evidence-based conclusion that if children have access to guns in their homes or neighborhoods, they are at risk of injury. Here is what the AAP recommended . ""The best preventive measure against firearm injuries and deaths is not to own a gun. However, if you choose to have firearms in your home, adhere to these rules for gun safety: . • Never allow your child access to your gun(s). No matter how much instruction you may give him or her, a youngster in the middle years is not mature and responsible enough to handle a potentially lethal weapon. • Never keep a loaded gun in the house or the car. • Guns and ammunition should be locked away safely in separate locations in the house. Make sure children don't have access to the keys. • Guns should be equipped with trigger locks. • When using a gun for hunting or target practice, learn how to operate it before loading it. Never point the gun at another person and keep the safety catch in place until you are ready to fire it. Before setting the gun down, always unload it. • Do not use alcohol or drugs while you are shooting. The massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has awakened our nation into action. It prompted our president to declare that ""now is the time"" to end gun violence. It encouraged our elected leaders to come together to vote on legislation that can make children feel safe in their homes, school and communities. It mobilized advocates and parents to come to Washington. It spurred dialogue in local and national media. We are at a tipping point. And we can do this. We have increased automobile and bike safety and prevented drownings and poisonings by making simple but strict rules compelling Americans to change their habits. We can make our country safer, but only if we work together. Only if we look at these numbers and say: Enough. Gun violence is an epidemic that we can treat over time. We must not only understand this, we must act. Through strong state and federal gun safety policies, through research into the causes and prevention strategies of gun violence, through doctors talking to patients about guns in the home, through reducing children's exposure to violence in the media, in their homes and in their communities, we can do this. Medical professionals, clergy, government officials, police officers, families must collectively say, without relent or apology: We must protect our children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Judith Palfrey.","Judith Palfrey: Gun violence a health threat to kids; New Jersey shooting is an example .
She says 6,570 people ages 1 to 24 died from firearm injuries in 2010 .

"New York (CNN) -- Moments after pilot Paul Dudley maneuvered his Bell 206 Jet Ranger into the air near midtown Manhattan, he radioed that the helicopter was experiencing problems, officials said Wednesday. Dudley, an experienced commercial pilot with 2,200 hours of flight time, careened above New York's East River as his craft lost altitude and eventually plunged into the water, according to National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind. A 15-member NTSB team is now trying to find out why the helicopter crashed, killing one woman and injuring four other people, he said. The woman, Sonia Marra of Sydney, Australia, died on her 40th birthday. Marra, a British citizen, was traveling with a friend, her mother and her stepfather when the chopper went down Tuesday afternoon. Trapped in the craft's back seat as it submerged, she was the sole passenger unable to escape as the copter inverted and sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday. A source close to the investigation identified the survivors as Paul Nicholson, 71; Harriet Nicholson, 60; and Helen Tamaki, 43. The Nicholsons are Marra's stepfather and mother, and Tamaki is a family friend, the source said. The chopper crashed as it approached for a riverside helipad landing. Images broadcast on CNN affiliate WCBS soon after the crash showed at least three people being towed to shore in a rescue effort. Rosekind said on CNN's ""American Morning"" that the helicopter was not on an air tour flight, but a private flight, and that a complete investigation would begin Wednesday. ""The NTSB is going to focus not just on what happened, but why,"" he said. U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said she was ""saddened and deeply concerned"" about the crash. ""There have been at least 28 helicopter crashes in our city over the last three decades,"" she said in a statement. ""Federal transportation officials should investigate not only the causes of this crash, but also whether it is safe to have such a high volume of helicopter traffic over our densely populated city."" Had the crash occurred over land, the death toll could have been much higher, Maloney said. Dudley, the pilot, previously made an emergency landing in a small Cessna plane in a Brooklyn, New York, park in 2006. CNN's Jason Kessler, Eden Pontz and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","NEW: The experienced commercial pilot had 2,200 hours of flight time .

"(CNN) -- A brown bear and her cub mauled a group of teenage boys deep in the Alaskan wilderness, forcing rescuers to scramble early Sunday to help the injured. Two of the teens, participating in a survival skills course, suffered life-threatening injuries, Alaska State Troopers said in a press release, and two had injuries that were labeled ""serious, but non-life-threatening."" Megan Peters, a spokeswoman for the state police, said those four are in critical condition, while three others had minor injuries or exposure-related issues. The National Outdoor Leadership School -- whose program the boys were participating in -- claimed in a statement that four people were hurt in the attack. The mauling occurred around 8:30 p.m. Saturday as the teenagers were crossing a creek in a remote area about 45 miles northeast of Talkeetna. There were no instructors with the group, which was on the 24th of a 30-day backpacking course to learn about teamwork and wilderness-related skills, according to the Wyoming-based program. The teens told state troopers that they were crossing the river in a line when the bears attacked. Those in front got the worst of the assault. ""They were mauled, very severely,"" said Peters. ""It was truly an emergency situation."" Between ages 16 to 18 and from all around the country, the boys said that they followed protocol in calling out to warn the bears and carrying bear spray, according to the wilderness program. Afterward, the group set up a camp, provided first aid and activated a personal locator beacon, which is used to alert authorities about one's whereabouts in an emergency. A helicopter was then dispatched, tracking the beacon's signal and finding the teens in a tent around 2:45 a.m. Sunday, said state troopers. The rescuers then determined that two of the victims were too hurt to be safely transported by the helicopter for medical aid. A state trooper stayed on the scene, helping tend to those two as well as a third boy who was in the best condition, while the others were flown out for treatment at Mat-Su Regional Hospital in Palmer. Four hours later, around 6:45 a.m., a better-equipped aircraft arrived to fly out the most seriously injured to Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, about 150 miles to the south. A state trooper on Sunday flew around the area, trying to locate the animals responsible for the attack. Peters said Sunday night that ""we have not laid eyes on the bear and the cub."" Seven other National Outdoor Leadership School students, as well as three instructors, had been in the Alaska wilderness at the time of the attack and were unaware of the mauling, the state police said. The outdoor leadership school said these 10 people have since been located and ""are in the process of being evacuated by helicopter."" In mid-July, wildlife officials in Colorado said they killed a black bear who they believed had wandered into a heavily populated campsite and attacked a teenage boy. The teen fought off the bear, then chased it away after being bit in the leg. A man was killed weeks earlier in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park. But park officials said the man, who was hiking with his wife, surprised the female grizzly while she was with her cubs. They determined that the bear was acting defensively and decided not to put the bear down.","NEW: A state police official says the teenagers ""were mauled, very severely""

"(CNN) -- SpaceX's Dragon spaceship splashed down Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, returning from a four-week resupply mission to the International Space Station and bringing back a valuable payload of potentially groundbreaking experiments. Dragon, an unmanned spacecraft, successfully came down about 300 miles west of Baja California just after 3:30 p.m. EST, carrying a return load weighing 3,276 pounds, NASA said in a press release. Dragon was expected to be hauled to a port near Los Angeles where some of the cargo would be removed almost immediately, the space agency said, while the rest of the research aboard the rocket will return to SpaceX's facility at McGregor, Texas, for further processing. SpaceX is a private company that has contracted with NASA to fly missions to the ISS since NASA retired its shuttle fleet in 2011. ""This mission enabled research critical to achieving NASA's goal of long-duration human spaceflight in deep space,"" said Sam Scimemi, director of the International Space Station division at NASA Headquarters. One of the experiments scientists are hoping yields information to help further deep space exploration involves mice. It's called the Rodent Research-1. Part of that experiment has returned aboard the Dragon. The study focuses on ""ongoing research on how microgravity affects animals, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology and knowledge that may directly affect human health on Earth, NASA said. The Dragon also delivered a 3-D printer to the ISS during its mission, to test the ability to produce parts cheaply and on demand, and a device called the ISS-RapidScat that will measure the winds on the Earth's oceans for climate and weather research. ""The delivery of the ISS RapidScatterometer advances our understanding of Earth science, and the 3-D printer will enable a critical technology demonstration,"" Scimemi said. Also critical to extended space travel is a dependable food supply. A study on arugula plant growth returned aboard the Dragon. The research hopes to determine the impact of various nutrients and microgravity on seedlings from the leafy vegetable that are grown in space. Scientists hope the experiment will help them learn the best ways to grow plants in space with the highest nutritional content. The Dragon delivered a total of 255 science experiments to the ISS during its fourth of 12 planned SpaceX resupply missions to the space station through 2016. The next SpaceX flight is set to lift off sometime after December 1. It will also deliver crew supplies and cargo to the International Space Station, including CATS, the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System. CATS is a laser instrument that will measure clouds and particles in the atmosphere, including pollution, dust and smoke. NASA recently announced it was awarding $6.8 billion contracts to SpaceX and Boeing to shuttle cargo and astronauts to and from the ISS. Since NASA's space shuttle program was retired in 2011, astronauts have been hitching rides on the Soyuz spacecraft, at a cost of $70 million per seat. Both Boeing and SpaceX's crafts will go through a certification process first. The target date to begin manned missions is 2017.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- ""I feel a deep sense of regret, I couldn't protect my own child,"" Nur Hamida said. ""He had to go out on the street to work."" As she speaks, she cradles her youngest child, rocking slowly back and forth. She used to have another son, 9-year-old Ardiansyah. He sang in the streets for money, like many impoverished children. One day in January, Ardiansyah's 5-year-old brother came back home without him. A few hours later, Hamida heard horrifying news about a mutilated child: Authorities were trying to locate the head. She instantly knew something was wrong with Ardiansyah. ""I asked some guy on the street if he knows how old this mutilated kid was. I was crying when I asked the question,"" she said. Hamida became frantic. ""I started looking around under the bridge trying to find the head of this child,"" she said. ""I told my husband, this mutilated kid is our son. I didn't know for sure, but my heart was just telling me that it was my son. I kept saying 'where's the head, where's the head' as I search through the grass."" The investigation led the police to a middle-aged cigarette vendor -- Baikuni. Police say he confessed to everything. ""He had asked Ardiansyah to have sex with him,"" said police spokesman Boy Rafli Amar. ""When Ardiansyah refused, he got angry and strangled him. He sodomized Ardiansyah after he killed him."" Ardiansyah was not the only victim. Authorities say he confessed to raping and murdering at least 14 boys dating back to 1995. Baikuni's lawyer said he will not contest the charges. Baikuni was no stranger to the community or his victims. He was nicknamed ""Babe"" -- which means father -- and was known for his kindness toward street children. He would regularly bring them in off the streets, provide them a comfortable place to sleep and eat. No one suspected that this fatherly figure would be the same man police say was a serial rapist and murderer. This case has shocked the Indonesian capital because serial killings, especially those involving children, are rare. But it has catapulted the plight of the estimated 12,000 street kids in Jakarta into public view. ""Ninety percent of the time the reason these kids end up on the street is the parents' financial condition,"" said Agusman, who owns a shelter for street children. ""Rarely do we find parents intentionally sending their kids to the street. They have no other choice but to have their kids fend for themselves."" At Agusman's shelter, a group of boys jams on a drum set and a couple of old guitars. They are some of Ardiansyah's friends, all sharing in the dream of becoming famous rock stars. All the boys spent time at Baikuni's house. ""It was always nice to stay at his house,"" one of the boys said. ""I met a lot of my friends there."" He said Baikuni would bathe them, but like a father. He said Baikuni never molested him, but he was approached by numerous others on the street. The boys at the shelter say they were shocked and terrified when they found out what happened to Ardiansyah. Agusman said the problem is that Indonesian street children are especially vulnerable since there are no laws to protect them. Someone like Baikuni can set up a make shift shelter and not be questioned by the community or the police. ""We don't want to ban people from trying to go good,"" he said. ""But the government needs to set some sort of a regulation for this kind of activity."" He also said the many poor families couldn't focus on their children or give them enough love and attention. Ardiansyah, for example, was one of six children, living crammed in a single room. The family was struggling to survive. His mother said she trusted Baikuni, that he was like a brother to her. ""I have so many kids, I was happy to have someone there to help and care for one of my kids,"" she said. ""I never suspected that he would do anything bad. My son was not the only kid who stayed at his house. I just told him to keep my son safe.""","An estimated 12,000 street kids live in Jakarta .

"(CNN) -- The New York Police Department announced Monday it will no longer confiscate unused condoms as evidence in some prostitution-related offenses, according to a press release from the department. The new policy will allow condoms to be held with other personal property that is returned when individuals have been released from custody on cases of prostitution and loitering for the purpose of prostitution, according to Det. Cheryl Crispin, a department spokeswoman. Condoms will still be confiscated and invoiced by police in other prostitution-related arrests, such as promoting prostitution and sex trafficking, according to the release. A suspect having condoms in his or her possession was a factor in determining if probable cause existed, according to the Sex Workers Project, a group that provides legal and social services to people who engage in sex work. The new policy, which was intended to ensure public health while maintaining effective criminal investigations, was implemented after the department collaborated with public health officials, community-based advocates and other city officials, according to Police Commissioner William Bratton. ""I think it's the right thing to do,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Monday. ""A policy that actually inhibits people from safe sex is a mistake and dangerous."" ""We are happy that this policy has been announced and we think it is an important step in the right direction,"" Sienna Baskin, co-director of the Sex Workers Project, told CNN. ""Unfortunately, we don't think it goes far enough or solves all the problems."" Baskin said that her organization is concerned that condoms may still be confiscated in certain situations and that police will continue to use the possession of condoms to justify an arrest. The group has been advocating a change in the condom confiscation policy for many years. A 2010 report by the New York City Department of Health, which was released by Human Rights Watch, found that 57% of sex workers surveyed had had condoms taken away by a police officer. In addition, 33% of sex workers reported that they had not carried condoms at one time because of fear of trouble with police, according to the report. ""This policy opens the door for individuals in prostitution to stop risking their health for fear of carrying condoms,"" Sonia Ossorio, president of the Nation Organization for Women, said in the department's press release. ""It's every individual's right to be able to protect their health and this policy shift under the new NYPD leadership goes a long way to protect their health and this policy shift ... goes a long way in furthering sound public health policy,"" said Ossorio. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","The New York Police Department won't take condoms in some prostitution arrests .

"(CNN) -- He doesn't have an agent. He doesn't have a publicist. He doesn't even seem to have a fixed address. Yet, in by-the-numbers Hollywood, Bill Murray has turned his unpredictability into an asset. Want to get hold of him? Call his 800 number. Maybe he'll get back to you. (Maybe he won't. In fact, he probably won't.) You almost certainly won't find him among the glitterati in Los Angeles, but if you're at a Charleston, South Carolina, birthday party; or a house party in Scotland; or the Salt Lake City airport, you might run into the star. Indeed, there's an entire website devoted to ""Bill Murray stories."" Such is his impish image that it's subtitled -- after an alleged Murray quote -- ""No one will ever believe you."" (There's a Tumblr, too.) ""If his three and a half decades in the public sphere have taught us anything about the actor, it's that he simply does not give a good goddamn,"" wrote GQ's Dan Fierman in a 2010 interview. Doesn't he know better? Doesn't he realize he should dress in fashionable clothes and not shorts and Hawaiian shirts? Doesn't he realize that he's supposed to glide around in limos and Lexi? Doesn't he realize he's a celebrity, dammit, and celebrities are supposed to be -- arrogant sniff -- special? Here are more than five reasons why he's the greatest star going: . He does the movies he wants to do. Some movie stars will do anything for a paycheck. Others, like George Clooney, have a code of sorts: ""One (low-budget indie) for me, one (big-budget blockbuster) for them."" Bill Murray's code is: I'll do whatever the hell I want. His new film, ""St. Vincent,"" lives up to the Murray ethos. It's an indie film with a rookie writer/director, Theodore Melfi. Murray took the role almost casually after Melfi, a neophyte, left a series of increasingly urgent messages for the performer. His role? A crusty old man -- a stroke victim -- who befriends a young boy. There's no rhyme or reason to what makes a Murray movie. He's become a part of Wes Anderson's troupe, appearing in ""Rushmore,"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" in roles large and small. He made an awards bid, playing Franklin D. Roosevelt in ""Hyde Park on Hudson,"" and took a small part in an attempted blockbuster, the big-screen version of ""Get Smart."" It's nothing new for Murray -- in the early '80s, he was uncredited in ""Tootsie,"" made the biggest comedy of all time in ""Ghostbusters"" and then turned to a pet project, ""The Razor's Edge."" He's never looked back. ""I think we're all sort of imprisoned by -- or at least bound to -- the choices we make, and I think everyone in the acting business wants to make the right choices,"" he told Esquire in 2012. ""You want to say no at the right time and you want to say yes more sparingly."" He works more than people think. It feels like Murray goes years between movies -- and, once upon a time, he did. Except for a small but nice turn in 1986's ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" Murray went four years between ""Razor's Edge"" and ""Scrooged"" -- he used the downtime to study at the Sorbonne -- and he made just a handful of films during the early and mid '90s. ""I've retired a couple of times. It's great, because you can just say, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I'm retired,' "" he told GQ's Fierman. ""And people will actually believe that you've retired. There are nutters out there that will go, 'Oh, OK!' and then leave you alone."" But since 1998's ""Wild Things"" and ""Rushmore,"" there's been plenty of Murray, including nine projects in 2014-15 alone, according to the Internet Movie Database. He won't be pressured into ""Ghostbusters 3."" Or any comedy, actually. Will Murray pop up in the new ""Ghostbusters,"" now being helmed by Paul Feig and starring a number of comic actresses? Who knows? In 2010 he was adamant that he wasn't going to do it for the (presumably substantial) money. ""It's the studio that really wants this thing. It's a franchise. It's a franchise, and they made a whole lot of money on 'Ghostbusters,' "" he told Fierman. And he's not so keen on a straight comedy, either. ""I think there's something that I can bring to a comedy today, but I don't know where to bring it,"" he said in 2012. ""I know that if I ever feel that I need to make a funny movie, I'll figure out how to write one. I'll get it done. If I ever get some ambition, I'm gonna get some s*** done."" He may look nonchalant, but he takes acting seriously. Perhaps Murray's most important teacher was improv great Del Close, with whom he worked at Chicago's Second City. ""He taught people to commit,"" he told Esquire. ""Like: 'Don't walk out there with one hand in your pocket unless there's somethin' in there you're going to bring out.' You gotta commit. You've gotta go out there and improvise and you've gotta be completely unafraid to die. You've got to be able to take a chance to die. And you have to die lots. You have to die all the time."" And he thought he was going to win an Oscar for ""Lost in Translation,"" which earned him his only Academy Award nomination. ""The one time I got a bunch of prizes, I just assumed I'd win them all,"" he told GQ. ""Because I'd been winning them all. I wasn't disappointed or anything, but I was surprised."" He's from a big family and he has a big family. Murray is the fifth child of nine. A number of his siblings are also in show business, including former ""SNL"" writer and cast member Brian Doyle-Murray, ""Mad Men"" actor Joel Murray and actor-writer John Murray. (A sister, Nancy, is a Dominican nun but also acts; she put on a one-woman show about St. Catherine of Siena.) He's also a father to a brood of six with two wives, and he takes fatherhood seriously -- and cheekily. While preparing for dinner during the Esquire interview, he told his then 10-year-old son, Lincoln, ""You're going to have to get dressed nicely. And you need a shower. That's an order."" His son responded, ""Yes, sir."" He also accompanied son Jackson to a 2013 Clemson-Florida State game in Clemson, which Jackson attends. As a witness reported on Billmurraystory.com, ""As I approached I noticed a young college girl covered in Seminole attire walk over to Murray and hand him an FSU themed football asking if he would sign it. Murray took the football from her, said ""Go Tigers"", PUNTED the football over the road into a big group of bushes, and ran off. It was single-handedly the funniest thing I have ever witnessed!"" He likes hanging out with you. (Well, maybe not you personally, but non-celebrity types.) The ""Murricane,"" as friend Mitch Glazer calls him, isn't much for security. He told The Associated Press' Jake Coyle that he generally trusts the public: ""Most people are fine,"" he said. The security wasn't worth it psychologically. ""From the first time I was ever given a bodyguard, I thought, 'Oh my God, I'm going to be assassinated.' It made me think I was going to be shot. So I never liked it. I never liked the sensation of it,"" he told Coyle. But the 800 number? That exists for a reason. ""When the phone started ringing too many times, I had to take it back to what I can handle. I take my chances on a job or a person as opposed to a situation,"" he told Esquire. Glazer is often his intermediary -- and, famously, the butt of one of Murray's favorite jokes. Glazer is married to actress Kelly Lynch, and when Murray sees Lynch's film ""Road House"" on TV, he'll call Glazer when the Lynch-Patrick Swayze sex scene comes on. ""Bill once called him from Russia,"" Lynch told the A.V. Club. And then there's ... well, you know. Several more reasons why we love Bill Murray: . • He crashed an engagement photo shoot. • He did karaoke with complete strangers. • He was busted for an allegedly drunken ride ... in a golf cart. In Stockholm. • He bartended at SXSW. Regardless of what you ordered, you could only get tequila. • He read poetry to construction workers. Perhaps his old friend and ""Groundhog Day"" director, Harold Ramis, put it best. Murray is ""all the Marx Brothers rolled into one: He's got the wit of Groucho, the pantomimic brilliance and lasciviousness of Harpo, and the Everyman quality of Chico.""

"(CNN) -- It's been 15 long months since he lifted a trophy and Andy Murray certainly did it the hard way. The Scot survived five match points against Tommy Robredo in the Shenzhen Open final Sunday before closing out a grueling three-set victory in two and a half hours. Following his 2013 triumph at Wimbledon, Murray had back surgery later that year and has struggled to match those heroics this year. He opted to play at the inaugural even in China and after battling to the final found himself a set down and trailing 2-6 in the second set tiebreaker. Showing typical fighting quality he saved the initial four match points and another at 7-6 down, before claiming the tiebreaker to level. The third set was one-sided as Murray won 5-7 7-6 6-1 and moves up to 10th in the race to make the ATP Tour Finals in London in November, with the top eight qualifying. ""It's been a long time since I won a tournament,"" Murray told the official ATP Tour website. ""The way that the match was won doesn't happen very often. It's rare to win a match like that. I was very close to losing. ""It was an emotional week for me. I managed to fight my way through it, win the title, and hopefully I can win another one before the end of the year."" Murray will stay in China for the ATP World Tour 500 tournament in Beijing and the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Shanghai, hoping to reach the finals for a seventh year in a row. He was claiming his 29th career title, the first since beating Novak Djokovic in last year's Wimbledon final. Robredo was also looking for his first title since last year and was disappointed to lose out after having so many chances. ""In a match like today that was so close, it's tough to accept it. But Andy did a great job. He was pushing right till the end and in the end, he deserved it,"" the Spaniard added.","Andy Murray wins Shenzhen Open in China .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic will look to seal a 24th straight win at the China Open final on Sunday after putting Andy Murray to the sword in Saturday's semis. The world No. 1 came through in straight sets 6-3 6-4 against the Scot to book a place in the final against Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic. ""I'm glad that I'm back in the form that I would like to be in, especially in these courts where I still haven't lost ever since I played this tournament,"" Djokovic said, the ATPTour website reported. ""Hopefully I can finish the year in style, similar as I finished last year."" The Serb is seeking to clinch his 46th ATP Tour title against the big Czech who won the tournament himself in 2011 -- Djokovic did not play that year because of a back injury. Berdych overcame Rafael Nadal's conqueror Martin Klizan in straight sets 6-4 6-1 in his semifinal and is relishing the prospect of ending Djokovic's incredible run of victories. ""Playing against the No. 1 player in the world is always a bit special,"" Berdych said. ""Novak is playing in incredible form again. He has a great record playing here at the China Open,"" he added. ""There is a new challenge, a new day, a new opportunity for me. I'm going to try to go there, try to take my chance and, again, try to play my tennis. Let's see what I can do with that.""

"(CNN) -- A snowplow driver who's been blamed by Russian authorities for a plane crash that killed the chief executive of the oil company Total has been sent to pretrial detention, his lawyer said Thursday. Snowplow driver Vladimir Martynenko has denied claims by Russian officials that he was drunk at the time of the crash Monday at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport. Total CEO Christophe de Margerie and three others were killed after his plane hit the snowplow during takeoff and crashed. Four other airport employees have also been detained in connection with the crash, a Russian investigative committee said earlier. They are: the airport service chief engineer, Vladimir Ledenev, who's in charge of snow-clearing operations; flights director Roman Dunayev; air traffic controller Svetlana Krivsun; and the airport's chief air traffic controller, Alexander Kruglov. ""Investigators believe the detained persons failed to provide safety requirements concerning flights and on-ground works and it led to the tragedy,"" a statement from the investigative committee said. ""They have been detained and questioned as suspects in the case."" Amid the fallout from the incident, the airport's director general, Andrei Dyakov, and deputy director general Sergei Solntsev have resigned, the airport said in a statement Thursday. Their resignations have been accepted. The airport's shift director, the head of the airport's maintenance division and the leading engineer who heads the shift have been suspended from duties. Blood test . Martynenko's lawyer, Aleksandr Karabanov, told CNN that a court decided Thursday to place him in detention. ""The judge explained her decision, saying that the court decided that Martynenko could escape, put pressure on trial participants or destroy the evidence,"" Karabanov said. He said the judge had also introduced a doctor's certificate with results of a preliminary medical examination. She said that according to that data, Martynenko was found to be drunk, but the final results would be known and announced in five to seven days. ""I found it's ridiculous and it makes no sense,"" Karabanov said. ""During that medical examination, Martynenko had a blood test that would show whether there was alcohol in his blood. It always takes only a day or two to get the results. Why are we still not given any?"" He said he was convinced his client was sober at the time. Log book . Karabanov said at a news conference Wednesday that Martynenko had passed a daily ""medical examination"" that all snowplow operators at the airport are required to take before reporting for duty. The lawyer said the results of the test were recorded in a log book that investigators now have. According to the lawyer, Martynenko became separated from a convoy of snowplows after he heard a strange sound and stopped briefly to check his equipment. The lawyer speculated that an unnamed air traffic controller saw the other snowplows in the convoy and cleared the runway without realizing that Martynenko's machine was still there. The French government has deployed three investigators and two technical consultants from its aviation authority to also investigate the crash. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Phil Black reported from Moscow, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","NEW: Judge orders snowplow driver involved in crash to be held in pretrial detention .

"Turkish-Syrian border (CNN) -- In the besieged Syrian city of Kobani, precious medicine rains from the sky. Antibiotics, anesthetics, sanitary supplies and bandages -- all desperately needed to treat local fighters and civilians wounded during the siege of this crucial town near the Turkish border. U.S. airplanes are dropping medical supplies and weapons into this Kurdish city as defenders try to beat back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Not long ago, Kobani's fall to ISIS seemed certain. But foreign airstrikes and airdropped supplies could help turn the tide. ""We thank the people who brought these medical supplies,"" said Dr. Walat Omar, who has been braving enemy artillery for weeks to treat the wounded at a makeshift clinic. In exclusive video obtained by CNN from inside Kobani, Omar showed boxes of medicine in his clinic received from the airdrops. Even though local defenders control some 70% of the city, Kobani is cut off, and ISIS forces have been shelling it with mortars from the east and south, local government official Anwar Muslim said this week. More than 100,000 refugees have fled to Turkey amid weeks of intense fighting by Kurdish forces for full control of Kobani, a border town that's one of the last in the region to resist falling to ISIS. Opinion: ISIS reveals its strategy . In the wrong hands? But some of the supplies may have landed in the hands of ISIS. One of the 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani on Monday drifted away from its target zone, a U.S. official said. The U.S. military said it went back and blasted it. But a video posted on social media shows what appears to be an ISIS fighter next to a parachute bundle. He goes on to show what appears to be the contents of the bundle, including crates of hand grenades and mortar rounds. CNN cannot independently confirm whether the items in the video are from a U.S. airdrop. Officials: Denver girls played hooky from school, tried to join ISIS . Fighting in Kobani continued Wednesday, with six Kurdish defenders killed and the bodies of 10 ISIS fighters recovered, a Kurdish fighter there said. Mortars fired from the city's east -- presumably by ISIS -- hit the city center, the fighter said. Battles in Iraq continue . As Kurdish fighters keep battling ISIS in Syria, the militant group continues its offensive in Iraq. The Iraqi military and tribal forces tried to repel an attack on Amriyat al Falluja on Wednesday, said Anbar province Deputy Gov. Faleh al-Essawi. Amriyat al Falluja is about 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Falluja. At least six suicide bombings and more than 70 mortar attacks targeting government forces were counted Wednesday, al-Essawi said. He said there are casualties on both sides, but the numbers were not immediately known. Ivan Watson reported from the Turkish-Syrian border; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Barbara Starr, Kareem Khadder and Brian Walker and journalist Odai Sadik contributed to this report.","A doctor in Kobani expresses gratitude for airdropped medical supplies .

"(CNN) -- Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to withdraw their troops from the area surrounding a disputed border temple, the official Thai news agency MCOT reported. The two countries reached a deal to implement an order by the International Court of Justice to put in place a ""provisional demilitarized zone"" around the Preah Vihear temple, MCOT cited Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh as saying at a news conference on Wednesday. Thai and Cambodian troops had clashed in the area around the temple earlier this year, displacing thousands of people on both sides and causing at least 20 deaths. A joint working group will be set up to discuss the rules governing the demilitarized zone, Banh said after meeting with the Thai defense minister, General Yutthasak Sasiprapa, in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The troop withdrawals, to be carried out as soon as possible, will be supervised by observers from Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Banh said. Cambodia had asked the International Court of Justice, the United Nation's highest court, to intervene and order Thai troops out of the area. The court, instead, ruled in July that both sides must withdraw their troops to avoid more casualties. The 11th century temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. In 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the U.N. says has outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple.","Thailand and Cambodia agree to implement a court order on a disputed temple .
