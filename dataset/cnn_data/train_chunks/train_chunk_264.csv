"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Immigrant rights activists are calling on U.S. retailers to stop selling two controversial ""Illegal Alien"" costumes that have surfaced for Halloween, saying the outfits are a broadside attack on illegal immigrants. The ""Illegal Alien"" costume was being offered by retailers including Target, Walgreens and Amazon.com. The ""Illegal Alien Adult Costume,"" manufactured by Forum novelties, includes an orange jumpsuit, similar to prison garb, with ""Illegal Alien"" stamped in black across the chest; a space alien mask; and a fake Green Card. The ""Illegal Alien Mask with Hat"" also includes a space alien mask, this time with a dark handlebar mustache and a baseball cap. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles said it began receiving e-mails from concerned legal immigrants on Friday. In response, CHIRLA wrote a letter asking several retailers, including Target, Walgreens, and Amazon.com, to stop offering the costume. As of Saturday afternoon, Target had pulled the products, and some links to the costumes on other sites were no longer functional. Target said the ""Illegal Alien"" costume was inadvertently uploaded to its Web site due to a data entry error. ""It is never our intent to offend the consumers with the products we offer,"" a company statement said. The makers of the costumes could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Jorge-Mario Cabrera, the director of communications for CHIRLA, said he initially thought the costume was a stab at harmless satire. But when he saw the Green Card, he realized it was an swipe at illegal immigrants. ""This was an ignorant attempt to poke fun at a small community,"" said Cabrera. Political satire and Halloween often merge. Costumes depicting former well-known political figures are often seen along side those depicting Batman or Wonder Woman. To some, the attempted humor of the costumes falls flat. Guillermo Iglesias said both of his parents were illegal immigrants in the United States. He felt the costumes were offensive because they depicted illegal immigrants as ""not one of us."" ""I have a lot of illegal immigrant friends,"" said Iglesias. ""If I showed them that costume, it would really hurt them."" Despite the controversy, some stores say the costumes have been a hit. ""It's a very well-recommended costume,"" said an employee at Ricky's, a costume store in New York City. The store has sold seven costumes for $39.99 apiece and is set to receive another shipment. William Gheen, the president of Americans for Legal Immigration, said he intends to buy the costume, and calls the reaction unfounded. ""The only people getting upset are the hyper-sensitive, over-politically correct, pro-amnesty, illegal alien-supporting nuts,"" said Gheen. ""You can't attack people's freedom in this country."" ""I think having a costume like that is distasteful,"" said Andrea Hill, outside of Ricky's. ""But if it's not illegal, I think it's alright for them to sell it.""","Costume comes with jumpsuit, space alien mask and fake Green Card .

"Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Read his column here . Ruben Navarrette says people shouldn't blame their failures on competition from illegal immigrants. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Here's the good news: Authorities say that fewer illegal immigrants are crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border in the last five months are down 24 percent from the same period last year. At the current rate, the level of apprehension this year could be the lowest since 1975. A big reason is the frightful U.S. economy. After all, you don't often see people trying to break into a house when the house is on fire. Some illegal immigrants are even going home to Mexico. But here's the bad news: There are still plenty of illegal immigrants in the United States who have families here, and they aren't leaving. And apparently those who are here are, because of the bad economy, more threatening than ever to those low-skilled U.S. workers who have to compete with them. And now this issue has become part of the debate over the economic stimulus law recently signed by President Obama. Researchers at The Heritage Foundation and the Center for Immigration Studies (which favors limiting all immigration, even the legal kind) estimate that illegal immigrants could fill as many as 300,000 construction jobs. That's about 15 percent of the 2 million jobs that new taxpayer-financed projects are expected to create. Advocacy groups say there is no way to predict how many jobs might go to illegal immigrants. No matter. The topic is grist for talk radio and those blood-pressure-raising curmudgeons on cable TV. Why, they ask, should American tax dollars go to illegal immigrants? As if illegal immigrants don't pay taxes. They do -- sales taxes, property taxes, even income taxes thanks to something called an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number), which Uncle Sam helpfully created to allow those who don't have valid Social Security numbers to still dread April 15. Conservatives are miffed that Congress ignored their pleas to require employers who compete for stimulus funds to use the E-verify program. Run by the Department of Homeland Security, that program lets those employers who choose to participate verify the validity of Social Security numbers provided by new hires. But the E-verify system needs to have its own accuracy verified. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2007, DHS commissioned an independent study of the program, which found that ""the database used for verification is still not sufficiently up to date to meet the requirements for accurate verification."" The error rate was almost 10 percent. Someone using a valid Social Security card that doesn't belong to him would go undetected. Oh, is that all? I understand that there is a larger issue here. As I've said for the last 15 years of writing about immigration, those who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted and jailed. But, in those cases where illegal immigrants squeak by and wind up on the job, U.S. workers have to compete with them, like it or not. And that brings me to what really bothers me about this controversy. It's a sad state of affairs when people who were born in this, the freest and most prosperous country on Earth -- instantly becoming U.S. citizens, no less -- with a free education and every other opportunity to improve their lives find themselves afraid to compete with a group of people who don't have legal status, often can't speak English, and usually have no more than a 6th-grade education. My fellow Americans, stop your trembling. Show some dignity. If you don't like competing with illegal immigrants, try making better choices. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Turn off those TV shows that constantly bash globalization and immigration. Go back to school. Get more training. Move out of the comfort zone of your hometown to take a job in another state, if necessary. Take responsibility for your own life. And stop thinking the world owes you a living. That was the ""tough love"" message I shared with the construction worker who called into a Las Vegas, Nevada, radio show about a year ago to complain that construction firms on the Strip were paying the same wage they were 20 years earlier. The caller blamed illegal immigrants, who he said were keeping wages low. It's interesting that he didn't blame the companies that employed the firms, or the firms themselves. And of course, he never thought to look in the mirror and blame himself for not taking steps to improve his skills in the last 20 years. Maybe he could have gone into a different line of work long ago. He decided not to. I suppose illegal immigrants were to blame for that, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Critics of stimulus plan say it will employ illegal immigrants .

"(CNN) -- There's plenty of gay-rights news to celebrate this week: . -- On Monday, a federal judge threw out Oregon's ban on same-sex marriages, writing that his decision was one in support of ""families committed to the common purpose of love, devotion and service to the greater community."" -- On Tuesday, the same thing, more or less, happened in Pennsylvania, with a judge in that case writing that ""we are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history."" (I mean, wow, right?) -- And, for those would might say ""activist judges"" are behind all of this progress, please note that Gallup on Wednesday released data showing 55% of Americans -- a greater percentage than ever shown in that group's polling -- support same-sex marriage rights. So, in summary: The era of same-sex marriage is upon us; even those who grimaced at NFL player Michael Sam's boyfriend kiss probably can see that; and, therefore, all's well that ends well. Well, not so much. In the march toward marriage equality, the United States skipped over other rights that are more fundamental and perhaps more essential for LGBT people. Consider three facts: . 1. It's legal for employers to fire gay and lesbian people because of their sexual orientation in not one or two fringe states but in 29 of them, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group that tracks these things. That's a majority of states where it's legal to fire someone simply for being gay. ""It's important to note that, while same-sex couples can legally marry today in Pennsylvania, they can actually be fired from their jobs for talking about their new spouses at work,"" Charlie Joughin, spokesman for HRC, wrote in an e-mail to me. Related: No one should be fired for being gay . 2. Related to that, there also are 29 states where it's legal for landlords to evict gay and lesbian residents simply because of their sexual orientation. That's true not just of places such as Mississippi but also states with more progressive reputations, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. 3. Some states make it onerously difficult, if not impossible, for transgender people to legally change their names and update the gender that's listed on their state ID or driver's license. Maybe that sounds inconsequential, but consider going to the airport with an ID that doesn't match who you are and having to explain your gender identity to a TSA agent. ""There are 15 (states) that we would give an F"" on these issues, said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality. Progress is coming but much too slowly in some cases. The first employment nondiscrimination laws were passed in East Lansing and Ann Arbor, Michigan, according to Michael Bronski's ""A Queer History of the United States."" The year was 1972. A range of cities and corporations have come up with their own nondiscrimination policies and rules in the decades since, but state and federal movement has been sluggish. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act passed the U.S. Senate last year but has been a nonstarter in House, thanks to Speaker John Boehner. To be fair, there are campaigns from LGBT rights groups to put in place these basic protections. The Human Rights Campaign, for instance, started Project One America to ""dramatically expand LGBT equality in the South,"" including freedom from discrimination, which is rampant in that region. But it's clear marriage equality has been the primary focus, for the public, activists and for the news media. There are some reasonable explanations for that. Some would argue, for instance, that campaigns for marriage equality have helped people realize gay and lesbian people are loving and family-oriented -- and that greater protections will follow that awakening. I hope that's right, but it's no sure thing. We're starting to see ourselves in America as a beacon of progressiveness and opportunity for LGBT people. But we also need to acknowledge the reality -- which is that this also is a country where basic protections remain worryingly absent.","John Sutter: The U.S. lacks some very basic protections for LGBT people .

"(CNN) -- The ugly specter of anti-Semitism in football has raised its face again after a man was arrested at an English Premier League game. Police confirmed that a 57-year-old man was arrested and charged on ""suspicion of a racially aggravated offense"" at Sunday's match between Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton. Tottenham's fanbase has a large Jewish contingent, and they originally called themselves ""Yid Army"" in response to anti-Semitic abuse from rival supporters, but the offense did not relate to the ""Y-word."" The club has often experienced abuse by its London rivals but this incident was unusual given the lack of animosity between Tottenham and Southampton. The latest incident involved anti-Semitic abuse and the man, who was sitting in the visitors' section at Tottenham's White Hart Lane, was reported by two Southampton supporters to police. A statement from the London Metropolitan Police read: ""During the Tottenham vs. Southampton match at White Hart Lane on March 23, officers in the stadium received a complaint regarding the behavior of a man sat in an area reserved for away supporters. ""The complaint was made by two people sat in the same area of the stadium. ""Officers arrested the man, aged 57, on suspicion of a racially aggravated offense under section five of the Public Order Act. ""He was taken into custody and subsequently bailed until May 19, pending further investigation."" Tottenham regards itself as being proactive in its fight against racism and told CNN in a statement that ""anti-Semitism in any form is wholly unacceptable and we support all efforts to kick it out of the game."" Last year the English Football Association had warned football fans that they would face criminal prosecution if they continued to chant the Y-word, which has been deemed anti-Semitic even as a segment of Tottenham fans claim they're using the word in defiance of anti-Semitism. Earlier this month, charges were dropped against three Spurs fans who were accused of using the word ""yid"" while at a Tottenham game. The Community Security Trust, which monitors incidents of anti-Semitism in the United Kingdom, has been outspoken in its fight against the problem. ""In recent years anti-Semitism in football has been an increasingly important issue,"" a spokesman told CNN. ""CST and other Jewish organizations have worked closely with the FA and Kick it Out to try and deal with the problem and we will keep doing so. ""Racism should have no place in football and that includes anti-Semitism."" A spokesman for Southampton told CNN: ""As the Metropolitan Police have confirmed, this is an ongoing investigation and as such we are unable to comment at this time."" The incident comes weeks after former West Bromwich Albion striker Nicolas Anelka was fined Â£80,000 ($130,000) by the English Football Association after making the ""quenelle"" gesture during a match in December. Anelka, who has since left the club, was widely criticized for the gesture -- -- which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand -- after scoring against West Ham. The gesture, which he said was dedicated to his comedian friend Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala -- who uses it as part of his act -- is believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-Semitism in Anelka's homeland, France. An Independent Regulatory Commission was asked to consider if the gesture was ""abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper,"" and ""included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief."" Both charges were proved, said the commission, but it added it did not believe Anelka to be anti-Semitic.","Fan arrested for anti-Semitic abuse at Tottenham's game against Southampton .

"(CNN) -- In a 5-4 decision, Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down limits on the total amount people can donate to various political campaigns in an election season, a blow to federal election laws ahead of November's congressional midterm elections. Jeffrey Toobin, CNN senior legal analyst, answers some questions about how this ruling works and its possible consequences. What exactly does this ruling do? Are some limits still in place? The court left intact the law that sets a $5,200 limit on the amount individuals can give to any single candidate in a campaign cycle, but struck down the $123,000 aggregate limit an individual can give to candidates in that time period. Wednesday's ruling declares the $123,200 limit unconstitutional. So now individuals can give up to $5,200 to as many candidates as they like. Does this mean money will influence campaigns more than ever? Who is most likely to gain? The decision gives rich people more power to influence campaigns. It expands the influence of people who have a lot of money to give. The end of the $123,200 overall limit means that people who have even more money to spend have more ways to spend it. Is this a First Amendment issue? The protection of political speech? Chief Justice Roberts' opinion said that campaign contributions can be regulated by Congress, but only under narrow circumstances. The only permissible laws ban what the court calls quid pro quo corruption -- in other words, bribes in the form of campaign contributions. Because spreading the money around to lots of candidates does not present the risk of bribes to any individual candidate, according to the court, the overall limits had to be struck down. How does this compare with Citizens United? This decision is similar to Citizens United, with a similar rationale. Citizens United was the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for political donations from corporations and special interest groups. The Roberts court believes in a simple idea -- spending money in political campaigns is the equivalent of political speech. Because the First Amendment prohibits most limits on speech, most limits on political contributions are in the process of being struck down. What does this means for the future of campaign finance? The next big question is whether the court will also strike down the $5,200 limit on individual contributions. In fact, very few people ran up against the $123,200 limit, so the practical effect of Wednesday's decision is limited. But lots of people give up to $5,200. Ending that limit would have a huge impact on political campaigns. What are the chances of the court ending the $5,200 limit? Justice Clarence Thomas said in a separate concurring opinion Wednesday that he thought the court should get rid of the $5,200 limit, but no other justices joined him -- yet. The decision was 5-4, so the four dissenters want to preserve campaign finance limits. The real question is whether the four other justices in the majority will join Thomas. It's hard to say. What's clear is that the court is looking for new ways to stop the regulation of political contributions -- and it's already stopped a lot of them. What's behind all these decisions? The core idea of the five justices in the majority is that spending money on political campaigns is a form of speech. The First Amendment strictly limits regulation of speech. Once you believe that money is speech, most campaign finance limits become unconstitutional.","High court struck down $123,000 overall limit you can give candidates in an election .
Jeffrey Toobin: Ruling expands influence of rich people most likely to run up against a limit .
Toobin: Court left intact $5,200 limit on what you can give to one candidate .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Watch CNN's TV theme week Comic Book Heroes from June 10-17 on World Report, CNN Newstream and I-desk. Ten years ago a Kuwaiti graduate from an American business school took a cab ride through London. By the end of the journey he had formed an idea which would spread across the world. It was the wake of 9/11, and Dr. Naif Al-Mutawa decided to create Islamic superheroes. Islamic religion and culture had become a global talking point and instead of complaining about the representation of his culture, Al-Mutawa decided to re-define it. ""Everytime something terrible happens in the name of my culture, my culture becomes diluted. I wanted to grab the bull by the horns and change it,"" Al-Mutawa explained in an interview with CNN. And so the CEO of Teshkeel Media Group created 'The 99' -- a comic book series inspired by principles within his faith. The series follows 99 superheroes whose powers are based on the Qu'ran's 99 Virtues of Allah: strength, courage and wisdom among them. Caped crusaders on patrol - meet the real life superheroes . But it was important to Al-Mutawa that his heroes possess universal values while at the same time offering fans something different from the comic books of DC and Marvel. ""It doesn't matter what culture you're from, it can still resonate. What The 99 does is saying 'Hey, our values, they're the same as yours; they're the same as the rest of the world. Let's just focus on the positives of this."" To be able to launch his project, Dr. Naif Al-Matawa had to call in the help of investors, eventually raising enough money. The series debuted in 2006 and its success spread quickly over the world, even turning into an animated series now showing in 70 countries. The big break however came in 2010 when the Justice League with Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, teamed up with 'The 99'. DC Comics had agreed to a six-issue crossover. More Comic Book Heroes: Superheroes on the big screen . ""Those story lines start off with distrust between the two groups of superheroes and they find out in Book 2 that actually it's the bad guys from both universes causing the distrust an then they fight together cape to shoulder and move it over to trust"" The union of the two comic book universes, fighting together cape to shoulder, won the praise from U.S. president Barack Obama. At the 2010 Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship, Obama mentioned the work of Dr. Naif Al-Matawa. ""His comic books have captured the imagination of so many young people, with superheroes who embody the teachings and tolerance of Islam. In his comic books, Superman and Batman reached out to their Muslim counterparts. And I hear they are making progress, too."" But the journey of 'The 99' hasn't been marked only by praise. The animated version was originally banned in Saudi Arabia and both Europe and the U.S. have been slow to embrace the Islamic superheroes. More Comic Book Heroes: Muslim superheroes series meets resistance in U.S. Trying to spark a higher interest among Americans, Dr. Naif Al-Mutawa invited a group of students from Boston to Kuwait in the spring of 2013. They discussed the differences and similarities between the universes of DC and Marvel and the universe of 'The 99'. A student in attendance pointed out the costume of one of the female superheroes in 'The 99'. ""One of the differences I noticed was, I guess there was an issue in the Islamic world that all the women were not wearing Burkhas, but in the United States, people were upset that one of the women was wearing a Burkha."" Being proactive in the way the Islamic culture is represented to the outside world is what's important to Dr. Naif Al-Matawa and he hopes he can have a positive influence on how the future generations of the Western culture will perceive it. ""For me to have been able to make kind of a dent, even if it's a small dent on how Islam is perceived to my children, I believe, which was my intent to begin with, I have achieved that and hopefully I've been able to have that influence on their children as well.""","""The 99"" is a comic book series created by Dr. Naif Al-Mutawa.

"(CNN) -- How will El Niño affect hurricane season? It depends on the ocean, forecasters say. Forecasters announced Thursday that the Atlantic hurricane season likely will have fewer storms than the average year, while in the Pacific, the numbers might be higher. The outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center forecast three to six hurricanes, with one or two major hurricanes for the Atlantic season, which begins June 1. There likely will be eight to 13 named storms in the Atlantic. ""It doesn't matter whether we get one or a dozen, it matters which one(s) hit land and what land it hits,"" CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said. About 40% of Americans live in counties on a shoreline, said Holly Bamford, the assistant administrator for NOAA's National Ocean Service. El Niño, characterized by warmer water in the equatorial Pacific, increases strong wind shear in the Atlantic, which reduces the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes and prevents other systems from becoming powerful enough to be named storms. The Atlantic Ocean is also cooler than in recent years. ""We are currently seeing strong trade winds and wind shear over the tropical Atlantic, and NOAA's climate models predict these conditions will persist, in part because of El Niño,"" said Gerry Bell, NOAA's lead hurricane season forecaster. The Atlantic hurricane season runs through November 30. The region includes the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and north Atlantic Ocean. Last year there were 11 tropical storms and two hurricanes. The center said there was a 70% chance there would be 14 to 20 named storms for the Eastern Pacific, with seven to 11 hurricanes, with the likelihood of three to six being Category 3 hurricanes or stronger (winds greater than 100 mph). That would be near normal or above normal. ""El Niño decreases the vertical wind shear over the eastern tropical Pacific, favoring more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes,"" Bell said. It is extremely rare for an Eastern Pacific hurricane to affect the U.S. mainland, though some do have an influence on Hawaii. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through November 30. Last year there were nine tropical storms and nine hurricanes. There is a 65% chance of an El Niño forming, the center said on May 8.","There is a possibility of more hurricanes in the Eastern Pacific, fewer in the Atlantic, forecasters say .
Winds from El Niño should lessen the intensity of storms in the Atlantic .
What counts is how many storms make landfall and where they hit, CNN meteorologist says ."
"(CNN) -- One day last September, I stumbled upon an article about retired NFL linemen who were struggling with their weight. A study mentioned in the article showed the life expectancy for those former linemen was significantly shorter than their normal weight peers. It made sense: How many older people do you know who are 6-foot-3 and weigh more than 350 pounds? People that size don't really grow old. I had already decided that I needed to make some lifestyle changes regarding my own health. But as a former football player, reading that article hit me hard. My first course of action was to buy a scale; I hadn't been on an accurate one in years. The scale in my doctor's office would only go up to 350 pounds. Just to be safe I looked for a scale that had a maximum of 400 pounds. I set the scale on my bathroom floor, and exhaled as much air as I could as I stood on it. The next few seconds were followed by a rush of emotions -- shock, disbelief, frustration and anger. I weighed 383 pounds. How did I get to this point? As I looked back on the previous few years, I realized that I was not a happy person. Within a year's time, I had turned 40, become a single father and lost my biggest supporter: my mom. I was disappointed in the direction my personal and professional life was taking. And I was using food to cope. My name is Ron, and I am a food addict . I used to read a poem to my student athletes that said, ""You can't fool the guy in the mirror."" But yet that is what I had been trying to do. I thought I was destined to be a large individual for the rest of my life, and I questioned my ability to lose a significant amount weight at my age. The self doubt was prevalent in my mind. The more I felt sorry for myself, the more I ate. It was a vicious cycle. I realized that this decision to change my life was about more than just losing weight. I had to lose my inner critic. I had to lose the ropes that were tying me to the past. More importantly, I had to lose this black cloud hanging over my head. I had only myself to blame, and I knew I was the only one who could fix it. Exercise quickly replaced food as my comfort in life. Where I once turned to fast food in times of stress and frustration, I instead found myself going to the gym. The more I exercised, the more weight started to drop off. From a minute to a mile: Learning to run . It was a slow climb out of the personal hole I was in, but I found that eating right and exercising were the best remedies to change my outlook on life. When I got to the 50-pound milestone, I decided to look at my wardrobe. I had a closet full of bad memories and BIG clothes. For instance, I had a shirt that I wore to my 25th high school reunion. I hated it when I saw pictures of how heavy I looked in it. So why did I keep it? I didn't have to think twice now about giving it away. It took at least two hours to finish cleaning out the closet. When I was done, I had five heaping garbage bags full of clothes. It was a gratifying experience to lose that much clutter from my life. The best part came when someone asked if they could take those clothes off my hands. I shared my story with that person when he picked them up. Maybe he'll be giving them away again in the near future. I firmly believe that if I can make these lifestyle changes, that anyone can. We all have something to lose.

"(CNN) -- History was made on two fronts when Joao Sousa beat Julien Benneteau to win the Malaysian Open. While Sousa celebrated becoming the first Portuguese man to claim an ATP title, Benneteau wasn't nearly as joyous. He slumped to 0-9 in finals to tie the unwanted men's record in the Open era, which began in 1968. Is he tennis' unlucky loser? Benneteau's fellow Frenchman, Cedric Pioline, and American Pat Dupre also lost their first nine finals, although Pioline went on to triumph five times -- he was a two-time grand slam finalist -- and Dupre ended his drought in Hong Kong in 1982. No man has lost his first 10 finals in the Open era, said the ATP. Benneteau was so close to overturning his woe in finals, too, holding a match point in the second set Sunday against Sousa. He did little wrong on the point, approaching the net with a good forehand, but Sousa unleashed a stunning forehand down the line. Benneteau then wasted a flurry of break points in the final set and fell 2-6 7-5 6-4. French sports daily L'Equipe used the headline, 'Benneteau, nothing new,' when referring to his defeat on its website, and the player tweeted a picture of what looked like a beer accompanied by the words: 'To forget.' ""I tried everything today,"" Benneteau, 31, told the ATP's website. ""I played very well, particularly I was very aggressive and I didn't let him play for two sets almost. I had match point and I played the point perfectly. ""It's hard, it's very hard. I was leading the match, but this is tennis."" Sousa couldn't stop smiling during the trophy presentation but spared a thought for Benneteau. ""I knew (about Benneteau's previous finals),"" he told the ATP's website. ""I feel bad for him."" That Sousa, 24, trumped compatriots Michelle Larcher de Brito and Gastao Elias by winning a title came as a surprise, since Larcher de Brito was a top prospect reared at Nick Bollettieri's famed academy in Florida and Elias once ranked sixth as a junior. But Sousa, mentored by Rafael Nadal's part-time coach Francisco Roig, entered Kuala Lumpur in good form, reaching the semifinals in St. Petersburg. He upset top-seed David Ferrer en route to the final in Kuala Lumpur and is now Portugal's highest-ranked player at No. 51. ""People can start to know Portuguese tennis and I think that's great,"" said Sousa. Top two in Beijing . Nadal will almost certainly reclaim the No. 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic during the Asian swing and both see action Tuesday at the China Open. Djokovic meets Nadal's conqueror at Wimbledon in 2012, Lukas Rosol, and Nadal faces Colombian Santiago Giraldo. Lleyton Hewitt was among the winners on the opening day of competition in Beijing as he beat German Tommy Haas in straight sets. Fellow Australian Bernard Tomic also advanced after seeing off China's No.1 Ze Zhang. In the women's tournament, Germany's Andrea Petkovic knocked out Belarusian second seed Victoria Azarenka. The momentum swung between the two players but it was Petkovic who won the decisive third set, taking the last two games to love to claim a 6-4 2-6 6-4 win. ""It was an awful match and a very bad performance from me, so there's not much to say about it,"" said U.S. Open runner-up Azarenka. ""I don't feel like I was ready to play - the preparation wasn't enough, I cannot deny that. It's my mistake for not paying enough attention after the U.S .Open how I managed my time and managed my health.""","Julien Benneteau slumped to 0-9 in finals after losing a thriller against Joao Sousa .

Yes, you will still find humidity and sunburned tourists, but also a diverse Tampa Bay area community that includes Greeks, Cubans and Scientologists. The area consists of the cities surrounding Tampa Bay. Four bridges cross this large expanse of water linking the bay area together. As the signs warn you, check for gas before you drive across the three-mile Howard Frankland Bridge. With miles of open water on both sides and pelicans flying by, it's hard to find a better commute. iReport: Share photos and tips for the Tampa Bay area . In the summer of '97, I moved with my family to the Tampa Bay area from Georgia. ""We live where people vacation,"" my mom loved to say. My parents bought a house with a pool in which we swam every day after school. We met Dad at the beach after work for dinner where we lost a sandwich here and there to a few daring seagulls. Tampa's great weather made all of this possible. As I've traveled around America's peninsula, I've noticed that compared with other Sunshine State destinations, Tampa's climate is superior. The breeze coming off the bay cools everything down. Yes, it's hot, but the light wind makes it bearable, and in the winter, there are never more than three weeks of uncomfortable cold. Many winters you'll find yourself on the beach and even in the water as late as October. (Take that, landlocked Charlotte). iReport: Share photos and tips for Charlotte . In downtown Tampa, the Hillsborough River carries diverse creatures from manatees to rowers through a collection of old factories and new office buildings. Along the winding river, the onion dome-topped buildings at the University of Tampa add to the unusual skyline. The campus was originally a grand hotel built by the railroad mogul Henry B. Plant, who saw an opportunity in Tampa with its central location in Florida and scenic landscapes. Follow the Hillsborough River out of the city, and you'll quickly find Tampa's natural beauty. The placid waters make for an extremely relaxing canoe trip. The low hanging trees create a beautiful canopy along the river, and the surrounding trails offer perfect weekend escapes for hikers. The river is just the beginning of Tampa's aquatic allure. Tampa is less than 20 minutes from some of the best beaches in the country. Whether you spend the day sipping daiquiris on the more commercialized beaches in Clearwater or travel south to the quieter Fort De Soto Beach, you'll be blown away by the white sandy shores and warm water. Just don't forget to do the stingray shuffle as you wade into the surf. City smackdown: New York vs. Los Angeles . Back on shore, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival is an annual event not to be missed. At the end of January, locals and tourists take out their finest eyepatches and polish their hooks in an event named after the swashbuckling pirate Jose Gaspar, who prowled the waters off the state's western coast during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. While hundreds of boats clog the waterways surrounding downtown Tampa, thousands of people enjoy a parade on land. I hear a little drinking goes on too. There's no need to drive all the way to Orlando for Disney when Tampa is home to one of Florida's greatest theme parks. Busch Gardens has a large variety of roller coasters and other stomach-churning rides. For those less-daring patrons, this African-themed park has a multitude of exotic animals. My favorite stop is always the giraffes on the Serengeti. Destination USA: Miami beyond the beaches . The Tampa Bay area is home to many diverse communities. In Ybor (that's pronounced E-bor), an old cigar factory community with Spanish, Cuban and Italian roots, you can watch cigar rollers' tobacco-stained hands quickly assemble cigar after cigar. More importantly, you may sample a Cuban sandwich. The popular Columbia Restaurant, founded in 1905 by a Cuban immigrant, attracts locals and tourists with flamenco dancers and authentic Spanish food. Traveling west, you'll find Tarpon Springs, where you can watch divers unload natural sea sponges from their boats and enjoy the Greek pastries and cuisine first brought to town by the community's early residents. Or head south and stroll through charming downtown Dunedin, a small town with a rich Scottish background where you might catch a bagpipe performance by Dunedin High School's band. Even Tom Cruise finds himself in the Tampa Bay area, as downtown Clearwater is the spiritual headquarters of Scientology. For a peek at surrealism, head to the Dali Museum in neighboring St. Petersburg to see the largest collection of Spanish artist Salvador Dali's work outside of Spain. Tampa's interesting mix of people has not gone unnoticed. While the majority of Florida votes Republican, Tampa, along with Miami and Orlando, is going to be one of Florida's few deciding factors in this year's election. The entire area is buzzing with anticipation for those days in August when the Republican National Convention will draw America's attention to Tampa. Tampa or Charlotte?

"(CNN) -- Federal safety investigators cast new concerns about using lithium-ion batteries to power systems on commercial aircraft, saying they should be put through rigorous tests that produce ""the most severe outcomes"" before being approved for use in the skies. The National Transportation Safety Board issued the recommendations on Thursday as it continues to investigate lithium-ion batteries on Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Two batteries on those aircraft self-combusted on planes last year. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing have vouched for the safety of the Dreamliner's re-designed battery system. And the NTSB said those changes are consistent with its new recommendations. But the safety board said the FAA needs to revise its 2008 battery standards for all aircraft, which remain in effect. Batteries should be tested in conditions that closely resemble the conditions on planes, the safety board said. They should undergo ""abuse tests"" in which cells are intentionally damaged. And they should be tested in ways that produce ""the most severe outcomes."" Such tests can show whether the batteries experience thermal runaway, an uncontrollable increase in temperature and pressure that can spread -- or cascade -- to adjacent cells. Thermal runaways typically result in smoke, a known concern when the FAA approved the Dreamliner battery. But smoke events were thought to be rare, and engineers designed ways to vent the smoke. But one witness to a Dreamliner battery incident described ""heavy smoke,"" a small, 3-inch flame coming from the battery case and material spewing out like molten wax . Aircraft manufacturers need to ensure that systems protect ""against all adverse effects."" ""The NTSB is vitally interested in these recommendations because they are designed to prevent accidents and save lives,"" the board wrote in a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. The Dreamliner is the first large commercial aircraft to use permanently installed lithium-ion batteries as it main battery and for its auxiliary power unit, or APU. The batteries are valued because they are small, lightweight and powerful. The NTSB says that in seeking certification of its batteries, Boeing and battery manufacturer GS Yuasa Corp. of Kyoto Japan, estimated that a ""smoke"" event would occur ""less than once in 10 million flight hours."" But after 51,662 hours of commercial flight, two batteries failed, one culminating in a fire. In the first incident, a maintenance worker entered the aft electronics bay of Japan Airlines Dreamliner parked at Boston Logan airport on January 7, 2013, and found heavy smoke and a small 3-inch flame coming from the battery housing. The lithium-ion battery provided electricity to the plane's auxiliary power unit, or APU. While the incident is still under investigation, he NTSB said a short circuit in one of the battery's eight cells resulted in a thermal runaway, and damage spread to adjacent cells. Nine days later, the main battery on an All Nippon Airways Dreamliner failed during a flight over Japan. No fire was observed, and damage was confined to the battery housing. ""This type of failure was not expected based on the testing and analysis .... that Boeing performed as part of the 787 certification process,"" the NTSB wrote. In a 2006 test, the battery manufacturer drove a steel nail into one of the battery's eight cells to induce an internal short circuit, to see if the damage would result in smoke, fire and damage to the battery case. Damaged cells emitted smoke, the test showed, but the smoke could effectively be handled by the airplane's ventilation system. The FAA and Boeing said they believed at the time that thermal runaway could only occur if a cell or battery was overcharged. So they took precautions to protect against overcharging, and adopted measures to vent smoke. Boeing had considered the potential that a short circuit of a single cell would generate smoke, but it ""underestimated"" the effects of a thermal runaway. The safety board said it is concerned about the repeatability of tests that induce thermal runaways in batteries, and said researchers have found that current test methods ""might not reliably produce failure effects as severe as those observed"" in the real-world failures. Internal shorts, the safety board said, are hard to reproduce. But it is important to solve to improve safety, it said. A safety board spokesman told CNN the board could make more recommendations when it issues its final report, likely later this year. Another battery incident troubles Boeing's 787 Dreamliner .

"(Matador) -- Grab a helmet and check out these 15 cities where drivers use all five fingers when they wave at you. EUROPE . Amsterdam, Netherlands . The "" bicycling capital of Europe"" tops many lists -- including this one, it seems -- as the most bike-friendly city anywhere. Safe and extensive route networks, serious governmental promotion, and a bike culture that transcends class boundaries are all reasons why 40 percent of the city's traffic moves on two wheels. Barcelona, Spain . Barcelona's Bicing program, one of many mass bike rental systems that have popped up recently in Europe and beyond, debuted in 2007 in the Catalonian capital. An annual Bike Week is held in late May to spread the word. Berlin, Germany . Commuting Berliners are never lonely -- 400,000 of them pedal to work each day. City leaders still aren't satisfied with this figure, and millions of euros have been allocated to encourage more cyclists to get on the streets. One result is a mapping website that helps you plot bike-specific routes. Matador: Photo essay - 16 reasons to travel Patagonia by bike . Copenhagen, Denmark . In the Danish capital, around a third of the workforce gets to the office by bike. By some estimates, that's more than a million kilometers pedaled every day. For an alternative and truly bike-friendly urban experience, check out Christiania, a neighborhood of 850 that, in addition to setting up a semi-independent government and decriminalizing trade in cannabis, has banned cars. Paris, France . Paris gets a nod here for its creation ofVélib', one of the world's largest public bicycle rental programs. Twenty thousand stylish three-speeds are distributed among 1,450 rental stations throughout the city, available to subscribers at variable rates (rides under 30 minutes are free). NORTH AMERICA . Boulder, Colorado . Denver's little hippy neighbor to the north dedicates 15% of its transportation budget to improving and promoting bicycle travel. Nearly every major roadway has a designated cycling area, and they've even instituted a pilot program to get kids biking to school. This guy has created a very cool color-coded route map, complete with local attractions. Chicago, Illinois . Late during his 22-year tenure, Mayor Richard Daley became set on turning Chicago into ""the most bicycle-friendly city in the United States."" It doesn't appear to be all talk, either, as more bike lanes pop up all the time, and more laws that protect cyclists' safety are passed.

"(CNN) -- Two men featured on the cover of the New York Post following the Boston bombing under the headline, ""Bag Men,"" are suing the newspaper, according to court papers. Lawyers for Salaheddin Barhoum, 16, and Yassine Zaimi, 24, took aim at the New York Post at a news conference Thursday. ""The New York Post accused our clients of being the men with the bombs in their bags and that is libel,"" said C. William Barrett, Zaimi's lawyer. Both filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Post on Wednesday over photographs and articles published three days after the Boston bombing that made it appear that FBI agents were looking for them. The picture on the front page of the April 18 edition of the New York Post shows the two men standing next to each other. One carried a backpack and wore a hat, the other had a gym bag over his shoulder. According to the complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court in Massachusetts, ""The front page would lead a reasonable reader to believe that plaintiffs had bombs in their bags, that they were involved in causing the Boston Marathon bombing."" In the complaint, lawyers for the plaintiffs accuse the New York Post of libel, negligent infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy. The plaintiffs are seeking damages, including unspecified monetary compensation. Boston bombing survivor meets woman she says saved her life . As a result of the New York Post's actions, the plaintiffs were ""put in fear for their lives and suffered harm, including but not limited to damage to their reputations and ongoing extreme emotional distress,"" according to the complaint. The New York Post referred CNN to its April 18 statement from Editor-in-Chief Col Allan: ""We stand by our story. The image was e-mailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects."" Following the bombing, federal authorities issued a release to news media to exercise caution when reporting information about the investigation and to go through the appropriate official channels to verify developments. Barhoum is a high school sophomore and Zaimi works full time while attending night school. The lawsuit states that both are lawful permanent residents of the United States. Boston fire chief resigns after criticism of bombing response . Being avid runners, the friends went to the finish line to watch the elite runners complete the Boston Marathon. They carried their own running gear in their backpacks, according to the lawsuit. Photos of the plaintiffs started to circulate on several social media sites in the days following the bombing. Upon learning this, they both voluntarily went to the police. Authorities questioned both men, told then they were not suspects, and sent them home, the lawsuit says. The next day, their picture appeared on the New York Post's front page with the sub headline ""Feds seek this duo pictured at Boston Marathon."" Inside the newspaper were two other pictures, one with their faces circled. Zaimi went to work unaware, and was approached by his office manager who told him about the Post's front page. ""He immediately started shaking, his mouth went dry, and he felt as though he was having a panic attack,"" the lawsuit says. While on his way home from work, the complaint says Zaimi was identified by a man waiting next to him at the train station. Barhoum was on school vacation and participating in a track meet, unaware of the New York Post's coverage, according to the filing. When he returned home, there was a large crowd of reporters outside his home asking him questions him about being a marathon bombing suspect. One of members of the media showed him the front page and according to the complaint, he ""became terrified, began to shake and sweat, and felt dizzy and nauseous."" Later that same day, authorities released photographs of Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

"(CNN) -- Billy the Kid is dead and probably doesn't care, but a pardon for the cold-blooded killer may be in the offing. Gov. Bill Richardson, called a ""Billy the Kid buff,"" is looking at an old promise by another governor, and not the Kid's reputation, in deciding whether to issue a posthumous pardon, a spokeswoman said Thursday. No matter that Billy the Kid has been in the ground since 1881. That hasn't dimmed interest in the cattle-rustling outlaw. Tourists, especially from Europe, are fascinated with Billy the Kid, born Henry McCarty, but also known as William H. Bonney and Henry Antrim. He died at the hands of Sheriff Pat Garrett when he was only 21. New Mexico's tourism website even has a travel guide to Billy the Kid territory. ""His nickname carries a lyrical quality that still gallops across the high plains of our imagination,"" according to the text next to the only known photograph of Bonney. ""If he does anything, [Richardson] will review the promise made by Lew Wallace to Billy the Kid,"" Alarie Ray-Garcia, Richardson's communications director, said Thursday, a day after the governor met with descendants of Garrett. The Garrett family and others oppose the pardon. Besides arguing that Billy the Kid was an incorrigible killer, they want to make sure Pat Garrett is absolved of wrongdoing related to the killing and a Bonney jail escape. Jarvis Patrick Garrett, 51, two other grandchildren and two great-grandchildren of Pat Garrett met for an hour with Richardson. ""People had forgotten that Pat Garrett was one of the first individuals to bring law and order to Lincoln County,"" Jarvis Garrett said. This latest chapter in the story of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid has more twists than a lariat. Popular history has Bonney gunning down 21 men, but many historians say the number was closer to nine. According to other legends, Bonney did not die at Garrett's hands and is not buried in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. He went to Texas and became known as ""Brushy Bill"" Roberts, they say. Poppycock, the Garretts argue. They asked Richardson to sign a petition signed by 100 people that reads, ""Whereas we the undersigned accept and agree the traditional history of Sheriff Pat F. Garrett and Billy the Kid (William Bonney), and believe that Billy the Kid died at Pat F. Garrett's hand. Therefore we oppose a postphumous (sic) pardon for Billy the Kid as Brushy Bill Roberts."" Garrett killed Bonney on July 14, 1881, in Fort Sumner weeks after Bonney escaped from a jail. The sheriff, legend has it, was hiding in the dark and shot Bonney when he entered a room. Garrett himself was gunned down in 1908 at age 57. Richardson ""agrees with the heart of the petition,"" but is asking his legal department to look at it, Ray-Garcia said. But the petition doesn't affect the Lew Wallace matter. Mark Lee Gardner, author of ""To Hell on a Fast Horse: Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, and the Epic Chase to Justice in the Old West,"" called for a pardon in an op-ed piece last month for the Los Angeles Times. According to Gardner and other historians, Billy the Kid wrote to Wallace, then the New Mexico territory's governor, asking him to honor a deal. Wallace had promised to grant Bonney amnesty for his role in shooting Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady and other ""misdeeds"" if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder. The pardon didn't happen. The Garretts argue Bonney decided to flee house arrest, making the pardon moot. ""Still, regardless of Billy's crimes, the motives of Richardson or the hollowness of posthumous justice, it all comes back to Wallace's promise. A deal is a deal, and 129 years doesn't change that. Billy is owed a pardon,"" Gardner wrote. Bill Garrett, 72, of Alamogordo, New Mexico, said he opposes the pardon. His grandfather was Pat Garrett's brother. ""I am very passionate about this,"" Garrett said. ""He [Bonney] was a killer."" Garrett, who was not at Wednesday's meeting but has written to Richardson, said Wallace did not exonerate Bonney. ""I think he might be better off doing something else,"" Bill Garrett, a retired bailiff, said of Richardson. Richardson has been interested in Billy the Kid officially since 2003. ""He thought it would be interesting to review this promise by Lew Wallace,"" said Ray-Garcia. A sheriff, a deputy and others got involved and moved to have the bodies of Bonney and his mother exhumed for DNA testing to prove they are buried at the Fort Sumner Cemetery. But a judge ruled against the efforts. Richardson wasn't interested in that aspect and the group's interest in whether Bonney became ""Brushy Bill"" Roberts, Ray-Garcia said. Ray-Garcia disputed contentions that the sheriff was following orders from Richardson. According to a letter the Garretts wrote to the governor, Richardson declared support in 2003 for reopening the investigation of Bonney's death. The investigation cited probable cause for allegations that Garrett killed an innocent victim instead of Bonney and that person is buried in the outlaw's grave, the Garretts said. There also were allegations the sheriff was an accomplice of Bonney in the murder of two deputies in April 1881 and the rustler's subsequent escape. ""This is an abomination as well as an inexcusable defamation of a great man,"" the letter said of the claims. Ray-Garcia said Richardson, who leaves office in five months, had nothing to do with the probable cause claims. ""The governor told them [the Garretts] that Sheriff Garrett was an honorable man."" She also denied state money went toward the investigation. Former Lincoln County Sheriff Tom Sullivan was among those involved in the investigation. He opposes the pardon, saying Billy the Kid ""was nothing but a glorified cop killer,"" but said there are many questions about the circumstances of his death and Garrett's conduct. He said he raised the probable cause questions so that an investigation would glean what really happened with Garrett and Bonney. ""Nobody wants to know the truth,"" Sullivan said Thursday. Jarvis Garrett and others in the family said they will continue their campaign to clear Garrett, who they said enjoyed a little gambling. They are hoping Richardson won't issue a pardon. ""If Billy the Kid was living amongst us now, would you issue a pardon for someone who made his living as a thief and, more egregiously, who killed four law enforcement officers and numerous others?"" the Garrett family wrote Richardson. Author Gardner said there is a reason for an abiding interest in Bonney and curiosity about whether he actually died in the dark and did not escape. ""If you have a folk hero die, you want him to go out with a blaze of glory.""","New Mexico governor considers pardoning Billy the Kid .

"(CNN) -- Like many 23-year-olds, Amanda Eang is self-conscious about her body. She constantly covers up and wears loose-fitting clothing to disguise her shape. At five-foot-two, she weighs just 93 pounds, and for years she has tried to gain weight. ""There are a lot of shows about losing weight, but they really don't have anything for people who are underweight,"" she says. ""It's just as frustrating for people who are trying to gain weight."" Eang, who lives in Toronto, says she has tried everything: eating junk food (which left her with high cholesterol), drinking supplements and doing resistance training. She'd like to reach 110 pounds, but she has never even weighed 100 pounds. Fewer than 2% of adults in the United States are underweight, according to 2007 to 2010 data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. To be considered underweight, individuals must have a body mass index of less than 18.5. A woman who is five-foot-six, for example, would weigh 114 pounds or less. For some, difficulty gaining weight can be a frustrating problem and must be approached in a healthy way, experts say. Ruling out problems . Before attempting to put on pounds, individuals who feel they are underweight should visit their primary care doctor for a complete physical examination, says Craig Primack, a medical obesity specialist and member of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians. Waist size signals diabetes risk . A physician can rule out medical issues that would impede weight gain or cause malabsorption, including celiac disease, lactose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth syndrome or B12 deficiency. Genetics play a big role in why some people are underweight, Primack says. A high metabolic rate is usually a factor, he says . The rest is a mystery. Experts have done significantly less research about being underweight than causes of being overweight. If individuals are slightly underweight, it might not be a sign of a problem. They may be in sync with their bodies' needs and avoid overeating, Primack says. Being naturally underweight is different from an eating disorder, in which individuals consciously try to reduce their size and avoid eating through various means. ""If someone has a problematic relationship with food, that's an eating disorder, and it doesn't matter what your weight is,"" says Linda Bacon, a psychologist and researcher at the University of California at Davis and author of ""Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight."" Fitness trainer gains and loses 70 pounds in one year -- on purpose . In extreme cases, being underweight can lead to difficulty fighting diseases, and for women it could lead to amenorrhea, or inability to menstruate, says Rachel Begun, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. If individuals are underweight and also not getting enough nutrients, this could cause osteoporosis, anemia and other nutrient-related conditions. Putting on the pounds . No matter the reason for wanting to gain weight, it is important to focus on the quality, not the quantity, of calories consumed, Begun says. ""The whole point is to eat more calories, but it shouldn't be a license to gorge on empty calorie foods,"" she says. Pairing calorie intake with both aerobic exercise and weight resistance training is crucial for cardiovascular health, she says. What to eat and drink when you exercise . Primack suggests fewer repetitions of higher weight in exercises that incorporate the whole body, done three to four times per week, in addition to cardiovascular exercise. At 28 years old, five-foot-ten and 138 pounds, Bryan Johnson of Minneapolis has tried some of these tactics to little avail. He'd like to reach 160 pounds, a goal he says he's ""pretty much given up on."" He's attempted intense workouts, drinking protein supplements and eating until he feels sick. Sticking to these plans despite his work schedule has been his biggest obstacle, he says. Like healthy weight loss, healthy weight gain takes time, Begun says. Individuals should try to put on about one pound per week, which means adding about 500 calories per day, she says. This allows for adding lean muscle and bone mass rather than unhealthy fat. Would you lose weight if money were at stake? It is best to choose foods from all food groups, especially complex carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fats. Some healthy yet calorie-packed options include nuts and nut butters, seeds, dried fruit, low-fat milk, yogurt smoothies, avocado, hummus and other bean spreads, Begun says. Whole grain pastas, sauces with brown lean beef and fish are also positive choices, Primack says. Gaining a new perspective . As society in general has become increasingly overweight, underweight individuals may feel they stand out. Others should be conscious of how their remarks that someone looks ""too skinny"" could be hurtful, Eang says. ""Some people have said, 'Oh, you look fine,' ... and there are other people who say, 'You're skinny.' It's the same way, that if a person were fat, (commenting on) it would be offensive."" Bacon says it is more important to practice healthy habits than to worry about weight and societal ideas about beauty and attractiveness. ""I don't think the answer is to gain weight to meet social standards or meet some kind of arbitrary idea of health,"" she says. ""We have so many social and health expectations that aren't predicated on what's true for the individual."" If underweight individuals are living healthy lifestyles but still find themselves on the lower end of the weight spectrum, it may be helpful to change how they view their bodies, she says. ""The best avenue is to start to appreciate the functionality of our bodies,"" she says. ""It is just amazing I have legs that can carry me from one place to another ... that we have mouths that allow many of us to be able to speak. There is so much we can just appreciate and marvel at in our bodies."" Are you part of the ""2 percent""? Do you feel as if you are underweight and want to gain a few pounds?

"(CNN) -- Elytte Barbour said Wednesday that his teenage bride's assertion she'd killed more than 22 people -- including one allegedly with him -- hasn't changed the way he feels about her. ""I still love her,"" Barbour said. Barbour talked exclusively with CNN from a secure line at the Columbia County Prison in central Pennsylvania, where he's awaiting trial -- along with his 19-year-old wife, Miranda Barbour -- after police alleged the couple lured a man using a Craigslist ad, strangled and stabbed him 20 times, then dumped his body. Since then, Miranda Barbour told a newspaper reporter that she had killed more than 22 but fewer 100 people over the past six years. Based on that information relayed to Daily Item reporter Francis Scarcella, she would have killed a different person every three weeks to three months, on average, starting around age 13. If true, this would make Miranda Barbour one of the United States' most prolific serial killers. Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Tony Rosini, the prosecutor who is aiming to convict the Barbours in the 2013 Craigslist killing of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, has discounted her claims. And Alaska State Troopers have said her claims don't bear out in that state, one of several (with Texas, North Carolina and California) where Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item she had killed. In his jailhouse interview, 22-year-old Elytte Barbour acknowledged, ""Everyone wants to know about her credibility."" Asked whether his wife was upfront with him regarding specific names or locations of the alleged murders, Barbour said, ""It was about 50/50."" He declined to comment on whether her confessions are valid. Elytte Barbour did speak, though, about his own interactions with authorities. ""Let's put it this way: I've been more than cooperative with every police force I've had contact with so far,"" he said. While saying it ""wouldn't be best"" to discuss certain things, Barbour did say that he planned to meet with federal authorities ""in the coming week or two."" ""It seems like I have my life or death on the line right now,"" he added. According to a police affidavit in connection with LaFerrara's November 2013 death, Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing him only to later confess after being presented with evidence police had gathered. So, too, did her husband. ""The defendant stated that they committed the murder because they just wanted to murder someone together,"" police said, referring to Elytte Barbour. The couple face a host of charges -- including criminal homicide, which is similar to first-degree murder -- tied to LaFerrara's death. The father of Barbour's 1-year-old child is dead, and police in Sunbury, Pennsylvania -- the small city located 130 miles northwest of Philadelphia where LaFerrara's body was found in a backyard -- have said that is part of their investigation. Among claims that authorities have to corroborate is Miranda Barbour saying she was involved in Satanism. That assertion raised questions among attorneys, missing persons experts and even a representative of the Church of Satan, the nation's largest satanic body. ""Thorough investigation will likely demonstrate that this cult story is fiction,"" said Peter Gilmore, the New York-based head of the Church of Satan.

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old woman was hospitalized after she fell down an elevator shaft at Fenway Park in Boston late Friday, authorities said. The unidentified woman was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Jerry Berger, a hospital spokesman, said he had no information on the patient, but the Boston Red Sox said she suffered serious injuries. ""Somehow (the) elevator shaft doors on floor 4 opened,"" the Boston Fire Department said on Twitter. The woman fell into the shaft, landing on the roof of the elevator, the department said. She'd fallen ""anywhere from 20 to 30 feet,"" fire department spokesman Steve McDonald told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""The firefighters went to the upper floors and were able to look down and see her,"" McDonald added. ""She was not moving."" Firefighters cut power to the elevator after stopping it on the 2nd floor, the fire department said. Rescuers did not wait for a ladder; they used a chair and boosted themselves up through a hatch to the roof. They immobilized the victim and lowered her through the hatch, the fire department said. In a statement before Saturday night's game against the Detroit Tigers, the Red Sox said: ""The Massachusetts Department of Public Safety and the Boston Police Department are working to determine exactly what happened. Due to the ongoing investigation, and out of respect for the family of the young woman who was injured, the Red Sox will have no further comment at this time."" The cause of the accident is unclear. A state elevator inspector was called to the scene and Boston police will investigate, the fire department said. The Red Sox lost Friday night to the Tigers 1-0. The incident occurred shortly after the game ended. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","NEW: The woman was not moving when she was found, fire department spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic made a winning return from a wrist injury when beating Radek Stepanek at the Rome Masters but the Serb described the conditions as some of the most testing he's faced. Playing his first match since losing in Monte Carlo to Roger Federer on April 19, the second seed dropped serve three times but beat the Czech 6-3 7-5. Despite Stepanek's resistance, the two-time winner of the event found the gusting wind to be an even bigger obstacle. ""It was one of the most difficult conditions I've played in my life,"" Djokovic told the ATP website. ""When it's very windy on court, especially on clay, the clay gets in your eyes. It was very difficult to get any kind of rhythm."" ""But the positive is that I managed to stay mentally tough until the end and win."" Watched by new coach Boris Becker, the 26-year-old needed one hour and 37 minutes to win through as he finetunes preparations for the French Open, which starts on May 25. The world number two missed last week's Madrid Open because of his the trouble in his right wrist and there had been some expectations that Federer would be a headline absentee in the Italian capital. Surprise Return . The Swiss welcomed the second set of twins into his life on Tuesday last week after wife Mirka gave birth to Leo and Lenny, who join elder sisters Myla and Charlene. The 32-year-old only arrived in the Italian capital on Monday after being packed off -- to his own surprise -- by his family. ""It happened all of sudden on Thursday,"" Federer, who plays on Wednesday, told reporters. ""I spoke to the team, I spoke to Mirka, asked all of them what they thought I should do and they said too quickly that I should come here and play. ""So 'ok, if you don't want me around, I'll go away!'"" joked the Swiss. ""It's hard to leave all the family, but I'll see them soon."" The world number four revealed that he fully expects the twins to soon be joining the rest of the family on the ATP World Tour. ""Clearly, it's going to be so much work with four kids on the road, but I feel like we're going to be able to handle it,"" he said. ""My wife's unbelievably supportive, and she's so good with the kids. I try my best every day as well, when I can, to help. I'm there every day, always with the kids, and I see them so often. ""It's something I'm really going to look forward to, spending this quality time with them, as we travel the world and are in different countries and cities. It's going to be actually very exciting."" Federer will meet France's Jeremy Chardy as he returns to the court just eight days after the expansion of his family. He has not played since losing last month's Monte Carlo final to compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka, who beat qualifier Pere Riba 6-0 6-3, registering 50 winners in a victory that lasted as many minutes. In the women's first round, there was local pride as Camilla Giorgi surprised ninth seed Dominika Cibulkova while Sara Errani also made it through, beating Chanelle Scheepers in straight sets.","Novak Djokovic beats Radek Stepanek at Rome Masters after nearly a month out with injury .

"(CNN) -- The Puerto Rico Police Department has a long pattern of violating citizens' constitutional rights through excessive force and unwarranted searches, the Justice Department said in a report released Thursday. The analysis by the Justice Department's civil rights division found the U.S. commonwealth's police force is ""broken in a number of critical and fundamental respects."" Bucking the trend of decreasing crime in the United States, violent crime in Puerto Rico increased 17% between 2007 and 2009. The island has also seen a number of large protests in past years over issues such as the cost of public education and job cuts. Police confronted these challenges with too heavy a hand, the report said. In response to student protests in August 2009, police used chemical agents, batons and physical force against protesters, according to the report. Protesters at other demonstrations have been met with chokeholds and rocks thrown by police, the report said. Puerto Rico has used excessive force that has violated and suppressed people's right to exercise free speech, the Justice Department said. There is also evidence of unlawful search and seizure that violate the Fourth Amendment. Many of the abuses come from the police department's strategy of sending tactical officers for community policing, according to the report. The Justice Department also found the police department fails to police sex crimes and cases of domestic violence, and discriminates by targeting people of Dominican descent. ""We find that these deficiencies will lead to constitutional violations unless they are addressed,"" the report said. It is a ""longstanding practice"" of the department to use force -- including deadly force -- in cases where lesser force or no force would have sufficed, the report said, adding that hundreds of people have been unnecessarily injured. The Justice Department also contends that there are problems not just with the way the Puerto Rico police department carries out its functions, but among the officers themselves. Between 2005 and 2010, there were more than 1,700 arrests of police officers on charges ranging from theft to murder, the report said. Current police policies fail to guide officers, and there is a lack of oversight by superiors, according to the report. Training is also insufficient, it said. Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno said Thursday that long before the Justice Department report, his administration had already sent a 150-page study to federal authorities outlining changes the police would undertake. Fortuno said he was aware there were problems at the police department for years. The governor also said that police have been meeting with the Dominican community in Puerto Rico to address issues of discrimination in policing. One aspect of the report that Fortuno did not address was police corruption. The Puerto Rico Police Department is the second-largest in the United States. Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez described the crime situation in Puerto Rico as serious. There have been 786 killings so far this year in what looks to be a record-setting year. One refrain that federal investigators heard repeatedly in Puerto Rico is that they had to make a choice between preserving public safety and abiding by the Constitution. ""I categorically reject that false choice,"" Perez said. He said history has shown that crime declines when the public has confidence in its police. ""Reforming the department won't be easy, and it will take time,"" Perez said. He gave Fortuno's government credit for giving investigators access to documents and personnel since the probe was opened in 2008. Nationwide, there are 17 investigations such as the one in Puerto Rico against police departments in the United States, Perez said. Such probes are designed to make systematic changes in those departments. The American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that pushed for the investigation, said the report confirmed the level of violence and corruption in the Puerto Rico Police Department. ""With the facts laid bare, it is now the responsibility of the Puerto Rican government and the Justice Department to make sure the police abuse and brutality end as quickly as possible,"" ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement. Journalist Dania Alexandrino contributed to this report.","NEW: ACLU says report confirms level of violence and corruption among police .

"St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- In the first major ballot box test of 2014, the GOP won. Republican David Jolly edged out Democrat Alex Sink to win Tuesday's special election in Florida's 13th Congressional District. Jolly will fill out the term of his former boss, Republican Rep. Bill Young, who died in October. Young, first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest-serving Republican in the House. With national Republicans framing the race as a referendum on Obamacare and a massive infusion of outside ad money to try to influence the outcome, pundits have looked to the Florida race as a bellwether for November's midterm elections. Special coverage: 2014 midterm elections . But Jolly didn't mention the health care law in his victory speech and instead said, ""This race is not about defending a broken agenda in Washington or advancing a broken agenda in Washington. This race is about defending Pinellas County and serving the people right here in our own community."" Sink, the state's former chief financial officer who narrowly lost the 2010 gubernatorial election, said in a concession statement, ""While tonight was not the result we were hoping for, I am proud of the race we have run and so grateful for the countless Pinellas residents, volunteers and supporters who put their faith in our campaign."" Swing district in swing state . Jolly won 48.5% of the vote, and Sink got just under 47%. Libertarian candidate Lucas Overby was a distant third, with just under 5% of the ballots cast. With Jolly's win keeping the House seat in GOP hands, the Democrats still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. Political handicappers say that's a tall order, considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts nationwide. Eight things to watch between now and Election Day . Florida-13, a swing district in a swing state, covers most of Pinellas County between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, including parts of St. Petersburg. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district in his 2008 and 2012 victories. Attacking Obamacare the right prescription for GOP? While the candidates said local issues mattered heavily, national Republicans were quick to proclaim Obamacare the biggest loser. ""Tonight, one of (House Democratic Leader) Nancy Pelosi's most prized candidates was ultimately brought down because of her unwavering support for Obamacare, and that should be a loud warning for other Democrats running coast to coast,"" proclaimed Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement. ""His (Jolly's) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare,"" added Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Co-chair Sharon Day in an e-mail blast to reporters. CNN Poll: Support for Obamacare slightly edges up . The Democratic National Committee claimed the issue of health care actually kept the contest close. ""Republicans fell short of their normal margin in this district because the agenda they are offering voters has a singular focus -- that a majority of voters oppose -- repealing the Affordable Care Act that would return us to the same old broken health care system,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the DNC chair. Tons of outside advertising money was poured into the race, and many of the ads attacking Sink focused on health care. ""Canceled health plans. Higher premiums. Medicare cuts. People losing their doctors. A disaster for families and seniors. For Alex Sink, the priority is Obamacare. Not us,"" said the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce, which backed Jolly. That was a potent message in a district that's one of the grayest in the nation. Nearly a quarter of all residents in Florida 13 are 65 or older. Jolly said he was committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely. Sink acknowledged that Obamacare was a major issue. While she highlighted how the Affordable Care Act has helped people, she also noted the law has flaws and said she was open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure's requirements. Democrats look to November . Sink was the candidate national Democrats wanted in this race, and she faced nominal opposition in January's primary. Jolly was far from the GOP's dream candidate and had to battle to win the party's nomination. Democrats jumped on his work as a lobbyist who worked for groups pushing to privatize Social Security after he had left Young's staff. National Democrats, who began to try to lower expectations a few days before the election, said they'll make another run at the district in November. ""Democrats will fight for Florida-13 in the midterm, when the electorate is far less heavily tilted toward Republicans,"" said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Outside money . Since it's one of a dwindling number of competitive districts and the only game in town, outside money poured into the race, which was the most expensive contest so far this cycle, topping even last year's special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. In addition to the approximate $2.5 million spent by the two campaigns, the party committees and outside groups dished out more than $9 million to run TV and radio ads, other paid media and direct mail, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors outside spending. The pro-Republican group American Crossroads, which said it spend $500,000 on the contest, said that Florida-13 was just an appetizer . ""A lot of us rolled up our sleeves after 2012, studied the Obama playbook and invested in targeted voter turnout and more effective messaging. The Florida CD-13 special was an important test market, and there was unprecedented cooperation among outside groups. We intend to keep refining these lessons as we prepare for the fall elections,"" said Crossroads CEO Stephen Law. While a contest this far out from Election Day rarely provides a preview of what will actually happen in November, Jolly's victory will give the GOP bragging rights. ""Regardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about November, the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Jolly's win ""means it's all about Obamacare for the GOP."" Zelizer: Obama may hate the midterm results .","Florida's 13th Congressional District is a swing district in a swing state .

"(CNN) -- A third of the houses on Britain's second most expensive street are lying vacant, many abandoned for decades and left to rot. Behind the padlocked gates and long driveways, up to 20 mansions stand empty on London's The Bishops Avenue, despite a reported combined value of around £350 million ($582 million). Dubbed ""Billionaires' Row,"" the road's average house costs over £6 million ($9.98 million), but many have been deserted by their wealthy owners. Despite their dilapidated condition, the houses remain a safe place for wealthy foreigners to park their money because of London's rocketing property prices, which rose 11% last year, and because of the road's reputation as a magnet for the rich and famous. Anil Varma, a property developer appointed by a hedge fund owner to manage six of the vacant homes, calls it one of ""the most expensive wastelands in Europe."" He's hoping to get permission to convert decaying mansion The Towers into luxury apartments. Bought 25 years ago by a prominent Middle Eastern family but never lived in because of planning permission complications, the once-magnificent mansion was abandoned and has fallen into disrepair. Varma showed CNN through the property, revealing animal skeletons lying on moss-covered floors, paint ripped off the damp-soaked ceilings and stairs which have partially collapsed. Jersey House, 200 meters up the road, is on sale for £40 million ($67 million) and estate agent Trevor Abrahmsohn says investors aren't put off by the numerous abandoned homes on the road because The Bishops Avenue ""is an iconic road, like Rodeo Drive or Wall Street."" Buying a house here ""is a statement of wealth... a statement that you've arrived,"" he told CNN. The street has long been a landing pad for wealthy investors in developing countries undergoing geopolitical chaos: Iranians after the 1979 revolution, eastern Europeans after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and most recently, Chinese oligarchs, he said. But, as Britain faces a housing shortage and soaring property prices, The Bishops Avenue's empty mansions are likely to add to debate over taxes payable by overseas property buyers -- particularly if they remain empty. However, Richard Cornelius, who heads the local government branch of Barnet Council, told CNN he ""would rather spend public money bringing family houses back into use than getting involved in battles with the lawyers of billionaires.""","A third of the houses on Britain's second most expensive street are lying vacant .

"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs had a long run with a rare form of cancer (a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor) that is sometimes curable by early surgery. While I was not his physician and don't have access to the details of his illness or its treatment, assertions that his use of alternative medicine shortened his life strike me as uninformed. No one knows how long he would have survived or what his quality of life would have been had he opted for immediate surgery and used only conventional treatment. For the past 40 years I have studied alternative and complementary therapies to learn which of them might usefully be combined with conventional approaches to develop a safer, more effective and more cost-effective system of care -- the result is the integrative medicine that I practice and teach. In the course of these investigations, I have looked at many alternative cancer treatments and found none of them to be effective. None withstand scientific scrutiny. Yet I find our standard cancer treatments to be incomplete and sometimes more harmful than beneficial. In the case of pancreatic cancer, they usually offer minimal extended survival, often at the expense of reduced quality of life. In October, 2010, I traveled in China to learn more about efforts there to integrate Western and Chinese medicine. My hosts took me to Guang'anmen Hospital in Beijing, a very large modern medical center devoted entirely to integrative medicine. Its largest department is oncology. Every cancer patient there gets appropriate surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as sophisticated herbal therapy designed to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy of those treatments, to strengthen body defenses against cancer and enhance quality of life. Acupuncture and nutrition are also part of the hospital's integrative cancer treatment. Seeing the large number of successful outcomes there made me sad that few American cancer patients can access this kind of care. What most impressed me is that it is supervised by fully trained oncologists in an academic medical center. Cancer centers in the United States that claim they offer ""integrative"" care stick to the safest complementary services -- massage, stress reduction, counseling. They wouldn't let a Chinese herb on their premises -- even a totally safe one like astragalus (from the root of Astragalus membranaceous) that helps protect bone marrow from the toxic effects of some chemotherapy agents. American oncologists commonly tell patients to avoid all dietary supplements and natural remedies while undergoing treatment and to eat whatever they want. That's not good enough. If cancer is confined to one part of the body and is accessible, surgery is usually curative, and it would be foolish not to use it. Unfortunately, by the time many cancers are first detected, they have already spread from their point of origin. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be the best treatments we have in those cases, but they are crude approaches that damage normal cells as well as malignant ones, especially in sensitive tissues of the immune system. I'm sure they will eventually be replaced by targeted, individualized therapies that cause less collateral damage. In the meantime, much can be done to improve our management of cancer. I would urge patients and families not to reject surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy but to seek and demand integrative treatment. The Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine that I direct has graduated a number of oncologists from its intensive fellowship training; a goal of the center is to develop formal training in integrative oncology. The Society for Integrative Oncology will hold its 8th annual international conference in Cleveland next month; it is co-sponsored by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. This is the future. Again, I don't know enough about Steve Jobs' cancer or the treatments he used to comment on them specifically. I hope he was lucky enough to find an integrative oncologist to help him with the tough decisions that all cancer patients must make about the recommendations they get, both from conventional doctors and others. I wish that all cancer patients could partner with integrative oncologists to guide them through the maze of confusing options, avoid fraudulent treatments and scams and make use of all safe and effective therapies to eliminate tumors, prevent recurrences and preserve quality of life. By demanding integrative oncology practitioners and facilities, consumers can speed their appearance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Weil.","Andrew Weil says he can't say if Steve Job's treatment choices shortened his life .
He says in his studies he has found no alternative therapy for cancer that is effective .

"(CNN)  -- The first decade of the 21st century in the United States was defined by terrorism, crisis and uncertainty.

Most Americans have been left reeling from nine very difficult years, even though the decade neared its close with a presidential election that spoke to the promise and potential of the nation. We must remember that any ""most important"" list should be seen as the beginning of a conversation, not a definitive judgment. Historians learn that it is extraordinarily difficult to discern exactly which events will be transitory and which will have the most long-lasting effects. iReport: Share 10 photos from the past 10 years . Some moments that seem to be turning points shortly after they happen, such as Operation Desert Storm in 1990-1991, seem less important over time. Others that we don't pay as much attention to, such as the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, look much more consequential with the passage of time. September 11, 2001 . The tragic moment when terror struck in New York and at the Pentagon will be at the top of everyone's ""most important"" list. When terrorism caused such devastating damage, the perpetrators defined the central national security challenge confronting the United States and much of the world: Stateless terrorism. Even though the nation had faced terrorism for several decades, including the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, nothing compares to 9/11 in scale and scope. The event shattered the sense of confidence that many Americans had about being able to avoid the kinds of attacks on civilians that had become commonplace in the Middle East. American national security policy was reconfigured as a result. The federal government vastly expanded and reorganized its homeland defense system. It instituted an aggressive program of interrogation and surveillance to combat terrorist threats and refocused foreign policy to concentrate on destroying these networks and the states that support them, including the invasion of Afghanistan to topple the Taliban regime. Eight years later, we are still fighting. Iraq War . The war with Iraq quickly became one of the most controversial aspects of the war on terrorism. The difficulties that the United States encountered in the reconstruction period, and the falsity of the Bush administration's claims in the build up to war that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, opened up the administration to intensified attacks from the left and the right. The war eroded Bush's political capital and constrained his ability to achieve other objectives, including domestic proposals such as Social Security privatization. Equally important, the difficulties the nation encountered in achieving its goal of creating a stable democracy and combating insurgents has raised serious doubts -- domestically and internationally -- about the capacity of American military power in conflicts, including the war in Afghanistan. Hurricane Katrina . When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, it revealed the horrible conditions under which many inner-city Americas were living after decades of neglect. The failure of so many levels of government to properly respond to the hurricane and its aftermath also exposed the limited interest of the government -- and the public -- in protecting these African-American communities even after a tragedy this severe. The unwillingness of the federal government to commit substantial resources to the reconstruction effort confirmed that urban America was not central to the national agenda. Financial crisis of 2008 . The financial crisis constituted a huge shock to the economic system. As September 11 ended a false sense of physical security within our borders, the financial crisis shattered the economic confidence which had emerged in the 1990s and established the parameters for President Obama's administration. The plummeting market fundamentally challenged decades of policies that centered on deregulation and market-based solutions. The fact that President Bush's administration put forth a hugely expansive financial bailout package revealed how Americans have come to expect federal intervention in times of economic crisis and showed that there were limits to the Reagan Revolution. Election of 2008 . The 2008 election is the one defining event that spoke to America's potential. Even though the United States clearly has not entered any kind of post-racial period, as Hurricane Katrina revealed, the election of an African-American to the presidency in a country whose economy once revolved around slavery was historic. Combined with other developments -- such as the growing acceptance of gay rights, despite the setbacks to same-sex marriage --  the election signaled a movement away from discriminatory attitudes that have been so deeply rooted in the American psyche. Any most important list is inherently incomplete, and only captures a small part of what the nation experienced. Should Congress pass health care reform, which seems likely, that could become a crucial moment in the history of our government. Nonetheless, these five events will certainly be ones that historians will look back to for years to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Zelizer writes: The first decade of the 21st century defined by terrorism, crisis, uncertainty .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Cheering Laker fans crowded onto roofs, balconies and sidewalks along a two-mile stretch of downtown Los Angeles Monday to celebrate another NBA championship. Los Angeles police would not estimate the crowd size, but unofficial reports ranged from 500,000 to two million people converging along the parade route. The Los Angeles Lakers rode on top of a slow-moving flat-bed truck, waving to the massive throng. At least six people were arrested along the parade route, LAPD Officer Rosario Herrera said. She did not have details about the arrests. Asked how many police officers were on the streets to control the crowds, she would only say there was ""a sufficient amount of officers out there for parade."" It has been called the ""back-to-back"" parade, since it was the second consecutive championship for the Lakers. The team repeated as NBA champs by beating the Boston Celtics last week in game 7 of the NBA finals. It was their 16th NBA title.","Lakers' parade followed 2-mile downtown route .

"(CNN) -- Elon Musk wants to revolutionize transportation. Again. The serial entrepreneur envisions a future where mag-lev trains in enormous pneumatic tubes whisk us from Los Angeles to New York in 45 minutes. Need to be in Beijing tomorrow? No problem. It's a two-hour ride away. As crazy as it sounds, Musk is merely updating an idea that's been around since the early 1900s, and at least one company is working on a functional prototype. But according to Wired sources, his involvement won't be nearly as hands-on as Musk's other endeavors at Tesla Motors and SpaceX. The engineering behind the Hyperloop is similar to the old-school pneumatic tube systems used by banks to suck your deposit to the teller at the drive-through. But naturally, it's more complicated than that. A massive vacuum tube — mounted either above ground or even under water — would be combined with a magnetic levitation system used on conventional bullet trains. That means no friction, no wind resistance, no chance of collisions, and insanely high speeds. Musk described the Hyperloop as ""a cross between a Concorde, a railgun and an air hockey table,"" at AllThingsD's D11 conference earlier this year. And in an interview with PandoDaily, Musk said the Hyperloop could form a fifth tent pole of modern transportation, joining cars, planes, trains, and boats, adding that because of its low energy usage and ability to get juice from solar power, it could generate more power than it would consume. But up until now, he hasn't elaborated on his involvement. Musk's interest in the idea was sparked after researching California's new high-speed rail project and realizing that it will be the slowest and — at $70 billion — the most expensive system on the planet. To his mind, there's a better solution. The Hyperloop is it. And one firm unaffiliated with Musk is in the early stages of development. ET3, a company based in Longmont, Colorado, is working on a Evacuated Tube Transport (ETT) system, which it describes as ""space travel on Earth."" It uses two tubes — one for each direction — with 400-pound, passenger car-sized capsules that could house six people, each accelerated by linear electric motors. According to ET3, state trips would average speeds of around 370 mph, while international trips would hit that insane 4,000 mph mark. The company, which calls itself an ""open consortium,"" claims that it's working with partners in China and has sold nearly 100 licenses for the technology. But ET3′s claims pose more questions than answers, particularly when considering you can buy your own license for the bargain basement price of $100. But the idea for a vacuum-sealed high-speed transit system isn't anything new. The ""vactrain"" concept was floated in the early 1910s and a paper written by physicist R.M. Salter and published by the Rand Corporation in 1972 titled the ""Very High Speed Transit System,"" or VHST, describes something very similar to what ET3 is developing. But where Musk fits in remains a question. Sources close to the Tesla co-founder and CEO say he believes ET3 is on the right track, but is missing some key components, and that Musk has his hands full with Tesla and SpaceX, and would rather have some involvement in the development, with another entity taking the helm. That lines up with a few responses Musk made on Twitter when asked about patenting the technology. ""I really hate patents unless critical to company survival,"" Musk tweeted. ""Will publish Hyperloop as open source."" When asked about partners, Musk said he's ""happy to work with the right partners. Must truly share philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & w/o wasting money on BS."" We'll have to wait until August 12th to find out more.

"(CNN) -- Nationally syndicated radio host Tom Joyner raised his hand in victory. ""I hope now they rest in peace,"" Tom Joyner said of his two great-uncles who were wrongfully executed. Nearly 100 years had passed since his great-uncles, Thomas Griffin and Meeks Griffin, were wrongfully executed in South Carolina. On Wednesday, a board voted 7-0 to pardon both men, clearing their names in the 1913 killing of a veteran of the Confederate Army. It marks the first time in history that South Carolina has issued a posthumous pardon in a capital murder case. ""It really, really feels good,"" Joyner told CNN's Don Lemon. Joyner made the journey to Columbia, South Carolina, with his wife, his sons, his brother and nieces and nephews. When the board announced its decision, they danced, hugged and kissed. ""All of the above,"" he said.  Joyner describes gleeful, historic moment » . In the end, it took only about 25 minutes for their pardon, nearly a century in the making. ""It's good for the community. It's good for the nation. Anytime that you can repair racism in this country is a step forward,"" Joyner said. He said the ruling won't bring back his great-uncles, who were electrocuted in 1915. But it does provide closure to his family. ""I hope now they rest in peace."" Many who were present were touched by the symbolism and significance of the moment. ""I felt like I was a witness to a historical event. It was pretty exciting around here,"" said Peter O'Boyle, the chief spokesman for the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. Dwayne Green, an African-American member of the pardon board, said he admired Joyner for seeking the pardon. ""He's not only done his family a service, but also the people of South Carolina."" ""There's no statute of limitations on doing the right thing,"" Green said. ""There's so much good that can come out of this public show of mercy."" The unanimous vote, he said, was heartwarming and satisfying.  ""It's a great opportunity to show how much South Carolina has changed,"" he said. ""While change comes slow, outcomes like this are a positive sign."" Joyner, the host of ""The Tom Joyner Morning Show,"" had known nothing of his great-uncles' murder convictions until last year. That's when esteemed Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. uncovered Joyner's past as part of the PBS documentary ""African American Lives 2."" In the documentary, Joyner explains that he never knew why his grandmother left South Carolina. ""All I know is she left home and she ended up in Florida and she didn't stay in touch with her people, either,"" Joyner says. ""Do you know why your grandmother moved away?"" Gates says. ""No,"" Joyner says. ""I have no idea."" Gates then shows him his great-uncles' death certificates. ""Cause of death: Legal electrocution,"" it says. ""They electrocuted my --"" an astonished Joyner says, unable to finish his sentence. In that moment, Joyner began the journey that led him to Wednesday's pardon. Gates and legal historian Paul Finkelman aided in the research of his family history, and helped lobby South Carolina to pardon the two Griffin brothers. It wasn't the first time a pardon had been sought for the men. According to their research, more than 150 citizens of Blackstock, South Carolina, asked the governor at the time for their sentences to be commuted. Many prominent whites in the community, including the mayor and former sheriff of Chester County, came to the defense of the Griffin brothers. ""I heard this case, and I don't think I could have given a verdict of guilty,"" one magistrate wrote. The Griffin brothers had owned 130 acres in the area and were well-liked in the community. They were convicted of killing John Q. Lewis, a 73-year-old veteran of the Civil War. Lewis was slain in his home on April 24, 1913. ""Only the most profound sense of injustice would have led so many white leaders of the community and ordinary white citizens to publicly support blacks convicted of murdering a white man,"" Finkelman said in a letter to the board of paroles and pardons. According to the research uncovered by Finkelman, Lewis, the former Confederate soldier, apparently had an intimate relationship with a married 22-year-old black woman, Anna Davis. Suspicion initially turned to her and her husband after the murder. ""It is plausible to believe that the sheriff did not want to pursue Mr. and Mrs. Davis because if they were tried, it would have led to a scandalous discussion in open court,"" Finkelman wrote to the pardon board on October 2, 2008. The investigation later turned to another man, Monk Stevenson, who would ultimately point police to the Griffin brothers and two other black men. Stevenson received a life sentence in exchange. ""Stevenson later told a fellow inmate that he had implicated the Griffin brothers because he believed they were wealthy enough to pay for legal counsel, and as such would be acquitted,"" Finkelman said. The Griffin brothers and the two other men, Nelson Brice and John Crosby, were convicted in a trial that lasted four days. They were electrocuted on September 29, 1915. Now, Joyner says he urges all African-Americans to explore their pasts -- no matter how difficult that journey may be. ""You can look at your ancestor struggles of the past and be encouraged. If they can go through what they went through, you can do much better,"" he said. His journey is continuing. He wants to know even more about his great-uncles -- what happened to their land, how they made the community better, what made them so well-liked by whites in segregated South Carolina. ""Until we can repair some of the deeds of the past, we can't really look forward,"" he said.","Radio host gets pardon for his great-uncles who were wrongfully executed in 1915 .

"(CNN) -- A dazed boy's musings after a trip to the dentist's office had a good run. But even with foggy pronouncements like ""I have two fingers,"" he was no match for Britain's talented Susan Boyle. Boyle's surprising vocal performance on ""Britain's Got Talent"" was far and away the most-watched video of the year on YouTube -- racking up more than 120 million views, according to the site. ""David After Dentist,"" filmed by the boy's father as he was clearly still loopy from medication, was a distant second with about 37 million views. This year is the first time YouTube has released a year-end list. On its blog, YouTube called 2009 ""the biggest year yet"" for online video. ""Some moments were big [President Obama's inauguration], some small [a Minnesota wedding party erupts into dance], some expected [""New Moon""], some surprising [Susan Boyle] -- but all of them inspired, entertained and connected millions of people around the world via YouTube,"" read the blog. Titled ""JK Wedding Entrance Dance,"" the video of a wedding party's choreographed entrance to the tune of Chris Brown's, ""Forever,"" finished third with about 33 million views while the trailer for the hotly anticipated movie ""Twilight: New Moon"" was fourth with 31 million. An advertisement for Evian bottled water that featured babies roller-skating to Sugar Hill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight"" was fifth with about 27 million views. Boyle, a 47-year-old, unemployed, Scottish charity worker, leapt to international stardom after first taking the stage on the British reality show. Audience members and judges seemed to smirk at her frumpy appearance before she rendered a show-stopping version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" from the musical ""Les Miserables."" Boyle would go on to finish second on the contest but her album, released late last month, instantly went gold with more than 701,000 sales in its first week in the United States. YouTube also announced its top search terms for each month of the year -- a list that serves as an instant reminder of the top pop culture moments of 2009. In the United States, the year started with ""Obama inauguration"" as the fastest rising search term in January and ended with ""Tiger Woods"" as the most popular term of December.","Susan Boyle's performance is most popular YouTube video of 2009 .

"Chibok, Nigeria (CNN) -- It's the beginning of the second semester in public schools across Nigeria and students are flocking back after the vacation. But in most of Borno state, the heartland of the militant group Boko Haram, the desks are empty and the playing fields are quiet. Western education is a sin in the eyes of the terror group --- and nowhere has that message more clearly hit home than in their recent horrific attack on Chibok Girls Secondary School. Only the walls of the classrooms, library and science laboratories remain: a charred shell of what was once, the pride of Chibok. But even more painful is the fact that more than 200 of the girls who took classes here are still missing, kidnapped from the school during that night of terror. Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school. Since the attack he's kept them at home, where he felt they would be safer. ""I am scared of sending them to school,"" he says. ""I'm not feeling good that they're at home and I'm not feeling good to send them to school because of the attacks."" Muvia's dilemma mirrors that of almost every parent in Chibok: torn between education for their child and their family's safety. On the way to Chibok from Abuja, the country's capital, travelers meet one police or military checkpoint after another. But join the main rough dirt road to Chibok and the government security presence seems to taper off. It all leaves local residents feeling vulnerable and afraid. Muvia couldn't forgive himself if he sent his daughter to school and then heard that something had happened to her. ""No one can afford losing their daughter,"" he says. In an article on his website ""Education for All"" Gordon Brown, the U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education, says 10.5 million children in Nigeria are yet to go to school and that the high levels of illiteracy are now an economic problem, as well as a social disaster, for the country. Analysts say that if the Boko Haram attacks on schools continue unabated then those levels of illiteracy will significantly increase, further compromising the future of the country's young people. CNN interviewed one of the girls who managed to escape from Boko Haram on the night they were taken from their dormitory. Though she hopes to go back to school soon so she can fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor, she's still very scared. ""If in Chibok, I'll never go again,"" she says. But like many families in the area her family is too poor to send her to a boarding school far away from the village. All the people in Chibok seem to have left is hope. Muvia prays a day will come when his daughters will be free to pursue their futures and become lawyers, doctors or engineers. ""When I see all these people doing their jobs, I have the desire -- or the hope -- that I want my children to be like them,"" he says. ""I have very high hopes for them.""","Up to 300 schoolgirls have been kidnapped by Boko Haram from Chibok, Nigeria .

"Editor's note: Reed Dickens was White House assistant press secretary for President George W. Bush from 2001-2003 and worked with Scott McClellan almost three years. He's the founder and CEO of Outside Eyes, a California-based communications firm. Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan wrote a tell-all book blasting the Bush administration. (CNN) -- I worked with Scott McClellan in the West Wing for almost three years. Like most people, I liked Scott very much. But there is zero resemblance between the Scott I worked with and the person I have been watching this past week. None whatsoever. When I first heard about his book, ""What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception,"" and read some of its excerpts, I tried to give Scott the benefit of the doubt and wait to read the book for myself. I mean, Scott McClellan is not some guy who met the president a few times and then decided to write a book, like another staffer did early on. This is a guy who had a great affection for the president, and that affection was mutual. As I read the book, I kept thinking I would come across evidence to back up the serious allegations Scott was making. I read more. I thought surely there will be some conversation that he claims to have overheard between adviser Karl Rove and President Bush, crafting some story to cover up the truth about Iraq or making the Iraq War sound political in nature. Or, maybe he witnessed some meeting, discovered a memo, or overheard a comment that confirmed his disillusionment. Still nothing. And then, I realized this book had no facts to support its ill-timed story. This book is false in premise, disappointing in substance and inappropriate in timing. First, the premise of the book is flawed for one major reason: This president placed some big bets on the table. For one, an attempt to reform the nation's tragically flawed educational system, which has seen more and more money thrown into it to reward incompetence. For another, to go on the offense in a War on Terror after our nation had been in a dangerously naïve position for years. President Bush swung for the fence. The president's efforts on these great issues of our time were not meant to be overnight solutions, but genuine efforts to change a faulty system or make us safer in the long term. You cannot mistake short-term media coverage for history. We will not know for many years how some of these big bets will pay off. So, to presume failure, when there is in fact real progress -- economically, politically, and militarily in Iraq -- is arrogant, short-sighted, and most tragically, undermines the efforts of those making the sacrifice to make America safer for years to come. The timing of this book is very disappointing. It is an outright attempt to undermine the president that made Scott's career and hurt those who served alongside him for years. Obviously, had Scott actually been disillusioned while he was in the West Wing -- that would have been the time to share it with those standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him. But this takes courage, and that is a lot to ask of a staffer. The other option would have been to share these newfound feelings years from now, after the dust is settled and the results from a very significant presidency are tallied. To use the platform that he was handed to poison the well from which he drank so freely is hypocritical at best. Scott was chosen by the president for his loyalty, not his communication prowess. And in a tough final year of one of the most-challenging and consequential presidencies in history, this book is quite a thank-you note. Over the last week, I have been asked two questions over and over. First, ""What do you think happened to Scott?"" And, the second, ""How does it make you feel?"" Both are tough questions to answer. But because I was traveling when the story broke, I was able to process both before being inundated with the opinions of so many others. As for what happened to the Scott we knew, I believe his is a classic case of what bitterness and an inability to forgive can do to you. While Scott had some valid disagreements with some of the other staff about the situation he was put in during the Valerie Plame case --  simmering for two years about it seemed to change him. And as for how I feel, well, it makes me sad that he forced the rest of us to choose between a friend that we respected and a president we love. I believe Scott's judgment was clouded and his memory distorted during his effort to revise his personal history and -- as he states in the opening pages of the book -- find ""his own version of the truth."" I happen to believe there is just one version of the truth, and it is nowhere to be found in this book.","Reed Dickens worked with Scott McClellan for nearly three years in White House .

"(CNN) -- For those with too much money but not enough time or common sense -- here's the perfect travel solution. A weekend trip to the other side of the planet. A UK-based tour operator has begun offering whistle-stop sightseeing excursions from London to Australia that depart Friday afternoon and return ""just in time for work"" on Tuesday morning. Austravel -- a specialist in Down Under destinations -- says the 33,800-kilometer (21,000 mile), 46-hour round trip is ideal for anyone trying to maximize vacation time. Tickets starting at $1,840 include airfare, two hotel nights and rental car for three days. You'll need the car because as well as the time spent cooped up in a jet, there's a 12-hour drive from Sydney to Melbourne to make the return flight. Austravel's Naomi Moreno-Melgar concedes traveling to Australia for a weekend is ""extreme"" but insists it's ""do-able."" ""A trip to the land Down Under does not need take up all of your holiday allowance, but with four time zones, three million square miles and 22 million people, it would be nice,"" she says. Forget about sleep . The itinerary sees passengers depart London on Friday afternoon, arriving in Sydney on Saturday evening. After a night in a four-star hotel and visits to Sydney's Opera House, Harbour Bridge and tower, they bundle themselves into their rental car and hit the coastal road south. There's a night and morning in Melbourne, before a return flight that lands in London at 6:40 a.m. on Tuesday. More: 10 natural wonders of Australia .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egyptians go to the ballot boxes on Monday to vote for their fourth president in as many years. Unlike the last time they elected a president, the result of this election is a foregone conclusion. The former defense minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is widely expected to win in a massive landslide. What remains, however, rather difficult to predict is: what will an el-Sisi presidency bring to Egypt? Egyptians have gone to the ballot box more than a half dozen times in the past four years. The last presidential elections resulted in a large number of candidates emerging, splitting the vote and leading to a run off between Ahmed Shafiq and Mohamed Morsy. The result was close, leading to the Muslim Brotherhood candidature of Morsy barely triumphing over Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, Shafiq. This time round, however, there is no possibility of a runoff round, because there are only two candidates. Morsy's former defense minister, el-Sisi, who removed him from office after substantial protests almost a year ago, and the Nasserist contender, Hamdeen Sabahi, who came in third in the last presidential elections. The outcome is in little doubt -- el-Sisi can count on the support of the state's main institutions, various media apparatuses, the political and economic elite, and a substantial proportion of the Egyptian population. Sabahi will struggle tremendously -- if he were to win even 25% of the vote, it would be a respectable showing in the circumstances. The question remains, however: how will el-Sisi govern? It is not entirely clear, because as yet, no official and complete presidential platform has even been released. His campaign team has indicated they do not believe it is appropriate to do so. Nor has el-Sisi himself been openly campaigning in rallies and so forth, with his team citing security concerns. That leaves room for a great deal of speculation, based on the few television interviews that the candidate has had and a few written ones, where he has constantly tried to lower expectations. What seems to be clear, however, is that el-Sisi's most oft-repeated themes can be summed up in two: the Egyptian version of the ""War on Terror,"" and an emphasis on the likelihood that Egyptians will not ""rest"" as the economic difficulties are addressed. The first theme relates to a number of radical violent groups, such as ""Ansar Beit al-Maqdis,"" which have been targeting police officers and military personnel over the past year. It also relates to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group that has been banned by the Egyptian government as a terrorist organization, although the designation has been disputed. Thousands of their supporters and members are either on trial or detained by the Egyptian state -- the most famous trials have resulted in scores of death penalty verdicts being recommended by Egyptian judges. It is, however, unlikely such sentences will be carried out, regardless of an el-Sisi presidency, even though he announced in an interview that in his presidency there would be ""no"" Brotherhood. Nevertheless, the presidency of el-Sisi, who is blamed by the Brotherhood for orchestrating a military takeover last July, as well as massacres of their supporters, will still be regarded as illegitimate by supporters of that organization. Sisi's non-Islamist opposition may acquiesce to the electoral result -- but they could still prove to be an additional thorn in the government's side, agitating for progressive change. That may mean that the polarization of Egyptian society will continue for the foreseeable future. Regardless of the hopes of some, it is doubtful that the Brotherhood, or dissent in general, will simply disappear. The second theme relates more to the Egyptian economy, which is in a deeply worrying situation. It may continue to deteriorate, but wholesale collapse does not seem to be on the horizon. Egypt's new authorities can count on the support of several Gulf countries, and the Egyptian military, as an institution, is expected to play a significant role in pushing forward on several projects designed to improve the Egyptian economy. The military's top brass generally supported el-Sisi's retirement, in order for him to run for the presidency, and for the time being at least, that institution will back him. Be that as it may, however, el-Sisi will become president at a time when the Egyptian public is more tired than ever. The last four years of instability have not delivered what that public expected, and while a significant proportion of it may give him a bit of breathing room in order to produce positive change, he will not be able to count on it indefinitely. If el-Sisi does not tackle the weighty problems concerning the economy, security (including security sector reform), and corruption, he should expect there to be a reaction. In a country where the majority live either under or close to the poverty line, and youth (who make up the majority of the population) unemployment is incredibly high, minute changes may not be enough to bring genuine stability to this country. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.A. Hellyer.","Egyptians go to the ballot boxes Monday to vote for their fourth president in as many years.
H.A. Hellyer says the former defence minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is widely expected to win.

"(CNN) -- The funeral of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il unfolded across the snow-laden streets of Pyongyang on Wednesday, a three-hour event that displayed the secretive regime's ability to choreograph elaborate state ceremonies. A North Korean state television broadcast of the services showed a tearful Kim Jong Un, the son and chosen successor of Kim Jong Il, trudging through the snow alongside the procession as it began at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, where Kim Jong Il's body had been lying in state since his death earlier this month. One black car carried on its roof a coffin draped in the flag of the nation's Worker's Party. Another transported a giant portrait of a smiling Kim. Senior officials accompanied the younger Kim, including Jang Song Taek, his uncle and a vice chairman of the National Defense Commission. Soldiers stood with their heads bowed, their caps in hand. Their green uniforms contrasted starkly with the bright white snow as mournful music played. The long funeral cortege then sped up, weaving through the streets of the city past throngs of emotional mourners. In footage that the state television repeated several times, the mourners wailed and beat their chests, their hair damp from the falling snow. ""That is our general,"" said one soldier interviewed by the station. ""In this snow, we have to send him off and it's heart ripping."" The snow also gave the country's state-run media fresh material with which to eulogize the dead leader. ""The feathery snowfall reminds the Korean people of the snowy day when the leader was born in the secret camp of Mt. Paektu and of the great revolutionary career that he followed through snowdrifts,"" the Korean Central News Agency said in a report Wednesday, referring to a mythical tale of Kim Jong Il's birth on a sacred mountain. The North Korean media had attributed a number of supernatural feats and events to Kim over his lifetime. ""All streets in Pyongyang and all towns and villages throughout the country are now inundated with people sweeping away snow before bidding their last farewell to the leader,"" the KCNA report said. ""They, who spent a sleepless night, missing him, have turned out in all roads covered by him in his lifetime."" The funeral procession, consisting of dozens of cars, went as far as Kim Il Sung Square, named after the founder of North Korea and father of Kim Jong Il, before returning to the palace. At that point, soldiers fired a 21-shot salute as Kim Jong Un and other officials stood with their heads bowed. The reclusive nation had revealed no details ahead of time about the funeral of the elder Kim, who was revered as a godlike ""dear leader"" by his people. He died December 17 -- reportedly of a heart attack -- after 17 years of repressive rule. Analysts were parsing the funeral footage for clues on the transition under way within the regime. The route the procession took appeared to follow that taken for Kim Il Sung's funeral in 1994, reported Yonhap, the official South Korean news agency. But Kim Jong Il received three fewer shots in the salute than his father did. The funeral Wednesday gave a prominent role to a third generation of the family: Kim Jong Un, the man designated the ""great successor"" by the nation's Worker's Party. ""This is a very scripted funeral. They've expected this for the last several years,"" said Lee Chung Min, dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""As you can see by the clockwork procession, the funeral basically signals a new era in North Korea"" under Kim Jong Un, Lee said. Questions have been raised about Kim Jong Un's ability to take the reins of the communist nation, given his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience. State news media have described the younger Kim as ""Supreme leader"" and ""Sun of the 21st century,"" suggesting he is succeeding in rallying support within the regime's hierarchy. ""As far as we can see from the TV cameras and from all of their state media projections, everything basically is going according to plan,"" Lee said. ""Whether Kim Jong Un will be able to remain in power over the longer term -- that's the $64 million question."" Analysts were also watching the ceremonies to gauge where leading figures stand in the new hierarchy. Jang Song Taek, who was shown walking behind Kim Jong Un on Wednesday, is expected to serve as a regent for the younger Kim as he builds leadership experience, said Denny Roy, a North Korea analyst at the East-West Center in Honolulu. Ri Yong Ho, who holds a number of key military and political posts, also took a prominent position in the procession. The ceremony is to be followed by a memorial on Thursday. The state-run KCNA said when the national memorial service is held, gun volleys will be fired in the capital as well as in provincial seats. ""All the people will observe three minutes' silence and all locomotives and ships (those on voyage included) will blow whistles and those units with sirens will sound them all at once,"" KCNA said. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: The funeral suggests everything is ""going according to plan,"" an analyst says .

"(CNN) -- The net in Bangladesh cricket's corruption scandal widened Tuesday as the ICC announced that seven people had been charged with match-fixing. Two more individuals have been accused of failing to report corrupt approaches. The joint action by the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) follows a tearful confession by former national captain Mohammad Ashraful that he was involved in match fixing. Ashraful, who captained his country between 2007 and 2009, played for Dhaka Gladiators in the Bangledesh Premier League (BPL), a Twenty20 tournament. In a joint statement, the ICC and BCB said the latest charges relate to an ""alleged conspiracy within the Dhaka Gladiators franchise to engage in match-fixing and spot-fixing activity during matches in the BPL 2013."" The identity of the individuals will not be revealed into the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings against them, they said. ""The continuing fight against corruption in cricket is not only the responsibility of the authorities like the ICC and the BCB, but it is increasingly the personal responsibility also of all players and support personnel,"" said ICC chief executive David Richardson. ""They must work closely with the authorities and comply with their reporting responsibilities at all times, so that the integrity of the sport can be protected for the greater good."" BCB president Nazmul Hassan backed up the tough line stance being adopted. ""The BCB is committed to doing everything possible to defend it from the very small group of people who are willing to compromise the values of the overwhelming majority for personal greed and, in so doing, bring disgrace upon themselves and their associates, as well as tarnishing the image of the game,"" he said. The action was taken after an investigation by the ICC anti-corruption unit. The individuals charged have 14 days in which to appeal or accept the allegations against them. It is the latest scandal to hit the image of cricket in the sub-continent. The most high profile involves Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, who has played 27 Tests for India. Fast bowler Sreesanth and 38 others have been charged by Delhi police in connection with spot-fixing in the Indian Premier League, the world's biggest Twenty20 tournament. Last year the BCB banned ex-Bangladesh international Shariful Haque after an inquiry fund his guilty of spot-fixing during the first edition of the BPL. Spot-fixing first entered the cricket vocabulary back in 2010 when three Pakistan Test players, captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif were caught in a sting organized by an English newspaper. They were found to have conspired to bowl non valid 'no-balls' at certain times during the Test series against England. The trio served jail sentences in Britain for the corruption offenses and were given lengthy bans by the ICC.","Bangladesh cricket corruption scandal widens .

"(CNN) -- A federal jury in Los Angeles on Friday found two men guilty of starting an illegal campfire that grew into a wildfire, destroying five homes and 17 other structures, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. The Colby Fire, as it was called, scorched close to 2,000 acres of foothills in Los Angeles County near Glendora. The two men, Clifford Eugene Henry Jr., 22, and Steven Robert Aguirre, 21, were convicted of one felony and three misdemeanors for unlawfully setting timber afire and being unable to control it, according to prosecutors. Embers from the campfire are believed to have ignited dry grass adjacent to the ring. Winds and drought conditions took it from there. Prosecutors said both men face a maximum of 6Â½ years in prison. Sentencing in the case is scheduled for August 4. The trial for a third suspect, Jonathan Jarrell, is scheduled to begin Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- World rugby champions South Africa held off spirited second-half fightback from New Zealand to win 32-29 and clinch their first Tri-Nations crown in five years on Saturday. Jean De Villiers, Victor Matfield and Bismarck Du Plessis celebrate winning the Tri-Nations with their supporters. The Springboks had to overcome an early setback at the Waikato Stadium in Hamilton as Dan Carter kicked the All Blacks in front after South Africa were penalized in gathering the kick-off. But Francois Steyn stepped up to plate for South Africa and he kicked over penalties from 60 and 58 meters to give the Springboks an advantage they would retain for the remainder of the game. South Africa stretched their lead when winger Bryan Habana barged opposite number Joe Rokocoko out of the way going for a high ball, and Fourie du Preez was on hand to run over the try. Morne Steyn, who took the closer kicks, landed the conversion and Peter de Villiers' side were firmly in command at 16-6. Additional penalties from Carter and both Steyns completed the first-half scoring with the All Blacks guilty of missing at least two try-scoring chances when star flyhalf Carter and then center Stephen Donald surrendered possession attempting to kick through the posts. Indeed it was Carter who made a crucial error as South Africa raced into a 29-12 lead when his attempted pass to Isaia Toeava was collected by Jean de Villiers, who sprinted away to score unopposed and Morne Steyn was able to convert. The All Blacks rallied as winger Sitiveni Sivivatu ran over for their first try and Carter successfully kicked the conversion and a penalty to cut the margin to seven points, but Morne Steyn kept the Springboks ahead with a second penalty. Captain Richie McCaw was able to touch down for New Zealand in the dying stages but the scoreline flattered the All Blacks, who were largely outplayed in the match. The win gave the Springboks their third Tri-Nations title and also saw them record three consecutive Test victories over the defending champions for the first time since 1976. It also meant that the final match of the tournament between bottom side Australia and their trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand next weekend in Wellington will be largely played for pride.","South Africa defeated New Zealand 32-29 to win the Tri-Nations rugby series .

"(CNN) -- With Google Glass, a new quest to cure death and driverless cars, it can be easy to forget what Google's primary business is: search. The largest search engine in the world is getting a few updates, the company announced on Thursday. Google tied the news to its 15th birthday and held the announcement in the original Google Garage. The overall design has been updated and borrows the ""card"" look from Google Now, lumping relevant information into rectangles and carousels and placing it above any links to websites. Answers will now be ""richer"" and include comparisons, filters and sorting. For example, if you ask Google to compare two foods, it will return a chart of their nutritional values. There are new results for song and music searches, and push notifications will soon come to the Google iOS app. The company is continuing to focus heavily on voice search, improving its conversational skills on the Web and in search apps. ""We believe that voice will be fundamental to building interactions with future devices that we will see,"" said Amit Singhal, Google's senior vice president of search. Devices such as smartwatches and Google Glass forgo traditional input devices in favor of voice interactions. No corporate birthday party is complete without a trip down memory lane and balloons and birthday cake, both of which were also present at the event. In September 1998, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started their company in Susan Wojcicki's home garage in Menlo Park. The space remains largely unchanged and still has the same sky blue carpet Wojcicki had installed as a perk to persuade Brin and Page to rent the space. Wojcicki, now a senior vice president at Google, kicked off the event. ""Even though a lot of thing are different at Google, the core is still the same,"" she said, citing the company's commitment to improving search, being a global company and thinking big. The original Google was indexing pages on the Internet, returning links to 10 Web pages that had a high probability of containing information that matched a query. The system was imperfect, easily flummoxed by synonyms, misspelled words and sites that gamed the system. Over the years, Google has launched various changes to the search engine to improve results. It added spell check, grasped the concept of synonyms and rolled out auto-complete. In 2007, it moved on from just links and started including other types of relevant content such as images, news articles and maps as part of its ""universal search."" A subtle update happened in 2010. Google Instant shaved fractions of seconds off each Google search by predicting your search terms as you type them. ""Google gives me back an hour of my life every month,"" said Singhal of Google Instant. ""That's not small, that's huge."" More recent changes have focused on how Google understands information. The Knowledge Graph debuted in 2012 and connects search terms with real objects, places and people. Now the company is indexing information. Instead of the top 10 pages about Picasso, you will get information on the painter directly from Google at the top of your search results, including background, images of famous paintings and related artists. People who use Google might not notice one of the bigger changes. The company has updated its under-the-hood search algorithms to something called ""Hummingbird,"" which will affect 90% of searches worldwide. The changes will make a difference in how results are ranked. ""Finding relationships between concepts is a very, very hard problem. And you have to balance the meaning of what that query is looking for with what the document is saying,"" said Singhal.","Google search getting voice upgrades, ""card"" style update .

"(CNN) -- If your post-Thanksgiving shopping plans don't involve leaving the house, you're in increasingly good company. And Web sellers are saying, ""Step right in."" As more people do at least some of their holiday shopping online every year, retailers are looking to take advantage of digital deal-seekers -- not just on the much-ballyhooed Cyber Monday, but on Black Friday and even Thanksgiving Day. ComScore, the online analytics firm, is predicting that online spending is going to increase yet again this holiday season. So far this November, $9.7 billion has been spent online, comScore estimated, marking a 14% increase versus the corresponding days last year. Wednesday, November 16, has been the heaviest online spending day to date at $688 million. ""With the persistent backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and continued high unemployment, consumers appear to be increasingly favoring the online benefits of convenience and lower prices,"" said comScore chairman Gian Fulgoni. ""Based on the expectation that these positive spending trends will continue for the season, this year promises to be a Merry Christmas indeed for online retailers."" The National Retail Federation says the average shopper plans to do about 36% of their holiday shopping online, up from 32.7% last year. And retailers are going after them aggressively. In a survey, 33% of respondents told comScore they think they've seen more online sales and bargains this year, while 45% said it seems about the same. Only 7% said they've seen fewer sales or promotions. The Retail Federation says that more than nine in 10 retailers plan to offer free shipping for online orders at some time this season. And more than one-third say they're offering free shipping earlier this year than last year. Among digital shoppers, it's perhaps not surprising that electronic gadgets appear at the top of the shopping list. Consumer-electronics site Retrevo's polling results showed that almost one-third (32%) of its respondents will be searching for a deal on a tablet computer this year. In an interesting twist that might point to the future of the tablet market, the same number of people said they hope to get a Kindle Fire this year (10%) as said they want an iPad. The $199 Fire actually finished slightly ahead of the iPad, which starts at $499, among men in the survey. High-definition televisions were next at 25%, with laptops and smartphones following close behind. Retrevo hasn't just been polling shoppers, either. Their gadget folks have rounded up some lists to help with your online shopping this holiday -- particularly on Black Friday. They've assembled a list of online deals to watch for, as well as a list of online ""duds"" that might not be so attractive. They like a 55-inch Samsung LCD TV for $1,099 at Sears and the Acer Iconia tablet (running Android) for $299 from Staples, among other potential bargains. Not so attractive? Retrevo says a 55-inch plasma TV going for $600 at Sears is already available for $100 less elsewhere, and a Toshiba blu-ray player being offered for as low as $39 on some sites requires a $49 adapter if you want it to run Wi-Fi. And this year, bargains may be increasingly creeping in front of potential shoppers via social-media. Retailers are using their Facebook and Twitter accounts, among others, to reach out to shoppers. Examples? CVS Pharmacy is hosting a quiz on its Facebook page, offering a 20-percent-off coupon for people who take it. In addition to listing specials, RadioShack's page has a ""So Wrong, So Right"" contest that lets fans submit a picture of a terrible give for a chance to win a much better one. And Sears is using Twitter, as well as Facebook, to let customers vote on which items they'd like to see on sale on Black Friday. ""Brands are starting to see that this word-of-mouth scale really works and creates a bigger sense of urgency to purchase,"" Elisabeth Diana, a spokeswoman for Facebook, told USA Today.","More retailers are offering deals for online shoppers, experts say .
National Retail Federation predicts Web spending will be up this year .
Survey: Online shoppers just as likely to want a Kindle Fire as an iPad .
While there are good deals to be found, look out for duds, as well ."
"(CNN) -- Bitcoin is still in beta, and users should only invest what they can afford to lose, Bitcoin Foundation executive director Jon Matonis says. ""It's still experimental, even though it's five years old and very successful, it still is considered experimental,"" Matonis told CNN's Jim Boulden at the world's biggest mobile tech trade show in Barcelona. ""I don't think that people should treat it as non-experimental. You should only invest in trade what you can afford to lose,"" he said. Matonis' comments to CNN at Mobile World Congress come just days after Mt. Gox, one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges, was taken offline, putting millions of dollars of investors' money at risk and shaking confidence in the digital currency. On Friday, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection at a Tokyo court on Friday with debts of 6.5 billion yen ($64 million), Japanese media reported. Matonis, speaking before Mt. Gox's bankruptcy filing, told CNN the melt-down represented the opposite of ""too big to fail capitalism"" because it was not bailed out. ""If this had been a traditional financial institution, the losses would probably be papered over with tax payer money. We didn't see that in this case,"" he said. Mt. Gox has been mired in problems since February 7, when it halted withdrawals from its accounts. The company's computer programmers hadn't accounted for a quirk in the way Bitcoin works, allowing cyber attackers to dupe Mt.Gox with a scheme resembling receipt fraud. When Mt. Gox discovered it was under attack, it stopped any investors from pulling their money out of their trading platform. Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors on Sunday. Matonis remained bullish about Bitcoin's future, telling CNN the currency was ""massively resilient."" Further, he said, ""the exchanges that are still in existence and operating will tend to be stronger because of this."" Matonis said the currency would move out of beta in the next few years. ""I would say in about three to five years we'll start seeing user-friendly apps which really will complete the transition to mainstream. It should be as easy to download and use Bitcoin apps as it is to download something like Skype,"" he said. The currency has fluctuated wildly in value since its inception in 2009, shooting to $1,000 in December as investors began leaping into the currency. It is now around $545. Some traditional businesses, including online retailer Overstock.com, some Subway sandwich shops and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, have begun accepting Bitcoin. But the anonymous nature of the currency also has linked it with less reputable outlets. Bitcoin and other digital ""cryptocurrencies"" have been the de facto payment system on underground websites that deal in drugs, weapons and other illegal merchandise.

"(CNN) -- Citing fears of genocide, representatives of of humanitarian organizations tried Thursday to focus U.S. lawmakers' attention on the Central African Republic, where the situation is on the verge of exploding into a ""decades-long conflict,"" one aid group said. Mercy Corps believes ""right now is the time to act, and we are asking Congress to make smart, forward-thinking decisions,"" said Madeline Rose, a policy adviser to the group, in a telephone interview prior to addressing the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on African Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations. The group fears ""that the current crisis in CAR is on the verge of metastasizing into a new, decades-long conflict,"" she added. The landlocked country, which is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, has seen nearly constant chaos for a year, since militant rebels removed the president from office and then lost power themselves. Even before that, frail governments and poverty plagued its population. Rose cited five priorities for CAR: . -- restoring security; . -- increasing support for peace-building initiatives; . -- meeting immediate humanitarian needs; . -- targeting interventions to protect and empower women and girls; . -- investing resources to transition to state-building and economic recovery. 5 coups d'etat since independence . The roots of the conflict date back to CAR's independence from France in 1960. Since then, ""it's had weak governance, chronic insecurity, five coups d'etat,"" Rose said. ""People have only known violent and oppressive rule. CAR's never really enjoyed a legitimate, civilian administration."" Throughout, the country's 5.2 million residents have endured chronic, abject poverty. That underdevelopment has fomented deep distrust among civilians -- whose median age is 19 years. That distrust erupted into violence and the country descended into chaos in March 2013, after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels known as Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize. They have since been forced from power, but Christian and Muslim militias have continued to battle for control. To counter attacks on Christian communities by Seleka groups, vigilante Christian groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to ""anti-machete,"" fought back. Muslims represented 15% of the population, and Christians were 50%, according to the CIA World Factbook. The groups have morphed into criminal gangs ""that are seizing this opportunity to enrich themselves and to take revenge,"" said Kasper Agger, a field researcher for the Enough Project, prior to his own testimony to the subcommittee. Battle for resources, not religion . ""The most important thing is that people start to understand that this is not necessarily a conflict of Christians versus Muslims, but it's about natural resources"" and competition for control of the states, he said. ""It's those classic issues that need to be tackled."" He called for the United Nations to send mediators to work with interim President Samba-Panza to begin a political process ""with local dialogues and reconciliation across the country."" In a report issued Thursday by his project, Agger said Seleka leaders were linked to Chadian and Sudanese government-backed armed groups, mercenaries, poachers and diamond traders. ""The research reveals that revenues from diamonds and elephant ivory are funding Seleka and other fighters in CAR, enabling them to purchase weapons, fuel, and poaching equipment,"" he said. ""Diamonds mined in CAR are sold to traders in the Darfur region of Sudan, as well as Chad, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo."" The traders circumvent the international certification process and likely sell their wares on the world market, he added. At least 2,000 people have died in the fighting, and 2.2 million others -- about half the country's population -- need humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations. The world body this week appointed Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal to lead the U.N.'s political office charged with preventing conflict in the region. He faces a big job: More than 650,000 residents are internally displaced, and nearly 300,000 have fled to neighboring countries. Ban: 'Do not repeat the mistakes of the past' ""There's no one that really has any power to stop this,"" said Agger, who recently spent a month in the country. ""It was an almost surreal experience,"" he said about his visit, most of which was in the capital city of Bangui, where more than 200,000 residents are displaced, many of them living at the airport or in churches. ""You could have people going to church and the markets were open and then, in the distance, you could hear shootings,"" he said. ""Almost every night, we could hear shootings around town."" The poverty extends to the government, which did not pay its employees for six months, he said. The continuing violence has raised the specter of genocide, as occurred 20 years ago in Rwanda. ""Do not repeat the mistakes of the past -- heed the lessons,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last month during a visit to the country. ""Most members of the Muslim minority have fled. Muslims and Christians have been placed in mortal danger simply because of who they are or what they believe,"" Ban said. ""People have been lynched and decapitated. Sexual violence is on the rise. Gruesome acts have been committed while others cheered on the perpetrators. There has been total impunity -- zero accountability. This must change."" International peacekeeping efforts are under way: Some 6,000 African Union troops and 2,000 French forces are operating in the country, as is the first contingent of 1,600 European Union troops. In addition, the United Nations has promised as many as 10,000 military personnel by September 15. More peacekeepers may not be enough . But Mercy Corps' Rose said it was not clear that they would suffice. The AU forces need help, she said. ""They don't know what's going on, they don't have good intelligence, and they're not good at communicating with the population,"" she said. ""It's making the community more fearful, particularly vulnerable populations."" She said she was hopeful that U.S. lawmakers would act ""to address the underlying issues that caused this crisis in the first place."" Thursday's appeal to lawmakers is an attempt to give them the big picture about what is happening in CAR. The United States has already committed $150 million to the peacekeeping mission, but that effort requires at least another $100 million, said Catholic Relief Services Chief Operating Officer Sean Callahan. ""The world stood by as nearly one million people were killed in Rwanda 20 yrs ago, and we cannot let the violence tear the social fabric of CAR,"" he said. Rose agreed. ""We've seen this over and over again in the way the international community responds to crises like these -- where we focus too narrowly on short-term, emergency needs and don't take a step back to make long-term, strategic investments and decisions about how to solve the root problem."" And CAR faces another big challenge: the country has long been geopolitically insignificant to major donor countries. ""So we, as a humanitarian and advocacy community, have an uphill battle to make the case as to why this is the smart decision now,"" Rose said. ""But I think it's possible."" The challenges are immense. Last week, 16 civilians -- including three national staff members of Medecins Sans Frontieres -- were killed during a robbery on the grounds of a hospital in the northern town of Boguila, said the group, which is also known as Doctors Without Borders. Ex-Seleka members surrounded the hospital grounds, where a meeting was taking place with community leaders invited by MSF to discuss medical access and care, the group said in a statement. ""Unprovoked, the men fired heavily into the crowd, killing and critically wounding meeting participants."" The incident led MSF to withdraw key staff, suspend activities in the town, where Muslims fleeing violence had sought refuge, and reassess whether to continue operations elsewhere in CAR. The incident reverberated among other humanitarian groups, but UNICEF's Country Director for Central African Republic Souleymane Diabate said he was planning to continue business as usual. ""We remained during the crisis, and after the crisis we will remain,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview from his office in Bangui, where he has been working since 2012. Schools have been closed in the country, so UNICEF has opened ""temporary learning spaces"" to carry on the teaching. And it has been providing chemicals to treat water nationwide, he said. In recent months, the number of UNICEF staff members has doubled, to more than 200, though many of them work alongside security staff. Still, he acknowledged, ""there is some risk.""","Since 1960, ""weak governance, chronic insecurity, 5 coups d'etat""

"Rome (CNN) -- The captain of the Costa Concordia went back on board Thursday for the first time since the cruise liner crashed into the rocks off Italy's Giglio island, killing 32 people. As part of his trial, Francesco Schettino, who faces multiple charges including manslaughter and abandoning ship, went aboard the vessel with an expert team appointed by the court and was present as a defendant. He denies any wrongdoing in the accident. Wearing sunglasses, Schettino toured the ship for four hours. Speaking to journalists afterward, he said he could not comment on the survey aboard the wreck. ""I have taken responsibilities for my actions and am undergoing a trial,"" he said. Schettino's lawyers had asked the court to allow him to accompany the experts as they examined the ship's emergency generators. They are also looking to see if anything other than human error could have contributed to the accident. Witnesses said Schettino jumped into a lifeboat to flee the ship, even though hundreds of passengers were still on board. In his trial, the captain said he fell into a lifeboat when the ship listed sharply. He also blamed a malfunction of the ship's watertight doors for making the situation worse by letting in water after the rocks tore into the vessel's hull. His attorneys also say the ship would not have crashed had the helmsman turned it in the direction that Schettino told him to 13 seconds before impact. Complex recovery . The wreckage of the cruise liner, now stabilized after a complex salvage operation last year, sits propped up on underwater platforms just outside the port of Giglio, off the Tuscan coast. It was carrying 4,200 people when it hit a reef January 13, 2012. Journalists and photographers swarmed Schettino as he arrived for a briefing on the island ahead of the tour of the ship. The raising of the Costa Concordia last September was one of the most complex shipwreck recoveries ever undertaken. In a lengthy process involving massive pulleys, cables and steel tanks, a salvage crew managed to roll the 114,00-ton vessel off the rocks. In an interview on Italian television last year, Schettino said he had felt pain over the victims' deaths every day since the disaster.

"Christchurch, New Zealand (CNN) -- I was just leaving Newstalk ZB's building for the day when all hell broke loose. Fast-footing it in the middle of Worcester Street, I watched in raw terror as the Christchurch Club collapsed in front of me. A blood-soaked woman emerged out of the storm of dust and debris and after I assisted her to Latimer Square, it soon dawned on me that much of the city center was raining down on its citizens. Gazing to the south of Latimer Square, a billowing column of dust blocked any view of the CTV building. It wasn't until later in the day that I was confronted with the brutal reality that the dust wasn't blocking the view, but it was the dust of the building's remains. After frantically ensuring my family members were all safe, and taking stock of my own smashed-up house, my thoughts and prayers have been transfixed on my CTV family. For the past 10 years, the regional television channel has been a trusty employer for me, broadcasting my weekly current affairs program. At the time of writing, it would be inappropriate for me to name all of the staff that have been killed in this mass tragedy. My heart has been torn by the unwieldy weight of grief, as I reflect on 17 much-loved workmates who I will never share a TV studio with again. Seventeen passionate, resolute workmates who believed in regional television and made it work. CTV was not just ""a shopping channel,"" as some people have scoffed. It served as a mirror on our region and that mirror has been so grotesquely shattered. And CTV has been the career launch-pad for dozens and dozens of TV journalists, who now appear on our nightly network news programs. CTV was the longest-running television channel in New Zealand, and although it will never be the same, it will rise again to serve our region. It must. One day at a time. Like many Cantabs, my mind is haunted with the apocalyptic scenes of our devastated city. I am sick to the pit of my stomach at the wrenching loss of life and casualty toll. Why did so many modern buildings implode? In hindsight, were we too impatient and ""she'll be right"" in agitating for the city center to return to ""business as usual"" so soon? How long should it be closed for now? What will it take before people trust our city center, and feel safe in the buildings that remain? How many people will trust the land they have lived and worked on? I know many Cantabs who simply cannot take it anymore and have abandoned the city they love, indefinitely. There are no fast solutions. For tens of thousands of folk, even securing basic services like power, water and sewage is going to be a marathon wait. Just as the Ellerslie Flower Show has been understandably cancelled, Christchurch's share of the Rugby World Cup does not look viable. Where will people stay? How fast can AMI Stadium be repaired? Should resources be diverted from key infrastructure work for the sake of this rugby tournament? There are so many questions and clouds of doubt. As much as we are exhorted to uphold our plucky, resilient spirit, I have huge fears about how much repair and rebuilding work can be done in time for winter. Can our viciously wounded city continue to support and sustain 400,000 people while major infrastructure and rebuilding work is undertaken? How can we seriously house everyone? I suspect a substantial portion of our population will need to relocate out of Christchurch, in the medium term, while the large-scale reconstruction work is carried out. Christchurch will rise again, Christchurch will shine again. But the slow road to recovery is going to be herculean.","Many of Yardley's colleagues were killed in the collapse of Canterbury Television news station .

"(CNN) -- It's been well more than a week since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing. With few hard facts to work from, experts -- and the public -- are conjuring up and sharing theories on what became of the commercial airliner carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Its disappearance -- as if into thin air -- is disturbing in our age of continuous connectivity. As a result, no speculation seems off limits, no matter how dark. As aviation expert Mark Weiss put it: ""I don't think you can discount any theory, frankly."" And so, the theories are plentiful. Speculation: Pilot suicide . Any traveler abhors the notion of a crew member bent on annihilation. But it's plausible. For example, EgyptAir Flight 990 was flying 217 people from Los Angeles to New York to Cairo in 1999 when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. officials blamed a co-pilot, who was recorded repeating a prayer, for deliberately causing the crash, but Egyptian officials blamed mechanical problems. The Malaysian Airlines flight, a Boeing 777, could have experienced destruction by pilot or crew, some say. Is there a clue in pilot psychological evaluations? ""It's my belief that there was probably some type of struggle in the cockpit where it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane,"" said Weiss, a retired American Airlines pilot captain who has flown the Boeing 777 and now works at the Washington consulting firm Spectrum Group. Or there could have been another crew member or an uninvited or invited guest in the cockpit who ""was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft,"" Weiss added. Though improper, pilots allowing guests into the cockpit is possible and ""should be disconcerting to anybody,"" Weiss said. He was referring to reports of how copilot Fariq Ab Hamid, 27, had once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit in a 2011 flight between Thailand and Malaysia. ""That's an enormous breach of security,"" Weiss said of cockpit guests. But none of us will know what really happened in the cockpit ""until we have the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder,"" Weiss said. Bergen: Did terrorists take control of Flight 370? Speculation: Commandeering . Commandeering isn't to be confused with hijacking, a political act in which demands are issued by the hijacker, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. A commandeering is more idiosyncratic, where motives aren't immediately clear, Bergen said. Some counterterrorism officials say that could be the case with the Malaysian flight, Bergen said. ""The plane could have been commandeered,"" Bergen said. Commandeered flights have a history -- prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, Bergen said. For example, in 1994, the cargo plane FedEx Flight 705 was commandeered by an employee with a hammer and spear gun who burst into the cockpit and wanted to crash the plane into FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee, headquarters. The crew thwarted that takeover. In 2000, a passenger with a suspected mental history commandeered a British Airways Flight 2069 between London and Nairobi and put the plane carrying 300 passengers into a nosedive until the crew subdued him. ""So commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know and certainly a theory that we haven't heard a lot of that isn't a conspiracy,"" Bergen said. Pilots, passengers of flight under scrutiny . Speculation: Hijacking . That the plane terminated transponder data before its disappearance leads some experts to suspect a hijacking occurred. The political motivation of such a hijacking, however, would be as mysterious as the plane's whereabouts. ""If you are dealing with hijackers on board the aircraft, whether it was an organized gang, or whether it was some psychologically disturbed individual that ... managed to gain access to the flight, they can neutralize the crew,"" said Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International. ""But then again, there wouldn't necessarily be any communication at all -- as we witnessed on September 11th,"" Baum added, referring to the terror attacks in the United States. ""If there was an explosive decompression, if a bomb detonated on board the aircraft, then again there would be no communication."" One motive could be terrorism. Authorities haven't ruled out this possibility, though some experts are divided on this theory, partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world's attention. ""There might be another reason for them not coming forward at this point,"" Shawn Henry, former executive assistant director of the FBI, said. ""If it was a terrorist incident...if this was part of a much larger or broader potential act, and for whatever reason, they wouldn't come forward at this point, but at a later time."" Speculation: Mechanical failure . In a less sinister but equally lethal explanation, some experts theorize the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction. Perhaps it was an electrical failure. It's possible, though pilots have trouble embracing the thought. ""I've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened,"" said Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and retired American Airlines pilot. ""One possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very, very hard to imagine because it has so many generators coming from different places,"" Tilmon said. ""If all the engine generators fail, they still have what's called the RAT (ram air turbine). That's the generator that literally falls out of the bottom of the airplane, has a propeller on it, and ram-air turns that and gives them generating power enough to go ahead and fly the airplane safely. ""Electrical failure -- it'd have to be total ... absolutely incredible like we've not heard of before,"" Tilmon said. Could flight have slipped by radar? Speculation: The bizarre . Not constrained by professional accountability as the experts are, Internet users have offered their own theories. A meteor struck the plane. Some country's military shot down the plane. The plane landed on a remote island. Aliens abducted the plane. With no answers and contradictions and questions increasing, the theories, creative conjecture and pure speculation abound. ""Everybody wants to get a handle on something right now,"" former Federal Aviation Administration investigator David Soucie said of conflicting theories. ""No one has an answer, so they're going to try to put one on it. So that creates all kinds of assumptions."" CNN's Wen-Chun Fan, Thom Patterson and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Experts conjecture that pilot or crew may have been bent on suicidal destruction .

"(CNN) -- Investors of Russian assets have had their first real chance to assess the situation in Ukraine and they didn't like what they saw. The two major indices in Moscow, the MICEX and the RTS, slumped more than 8% on opening Monday and worsened as they day carried on. Investors do not like uncertainty and they were delivered more than their fair share over the weekend. With the ruble hitting a record low of about 37 to the dollar, central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina surprised the market by pushing interest rates to 7% to buffer a run on the currency. The reality is quite simple: Russia's economy has seen a dramatic slowdown for the past year. After growing 3.4% in 2012, it came in at about a third of that level last year with an expansion of just 1.3%. The forecast of 2.5% growth in 2014, many suggest, looks ambitious with incursions into Ukraine part of the equation. While this is being positioned domestically in Russia as a move by President Vladimir Putin on behalf of Russians in the east of Ukraine, the military action probably will not sit well with those in the middle class who took to the streets over the past year. They have been frustrated by slow growth, a lack of transparency within government, and a lack of oil and gas revenues trickling down to those with higher aspirations and expectations. During the height of the global financial crisis, Putin, whether at a G8 or G20 Summit, took the opportunity to criticize western powers for not being vigilant enough with their commercial bankers -- whether on Wall Street or within the City of London. He proudly predicted Russia would continue to grow at 4% with ample reserves of a half trillion dollars saved for a rainy day. That day may have arrived. Strategists I have interviewed complain that Putin relied on one asset -- energy -- for far too long. At the World Energy Congress in South Korea late last year, the energy minister Alexander Novak spelled out plans for Russian reserves to expand handsomely over the coming years. Gas pipelines, like the South Stream, are being constructed to bypass Ukraine and provide Europe with ample supplies for the next generation. Russia also has inked strategic energy partnerships with China and South Korea. But as the world is finding out, one cannot live on energy alone with an economy of 140 million people. Government ministers I have spoken with admit they are well behind the curve when it comes to infrastructure investment. Another worrying sign for the economy is that it is expanding only modestly -- despite the projected $50 billion that was spent on the Sochi Winter Games and projects earmarked for the 2018 World Cup. So where does dispute over Ukraine lead us? There are a number of tricky questions that need to be answered. Executives at Gazprom, Russia's state-run gas giant, have declared that Ukraine is one and a half billion dollars in arrears on payments and that discounts given to the previous, pro-Moscow government expire at the end of the month. It is not clear whether Russia will turn off the taps as it has done twice before. Ukraine is carrying an unmanageable amount of debt -- nearly $30 billion comes due by the end of 2015, about half of that this year. The IMF is sending a team over for an initial consultation this week, but until the political situation is sorted out before elections, it is not clear whether the fund will step in. There is a co-dependency between Russia and Europe. While major European Union members like Germany and France have reduced their reliance on Russian gas, about a quarter of all supplies still comes from pipelines filled by Moscow. About a third of Russia's daily oil output of nearly ten million barrels a day goes to Europe as well. Finally, the U.S. may be suffering from military fatigue after years in Iraq and Afghanistan and the European Union from expansion fatigue. With 28 members after of an era of enlargement and sluggish growth of just a 0.5% projected for this year, Brussels can ill afford to jump into a political mess on its eastern flank.

"(CNN) -- ""I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'"" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos. She was speaking from her hospital bed in Christchurch, New Zealand, after being rescued from the rubble of a five-story building that collapsed during Tuesday's 6.3-magnitude earthquake. Vos had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the Pyne Gould Corporation building, drawing international attention to her plight. In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die. ""I'm very lucky, I'm very, very lucky,"" she said. She said she remembered vividly the moment the quake struck. She had taken over at the reception desk to allow a colleague to go for lunch, and she was logging onto a computer when the ""rumbling"" started. ""It happened so quickly. I heard the rumble and then stuff was falling from the ceiling and I thought it was best to go under the desk rather than try to get out. There wasn't any time to think, but I am lucky I didn't go to the stairs. There wouldn't have been time. I don't know what might have happened. ""A lot of concrete pieces fell on me and the desk sort of bent completely around. My arm was trapped under a huge piece of concrete. It was starting to swell and I couldn't feel my hand. I couldn't get my feet out, and there was a lot of broken glass and electrical wires so I couldn't move at all. I was stuck there in a little cubby hole,"" she said. It was then, in severe pain and struggling to breathe, that Vos realized she may not survive. She began to call close friends and family on her mobile phone. ""I was more or less saying goodbye. I just wanted to tell people that I loved them and to say goodbye."" She was unable to reach her Melbourne-based son, Robert, and she left a goodbye message on his voicemail. Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out. She was awakened by shaking, but she says she doesn't know whether it was an aftershock or the building further collapsing. Whatever it was, it changed her fortune. ""When I came to, it (the piece of concrete on her) had moved and I was able to wriggle a bit. Once that came off and I could breathe again, I started to think maybe I could I make it. The whole time I was thinking about my family and my friends and I just wanted to make it out. I was hoping someone would rescue me soon."" Vos' next few hours were remarkable. Her son, Robert, gave her number to a Melbourne radio station, and soon conversations with her were being broadcast internationally. She spoke to the media from underneath her crushed desk until her phone battery died. Listen to Anne Vos talking to the media . Vos was not rescued until early Wednesday afternoon. She was taken to hospital with cracked ribs, heavy bruising and multiple cuts. She said the feeling of relief was hard to describe, especially when she saw the state of the building. ""While I was in there I didn't know what was going on. I was just trapped under my desk, you know. When I got out it was such a shock. The building wasn't there anymore. The job the search teams did was just fantastic."" Vos says she now needs to assess the damage to her possessions, and after experiencing two major earthquakes and many aftershocks, she may decide to move away from the area. ""I don't know if I'll stay. I am scared. I feel a bit like I have nothing keeping me here. I don't know if my place has survived."" There are other anxieties too. ""I am also a bit worried about where I could work. I think I would be too afraid to go into a tall building for a while,"" she said.","Anne Vos spent 24 hours trapped in the rubble of the Pyne Gould Corporation building .

"(CNN) -- Israel responded with heavy fire after five rockets from Gaza landed Wednesday in populated areas of southern Israel, marking ""the most substantial attack"" in two years against the country, the Israeli military said. The military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, called the Al-Quds Brigade, claimed responsibility for firing dozens of missiles on what it called ""Israeli settlements."" In response, Israel launched airstrikes on three areas in Gaza -- Rafah, Khan Younis and Jabalia -- that are believed to belong to Islamic Jihad, according to security sources in Gaza. A Hamas spokesman texted CNN to say they counted six airstrikes, but claimed they were against bases that were empty. In all, the Israeli military targeted ""29 terror sites"" in Gaza, the military said on its Twitter page. ""Direct hits were confirmed,"" the military tweeted. ""In today's attack, 41 rockets struck in Israel, five hit populated areas and three were intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system,"" the military said in another statement. ""This is the most substantial rocket attack from the Gaza Strip since Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012."" Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which is the Palestinian movement running Gaza, evacuated their military and civilian institutions on expectation of Israeli reprisals, the security sources in Gaza said. Israel intercepts ship with weapons headed to Gaza . In the wake of the attack, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told Israeli army radio that ""the position of my party Israel Beitanyu is that we support the full occupation of the whole of Gaza in any possible future action."" Liberman opposed a response short of full occupation. ""I am against a limited operation,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was later asked for his reaction to Liberman's comments at a joint news conference with Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron Wednesday evening in Jerusalem. ""If it is not quiet in southern Israel, it will be very noisy in Gaza,"" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called upon Israel to stop the ""military escalation on the besieged Gaza Strip, considering that this escalation will put the isolated residents in the danger of the war and destruction,"" presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said through the official Wafa news agency. ""The Gaza Strip is constantly being targeted by Israeli airstrikes that targeted many areas,"" Rudeineh said. Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV flashed a banner stating: ""The occupation bares the full responsibility regarding this wave of aggression and the ongoing escalation."" Abu Ahmad, spokesman for the Al-Quds Brigades, said the rocket fire came ""after a long series of violations to the truce with the Palestinian resistance since November 2012."" ""This operation, dubbed 'Breaking the Silence,' comes as a response to the ongoing and continued Zionist Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza,"" Ahmad said. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon ordered a halt to the shipment of goods to Gaza through a crossing on the Gaza-Israel-Egypt border until security assessments are made, the military said in statement. However, another crossing will be open for humanitarian movements, the military said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the multiple rocket attacks from Gaza on Israel and urged maximum restraint by all parties to prevent an escalation of violence and destabilization to the region, a spokesman said. Israeli Apache helicopters flew over Gaza City on Wednesday after several rockets were reportedly fired from the Palestinian territory at the Israeli town of Sderot, officials said. The Al-Quds Brigade claimed responsibility on its website for firing a total of 34 rockets and 14 mortar rounds at ""Zionist targets.""

"(CNN) -- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared Saturday somewhere over Southeast Asia. Authorities don't know where the plane is or what happened to it. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about this baffling disappearance: . Did the plane go off course? Possibly, but not certainly. While accounts from Malaysian authorities have been at times confusing and sometimes conflicting, authorities said Wednesday that radar picked up an unidentified aircraft flying over the Malay Peninsula into the Strait of Malacca early Saturday night. That's hundreds of miles from the Beijing-bound plane's flight path. But authorities cautioned they aren't sure the blip was Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. On Tuesday another Malaysian official said there wasn't any evidence the plane had turned around. And early Thursday (Wednesday evening ET), China announced one of its satellites had spotted ""a suspected crash area at sea"" -- including three ""suspected floating objects"" up to 24 meters (79 feet) long. We could find out more soon, as Malaysian officials have asked international experts to help interpret the data. What is a transponder? It's a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar. When it receives a radar signal, it returns a code with the aircraft's position, altitude and call sign. Air traffic controllers use the signals to determine a plane's speed and direction. Why did it stop working? That's one of many million-dollar questions. The transponder is situated between the pilots and can be disabled with a twist of the wrist, but former airline captain Mark Weiss said that because of the vital information -- and thus, protection -- the transponder provides, it's highly unlikely a pilot would turn it off. Without the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, it's difficult to say who was in the cockpit and exactly what happened, Weiss said. Experts also give conflicting opinions: While one expert says the circumstances point to someone -- perhaps a hijacker -- deliberately turning the plane around, another says a catastrophic power failure could explain the anomalies. How does the search work? Authorities break huge swaths of Earth into much smaller grids. Then, planes or ships scour the grids to eliminate them as candidates for the crash site. As of Wednesday, 42 ships and 39 planes from a dozen countries were involved. The grids are massive and make up 27,000 miles of land and sea, including the southern tip of Vietnam, South Thailand, about half of Malaysia and parts of the South China Sea, Gulf of Thailand and Strait of Malacca. Could 'crowdsourcing' help find the plane? Ostensibly, sure. Colorado firm DigitalGlobe has one of the most advanced commercial satellite networks, and its images of the Strait of Malacca and Gulf of Thailand can capture details as small as a baseball field's home plate, the longest side of which is 17 inches. Volunteers can flag anything they find interesting, but so many answered the call this week that the firm's website crashed. (The website appeared to be up Wednesday). Also, there's the troubling size of the search area. Is this the first time a plane has vanished? Not at all. Several plane crashes have posed problematic searches -- 1988's PanAm 103, 1996's TWA 800 and 1999's EgyptAir 990, among them. But perhaps none was as a tricky as Air France 447, which went down after departing Rio de Janeiro on June 1, 2009. It took four searches and almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage and majority of bodies were recovered. The voice and data recorders weren't found on the ocean floor until May 2011. How does a plane disappear? There's no simple answer here, especially when you consider the bevy of technology on a state-of-the-art jetliner, which includes UHF and VHF radios, automatic beacons, GPS and computer communications systems. It doesn't help that Flight MH370's flight path is unclear and that the search areas include vast waters and sparsely populated jungles and mountains. Were the pilots experienced? The short answer is yes. Fariq Ab Hamid, 27, joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007 and was first officer on the flight. He has 2,763 flying hours and was transitioning to the Boeing 777-200 after finishing training in a flight simulator. The pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, has 18,365 flying hours. He joined the airline in 1981. There are reports Hamid let passengers in the cockpit on another flight? Is that legal? Jonti Roos has told several media outlets that Hamid invited her and a friend into the cockpit for most of a 2011 flight from Thailand to Malaysia. While this would be a strict violation of U.S. regulations put in place after the 9/11 attacks, the legality would vary from country to country. Upon learning of Roos' claim, Malaysia Airlines said it was ""shocked,"" while former U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief of staff Michael Goldfarb said such behavior by a pilot ""just violates every code of conduct."" Is foul play possible? Hijackers? Terrorism? The CIA and FBI aren't ruling it out, but to be fair, authorities aren't ruling out much at this point. It's highly suspicious that the plane may have turned around. Those suspicions are further fueled by the loss of communication with the plane, considering the aircraft had ""redundant electrical systems"" that would have to be disabled. Robert Francis, former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, said his first thought upon hearing the circumstances of MH370's mysterious disappearance was that it blew up, but even then, an explosion would not be hard-and-fast evidence of terrorism. What about those passengers with stolen passports? Interpol says it has identified the men as Iranians Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, and Malaysian investigators say neither of them has any apparent connection to terrorist organizations. Stolen passports certainly aren't indicative of terrorism. In fact, Interpol says passengers flew without having their travel documents checked against its lost-and-stolen passport database more than a billion times in 2013. Among the reasons someone might use a stolen passport: to immigrate illegally to another country, to import goods without being taxed or to smuggle stolen goods, people, drugs or weapons. What about pilot error? Certainly possible. That's what the investigation showed happened with the 2009 Air France flight, though there was an element of mechanical failure as well. In that case, though, there was also inclement weather -- not the case with MH370. As of Wednesday, nothing suggests that pilot error played a role in the flight's disappearance. So, could mechanical failure explain it? It's one of the stronger possibilities. The absence so far of any debris field could suggest the pilot had to make an emergency landing on water and it later sunk beneath the sea, but there is still the mystery of the distress signal. There's wasn't one. However, aviation consultant Kit Darby has said it's possible there was a power problem, the backup power lasted only an hour and the pilot attempted to turn back to ""the airports and a region he knows."" There's also the possibility of a tail or wing ripping off. This particular Boeing suffered a clipped wing tip in the past, but Boeing repaired it. Another frightening possibility is that a window or door failed, which would allow ambient temperatures of 60 degrees below zero into the cabin, creating a freezing fog and giving crew members only seconds to don oxygen masks before they were disoriented and then incapacitated. Could it have been hit by a meteor? There was a known meteor in the area at takeoff, but this seems to be atop a list of strange conspiracy theories popping up in the absence of empirical data explaining the plane's disappearance. Given what little is known about the flight path, it seems like a long, long shot that a meteor is to blame. What about reports that passengers' cell phones continued operating after MH370's disappearance? Please see earlier question about meteors and conspiracy theories. When phones are disabled or turned off -- which would presumably happen after a plane crash -- calls to those cell phones don't ring, but go to directly to voice mail. Friends and loved ones of the missing passengers, however, reported ringing when they called. Technology industry analyst Jeff Kagan says a call would first connect to a network before trying to locate the end user, and the ringing sound callers hear masks the silence they would otherwise hear while waiting for the connection to be made. ""If it doesn't find the phone after a few minutes, after a few rings, then typically, it disconnects and that's what's happening,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- If fans thought season one of ""Orphan Black"" was mysterious, get ready to spiral deeper down the rabbit hole for a second season. The show returns this Saturday April 19 on BBC America. Never heard of ""Orphan Black""? For the uninitiated, ""Welcome to the trip, man,"" as character Cosima Niehaus would say. It all unfolds in the first three minutes of the series premiere: A woman on a train platform witnesses another woman jump to her death -- and they're identical. The witness, morally ambiguous Sarah Manning (played by Tatiana Maslany), assumes the dead woman's identity. It's no spoiler to say that things don't work out the way she planned. By taking on the identity of the deceased Beth Childs, Sarah discovers that Beth was in contact with other identical women who are actually clones. Together, the clone sisters realize that some of their loved ones are really monitors for the mysterious Dyad Institute, overseeing the clone experiment. The clones can only trust one another as they try to unravel the mystery of their origins and the people who seek to control them. ""It's a crazy, fast-paced clone conspiracy thriller and a long-arc mystery,"" co-creator and writer Graeme Manson told CNN. The idea was heavily inspired by the mind-bending film ""Memento,"" and evolved into a multifaceted story dealing with themes of nature vs. nurture and identity theft. ""We thought clones hadn't really got their due."" For many, those first few glimpses hooked viewers and turned them into instant fans -- celebrities like Kevin Bacon, Damon Lindelof, Patton Oswalt and Emma Roberts included -- and the #cloneclub community was born. Why 'Orphan Black' works . Tatiana Maslany . Maslany's unique embodiment of each clone, from tough girl Sarah to geeky scientist Cosima to high-strung soccer mom Alison, is fascinating to watch. She created a playlist of songs to help her develop personalities for each character. As for playing multiple clones in a single scene, Maslany has acted against a double most recently. But she's been known to rely on tennis balls with faces drawn on them and Xs taped on the wall and floor. ""Watching her do these characters in a very substantial, complex, layered way really is what made this absolutely absurd idiotic premise work,"" co-creator and director John Fawcett told CNN. While the campaign to get Maslany nominated for an Emmy didn't succeed (and, as a result, incited the Twittersphere), Maslany was nominated for Golden Globe and People's Choice awards, and won the Critics' Choice, Young Hollywood and Canadian Screen awards. It can't be easy to portray so many different characters, but Maslany makes it look effortless. ""I kind of have to think about all of them [...] Just breathing and being there as that character, and letting that come out, with an awareness that I do have to move on from that person at the end of it,"" Maslany told Entertainment Weekly. See Tatiana Maslany and more of CNN's 10 fresh faces for 2014 . Cliffhangers galore . If you watch ""Orphan Black"" regularly, you might have trust issues. Every episode is a roller coaster of twists and turns that creates doubt before the audience can believe a character's motives completely. Paul Dierden (Dylan Bruce), Beth's boyfriend, proves to be a chameleon. One minute, he seems loyal to Sarah-as-Beth. The next minute, he's reporting on her activities to the Dyad Institute. There is no lag time as the action stacks up back to back, usually pairing car chases and shootout scenes in between kidnappings and one clone masquerading as another. ""We wanted cliffhangers every act break and left turns when you weren't expecting them and to generally keep the audience unbalanced,"" Fawcett said. Unconventional characters . Each clone is surrounded by a memorable cast of characters. From Sarah's sassy foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris) to Cosima's beautiful lover Delphine (Evelyne Brochu,) ""Orphan Black"" tends to celebrate the underdog. These gritty, flawed portrayals aren't the characters you normally see on TV and they aren't written as classic archetypes. Sarah is a con artist with a checkered past, but she's also a fiercely protective mother to her young daughter, Kira. Cosima isn't played as your average geek -- she's quirky, making a brilliant discovery about clone DNA one second and smoking pot the next. Dr. Aldous Leekie (Matt Frewer) of the Dyad Institute is as charmingly likeable as he is terrifyingly controlling. Not only have fans identified with each clone, but the representations of LGBT characters like Felix and Cosima as well. ""I take joy in playing someone who is so liberated, not just in his sexuality, but his work as an artist, and his life,"" Gavaris said. ""He's not perfect, he's an antihero with a lot of flaws (most of them powder-related), but he is a fully realized human being."" Clone science . Fawcett has become accustomed to hearing people say, ""I don't normally like sci-fi, but I love your show."" That's probably because cloning and body augmentation is played as modern science, rather than futuristic science fiction. The fictional Dyad Institute explores the ethical complications of when science plays God. It poses a question largely explored in Season 2: When you're a clone, who really ""owns"" you and your DNA? What to expect in Season 2 . Now that you're caught up, the new season will catapult from last year's finale. ""Season 2 does two things,"" Manson told CNN. ""It continues our fast pace and momentum and opens up our mysteries while giving some answers."" Specifically, this means the addition of threatening characters (think religious extremists) and delving into Cosima's mysterious illness that could endanger all of the clones, while further exploring a clone we met at the end of Season 1: Rachel Duncan. The ruthless corporate pro-clone and Sarah's nemesis is actually Maslany's favorite to play, and a large focus of the second season. The relationships between characters will shift as well. ""Sarah and Felix will be tested, there's some contention there,"" Gavaris said. ""I wanted to establish Felix outside of the clones, and the only way to do that is to put a wedge between him and Sarah. But I think the audience will understand it when we get there."" The biggest question shaping Season 2: who took Sarah's daughter, Kira, at the end of Season 1? As the only child born to a clone, plenty of people have good reason for viewing her as a scientific goldmine. And it appears we may not be finished with meeting all of the clones. Fawcett added that learning what the fans liked from season one and the strong response from the ""clone club"" inspired the entire ""Oprhan Black"" team to pull out all of the stops for Season 2. ""The clone club community has been so inclusive and such a source of respectful conversation online,"" Gavaris said. ""It's the society we want. There's no need for boxes or labels. We would all rejoice in a world where everyone is accepted.""","Season 2 of ""Orphan Black"" returns April 19 .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The 15 victims simply couldn't outrun the searing debris that billowed out of Indonesia's Mount Sinabung. Plumes of ash had spewed more than a mile into the sky Saturday and descended in superheated clouds. Scalding ash up to 700 degrees in temperature raced down the slope in just two to three minutes. By the end of several eruptions, at least 15 people had been killed, a government official told CNN. It was the first time Mount Sinabung's volcanic output had resulted in deaths, the Jakarta Post reported. On Sunday, the sky above the North Sumatra mountain was still the color of murky gray ash, as shown on video from the Indonesia Geologic Agency. The victims, and at least three other injured people, were all found in Sukameriah, a village close to the volcano's crater, disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told CNN. What you need to know about volcanoes . Local search-and-rescue teams were scheduled to go on a recovery operation Sunday, he said. Eruptions at Mount Sinabung are becoming common. After about 400 years of minimal volcanic activity there, Sinabung erupted in 2010. It has been emitting gas since September. The English-language Jakarta Post said while 31 people previously had died from eruption-related illnesses such as asthma and hypertension. The unpredictable volcanic volatility has meant an itinerant existence for those who live in this region a 2Â½ hour flight from Jakarta. Last month, intensifying volcanic activity forced 22,000 people into temporary camps, but more than half were allowed to return home on Friday. The newest volcanic activity has forced people to evacuate 16 villages, the Jakarta Post reported. At least 30,000 people have been temporarily housed at 42 evacuation centers, according to Billy Sumuan, the emergency response director in Indonesia for the humanitarian group World Vision. Saturday's victims lived within a 3-kilometer radius of the volcano. Some were there checking on their homes or were there just to watch the eruptions, Nugroho said. Others were students and volunteers in the region to help its beleaguered people, Sumuan said. The government had issued the highest level of alert for the latest eruptions, and Sumuan noted that no one was supposed to go inside a 5-kilometer zone around the volcano. Live video of the volcano . Several government agencies and nongovernmental humanitarian groups were on the scene Sunday helping those affected, including World Vision, which Sumuan said was helping children with their trauma and hygiene. The government and local churches handed out masks to everyone to mitigate breathing problems, he said.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A truck carrying more than 25 tons of dynamite exploded Monday in northern Mexico, killing at least 23 people and injuring more than 140, a government spokesman said. Of the 140 injured, 30 suffered critical wounds and five were listed in extremely critical condition, said David Aguisn, spokesman for Humberto Moreira, the governor of the state of Coahuila. Notimex, Mexico's official news agency, reported at least 30 people were killed in the blast at a factory near Monclova -- about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Monterrey. Three Mexican reporters were among those killed, according to Notimex. Video footage showed the burned-out, mangled shell of the truck and nearby cars damaged by the blast.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A day after Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal apologized for mishandling Tuesday's snowfall, which paralyzed Atlanta and resulted in commutes that exceeded 20 hours for some people, temperatures rose above freezing Friday and the city too busy to hate moved on. ""I've gotten the message loud and clear and I'm going to act like it and do something about it,"" Mayor Kasim Reed told reporters at the Atlanta Press Club. Reed said he would be more aggressive in handling any future events, even if that means using his bully pulpit to persuade others not under his authority to act. ""I'm going to publicly say that the city of Atlanta is closing and we believe everybody in the city should close right away, and anybody who doesn't agree, they can take my seat on CNN."" That was an apparent reference to a testy interview Reed had Wednesday with CNN's Carol Costello. Reed acknowledged that the image of his city has taken a hit in the public eye, but predicted it would rebound. ""I think we'll earn it back, day by day, and I'm confident that there will be a severe weather event and we'll be able to show that we have the ability to respond."" On Friday, the last of the more than 2,000 cars that were abandoned when 2.6 inches of snow overwhelmed Atlanta's ability to cope were being picked up by their owners. By Friday morning, only about a dozen were left on interstates and state roads, said Ken Davis, a spokesman for Georgia's Emergency Management Agency. Government help, which many said was impossible to find in the immediate aftermath of the storm, was available Thursday, when the National Guard and State Patrol offered free rides to abandoned cars, five free gallons of gas and a jump-start. On Thursday night, the state began towing -- at state expense -- unclaimed cars. The Atlanta Police Department said it would waive impounding fees for those cars it towed, though it was just one of many agencies dealing with abandoned cars. By Sunday, the temperature should reach the 60's in parts of the Southeast. Political aftermath . The governor also vowed to move more aggressively and more quickly before any future storms, even if that means more false alarms. ""I accept responsibility for the fact that we did not make preparation early enough to avoid these consequences,"" Deal said Thursday. ""I'm not looking for a scapegoat. I'm the governor, the buck stops with me."" Many people spent the night in their cars Tuesday, trapped in the gridlock. Some students were stuck on school buses, others had to shelter overnight in their schools. GEMA's director apologized for not cranking up emergency operations six hours earlier than he did. ""I got this one wrong,"" Charley English said. Reed cited the mass exodus from his city as largely responsible for the gridlock and said the schedule for sending people home should have been staggered. He acknowledged that a ""lack of experience"" in dealing with severe weather events in Atlanta played a role. Monster sprawl . Reed has managerial control over most, but not all, of Fulton County. But greater Atlanta comprises 28 counties with 140 cities and towns sprawled over an area the size of Massachusetts, and Reed does not have administrative power over them. That needs to change, according to retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who coordinated relief efforts along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. ""They need to have in Atlanta the same type of government you have in New York, where the mayor controls the city and everything around that city, and the mayor can make decisions on road closures; he has emergency powers as when schools close,"" he said. Atlanta's transportation system is fragile . Though warmth may have returned to Atlanta, its residents still can't count on a reasonable commute. The city's subway -- called MARTA -- does not reach many areas of the city, so the vast majority of commuters drive. That often means traffic jams during rush hours, which can extend through much of the day. According to the Texas Transportation Institute's Urban Mobility 2010 study, cited by the Clean Air Campaign, the region is the 12th most wasteful commute in the country. The average Atlanta driver is stuck in traffic for 43 hours per year; that's in addition to his or her normal commuting time, it said. That translates into a cost to Atlanta commuters of nearly $3 billion per year in time and fuel -- $924 per person, it said. The average commuting distance is 35 miles in metro Atlanta, and costs commuters $16.45 per day, said the Clean Air Campaign, a not-for-profit advocacy group. More than four in five commuters (82%) drive alone, it said, citing a 2010 survey carried out for the Georgia Department of Transportation. Despite those statistics, voters in 2012 turned down a transportation initiative. ""Nobody fought harder for funding for MARTA than me during the regional transportation referendum,"" Reed said Friday. But, he added, he has transportation improvement in mind, with plans to extend a street car due to come on line this year and to invest in roads, bridges and sidewalks.

"(CNN) -- With an awesome four-goal display from striker Robert Lewandowski in the first leg of their semifinal last year, Borussia Dortmund all but knocked Real Madrid out of the Champions League. On Wednesday when the teams met again in the first leg of the quarterfinals, it was Real Madrid's turn to inflict a heavy defeat and realistically seal a spot in the next round. And two men jeered by their own supporters last weekend played a key role, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Both scored -- Ronaldo tied the single season record with his 14th goal before leaving due to injury -- as Los Blancos thumped an under-strength Dortmund 3-0 at Madrid's Bernabeu stadium. Dortmund pulled off a miracle victory in the 2013 quarterfinals against Malaga and it looks like only a similar scenario would see Jurgen Klopp's men progress. ""It's a magnificent result,"" Isco, the other Madrid goal scorer, told Spanish television. ""We are pleased with the 3-0, above all for not conceding a goal. ""It's a big step towards a place in the semifinals."" In a battle of two clubs rejuvenated thanks to mega wealthy owners, Paris Saint-Germain added to Chelsea's woes by prevailing 3-1 in Wednesday's other quarterfinal. Klopp called Real Madrid the ""overwhelming"" favorite with his team missing among others the suspended Lewandowski, Neven Subotic, Ilkay Gundogan and Jakub Blaszczykowski -- and it didn't take long for the home team to prove him right. Bale, the world's most expensive player, poked the ball past Roman Weidenfeller in the third minute. Following a spell where Dortmund managed to contain Real Madrid -- Weidenfeller did, though, keep out Ronaldo's free kick -- Isco's low finish in the 27th minute doubled the advantage and the record nine-time tournament champion cruised to the interval. Isco, in the Malaga side ousted by Dortmund, only started because of an illness to winger Angel di Maria. Klopp got a response early in the second half but Dortmund fans must have been ruing the absence of Lewandowski even more. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrik Mkhitaryan missed chances, then Ronaldo got the crucial third from close range in the 57th minute. His 14 goals equal Barcelona rival Lionel Messi's output in 2011/2012 and Jose Altafini's European Cup mark for AC Milan in 1962/63. Defender Pepe's sliding block prevented Dortmund from getting a goal back. In the lone worry for Real Madrid, Ronaldo was substituted with what appeared to be a leg injury in the 80th minute. Paris Saint-Germain, running away with the French league title, won its 10th game in succession in all competitions. Chelsea, meanwhile, suffered another defeat after a surprise 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace last weekend. The Blues were displaced atop the Premier League by Liverpool. Ezequiel Lavezzi pounced after a poor defensive clearance from John Terry in the third minute -- it was the normally reliable Terry who netted an own goal against Palace. Chelsea, starting without a recognized striker, drew level when the referee ruled Thiago Silva brought down his fellow Brazilian Oscar. Eden Hazard converted for 1-1 from the spot in the 27th minute but David Luiz's own goal in the 61st gave Paris Saint-Germain the lead. With an away goal, that score probably wouldn't have been daunting for Chelsea ahead of the second leg. But Javier Pastore beat Petr Cech deep in injury time to alter the complexion of the tie. ""The third goal was ridiculous,"" Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""But we played against a great side full of great players, especially the attackers. ""It's a difficult job now but not impossible, nothing is impossible in football. But they have players who out of nothing can score goals, we are not a team full of talent who can score lots of goals."" PSG, however, saw talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic limp off in the second half. Before the game, police told CNN there was a fight between Chelsea and PSG supporters and that one was slightly injured. No one was arrested, police added. In Tuesday's games, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid drew 1-1 while defending champion Bayern Munich was held to a 1-1 draw at Manchester United.","Real Madrid beats Borussia Dortmund 3-0 in the Champions League quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- They're a family of two fathers and one daughter. Until recently, they had lived a quiet life in an upper-class neighborhood in the Mexican city of Monterrey. But they're now at the center of a national gay rights debate in Mexico. Their 2-year-old daughter, the couple says, was expelled from a private school in Monterrey for having two fathers. Alex and Pepe were married in Mexico City, where same-sex marriage is legally sanctioned. They asked CNN not to make their last names public to protect their daughter's identity. Alex, a 28-year-old who works in marketing and sales, is the girl's biological father. Pepe is a 39-year-old broker with a degree from the University of Miami. The couple says an administrator at The Hills Institute, which also has a daycare facility, told them they would have to hide the fact that they're a same-sex couple if they wanted the girl to stay at their school. ""They were asking me to give up all of my rights as parent at the school,"" Alex told Telediario Monterrey, a local independent TV station. ""I would've had to not participate in school or social activities. I was to not communicate with anybody nor attend together, as a family, Mother's Day or Father's Day celebrations as long as she was attending the school."" The couple found the conditions unacceptable and the school called the parents to the school a few days later only to give them the news that girl had been officially expelled. ""They saw us through the door's window and locked the door,"" Pepe told Telediario. ""The receptionist went to the back of the office. After waiting for 10 minutes, they sent an employee escorted by a security guard to tell us that the girl had been officially expelled. CNN's calls and e-mail to officials at The Hills Institute so far have gone unanswered. On its website, The Hills Institute says their vision is to become ""the best bicultural school in Mexico's educational system."" According to Alex and Pepe, the couple attended the school's open house in mid-August. They say they made it clear to school personnel that they were a legally married couple and had legal custody of the child. No issues were raised by the school, the parents said. The girl was expelled September 13. Last week, Alex and Pepe made the decision to file complaints with two agencies in Mexico. The couple filed a complaint with the Nuevo Leon state department of public education claiming that regardless of their family's composition, or whether the school is private or not, it is illegal to deny a child an education in Mexico, based on the Mexican Constitution's anti-discrimination protections. They also filed a complaint with the Mexican agency that protects consumers saying the school has yet to refund their money. Alex says a check the school sent bounced. In a letter to the Nuevo Leon state secretary of education, a spokesman for the LGBT community in Monterrey denounced the girl's dismissal from the school. Mario Alberto Rodriguez wrote that he believes the incident ""violates several legal statutes ... in detriment of the rights of the minor."" Article 1 of the Mexican Constitution states that ""discrimination on the basis of ethnic or national origin, gender, age, disability status, social status, health, religion, political persuasion, sexual orientation, civil status or any other that infringes against human dignity or diminishes rights or liberties of the people is hereby prohibited."" The Nuevo Leon state constitution mirrors that prohibition. Alex and Pepe say they decided to go public because they feel it's the only way authorities will do something about their case. ""Our daughter has been discriminated against in the most vicious way,"" Pepe told CNN. As for the little girl, her parents say they're looking for an alternative school while trying to explain to her why she can't see her friends anymore. Journalist Daniela Mendoza contributed to this report.","Alex and Pepe file complaints after their daughter is expelled from a Mexican day school .

"(CNN) -- The FBI questioned passengers from a Delta Airlines flight from Detroit to Denver on Friday after a potential security threat. ""The majority of the Delta Flight 1500 passengers have been allowed to claim their luggage and continue with their travel plans,"" FBI spokesman Dave S. Joly said. The screening that included police officers with the K9 unit delayed their arrival at the terminal by about four hours. ""Why did it take so long? What was the real holdup here? What were they really looking for?"" asked Jace Booher, according to CNN affiliate KDVR. A law enforcement official told CNN that a bomb threat found written on a note prompted the security screening after the plane landed at Denver International Airport. The 737 aircraft, which was carrying 151 passengers and six crew members, landed safely at 4:40 p.m. MT as scheduled, said Russell Cason, a spokesman for Delta.

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Google has not altered its search engine in Argentina despite a court order to do so because the company has not yet received an official order from the court, a spokeswoman said Thursday. Until Google is served with the injunction, the company will not remove any search results from its search engine or comment on the matter, Victoria Campetella told CNN. An Argentine court this week granted an injunction that blocks the Internet giant from ""suggesting"" searches that lead to certain sites that have been deemed anti-Semitic, and removes the sites from the search engine's index. The injunction, filed by DAIA, an umbrella organization of Argentina's Jewish community, also prohibits Google from advertising on the stated websites. The injunction names 76 sites that the organization considers ""highly discriminatory."" Google's suggested searches are a Google algorithm that offers search terms similar to the one the user appears to be typing in. ""The common denominator on these sites is the incitement of hate and the call to violence,"" DAIA said in a statement. ""In none of these cases are there discussions or criticisms from the academic, technological, political or philosophical perspectives."" ""It's a slippery slope. I don't think that the people of Argentina are harmed by the inability to see anti-Semitic content, but I think that the best answer is counter-speech,"" said Ryan Calo, a researcher at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. He noted that Google, faced with anti-Semitic search results in the United States, responded by posting an ad with a link to a statement that includes a link to information from the Anti-Defamation League. ""If you recently used Google to search for the word 'Jew,' you may have seen results that were very disturbing. We assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by Google,"" Google's policy statement says. It goes on to note that citizens and organizations have urged the company to remove links or adjust search results. ""Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, Google views the comprehensiveness of our search results as an extremely important priority,"" the statement says. ""Accordingly, we do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it."" Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America. The Jewish community there numbers more than 250,000, with the majority residing in the capital, Buenos Aires. The court ruling on the injunction notes that restrictions on freedom of speech and censorship are illegal under the Argentine constitution, but also notes that the constitution protects people from discrimination. As such, the judge cited previous cases in Argentina that establish that in some restricted cases, it is permissible to prevent the diffusion of certain publications if they infringe on someone's personal rights. Judge Carlos Molina Portela concluded that ""the terms mentioned (in the lawsuit) as well as the results obtained through 'suggested searches' could be described as discriminatory acts and/or at least, incitement and/or encouragement for discrimination."" According to DAIA, the suggested search complaint focused on 13 terms that led to websites that are anti-Semitic, some of which deny that the Holocaust took place. The group did not disclose the 13 terms in question, nor the names of the websites that were blocked. In a statement, the group said that by suggesting these websites, Google is ""inducing and directing traffic to sites with offensive and illegal content."" In Argentina, there have been previous cases in which individuals have sued to have certain websites removed from Google's index, citing invasion of privacy, said Robert Faris, research director for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. The court actions in Argentina appear to view Google more as a publisher of information than as an intermediary, he said. ""It seems to reflect a misunderstanding of how the Internet works and how search engines work,"" he said. Cynthia Wong, director of the Global Internet Freedom Project at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, said the Argentine court's move was part of a ""problematic trend"" on the part of many governments. ""At the end of the day, enlisting companies to become greater gatekeepers on content online really does shrink the range of speech that we can access. ... It's dangerous to try to shut down speech, because you don't get that kind of robust public debate about what should or should not be acceptable in a democratic society,"" she said. While restrictions on the Internet are usually associated with countries such as China or Iran, it is not uncommon for other nations to try to impose some limits on it. Thailand, for example, asked Google to remove YouTube videos that showed the Thai king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, with feet near his head. In Thai culture, it's considered extremely offensive for anyone's feet to be near someone's head.  A national law bans such representations, and Google agreed not to show such videos within Thailand, although they are still available elsewhere in the world. Germany bans neo-Nazi content, and Google has agreed to remove such sites from its Google.de search engine in that country. Turkey, meanwhile, blocks YouTube because the company refused to take down all potentially offensive videos about Ataturk, the Turkish political hero. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Google has not yet received official notice of the injunction .

"(CNN) -- A fire-breathing dragon, self-stirring cauldrons and dancing skeletons. These are the things Muggle dreams are made of. But they won't be dreams much longer. This summer, Universal Orlando will open the doors, or rather the secret entrance, to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter -- Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida. Once inside the elaborately themed area, which has been in the works since the summer of 2010, guests will feel like they've stepped onto the London film set, complete with the popular wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron, several iconic shops and a marquee roller coaster-type attraction based on Gringotts, the goblin-run bank from the series. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter -- Hogsmeade, which opened in June 2010 at Universal's Islands of Adventure, was one of the most talked about new attractions of the past decade within the industry and has been wildly popular ever since. By August 2010, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, the star attraction at Hogsmeade, hit a million riders. Parent company NBC Universal reported a theme park revenue increase of more than 30% in 2010, thanks in large part to the Wizarding World's opening that year. In 2011, theme park revenue jumped again by nearly 25%, followed by a modest gain in 2012 of about 5%. ""Park operators from around the world were impressed by the immersive experience Universal created and the meticulous attention to detail they used to bring the Harry Potter stories to life,"" says David Mandt, vice president of communications for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. ""There is great anticipation within the industry to see how Diagon Alley will build on that success."" CNN got a tour of the 20-acre construction site, which roughly doubles the size of the Harry Potter experience, where thousands of designers, engineers and craftspeople are hard at work preparing for opening day. Here are some things to know: . It's hidden: The outside of this attraction is a hodgepodge of building facades built to scale, including the Wyndham Theater, Leicester Square's tube station and Grimmauld Place, which mask the entrance to Diagon Alley. Here, guests will be able to meander along the London waterfront, sit under the shade of trees and gaze at a replica of London's Eros fountain. Guests will enter under the arches of the Leicester Square facade. However, Universal has not said how exactly. In the series, Harry enters Diagon through a magical wall of bricks. Once inside, guests will be immediately immersed in a bustling wizarding hub within a Muggle city where towering buildings are slightly askew, with steep staircases and jagged edges galore. There will be goblins: The star of it all is Gringotts, which in the series is a massive, goblin-run bank that Harry visits to get money for his school supplies. In the real-life version, visitors will be in awe of the marble lobby and cavernous passageways. They'll take off from here on a multi-sensory thrill ride through the vaults. And the dragon that will perch atop the bank building (reminiscent of when it escapes from the bank in the series) really does blow a giant ball of fire quite frequently, says Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative. Your ticket to Universal Studios gives you access to Diagon Alley: Admission into Universal Studios Florida ($92 for adults and $86 for kids ages 3 to 9), allows you to roam around the park and visit Diagon Alley. However, if you'd like to pop over to Hogsmeade via the Hogwarts Express, you must purchase park-to-park admission ($128 for adults, $122 for kids ages 3 to 9). The train, where Harry meets pals Hermione and Ron in the first movie, will shuttle people over to Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure. Along the way, rather than seeing backstage areas between the parks, guests will see views of London and the British countryside thanks to some high-tech features. It goes beyond the books/films: J.K. Rowling provided Universal with names that didn't exist in the book. For instance, in Diagon Alley, visitors will find Horizont Alley and Carkitt next to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and the train trellis. Although the world-famous author has not toured the site yet, ""She has been involved as usual in the development process and has been a great supporter throughout the process as she was in the original in 2010,"" says Woodbury. ""Just a delight to work with and a wonderful author. And someone we are eternally grateful to for creating a body of fiction that is so rich that gives us an opportunity to develop what we've been able to do."" There will be new merchandise and foods: All the bits and bobs that any good wizard needs will, of course, be available. Shops will include Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions for Hogwarts scarves and character costumes; the three-story Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes shop for magical jokes and toys; the Magical Menagerie for owl and Hippogriff stuffed animals; Quality Quidditch Supplies for brooms and quaffles and more. Wand shop Ollivanders will be there, too. (Note: The Ollivanders location found within Diagon Alley is the original location, as referenced in the Harry Potter books and films. This shop will be larger than the current one found within Hogsmeade at Islands of Adventure.) The Leaky Cauldron, a popular wizarding pub and inn from the series, will be a ""colossal space"" serving Butterbeer and traditional English pub fare. Nearby, Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour will serve weird flavors like strawberry with peanut butter. It will blow Hogsmeade away: ""We think the experience is exponential,"" says Woodbury. ""It's not just one and one is two. In this case, it's one and one is six."" Actor Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom in the films, concurs: ""It's ridiculous,"" Lewis said after touring the site yesterday. ""The scale of it, it's just enormous.""","New Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction set to open this summer in Orlando .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Princess Diana's relationships with two Muslim men provoked an outburst from her mother, who called her daughter ""a whore"", Paul Burrell, the princess's former butler, told an inquest Monday. Diana once referred to her former butler Paul Burrell as ""my rock."" Burrell, who returned to Britain from his home in Florida to give evidence, was the first star witness of the London inquest, now in its fourth month. His role as confidant to Diana, who died in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997, along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and hotel security chief Henri Paul, meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated. Burrell, whom the late princess once called ""my rock,"" cast doubt on whether Diana was ready to marry Fayed. According to Burrell, the princess was still ""holding a candle"" for former boyfriend and heart surgeon Hasnat Khan -- who she called ""her soulmate"" -- when she started dating Fayed ""on the rebound."" Burrell told the inquest that Diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in June 1997 with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with Muslim men.  ""She called the princess a 'whore' and she said that she was messing around with 'effing Muslim men' and she was 'disgraceful' and said some very nasty things,"" Burrell said. He agreed that, as a result of such calls Diana, decided not to talk to her mother again. The inquest, which began in October and is expected to last another two or three months, aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the Princess and Dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise. Asked earlier in the day if he believed that Fayed was ""the one,"" Burrell said ""no, I did not have that impression."" He also cast doubt on claims that Fayed and Diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement, saying: ""I find that difficult to believe."" Asked to explain himself, Burrell said: ""Because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone (Khan) she cared deeply about. I knew that because I was there and I saw it."" Diana's 18-month relationship with Khan ended around the same time she started seeing Fayed in July 1997. Burrell said Diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with Khan might take place, given that Khan is Muslim.  Watch report on claims about Diana's marriage plans. » . Khan had not proposed to the princess, Burrell said, adding that Khan was ""the man she loved more than any other."" He said he spoke to Diana about the possibility that Fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death. Burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand, rather than the left, as is customary with engagement rings. ""I need marriage like a bad rash,"" Burrell claimed Diana told him. Last month at the inquest Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a friend of Diana, said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage ""like a rash on my face."" Burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring, as the Fayed family has maintained. Fayed family spokesman Michael Cole testified last week that Dodi's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, was certain the couple had planned to marry. Lawyers at the inquest asked Burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the Monday following the fatal car crash. There has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news, such as an engagement. But Burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan. He said he had actually looked at Diana's schedule for that day and found only mundane items, and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement. Burrell also told the inquest he did not believe Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's, husband was involved in Diana's death. Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi and the owner of Harrods department store, has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen's husband, Prince Philip -- ordered the pair be murdered. He also claims that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death. But Burrell said that he knew Prince Philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths. ""I can tell you that is not Prince Philip's nature, "" he said. ""Plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren. Why would he want to harm her? It's not possible."" The inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which Prince Philip sent to Diana, with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters. But other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed, ""Pa."" Burrell explained that Philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks. ""Prince Philip doesn't mix his words,"" Burrell said. ""He says it as it is, but he is not a nasty man. Prince Philip isn't known for his diplomacy. He was fond of the princess."" Burrell worked for the British royals for 21 years and became close to Diana after her separation from Prince Charles. He has written two books about his time with the princess. In his second book, Burrell told of a letter from Diana which indicated she feared for her life. The princess wrote that Prince Charles planned ""'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury."" One of Diana's close friends, however, testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged. Lucia Flecha de Lima said on December 18 that Burrell was capable of imitating the princess's handwriting. Lawyers questioned Burrell about the date of the letter. Burrell said it was written in October 1996, two months, after Diana and Charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to Charles as ""my husband."" Burrell responded that Diana always referred to Charles that way, even after the divorce. The inquest has revealed that Diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence. Witnesses, including Burrell, recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk, with the more important ones stored in a special box. Burrell testified that after Diana's death, her mother, Frances Shand-Kidd, worked every day for a week shredding the papers from Diana's desk. He said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on December 19, 1997. It was at this meeting that Queen Elizabeth told Burrell: ""There are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge."" That comment, which has been widely reported, was meant to warn him to be careful, Burrell said, and was not a warning about any one person or group of people. At the same meeting Burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of Diana's belongings to keep safe. The details of the conversation emerged when Burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002, causing the case against him to collapse. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman's parents are suing Roseanne Barr for tweeting their home address, which they say forced them to go into hiding for years. Robert and Gladys Zimmerman have filed a lawsuit against Barr, accusing the comedian and actress of posting ""an open and obvious call for vigilante justice,"" which she intended ""to cause a lynch mob to descend"" on their Lake Mary, Florida, home. ""It was foreseeable that the tweets would cause Robert and Gladys Zimmerman to have to flee their house in the middle of the night and never to be able to return, have to face a descent of media and others who would seek to do harm to Robert and Gladys Zimmerman and to their home, and have to live in seclusion to protect their personal and emotional well being,"" the civil complaint said. The Zimmermans accuse Barr of ""intentional infliction of emotional distress"" and ""invasion of privacy"" with the message to her 110,000 Twitter followers on March 29, 2012. The lawsuit does not indicate exactly how much the couple is asking for in damages. The tweet was published a month after their son killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a Florida subdivision, when national attention was focused on the incident and amid calls for Zimmerman's arrest. A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting of the unarmed teenager in a highly-publicized 2013 trial. The tweet listed his parents' names, telephone number and home address, even though they were ""in no way involved in any of the incidents occurring on February 26, 2012,"" the lawsuit said. The complaint said Barr later tweeted: ""At first I thought it was good to let ppl know that no one can hide anymore ... If Zimmerman isn't arrested I'll rt his address again- maybe go 2 his house myself."" Barr violated Twitter's rules banning tweets with unauthorized personal information, the lawsuit said. ""Roseanne Barr acted extremely and outrageously in making the tweets which were intended to cause severe emotional distress to Robert and Gladys Zimmerman and possible great physical harm, if not death,"" the lawsuit contends. The Zimmermans ""suffered emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of the capacity for the enjoyment of life, incurred additional living expenses due to the inability to live in their home and have suffered a loss in value of their home,"" the complaint said. ""These losses are permanent and continuing in nature and Robert and Gladys Zimmerman will continue to suffer these losses in the future."" The suit demands a jury trial.

"(CNN) -- You've probably never heard of the race, but there's no doubt you'd appreciate the action. The athletic skill and white-knuckled bravery possessed by Green River Narrows whitewater kayak racers can only be described as impressive. Over the race's 15-year history, 412 professional and expert whitewater kayakers of the highest caliber have traveled from around the globe to participate in the event near Hendersonville, North Carolina. They race not for money or corporate sponsorship but for bragging rights. The race begins each year at noon on the first Saturday in November. Organizers estimate that between 140 and 150 racers will compete this Saturday. An estimated 1,000 like-minded river-loving enthusiasts will be on hand to watch. (CNN Photos: See images from the 2010 race) Organization of race logistics and details is homegrown; there are no emergency medical services available, and the entire affair is basically DIY. Close relationships between organizers and paddlers and the informal setup contribute to the race's revered reputation among paddlers. The first race, organized by local kayaker Leland Davis, was held in 1996, with only 16 kayakers participating. That number has grown immensely, with 136 racers competing in 2010. The most unique element of the Green River race is the great sense of brotherhood and friendship amongst racers, organizer John Grace said. ""Everyone who races the Green is friends for life, because of the shared experience,"" Grace said. ""The Green race mixes danger and extreme with just enough safety."" The perception of ""just enough safety"" undoubtedly depends on a paddler's risk threshold. The race's course drops roughly 250 feet over six-10ths of a mile. This is squarely Class V whitewater territory, defined by the International Scale of River Difficulty as ""Extremely Difficult"" or ""Expert."" Liability waivers must be signed, and a line from this year's Acknowledgment of Risk section of the registration website illustrates the dangers: . ""Racing the Narrows is exceedingly dangerous. Doing so entails known and unanticipated risks, which could result in physical or emotional injury, paralysis and death,"" the site reads. ""This is not theoretical: several boaters have died running the Narrows and another has been paralyzed from the upper body down for life. Accidents resulting in dislocated shoulders, deep lacerations and extensive dental work are common. Please do not take your decision to race lightly."" In October 2010, first-time participant Jiri Vala traveled from his home in Atlanta to the Green River Gorge, just east of Hendersonville, on weekends to test himself on the Green's unique rapids and river features ahead of the race. ""As a first-time racer, I just want to get through. I want to have a clean run, hopefully a fast one, and keep my heart from exploding,"" Vala said in anticipation of the race. (Watch the video to see how his run in last year's race turned out.) Vala will run the Green again this year. ""After last year, I'm totally hooked."" But he hasn't had much time to train for his second run. ""My training has consisted of sitting at my desk in kayaking position for 10 hours a day. Because, as we all know, sitting is the foundation of kayaking technique,"" Vala said. Beyond actual participation, just being on hand to watch the race is a test of physical stamina. Spectators' arrival on the steep and rocky banks that hang over the swift water is preceded by a two-mile hike, a seemingly vertical descent into the river gorge and a final trek upstream that is more of a climb than a straightforward walk. If you want to experience the race, you're going to work. Most race enthusiasts perch themselves on a slippery outcropping above an 18-foot waterfall, a raging inferno of water affectionately dubbed ""Gorilla."" The water above Gorilla flows with immense power through a narrow slot that racers call ""the notch."" The notch is roughly 6 feet wide and is notoriously the most dangerous spot on the river. It is through this obstacle that racers must pass and quickly set up to drop over Gorilla. This is where much of the race's carnage and therefore entertaining action occurs, so onlookers perch here, anxiously anticipating the racers' miscalculations and unfortunate binds. As racers pass through ""the notch,"" they often flip or find themselves out of control as they head for the lip of Gorilla. This can result in a backward tumble or worse: an upside-down fall over an 18-foot waterfall with a shallow shelf of rock just below. In addition to bragging rights, race winners come away with handmade glass trophies. But it's the daring required to participate that earns Green River Narrows Race competitors a badge of honor in boating circles.","Green River Narrows kayak racers brave Class V whitewater .

"(CNN) -- When one of the Titanic's four giant funnels collapsed, Dick Williams saw his father Charles killed in front of him. Grief stricken but with his survival instinct still intact, the 21-year-old dived into the icy waters of the Atlantic to take his chances and swim for his life. The cold was almost paralyzing and many poor souls perished almost immediately, but Williams was made of stern stuff and managed to pull himself into a collapsible lifeboat. With others desperately clamoring to get on board, it was almost waist deep in water and the cold proved almost unbearable for the occupants. Many died before they were helped, initially by another more stable lifeboat and then by the liner RMS Carpathia, a haven for so many Titanic survivors. A little distance away, Karl Behr sat shivering, huddled in one of the last lifeboats to leave the stricken super liner -- which had been heralded as ""unsinkable"" ahead of her maiden voyage from the British port of Southampton on April 10, 1912. Next to him was Helen Newsom, a fellow passenger on their first-class journey who was later to be his wife. In the same lifeboat was the Titanic's owner, Bruce Ismay, who had embarked on the journey with his reputation never higher, but was later to be vilified for allegedly deserting his ship. Amputation threat . It took nearly six long hours for the lifeboats and the 706 survivors to be reached, by which time Williams had lost all feeling in his legs, which had turned purple with frostbite and lack of circulation. The ship doctor on the Carpathia warned him that they were so far gone that amputation was the likely outcome. But Williams could not conceive this possibility and took about literally walking his legs back to life, relentlessly pacing the decks on the journey to New York -- two hours at a time, despite the intense discomfort. It was during this time that he met Behr for the first time. Little is recorded of their exchanges, but from memoirs it is reported that at 26, the elder man was ""very helpful"" to Williams. Aside from their shared survival of one of the greatest maritime tragedies in history, where over 1,500 passengers and crew perished, they had one other thing in common. Both were to become members in the International Tennis Hall of Fame, having been on-court rivals and later Davis Cup teammates for the United States. And both were to be central figures in two books which have been published around the 100th anniversary of the 1912 tragedy. Rival books . Like so much associated with the Titanic in the many books and films on the subject, controversy and disagreement over what actually happened is never far from the surface. First came ""Starboard at Midnight,"" written by Behr's granddaughter Helen Behr Sandford and published last year. Former U.S. Davis Cup team press officer Randy Walker commissioned Hollywood screenwriter Lindsay Gibbs to write a ""factional"" account for his New Chapter Press publishing firm -- ""Titanic: The Tennis Story,"" which came out this month. Sanford, who is published by Darwin Press, stuck more or less strictly to memoirs and historical records, although a small passage in her book is also fictional. Walker, who has published books on great players such as Rod Laver, believes the tale to be the ""greatest story in the history of tennis"" but allowed the 45-year-old Gibbs some leeway in developing characters and themes. He compares the treatment to that of the Oscar winning film ""Chariots of Fire"" about British track and field runners Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell where fact merged with fiction to dramatize the story. However, Sandford is aghast at the portrayal of her grandfather and Williams. The 62-year-old, who is known as Lynn, is deeply protective of the memory of her forebear. ""The 'other' book is truly appalling,"" she told CNN. ""Dick Williams and Karl Behr were wonderful, dignified men, who would never have exhibited the characteristics that are displayed. ""If Karl and Dick were here right now they would be incensed and absolutely miserable at how they took their lives and created something out of fiction."" Gibbs stands by her writings: ""I'm proud of what I did, which was based around a lot of research by Randy Walker."" ""Lindsay Gibbs is a very good writer,"" conceded Sanford. ""But the saddest part is she didn't honor the truth at all."" With both books competing for sales, there is no sign the row will settle down, but what is not disputed is how the lives of the two men became intertwined in the aftermath of the tragedy. Remarkable recovery . Williams made a remarkable recovery and less than three months later he faced the more experienced Behr in a tennis tournament on the lawns of Longwood Cricket Club in Boston. Williams raced into a two-set lead, but the wily Behr prevailed in five sets. Legend has it that their shared experience on the Titanic was never mentioned by the two fellow Ivy Leaguers. Williams was on the rise and won the 1914 U.S. National Championship (now known as the U.S. Open), beating Behr in the quarterfinals. Both were in the 1914 U.S. Davis Cup team, with Behr as a reserve. Further success followed for Williams in the 1916 U.S. Nationals before serving in the United States army in World War One, being decorated for valor. Resuming his career after the hostilities, Williams enjoyed major success in doubles competition in the Davis Cup and grand slams. His crowning glory came aged 33 at the 1924 Paris Olympics, where he partnered Hazel Wightman to the gold medal in the mixed doubles -- the last time the event was part of the Games. The pair remain the reigning Olympic champions as mixed doubles will be reintroduced at London 2012, with the likes of Roger Federer and Victoria Azarenka coveting the gold. Williams became a successful banker in Philadelphia and died aged 77 in 1968. Behr's story was more complex and the events of April 14, 1912 left an indelible mark on his psyche as he suffered from ""survivor's guilt."" As both his granddaughter and Gibbs touch on in their accounts, the circumstances under which he ended in a lifeboat with women and children has come under scrutiny, particularly as the reviled Ismay was also an occupant. Honor at stake . Sanford said that her grandfather was in the ""right place at the right time"" as the first-class passengers were shown to the lifeboats, at first more as precaution because it was widely believed that the Titanic was ""unsinkable."" Walker concurs. ""According to our research, Karl was very honorable,"" he said. As boat No. 5 was lowered, Ismay was imploring passengers into the craft and was asked by a lady passenger ""if the men could join us."" He replied in the affirmative and Behr climbed aboard. In Gibbs' book, a smitten Behr proposes to Newsom while in the lifeboat -- poetic license, indeed. Sanford recounts that they actually waited eight months to announce their engagement. ""They feared a backlash from being Titanic survivors,"" she said. Behr's sense of duty intensified as World War One started in Europe and he became a leading campaigner for American involvement working alongside former president Theodore Roosevelt. As Sanford recounts, Behr organized the Citizen Preparedness Parade in New York in 1916, with over 135,000 people taking part, which galvanized similar pro-war parades across the country. When American finally entered the war in 1917, Behr was refused permission to enlist, perhaps because of his German background. Exhausted and demoralized, his health collapsed and he entered a sanitarium, but he was allowed to serve just as the war ended. By then his tennis career was over and he spent the rest of his life in business, being on the board of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and other firms. He died in 1949, aged 64. His wife Helen later remarried and died in Princeton, New Jersey in 1965. As a small child, Sanford recalled asking her grandmother about the events of the fateful night. ""She just said, 'I can't answer you, but I can say the worst part of the experience was on the Carpathia.' "" It was never mentioned again, but Sanford became determined to recount the events and spent many years researching before putting pen to paper. She recently joined members of the Williams family at a special event organized by the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Its headquarters in Newport, Rhode Island has a special exhibition to honor both remarkable men and their remarkable story.","Two star tennis players were survivors of the Titanic disaster 100 years ago .

"(CNN) -- In many ways -- more than just distance, at least -- it is a long way from the remote city of Kashgar in the restive northwest Chinese province of Xinjiang to Kuala Lumpur, the bustling, teeming capital of Malaysia. But it was a journey that an Uyghur artist named Memetjan Abdullah made earlier this month. It was his first trip outside China. Father to a young daughter, Abdullah -- whose name is sometimes spelled Maimaitijiang Abula -- was part of a delegation of some 24 artists who were returning to China from the ""Chinese Dream: Red and Green Painting"" art exhibition, held March 4 to 6 in the Malaysian city. The exhibition also acted as a cultural exchange conference, while celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Malaysia. Abdullah, who won an award for his work during the exchange, and his colleagues were on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 when it disappeared somewhere over the Malacca Strait early in the morning of March 8. A talented, popular painter, who uses oils as his medium, Abdullah teaches painting at a Kashgar middle school, a position that perhaps belies his talents. A painting of his, entitled ""Outlook"" is part of National Art Museum of China collection, a testament to the 35-year old's skill. A colleague from his school, Mehmet Emin Kahar, said ""Memetjan has (a) good personality. He cares for students, his ideas are progressive and he's dedicated to his job."" A hard worker . Prior to taking the position in Kashgar, Abdullah studied in Beijing for a year at the Chinese Academy of Oil Painting. Lin Jianshou, who befriended the young Uyghur painter in 1999 on a trip to Kashgar, suggested he attend a one-year program at the academy. ""He tried really hard. He had to live on instant noodles every day because there was no Muslim food. But still he worked really hard and kept on painting. So from what I know of him, he's very hardworking and has great pursuits in art."" Lin recalls the moment that he realized that his friend and student was on the flight. ""I stopped what I was doing. And all of a sudden I felt so weak. Because he was my good friend and he was always supporting me. Of course, my legs went weak and I had no strength. I thought, how was it that I was able to meet with him."" Some extremists from a sizable Muslim population in Xinjiang have fostered unrest in the province and beyond, which boiled over at the beginning of March with a massacre at a Kunming train station. Li recalls that, following MH370's disappearance, he was asked to clarify his friend's ""situation"" with the police. When news of the flight's disappearance broke over two weeks ago, Chinese media initially blurred Abdullah's name from the passenger manifest, fearing that a Uyghur separatist attack was to blame for the flight's disappearance. The Chinese government has since ruled that none of its citizens that were aboard MH370 have any link to terrorism. Lin adamantly believes his friend has no link to terrorist activities, and could not have been involved in the disappearance of MH370. ""No, absolutely not a possibility. I know him well, and there's no way ... He is someone who perseveres in art. He would not use lives to do this to art. No way ... it's not 'probably he did not do it.' It's 'absolutely no way he could have done it.'"" Kurbanjan Semet, 32, a cameraman with CCTV's documentary channel met the painter at a local gallery in Kashgar in 2005 while he was filming ethnic group cultural elements, and was drawn to his passion. ""I found his paintings interesting,"" says Kurbanjan, ""He's the kind of person that lives for his art. Painting is his life. His biggest wish is to express his feelings with painting, especially his feelings for his hometown. ""He's been a really modest person when he was with me and my other friends. He always seeks advice for his painting from others, like advice on the use of color and other things."" The Xinjiang passenger . It was on March 2 that Abdullah flew to Malaysia. Kurbanjan spoke briefly with his friend the day before, but news of the Kunming knife attack soured his mood and prevented him from accompanying him to the airport. He heard again from his friend a couple of days later, with the news that he'd been interviewed by local media, and again the following day when he posted on WeChat that he'd won the award. ""I sent a message to him: 'Congratulations brother. We should celebrate when you come back.'"" Kurbanjan learned the news right after it came out on March 8. ""It was when the news came out the Xinjiang passenger was with the 24 people artist group that I immediately realized it was him. ""Then I just... I just couldn't believe it happened to him. I still believe, until today, that he's coming back, and I will film his stories."" He called Abdullah's wife on the second day of the plane's disappearance. ""They arrived on the third day because the weather conditions didn't allow them to fly to Beijing on day two. I picked them up from the airport when his family arrived. His wife was (emotional) when she saw me."" In the past few days, Kurbanjan has been telling Abdullah's story to media. ""At this very moment, many people need to know about what kind of man he is. That's what I've been working on."" ""His daughter is too young to understand what happened. She believes her father went to Malaysia and is on his way back, but she doesn't know when he'll return.""

"(CNN) -- Coverage for 30 million uninsured. A ban on lifetime payout limits. No co-pays or deductibles on preventive medical services. Insurers prohibited from excluding patients based on pre-existing medical conditions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as ""Obamacare"") creates a massive, wide-scale overhaul of the heavily flawed and criticized health care system of the United States. But for all of the Obama administration's work in creating this 906-page federal law, there is one glaring omission that could decrease the costs of health care and help relieve the upcoming physician shortage. Medical liability reform. How could the Obama administration create such a comprehensive overhaul of health care without addressing this issue? Although not a panacea for the health problems in the United States, the need for physicians to practice defensive medicine in order to avoid potential litigation has far-reaching consequences. A 2008 survey of Massachusetts doctors found that 83% admitted to practicing defensive medicine. This study determined that 18% to 28% of tests, procedures and referrals and 13% of hospital admissions were performed for the sake of avoiding lawsuits. In this one state alone, an estimated $281 million in unnecessary physician costs and more than $1 billion in excessive hospital costs was due to the practice of defensive medicine. Across the country, doctors are ordering tests and consultations as a way to protect themselves from potential liability. In our litigation-obsessed culture, the costs for doctors to purchase liability insurance can be astronomical. According to the Medical Liability Monitor, in 2011, general surgeons in Florida's Miami-Dade County paid $190,000 per year for malpractice insurance. General internists in Detroit paid approximately $35,000 per year for coverage. It's a well-known fact that family medicine physicians and even obstetrician-gynecologists are giving up the practice of obstetrics because of the excessive cost of malpractice insurance and the fear of potential lawsuits. Malpractice fees break OB-GYNs . Even if physicians purchase malpractice insurance, it's no guarantee that, should they get sued, they will not lose virtually everything they have. The maximum coverage most malpractice insurance carriers will offer a physician is $1 million per lawsuit. That means any verdict greater than this limit comes out of the doctor's pocket. In today's climate of multimillion-dollar verdicts, one lawsuit could be financially devastating. A physician can work 30 years, healing and saving the lives of thousands of patients, yet one mistake at the end of his or her career could literally cost them everything. Is that right? Under this type of hostile litigious climate, why wouldn't physicians order that extra test, keep their patients in the hospital that extra night or refer for a second opinion? As a board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon, I'm aware of this every day. A recent study found that plastic surgeons have a 99% chance of getting sued by the time they reach age 65. Does the fear of missing a diagnosis and getting sued cause me to order more tests and referrals for my patients? Definitely. Opinion: Doctors and patients should talk more, test less . So why hasn't the Obama administration included medical liability reform in the Affordable Care Act? I suspect that it comes down to dollars. Not health care dollars or insurance dollars but campaign donation dollars. According to OpenSecrets.org, since 1990, the American Association for Justice, previously known as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, has given 92% of its $36.8 million in contributions to Democrats. The association is also a large contributor to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign. It is opposed to malpractice tort reform, for obvious reasons, and I suspect that it may have played a significant role in the absence of malpractice liability reform in the Affordable Care Act. In a 2009 speech to Congress, Obama stated that he ""talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs."" With the cost of health care continuing to rise, it's a shame his Affordable Care Act doesn't include a provision addressing this. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Youn.","""Obamacare"" does not address medical liability reform .

Malpractice insurance costs can be astronomical for some .

"(CNN) -- In the cold rain outside a girl's school in Kabul, a queue stretches several hundred meters down the road. Some are dressed in western clothes, others in traditional shalwar kameez. One man is wearing overalls covered in paint from the work site he's just come from. They've been waiting for over an hour but they don't mind -- they're here to make history and change the course of their country. A 5-year-old boy stands next to his father, holding his hand, unaware of what all the fuss is about. In his other hand he holds his father's voting card -- an Afghan's ticket to democracy. ""We work for him,"" says an old man pointing at the child. ""This is why we're all here to vote -- to build a better future for all our children."" Arriving at the gates of the school, smiling from ear to ear, MP Shukria Barakzai goes through the women's entrance. ""I feel fantastic, proud happy, successful,"" she says. ""I feel really good because I believe today is my day because the people of Afghanistan can go and vote freely. ""The crowds are fantastic and that's a big slap in the face for the Taliban and terrorists who kill our children. They stop people coming from election and they don't believe in democracy. See? All (these) wonderful people are coming to practice democracy."" The citizens of Afghanistan would be forgiven for not wanting to come and stand in these long lines outside almost 6,500 polling stations around the country. The Taliban launched a series of high-profile attacks in the lead up to the historic elections, warning that anyone who participated in the vote would be punished. But despite the threats and the violence the voters are defying the insurgents, rejecting their message of fear. ""We are not afraid of the threats,"" explains Barakzai. ""As much as they kill us, we get ... stronger, as much as they killed our children, our journalists, innocent women, we say 'no.' We will go and vote because we are fed up. We want to see real change, we want to enjoy our democracy."" Her 17-year-old daughter Fatmia, proudly listens to her mother. She's heard these words before but today is different -- today change is really happening. ""I hope Ashraf Ghani wins,"" she tells me with excitement even though she can't vote for another year. ""I hope he wins because I think he's the best of the candidates and he's got ideas, bright ideas that will help our country."" When I ask Fatmia what sort of future she would like to see for Afghanistan, she tells me, ""Honestly a bright future, a future that is good for us, good for all the people, for girls, good for women -- you know, a bright future!"" Inside the school, past the layers of security, men and women troop off into different buildings where they line up again, this time in classrooms that have been transformed into polling booths. Each one shows their voter card to the Independent Election Commission official and has their name marked off the list. Their forefinger is then dipped into indelible ink -- proof that they've voted -- and they pick up their ballot papers. ""It is very important for the future of Afghanistan,"" says a father of three, after placing his papers into clear, locked plastic containers. ""I'm very happy everyone is participating in the election. We are deciding the future and we want someone to protect our people and stop the war."" It was hoped President Karzai would achieve peace during his 12 years in office but as he departs after a constitutionally-restricted two terms at the helm, he leaves behind a war-torn country, mired by corruption and whose relationship with the United States is at an all-time low. Karzai has refused to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) that would ensure an enduring presence of U.S. troops post 2014, creating a schism with the U.S. government. The three top candidates -- Ashraf Ghani, Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmai Rassoul -- have all said they would sign the BSA. While voter fraud was a big problem back in 2009, when Karzai was accused of stealing the election, this year 300,000 observers are taking part to ensure the vote is free and fair. ""So far it's really good, we haven't noticed any voter fraud,"" says Mohammad Hanif of the Free and fair Election Forum of Afghanistan. ""It is very important to observe,"" he says. ""It's my duty for my country and as an Afghan citizen I want these elections to be a success."" So does 24-year-old Trina Haidarzada, a mother of two, who has only known a life of war. ""I'm here to elect a good president so the bombings and (the) war ends. I want a bright future and I want my kids to go to school without fear -- that's what I hope for.""","Afghans queue patiently to cast ballots in historic election .

"(EW.com ) -- As J.J. Abrams and company get underway shooting ""Star Wars: Episode VII,"" they're still adding pieces to the cast. One of those pieces could be you. In a very unusual move for the highly secretive film, a walk-on role for a member of the general public has been created and will be raffled off to benefit the charity UNICEF. The filmmaker explains himself in a video from Abu Dhabi â€” which also offers a glimpse of one of the practical (that is, no digital effects here) alien creatures from that far off galaxy. ""We want to put you in the movie, in Star Wars,"" Abrams explains. ""You get to come to London, where we're shooting the movie mostly at Pinewood Studios ... You'll get to meet the cast, go behind the scenes, and see the whole moviemaking process. But more than that, we'll put you in hair, makeup and wardrobe, and you'll actually get to be in the movie."" To enter, Abrams says to visit Omaze.com's page dedicated to the Star Wars: Force For Change initiative. The auction will raise money to support UNICEF's Innovation Labs, which aims to create technological fixes for children in remote or troubled reasons. (Some of their work involves creating portable, solar-powered education kits in places like China, Uganda, and Burundi, mobile phone programs in the Philippines aimed at reuniting children with their families after an emergency, or delivering infant medical information from clinics in Zambia.) The walk-on roll won't be a budget-buster, available for auction only to the highest bidder. You could land the part for as little as ten bucks. For each $10 contribution, donors will be automatically entered â€” and the contest runs from now until midnight on July 18th. There are other prizes, too.

"(CNN) -- A building under construction in downtown Boston partially collapsed Thursday morning, sending two people to the hospital, the city's fire department said. The incident happened about 8 a.m. at a construction site at 45 Stuart St., the Boston Fire Department tweeted. The collapse occurred on the 12th floor of what's slated to be a 33-story residential high-rise, causing damage from the 11th floor's roof down to the fifth floor. First responders treated two people with injuries that were not life-threatening and then took them to nearby Tufts Medical Center. The fire department later explained that one of those had ""a serious head injury,"" while the other had a minor injury. ""No others workers reported trapped at this time,"" the fire department tweeted.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 13 people were killed and 28 others were wounded in a suicide bombing Monday at a market near the Pakistani Army's headquarters, police said. Those killed in the attack at the Royal Artillery Bazaar include civilians, security personnel and at least one child, Rawalpindi police official Muhammad Maqbool told CNN. The Royal Artillery Bazaar is in a highly sensitive military area close to the general headquarters of the Pakistani Army in Rawalpindi, a city that neighbors the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. Police said that attack took place at 7:50 a.m., during a busy period for people traveling to offices and schools. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack through their spokesman Shahidullah Shahid. It comes the day after an explosion at an army checkpoint in the northern city of Bannu killed more than 20 people and wounded dozens more. That blast was also claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, who said it was to avenge the killing of one of their commanders in a U.S. drone strike last year. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the Bannu attack and said he was canceling a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum takes place this week. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Zahir Shah reported from Peshawar.","NEW: The death toll rises to 13, including one child, police say .

"(WIRED) -- The BlackBerry PlayBook tablet is a good-looking piece of hardware. Like the proto-humans in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you'll be eager to touch the monolithic object's black, buttonless visage. But once you do, things get a little more complicated. The PlayBook's design exudes the same sense of finely honed ""business chic"" that Research in Motion has perfected in its BlackBerry smartphones. But the PlayBook's software suffers from several missteps and oversights, especially in the drought of useful apps -- the very things that have made tablets such a hit -- and the lackluster performance of Adobe's Flash player. At a svelte 7.6 inches by 5.1 inches, the PlayBook is about the size of Samsung's Galaxy Tab, and considerably smaller than the Motorola Xoom and Apple iPad 2. That may prove bothersome if you prefer watching videos and gaming on a larger screen. But in a trade-off for the small screen size, the PlayBook makes gains in portability. At just under a pound, long reading sessions don't cause as much fatigue as they do with larger tablets, and the rubberized backing adds a pleasing tooth to the grip. You won't be worried about dropping it on the floor of the bus. RIM is banking that those who bemoan the loss of screen real estate will use the tablet as a media hub for larger devices. You can drag and drop media files from your desktop to the PlayBook the same way you'd move files to a USB flash drive. You can also transfer files wirelessly over your local network. Once the PlayBook is loaded up with movies, use the HDMI-out to connect the tablet to a television and watch everything in full 1080p on a 16:9 wide screen. On both the big screen as well as the PlayBook, videos look damn good. And they sound good, too. The PlayBook's two speakers flank the screen's face horizontally, projecting sound outward toward your ears. The quality is surprisingly clear for the size of the speakers. There's no tinniness or distortion, even with the volume cranked. There are no buttons on the face, but there are four along the top edge: a Play/Pause button, a two-way volume rocker and a Power button. They're unobtrusive, though sometimes to a fault. It takes a noticeable amount of effort to push in the Power button, which is frustrating if you want to turn the screen on or off quickly. In the absence of a Home button, there's a new UI convention to learn: You touch the frame along the bottom of the screen and swipe up when you want to return to the home screen. Touch sensitivity is very responsive, and the swipe controls work great. Taking a note from Palm's webOS, RIM brings multitasking to its QNX-based BlackBerry Tablet OS, letting you switch back and forth between simultaneously running apps. By swiping a finger to the side of the screen, you can jump from the YouTube video you were watching back to a paused game of Tetris, without having to return to the home screen. Also cool: the ability to multitask with apps running on a peripheral display. When the PlayBook is hooked up to an HDTV, you can watch video at 1080p on the big screen while browsing the web on the PlayBook. Or, you can show a presentation on a projector while swiping through your speaking notes on the tablet. Be forewarned of resource hoggery, though. Try running too many apps at once, and a low-memory notification will pop up in the left-hand corner telling you to cool it. The PlayBook comes loaded with 1 GB of RAM to protect against this, though on occasion when I ignored the warning long enough, my browser crashed. Move closer to the software level and things get even stickier. Any tablet debuting more than a year after the Apple's market-dominating iPad needs an edge. For the PlayBook, that edge is support for Adobe Flash, a feature that the iPad is famously lacking. RIM says it took over two years of working with Adobe to bring Flash to its tablet. Two years may not have been enough. During a round of ""Plants vs. Zombies,"" gameplay bogged down whenever the animation got intense. Every time I tried to access a Flash game on Facebook, the browser crashed. Yes, every single time. Say goodbye to your well-tended crops, Farmvillians. RIM delivered several software updates during our tests, showing that the company is still ironing out bugs. Flash stability increased with each update, and may well be even more stable by the time the PlayBook ships on April 19. But the fact that a marquee feature is strapped with such stability problems so close to the ship date is troubling. Another glaring flaw is the PlayBook's complete lack of native e-mail, contacts and calendar apps. Want those apps? Log on to your Gmail account with the browser. BlackBerry smartphone owners can access e-mail on the PlayBook after installing RIM's Bridge app, which connects the phone to the tablet by Bluetooth, but we weren't able to test this feature. If you don't have a BlackBerry phone, you're out of luck until summer, when RIM says a future software update will bring native clients to the PlayBook. Also worth considering is the relatively paltry selection on BlackBerry's App World, which contains roughly 3,000 apps. By comparison, Apple and Google's app inventories number in the hundreds of thousands. And some of the biggest apps -- Facebook, a Gmail client, Twitter, Angry Birds -- are conspicuously absent. Clicking on the Facebook ""app"" icon on the desktop brings up a web browser and loads the Facebook website. RIM has announced that an Android app player will be available on the PlayBook, which should bolster the number of available apps. But any Android apps ported to the PlayBook must be vetted by RIM before they can make it into the store. Under casual use conditions, the PlayBook's battery held up for close to eight hours, which is on par with both generations of the iPad. With heavy use of Flash-based sites (when they functioned) and 1080p video-watching, the PlayBook's battery hung in there for an impressive 5½ hours. It's important to note that this is a Wi-Fi only version of the PlayBook, and that the battery life may be different once RIM releases the promised 4G versions of the PlayBook for the big three U.S. carriers. Expect those to roll out beginning this summer, though no pricing details have been released on the 4G models yet. The bottom line: It's a well-constructed device with great media-viewing capabilities, solid hardware specs and a price on par with the current tablet market. But with serious gaps in key areas like app selection and Flash stability, you may want to think twice before picking one up. WIRED Sexy design appeals to the Mies in you.

"GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said. Palestinians distribute U.N. food aid Thursday in a refugee camp in southern Gaza. The U.N. has ""lost confidence"" in the Israeli military's attempts to allow humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency's director said. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council late Thursday overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Fourteen of the council's 15 members voted in favor of the resolution -- with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice abstaining from the vote. Hours before the resolution was approved, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanded an investigation into the convoy incident he said killed two contract workers near the Israel-Gaza border. UNRWA director John Ging said one aid worker was killed. Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.  Images emerge of Israeli troops in Gaza » . ""We are perfectly willing to take risks, but something has to change,"" Ging told reporters from Gaza City. ""If they give us the clearance to move, it is [unacceptable] that their soldiers are firing on us from the ground."" Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle. Four U.N. staffers have been killed since Israeli airstrikes on Gaza began December 27, and two U.N. schools in the territory used as civilian shelters have also been hit by the Israeli military. The aid agency provides food and relief supplies to some 80 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million people, but it says it has been unable to reach many Palestinians or assess the situation in Gaza during the Israeli military offensive. The absence of foreign journalists -- whom Israel has barred from entering Gaza -- is preventing the truth about conditions there from getting out, Ging said. ""We have horrific stories coming out now. ... You have to brace yourself for more,"" Ging said. ""This is a horrific situation."" Red Cross workers on Wednesday found numerous wounded Palestinians in the neighborhood of Zaytun, the organization said in a statement. The injured included four children, too weak to stand, next to their dead mothers in a house containing 12 corpses, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Palestinian medical sources said Thursday that 765 Palestinians have died in Gaza -- nearly 40 percent of them women and children -- since the Israeli military operation began. Three Israeli soldiers died in the fighting on Thursday, bringing to 10 the number of Israeli soldiers killed in the operation. Three Israeli civilians and one of those soldiers have been killed in rocket strikes from Gaza. The Israeli military says its operation is aimed at halting the firing of rockets into southern Israel by Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007. But militants have continued to fire dozens of rockets and mortar shells on southern Israel since Israel launched its military operation. More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said. The mounting death toll and humanitarian concerns in Gaza are being addressed by cease-fire proposals now being considered by Israeli and Palestinian diplomats in Egypt. Israel continued its military operations in Gaza even during a three-hour period in which it said it would halt its offensive activities to allow for ""humanitarian activities."" At least 50 trucks carrying aid were allowed into Gaza on Thursday, but it is unclear if any of the supplies were distributed to civilians. Much of the U.N.'s aid is stuck at the Kerem Shalom border crossing because the private company that drives the aid in is refusing to enter Gaza ""because the situation is too dangerous,"" U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief John Holmes said. Israel has periodically opened some of its borders with Gaza to allow aid into the territory during the military campaign.

During the three-hour ""truce"" on Thursday, large explosions could be heard from central Gaza and small arms fire from northern Gaza, according to CNN's Ben Wedeman, reporting from along the Israel-Gaza border. Also, Israeli armored bulldozers demolished a home in Gaza ""just as the lull was supposed to go into effect,"" he said. Video shot from the border showed the home -- with two white flags flying on the roof -- crumble to the ground as the bulldozers plowed into its side and roll over the debris. ""We saw a man coming out of that house with a white flag and until now we have seen no sign of any military activity in that area,"" Wedeman reported. ""There have been no shots fired from that house."" The Israeli military had no comment on the incident. A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces. Separately, four rockets fired from southern Lebanon landed near the northern Israeli city of Nahariya Thursday, leaving two people with minor injuries. The Israeli military returned fire across the border and suggested that residents of northern Israel stay near their shelters.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour discuss the rocket attacks » . There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Hezbollah assured the Lebanese government that it was not responsible for the attacks, the Lebanese information minister said.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors on Friday dropped human trafficking charges against a Saudi princess, saying a domestic servant living with her in Southern California was not being held against her will as previously alleged. Meshael Alayban, 42, was charged in July after the 30-year-old woman alleged that, among other things, she wasn't free to leave Alayban's condominium in Irvine. But an extensive investigation after Alayban's arrest determined that while the servant might have believed the allegations, the woman's movements weren't restrained and Alayban wasn't guilty, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters outside a courtroom after a judge dismissed the case Friday morning. ""The evidence indicates very strongly at this point that the (domestic servant) was not actually the victim of human trafficking, and so this case had to be dismissed,"" Rackauckas said. Alayban, one of the wives of Saudi Prince Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud, was arrested and charged after the servant, originally from Kenya, left the condominium, flagged down a bus and then talked to police. The woman accused Alayban of paying her only $220 month, significantly less than the $1,600 a month she said she was promised. The woman also claimed that she was denied medical care, and that, when she arrived in Saudi Arabia to work for the family before following Alayban to California, the family confiscated her passport, authorities said. But a post-charging investigation revealed that the ""original terms of her employment were not what had been stated,"" and that the other allegations also didn't bear out, Rackauckas said. ""The fact is she did receive medical care, and ... there really was not the restriction of her movements and her freedom to come and go as she certainly believed,"" Rackauckas said. Rackauckas said the movements of the family's other four workers were not restricted. ""I don't think (the servant) was lying to us. I think that there was a lot of misunderstanding and misapprehension,"" Rackauckas said, . One of Alayban's attorneys, Paul Meyer, told reporters he thanks Rackauckas ""for standing up and doing the right thing."" ""Our sense is justice was done in this case,"" Meyer said. ""The princess is innocent, and we are now satisfied that's been shown."" Alayban's family and the five workers had traveled to the United States in May. At the time of Alayban's arrest, police said all five workers were in good health and there were no indications of physical abuse. This would have been the first forced labor human trafficking case to be prosecuted in Orange County under California's Proposition 35, which passed in November and increased the penalty for human trafficking. CNN's Michael Martinez and Chandrika Narayan contributed to this report.","District attorney says Meshael Alayban didn't hold domestic servant against her will .

"(CNN) -- Mickey Rooney, who died Sunday at 93, may have been the most unusual major star in the history of Hollywood. Why? For one thing, at the peak of his fame, he was only a youth. In the late 1930s into the 1940s when he topped the Hollywood box office, earning the then huge sum of $150,000 a year, there were few child actors with his clout. In fact, unlike today, there weren't many child actors at all. Only Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin could begin to rival him. Then there was his size, even into adulthood. There were other diminutive stars in Hollywood's Golden Age, such as Jimmy Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, Paul Muni, Humphrey Bogart, but no one as pint-sized as Rooney, who topped out at just 5-foot-2. We like our stars to be outsized. Rooney was definitely undersized. But Rooney had something else that no other star had. Male stars -- then as now -- were largely figures of power: not just Cagney and Bogart, but Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, even Spencer Tracy. Moviegoers were attracted to their ability to dominate, to bend the world to their will. Rooney didn't exude power. He exuded pluck. Rooney never played the conventional hero vanquishing forces of evil. He was best known as Andy Hardy in a series of films at MGM: the quintessential young man in the quintessential small town with the quintessential family and honoring quintessential American values. About the only things he vanquished in these movies were his own doubts or his own lovesickness or his own moral quandaries. Andy was eager, loving, decent, thoughtful -- not the qualities we ascribe to movie heroes but the very qualities Americans, particularly as they emerged from the Great Depression -- liked to ascribe to themselves. He didn't conquer through strength. He succeeded through sheer energy. ""Let's put on a show,"" the joking line attributed to Rooney in those Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland pictures, expressed what Rooney was about: not American muscle, but American determination. And if Rooney didn't convey power, he didn't convey manliness either. (Hell, he wasn't even a grown man in his heyday.) The great male stars of his time didn't cry. They didn't even wince. They were stoics patrolling America's mean streets. Only Jimmy Stewart among them even seemed to have a tender side. But Rooney was no stoic. He did cry. He was open and vulnerable and wounded and occasionally scared. Think of the last scene in ""The Devil Is a Sissy"" where he stares into the night after his prisoner father is executed. He couldn't stare down the world the way the other male stars did. He could only stare into it, often with wonder and pain. After all, he was still a boy, he could expose his heart. He could be hurt. And there was one more thing about Rooney that made him an unusual star in the Hollywood constellation. Almost every great star then, male and female, was a cynic. They were hard-boiled, had learned to survive life, but lived without illusions. Think of Bogart in ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep"" or Bette Davis in just about any of her pictures. Rooney, again partly because of his youth, was devoid of that cynicism. He was hopeful, idealistic, utterly sincere. In a movie world of doubt, Rooney alone was a true believer. In these three ways -- pluck and heart and idealism -- Rooney may have come closer to the American ethos in Depression-era America than any other star. He was loved not because he expressed what we could only hope to be, but because he expressed what we liked to think we actually were. Take Rooney in what is arguably his best role, as Homer Macauley in Clarence Brown's screen version of William Saroyan's World War II novel, ""The Human Comedy,"" from 1943. Homer's job is to deliver telegrams, including those informing families of their sons' death in battle -- more Rooney sadness. This was MGM head Louis B. Mayer's favorite film because it captured the idealized way he viewed America, with Rooney as the idealized American boy--though the director Billy Wilder once recalled to me a time he found Mayer throttling Rooney on the lot after some transgression and yelling, ""You're Andy Hardy! You're America!"" That Rooney was. His death is a reminder of an earlier time when Americans had a more innocent vision of themselves. Rooney's persona may not have worn well over time -- it was a young man's persona -- but in the '30s and '40s he was the personification of that innocence, and a vestige of it has passed with him.","Neal Gabler: Rooney was very unusual in Hollywood. A child actor with enduring success .
He says he had quality unlike male stars of Golden Age: not powerful, but plucky, vulnerable .
He conquered through energy, determination, not strength. His image was hopeful, sincere .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States and Russia completed a spy swap Friday, exchanging the agents on chartered planes at an airport in Vienna, Austria, a U.S. official and Russian media said. The plane carrying 10 Russian agents, who were expelled from the United States on Thursday for intelligence gathering, landed at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport on Friday afternoon, the airport press office said. ""The United States has successfully transferred 10 Russian agents to the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation has released four individuals who had been incarcerated in Russia,"" Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the National Security Division at the U.S. Department of Justice, said in a statement released as the plane landed in Moscow. ""The exchange of these individuals ... has been completed."" The elaborately choreographed transfer -- which took place while the planes sat on the ground for about an hour -- was reminiscent of a scene from the Cold War. The White House was first briefed in general terms in February by the FBI, the CIA and the Department of Justice about the program and some of the individuals involved, a White House official said. Additional briefings occurred in subsequent months, the official said. President Obama was first briefed on the matter on June 11 and given details of the individuals involved over the past decade. A week later, Obama chaired a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the issue. The idea of a swap was discussed among the administration's national security team before the arrests were made, the official said. The four individuals freed by the Russians were selected based on humanitarian concerns, health concerns, and other reasons, the official said. The 10 Russian agents pleaded guilty in the United States on Thursday for failing to register as foreign agents and were ordered out of the country. They then boarded a U.S.-chartered flight accompanied by U.S. marshals, a federal law enforcement source said. ""As a result of the successful exchange ... the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has requested that the court dismiss any remaining charges against the 10 Russian agents,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Friday. In Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder said none of the 10 had passed classified information and therefore none had been charged with espionage. ""They were acting as agents to a foreign power,"" he told CBS News, referring to the Russians who, U.S. officials have said, had been under observation by federal authorities for more than a decade. Four young children of the Russian agents are now in Russia, according to attorneys for the agents. Two older children are no longer in the United States, though their exact location is unknown. Another two older children have remained in America, the attorneys indicated. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told PBS' ""NewsHour"" that although the 10 agents didn't plead guilty to being spies, they ""were clearly caught in the business of spying."" In a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said the agents agreed never to return to the United States without permission from the U.S. government. Holding them would have conferred no security benefit to the nation, they said. This ""clearly serves the interests of the United States,"" one official said. A second official said the four prisoners in Russia were in failing health, a consideration that prompted quick completion of the deal. Under the plea agreements, the defendants disclosed their true identities in court and forfeited assets attributable to the criminal offenses, the Justice Department said in a news release. ""Defendants Vicky Pelaez, Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko, who operated in the United States under their true names, admitted that they are agents of the Russian Federation; and Chapman and Semenko admitted they are Russian citizens,"" the Justice Department said. Carlos Moreno, an attorney for Pelaez, said his client does not want to take up residence in Russia and would prefer ultimately to live in her native Peru or in Brazil, where she has family. Pelaez hopes to continue her work as a journalist, according to Moreno. Pelaez told the court that Moscow promised her free housing in Russia and a $2,000 monthly stipend for life, as well as visas for her children to travel to see her. Pelaez and her husband, both naturalized American citizens, were stripped of that citizenship as a part of the plea deal. Authorities have lost track of an 11th suspect, who was detained in Cyprus, released on bail, and then failed to check in with authorities as he had promised to do. In Moscow, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree Friday pardoning the four Russians imprisoned for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies, the Kremlin press service said, according to state-run RIA Novosti. ""Three of the Russian prisoners were convicted of treason in the form of espionage on behalf of a foreign power and are serving lengthy prison terms,"" the Justice Department said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who handled the case in the United States. ""The Russian prisoners have all served a number of years in prison and some are in poor health. The Russian government has agreed to release the Russian prisoners and their family members for resettlement."" It added, ""Some of the Russian prisoners worked for the Russian military, and/or for various Russian intelligence agencies. Three of the Russian prisoners have been accused by Russia of contacting Western intelligence agencies while they were working for the Russian (or Soviet) government."" The individuals pardoned by Russia are Alexander Zaporozhsky, Gennady Vasilenko, Sergei Skripal, and Igor Sutyagin. All four appealed to the Russian president to free them after admitting their crimes against the Russian state, press secretary Natalia Timakova said. But in Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner denied Thursday that Sutyagin had been a spy. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the move was made ""in the general context of improving Russian-American relations, and the new dynamic they have been given, in the spirit of basic agreements at the highest level between Moscow and Washington on the strategic character of Russian-American partnership.""

"(CNN) -- ""Why does it seem that the elections are only being held on Facebook? Why is there no commotion on the streets yet? Where are the people?"" This is a question that a journalist based in Tehran posted on his Facebook account eight days before election day. Iranian public opinion is deafeningly silent, a silence that even the media close to the regime has complained about. Unlike the four previous presidential elections during which the streets were turned into lively and colorful carnivals with the supporters of different candidates engaging in unending debates and fervent speeches, this time it is only the walls of the streets that have been covered with banners and posters. But if this situation is sad it is also strange. Domestic opinion polls and a few foreign ones -- such as the Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) -- show that 60% to 75% of the people say they will participate in the elections. The same polls show that 60% of these people have yet to decide which candidate to vote for. Under such circumstances, one would expect individuals to come together in a public sphere and have ongoing and meaningful discussions so that people could hear different opinions. But this is not the case. Read more: Candidate quits Iran presidential race . Of course, people in taxis -- one of the most political public spheres in Iran -- talk about the elections but there is no discussion. Less people are seen trying to persuade or convince one another; therefore no political deliberation is taking place. It is as if this time it is not the public per se but individual observers who are deciding in their heads what to do on election day. Contrary to what that journalist from Tehran thought, compared to 2009 even online political engagement is less, colder and more indifferent. In 2009, cyberspace was a battle scene for the campaigns of candidates -- particularly reformist candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who are currently under house arrest. The Facebook pages of these candidates had tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of likes and each post received hundreds of comments every day. One could easily see the accumulation of emotional energy in the interesting and untiring debates of Facebook users, bloggers, and micro-bloggers. The supporters of the two Reformist candidates tried to persuade those advocating banning the elections while at the same time engaged in passionate polemics over which one of their candidates was better. Such a momentum was about to build up this year too. When former president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani -- who is controversially considered the Islamic regime's godfather figure and also a democracy catalyst -- registered for candidacy one could see this built up energy begin to release. Read more: The man to revive Iran's reformist movement? The Iranian regime had different political calculations for Rafsanjani's disqualification but definitely one of them was to prevent the polarization of the election and ultimately seeing it turn into a carnival -- like in 2009 -- which was impossible to contain even after the election was over. This indicates that the regime fears election campaigns more than the ballot boxes. Iranian state television took measures to ensure that in the three rounds of televised election debates there would be the least amount of confrontation among the eight candidates, unlike in 2009. The first two debates were so boring that it drew criticism not only from the candidates themselves but also the presenters of the state TV. It was as if the soup had been served up too cold. But the third debate -- held on Friday June 7 - suddenly became heated. Not only did the reformist and ""principalist"" candidates [who back the Supreme Leader] attack each other but the principalist ones -- who were supposed to be in a coalition -- also went after one another. The candidates realized that even in the restrictive debate channels they could navigate and create waves. Still, with every debate, social media became a place for individual posts full of mockery, sarcasm and personal revelations rather than showing affect for a certain candidate. While there are many pages dedicated to the eight presidential candidates on Facebook -- none of which are official -- their energy level is low. The Facebook pages of the two candidates close to the Reformists are more active and have daily posts. But while commenting is allowed, there is a very short trace of vernacular voices under the posts. Among the five so-called principalist candidates, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Saeed Jalili are the most active on social media websites. Jalili supporters who are mostly young radical idealists associated with the cult known as Hezbollahi are digitally savvy enough. Aside from a group of websites supporting him, a hub, which has identified more than 1,800 bloggers from all over Iran who advocate for Jalili, has also been launched. If the reformist and Green Movement -- which was formed after the disputed 2009 elections -- supporters are present on Facebook the principalist supporters of the regime have tried to ""occupy"" Google Plus. This ironically shows that the digital attitude in Iran conforms with political orientation to some extent. What these two groups have in common is that they both access these websites with difficulty and using illegal anti-proxy software. But they have one main difference: Principalist online activists monitor and follow their opponents but they are less being seen. Read more: Is Iran's next president the face of its nuclear program? The popularity of social media and growing number of Internet websites in Iran causes fewer individuals and groups to feel isolated or that they are in a minority. But the downside is that anyone can have the illusion that they are in the majority because they have less opportunity to step out of their ghetto and be exposed to opposition and contesting voices. The Iranian regime is not that concerned about the ghettoization or fragmentation of public spheres. The experience of the past election has taught the regime that they must prevent the clash of these publics and their beliefs which could cause the election atmosphere to become antagonistic. This is why this year it was decided that the spring semester of universities would be finished sooner so that student bodies would not have the chance to have any election activity -- which even drew criticism from the pro-regime student bodies. Using Slavoj Zizek's analogy, Iran's 2013 presidential election so far resembles drinking decaffeinated coffee, it tastes like coffee but you are not supposed to get a caffeine buzz from it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Reza Eshraghi.","Iranians head to the polling booths on Friday June 14 .

"(CNN) -- Malaysia's opposition leader has urged his supporters to wear black at a rally to be held in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to protest Sunday's vote, which he claims ""was marred with unprecedented election fraud."" ""Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,"" Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement released Monday. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the leader of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for 56 years, took his oath of office on Monday after winning 133 out of 222 parliamentary seats, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition won 89 seats, handing Barisan Nasional its worst ever electoral showing. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were ""unsubstantiated"" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. ""Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""This is entirely contrary to pre-election opinion polls, including those by Pew Research and the Merdeka Center, which showed significant support for both the Prime Minister and his ruling party and suggested they were on track for a victory."" The weeks leading up to Sunday's election saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings and there were widespread reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. ""We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,"" it said in a statement. Investors reacted favorably to the election outcome, sending Malaysia's stock index up more than 8% on Monday and strengthening the currency. Liam Hanlon, senior political analyst at Cascade Asia Advisors, said the government should interpret its reduced margin of victory as a warning from voters that reform is needed. ""The government must heed this warning and understand that it needs to be more forward-looking in order to survive,"" he said. ""It would be a shame if the opposition's strong showing actually propelled the country back into more pronounced race-based policies."" In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced policies that effectively split the country along ethnic lines, giving preferential treatment to the so-called Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays and natives of Sarawak and Sabah. According to the CIA Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay. Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. Anwar appealed to voters with a promise to change race-based policies to make them more inclusive and needs-based. James Chin, a professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University, said the results showed that Malaysia's ethnic Chinese population had voted in a bloc against the government for the first time. He added that some urban Malays had also voted for the opposition. He said that Anwar's efforts to address election irregularities would depend on whether he drew support from across Malaysia's multi-ethnic population. ""Elections in Malaysia have never really been free and fair but the big difference this time was for the first time in Malaysian history, the Chinese on both sides of the South China Sea voted together against the government,"" he said, referring to Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. ""The key to tomorrow's attendance is to see if the Malays are willing to come out. If only the Chinese come out it will look like a racial protest. It needs to be a multiracial protest if it's going to have any effect.""","Malaysia's opposition leader calls on supporters to attend rally on Wednesday .

"(CNN)  -- A fight over books depicting sex and homosexuality has riled up a small Wisconsin city, cost some library board members their positions and prompted a call for a public book burning. A washing machine was part of a July 4 parade float made by a group seeking changes at West Bend's library. The battle has stirred much of West Bend, a city of roughly 30,000 people about 35 miles north of Milwaukee. Residents have sparred for months on blogs, airwaves and at meetings, including one where a man told the city's library director he should be tarred and feathered. The row even spread to this year's Fourth of July parade, which included a float featuring a washing machine and a sign that read ""keep our library clean."" ""If you told me we would be going through a book challenge of this nature, I'd think, 'Never in a million years,' "" said Michael Tyree, director of the West Bend Community Memorial Library. The strife began in February when West Bend couple Jim and Ginny Maziarka objected to some of the content in the city library's young-adult section. They later petitioned the library board to move any sexually explicit books -- the definition of which would be debated -- from the young-adult section to the adult section and to label them as sexually explicit. Ginny Maziarka, 49, said the books in the section of the library aimed at children aged 12 to 18 included homosexual and heterosexual content she thought was inappropriate for youths. She and her husband also asked the library to obtain books about homosexuality that affirmed heterosexuality, such as titles written by ""ex-gays,"" Maziarka said. ""All the books in the young-adult zone that deal with homosexuality are gay-affirming. That's not balance,"" she said. The library did not agree with the Maziarkas' suggestions, and the couple appealed to the library board. Ginny Maziarka, a mother of four, began blogging about the issue and the local newspaper picked up the dispute, sparking the opposition. Maria Hanrahan, also a West Bend mom, set up a rival blog to argue the other side. ""I'm against any other party telling me what's appropriate for my child and what isn't,"" said Hanrahan, 40, who also created a West Bend Parents for Free Speech group. ""We don't mean to say these are appropriate for everyone, but we don't feel they should be set apart from other materials or restricted from the young-adult section."" By this time, many more people had become caught up in the issue, which was generating heat. When Hanrahan appeared on a local radio, callers attacked her views, she said. ""People were being very passionate on both sides of the issue. I think it divided the community a little bit,"" she said. With the debate raging, the city council voted in April against renewing the terms of four library board members, in part because council members thought the board was dragging its feet, library director Tyree said. The Maziarkas were still fighting to have books moved, having identified 82 questionable titles -- more than double their original list. Then they stopped targeting a list of books and circulated a petition that asked the board to label and move to the adult section any ""youth-targeted pornographic books"" -- including books that describe sex acts in a way unsuitable for minors. The books could still be checked out freely by anyone. ""We're not talking about educational material. We're talking raunchy sex acts,"" Maziarka said. One book she objects to is ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" in which a fictional teenage boy tells about his freshman year in high school, including rape and homosexual and heterosexual sex between teens. Tyree said book excerpts found on Maziarka's blog had been taken out of context and, in the case of ""Wallflower,"" the criticism missed some of the book's points. ""In this book, there were consequences of ... rape, of indiscriminate sex. Those were not portrayed so glowingly,"" he said. By the time the library board met on June 2, each side had collected more than 1,000 signatures backing their position. Dozens of residents spoke at the meeting before the board -- still including the outgoing members -- unanimously voted to keep all policies the same. The demand to move the books was always going to be problematic because no authority has determined that any of the titles are pornographic or obscene, Tyree said. Book challenges aren't new. More than 500 were reported in the United States in 2008, mostly in schools and public libraries, Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the American Library Association said. But this one was attracting extra attention. Caldwell-Stone, who monitored the dispute, said moving any young-adult book to the adult section would have been a form of censorship, even if teens were free to check them out. ""The whole intent was shelving books not on the basis of age or reading ability, but because they disapprove of the content with the intent of restricting access. That's a burden on First Amendment rights,"" Caldwell-Stone said. Outside West Bend, the fight caught the attention of Robert Braun, who, with three other Milwaukee-area men, filed a claim against West Bend calling for one of the library's books to be publicly burned, along with financial damages. The four plaintiffs -- who describe themselves as ""elderly"" in their complaint --- claim their ""mental and emotional well-being was damaged by [the] book at the library."" The claim, unconnected to the Maziarkas, says the book ""Baby Be-bop"" -- a fictional piece about a homosexual teenager -- is ""explicitly vulgar, racial and anti-Christian."" Braun, who says he is president of a Milwaukee group called the Christian Civil Liberties Union, said he singled out the book because it ""goes way over the line"" with offensive language and descriptions of sex acts. The call for burning the book showed his passion, Braun, 74, said. ""I don't sit on the fence when I do these things. When I make a decision to speak up on something, I go for it."" The ALA will help the library oppose the claim if it goes forward, Caldwell-Stone said, adding she felt that was unlikely because ""it has very little basis in law."" Back in West Bend, the Maziarkas and their supporters are gearing up for another go at the library, in part because the board now has its four new members. They do not want books burned, but they do want action. ""We want parents to decide whether they want their children to have access to these books ... and we want the library's help in identifying [them through labeling and moving],"" Maziarka said. ""It's just common sense.""","Wisconsin couple say some books too risque for library's young-adult section .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- An Australian author was sentenced Monday to three years in prison in Thailand after falling foul of a Thai law that makes it a crime to insult the country's royal family. Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell on Monday. Harry Nicolaides was arrested last August over a 2005 book called ""Verisimilitude,"" which includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that the authorities deemed a violation of the Lese Majeste law. Nicolaides, 41, was bombarded with questions from foreign journalists as he arrived at the court Monday, wearing shackles as he stepped from a prison bus. In tears, he said he would plead guilty. ""Truth is stranger than fiction,"" he said. ""It's been an ordeal for months. It feels like a bad dream.""  Watch shackled Nicolaides at court » . The Thai Criminal Court originally sentenced Nicolaides to six years in jail but cut the punishment in half because of the guilty plea. He listened calmly as the verdict was translated to him. After hearing his verdict Nicolaides said: ""I wish my family the best.""  Watch Nicolaides' brother's reaction » . One of his lawyers said no decision had been made about whether to appeal or seek a royal pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej has pardoned foreigners in other similar cases in the past. CNN has chosen not to repeat the allegations made by Nicolaides because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand. Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism. He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31 last year. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him. ""I think there are individuals who have exploited an obscure law for their own self-interest,"" he said. Only 50 copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold. The law Nicolaides was convicted of breaking is section 112, known as the Lese Majeste law. It says: ""Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years."" Thailand's king is highly revered in this Buddhist nation, but even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's new prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also told CNN he is concerned about the misuse of the Lese Majeste law. ""There are cases in the past where this law has been abused for political purposes, and I agree this has to stop,"" he said. Despite the rhetoric there's little sign the prime minister will change the law. Other cases are pending against both foreigners and Thais.

"(CNN) -- A lone blonde woman, wrapped in nothing but a sarong, leads four camels and a little dog across one of the most uninhabitable environments on Earth. Startlingly beautiful, with skin roasted a deep chestnut from the desert sun, the petite 26-year-old in flimsy leather sandals appears the unlikeliest adventurer for a nine-month expedition across the Australian outback. Appearances can be deceiving. In 1977, Robyn Davidson trekked 2,700 kilometers from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean, armed with little more than a map and a rifle, in a landscape which had destroyed many a hardened explorer before her. Adventurers are often asked why they push themselves to the human body's limits. ""It's only in hindsight that there's any psychologizing of it,"" Davidson tells me in between bites of her croissant, at a trendy inner-city London cafÃ© on a humid spring morning. ""At the time it just seemed like a perfectly sensible, good thing to do. Above all else, it was pleasurable."" And in an age of instant communication, where you are never far from a text message, tweet or Facebook post, perhaps Davidson has a lesson for us all. ""I disappeared but I've never felt so alive,"" she says in her soft Australian accent. Making Tracks . It's no coincidence these punishing red plains are nicknamed the country's ""dead heart."" A place where temperatures can exceed a scorching 120F and the nearest town is often hundreds of kilometers away. The Aboriginals called Davidson the ""desert woman,"" and her epic journey caught the attention of National Geographic photographer Rick Smolan -- who became both her documenter and lover. His intimate images of the intrepid young woman -- tenderly feeding her camels, or swimming in a rare watering hole -- helped make it one of the most popular photo essays in the magazine's history. It plunged the girl who grew up on a cattle station in remote Queensland into the international spotlight -- her outback odyssey became the toast of New York. Davidson's book detailing the marathon mission, called ""Tracks,"" has since sold over one million copies, bringing to life the beauty and brutality of a landscape mysterious to many outside Australia -- and indeed to the majority of people living in the country's coastal cities. The book has now been turned into a feature film, with actor Mia Wasikowska possessing an unnerving resemblance to the real-life desert woman. A literary life . Wearing a crisp white shirt, Davidson's broad face remains unmarked by a lifetime in the sun. At 63-years-old, she is still as quietly striking as those images of a fair-haired girl on camel-back staring fiercely into the camera three decades ago. How do you follow an expedition of such epic proportions? In her late 20s, Davidson moved to a shoe factory in London's East End, of all places. She fell in with a literary circle that included housemate and celebrated author Doris Lessing, and boyfriend-of-three-years Salman Rushdie. A nomad at heart, Davidson lived across the world, shifting like the sands of her impressive landscapes. Now she's back in the UK capital to write her memoirs -- about as far away as you can get from her extreme pilgrimages, including two years traveling with nomads in north-west India in the 1990s. Pleasure and pain . ""Why not?"" has become Davidson's enduring response to why she ventured into Australia's great unknown in the 1970s an era before. Where other people might see a vast expanse of arid nothingness, Davidson saw the desert as a ""limitless garden,"" a place ""teeming with life."" It was a desert she traversed without GPS trackers and high-tech camping kit. Learning bush skills from the aboriginal communities she met along the way, Davidson ate witchetty grubs -- which to the easily-queasy might resemble enormous maggots. She quickly learned not to trust her maps in this unchartered landscape, and instead followed animal tracks towards water. Not bad for the girl who police initially wouldn't register a rifle to, because they thought they'd have to go chasing after her when she got lost. Real-life romance . Even Smolan -- the 27-year-old photographer who spent three months with Davidson at intermittent points throughout the journey -- was convinced that each time he looked back at her in his rear view mirror, it would be the last. ""There were herds of wilds animals, crazy people out there,"" he says over the phone, the sound of traffic blaring in the background of his native New York. ""Her camels could have thrown her, she could have broken a leg, she could have gotten lost. It's the kind of place where if you take the wrong road, after three weeks you come to a fence and find you're out of water."" Much is made in the film of the pair's romantic coupling, but in the searing heat it was a relationship tempered by more complex emotions -- some still raw for Smolan. ""I was resistant to Rick because I felt I'd sold out to National Geographic,"" says Davidson, who never intended to write about her personal pilgrimage at all. ""He's a sweetie, but hopeless in the desert. But when you are forced to deal with somebody, you either kill them or you learn tolerance. And we're still very good friends so... I think it forged a very deep friendship actually."" Smolan has a different take: ""It was much more of a romance -- at least on my side -- then it was in the movie."" ""I was pretty smitten and you can see that in the photographs,"" he says of the ""intense and fascinating woman who didn't want me there."" ""She had no idea how beautiful she was. Several times I developed my pictures and brought them out to show her, thinking I could win her over -- because most women like it when you show them how beautiful they are. And I remember being really stunned that the more beautiful my pictures where of her, the more she hated them. ""She just said: 'I'm not some god dammed model out here."" Four-legged family . Was Davidson's real adoration for her faithful dog Diggity and four camels, a type of ramshackle circus family inching across the desert together? ""The love story of the movie is much more between her and the dog, than her and me,"" says Smolan, chuckling good-naturedly. ""This little dog was like her protector. If there were snakes, if there were intruders... Diggity had her back."" But why camels? ""They're the perfect form of transport,"" explains Davidson matter-of-factly in her book. ""One sees little by car, and horses would never survive the hardships of desert crossings."" This was not about conquering nature, she says, bristling at the suggestion. Instead, Davidson wanted to meld into the environment, her skin slowly turning the same reddish brown as the ancient lands she walked. ""Maybe for men it's a longing to conquer something. They conquer the mountain, they conquer something in themselves. I never felt that way. For me it was more of a merging into, entering into, becoming part of."" Tough love . She'd see other travelers ""hurtling through the desert in a four-wheel drive, with two-wave radios, and iceboxes, and think -- why bother?"" ""My procedure across that desert was about getting rid of stuff -- both physically and metaphorically."" Did that include the memory of her mother's suicide when she was 11-years-old, as suggested in the film? Davidson sighs, and you get the feeling it's a diagnosis she's heard many times before. ""It kind of seems to say that for a woman to have done anything extraordinary, she has to be a bit strange, or have something to work out, or there has to be some sort of dark thing in her past. ""I don't think my mother's death had much to do with it at all, frankly."" Myth and memory . These days, where even NASA astronauts can tweet every step of their missions to millions across the world, Davidson's slow and deeply personal journey feels all the more rare -- and mysterious. ""It's a tale with mythical elements,"" she says, her gray eyes revealing the only hint of sun damage on her serene face. ""If you think of all the enduring stories in the world, they're of journeys. Whether it's Don Quixote or Ulysses, there's always this sense of a quest -- of a person going away to be tested, and coming back."" How lucky we are she did.

"(CNN) -- Remember the Muppets? Silly question -- you're old enough to read, so they probably helped teach you. Back when I was kid, they were huge. ""The Muppet Show"" ran five seasons, 1976-1981, and spawned half a dozen film spin-offs. The first Muppet movie (""More entertaining than humanly possible!"") boasted cameos by Bob Hope, Mel Brooks, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, Steve Martin and Richard Pryor -- not to mention Orson Welles -- a bill that positioned Kermit and company as the natural heirs to a half-century or more of prime-time vaudeville shtick. But the brand has fallen into neglect, and it's entirely possible that an otherwise pop savvy 10-year-old wouldn't know his Scooter from his Waldorf. (""Fred the frog?"" my son guessed, when I asked him to name one. ""And isn't there a pig?"") Catch up with Kermit and Miss Piggy . Enter Jason Segel, who fessed up to a fetish for singing puppets in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and who has taken up the challenge of making Jim Henson's fabric-and-thread creations relevant to today's digital generation. Segel, who stars and co-wrote (with ""Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller), grabs the bull by the horns, so to speak, by acknowledging that the Muppets' glory days are long gone. That strategy risks making this comeback vehicle too much of a nostalgia trip to entice the kiddies, but their parents will probably lap it up. Gary and Walter are brothers, and inseparable; except that Gary (Segel) is flesh and blood, and Walter ... well, let's just say there's a reason why Walter's favorite show is ""The Muppets."" When Gary invites his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) for a romantic getaway to Los Angeles, it's only natural that he would invite Walter along too: For as long as they both can remember, it's been Walter's dream to visit the Muppet Studios. But when they get there, the building is dilapidated and on the verge of falling into the hands of an unscrupulous oilman, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). The only way to save it is to persuade Kermit to round up the old gang and put on a telethon: a comeback comedy special. It's not exactly a fresh idea, but Segel and debut director James Bobin (""Flight of the Conchords"") amuse themselves -- and us -- by poking fun at the cornball conventions of movie musicals: When Mary breaks into a melancholy ballad, the sudden downpour on her window pane doesn't come from the heavens, but a gardener's hose. A song-and-dance routine involving the entire population of ""Smalltown"" climaxes in the citizens collapsing into a heap, exhausted. In fact, this early showstopper -- ""Life's a Happy Song"" -- is easily the pick of the new tunes, an infectiously jaunty number written by ""Flight of the Conchords' "" Bret McKenzie. Too many of the rest are strictly novelty items, including an intentionally awful barbershop rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and Chris Cooper rapping, badly. ""Man or Muppet,"" which is supposed to reflect the identity crisis of the two brothers, doesn't make much sense in the circumstances. We can see pretty clearly which is which and where the 2-foot hand puppet really belongs. I hate to be a party pooper. At its best, this is a bright, colorful, perfectly innocuous amusement, but it's also pretty slapdash and disappointingly sluggish. Tim Burton and Paul Reubens worked this line of parodic faux innocence better in ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" 25 years ago (so did Amy Adams in ""Enchanted""). Segel hasn't given himself enough to do as Gary, whose defining characteristic is neglecting Mary -- and if you're going to go to the trouble of inventing a new Muppet (Walter), why make him a bland nonentity? As for the show's true stars, Kermit and Miss Piggy, it's nice to have them back, but I have to say they've never had the same spark since original voice artists Jim Henson and Frank Oz passed the baton to Steve Whitmire and Eric Jacobson. Piggy, in particular, is a pale shadow of the psychotic diva she used to be -- just don't tell that to Jack Black, the guest star she kidnaps and, uh, hogties when no other celebrity volunteers for the telethon. A mixed bag then: ""The Muppets"" isn't the best or the worst of Kermit's big-screen capers. At least it's a reminder that here's one frog who isn't about to croak.","""The Muppets"" isn't the best or the worst of Kermit's big-screen capers .

"(CNN) -- The Pap test, the gold standard for detecting cervical cancer for 60 years, may be losing its luster. An FDA advisory committee unanimously recommended this week that a particular HPV test become the first line of screening for the deadly disease. The test developed by Roche detects the DNA of the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which is the cause of more than 99% of all cervical cancers. The Pap test is designed to look for abnormal squamous cells that could indicate cervical cancer. Both tests are performed with a vaginal swab. Up until now, the Pap was the first test women had to detect the illness, with the HPV test as a second analysis. But if the FDA follows the advisory committee's recommendations, that would change. The committee, which voted unanimously to make the switch, would only allow the Roche cobas test to be used alone as the primary evaluation for women 25 years and older. Although there are other HPV tests available, the Roche test detects two strains of the virus that are found in 70% of all cervical cancers. ""Every year, 12,000 women are diagnosed in the U.S. with cervical cancer. This is especially tragic because cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease, and it is well established that HPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancers worldwide. Women need better access to screening tools that include primary HPV screening in order to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer,"" said Dr. Thomas Wright Jr., an expert in gynecology and pathology at Columbia University Medical Center. ""I am pleased that the FDA panel recognized the importance of validated, scientific evidence documenting the use of primary HPV screening to detect women at risk of invasive cervical cancer and allow us to prevent cervical cancer from developing."" This does not mean the Pap test will go away. It will really be up to the physician and the patient on how best to handle testing. But according to women's health experts, in most cases, patients who don't have HPV are less likely to need a Pap, which is why the advisory committee felt it best to recommend the Roche test be administered as the first form of detection. ""I think anytime guidelines are changed, it becomes confusing for both patients and physicians. And we're going to have to do more research on what's best,"" said Dr. Angela Marshall, director of Comprehensive Women's Health of Maryland. ""But the fact that the FDA is looking to make these changes says we've made great strides in detecting and treating cervical cancer."" Many physicians are viewing the recommendations with caution. ""Use of the Pap test and HPV test in tandem, or co-testing, is currently the preferred method of cervical cancer screening in women over 30, so ob-gyns generally use the combination. The use of the HPV test as a first-line screen is promising, and appears better than the Pap test used by itself. The real question is how it compares to co-testing, which is not yet clear,"" said Dr. David Chelmow of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center. Chelmow also spoke on behalf of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists at the advisory committee meeting. ""About half of the cervical cancers diagnosed in the United States are found in women who were never screened for the disease. At this time, primary screening is not part of any of the generally used clinical practice guidelines."" Current U.S. guidelines for cervical cancer detection recommend that women between age 30 and 65 undergo the Pap test alone every three years, or both the HPV and the Pap tests every five years. Although the FDA does not have to follow the recommendations of its advisory committee, in most cases it does.","FDA Advisory committee says a particular HPV test should be first line of screening .

"(CNN) -- Nobody's perfect -- in life or the 2014 NCAA basketball brackets. But Brad Binder gave it quite a ride, notching 36 correct men's tournament picks until he was derailed Saturday night. Binder, 23, of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, picked the wrong team to win the Syracuse-Dayton game, killing his chance of a perfect 63-0 bracket in the Yahoo Sports' Tourney Pick'em pool. Binder had picked every single game in the round of 64 and the first four games played Saturday. Then, Dayton upset Syracuse, 55-53. Binder had picked the Orange. The pool is for bragging rights and has no prize money, unlike other bracket pools. Binder forgot to enter the Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge, also run through Yahoo sports. He tweeted Saturday, ""And that was the closest I've ever come to not winning a billion dollars."" Additionally, there were no perfect brackets remaining in ESPN's bracket challenge. CBS Sports, which runs one of the bigger bracket challenges, previously reported that in the past two years the last remaining perfect brackets were eliminated in the 22nd and 23rd games of the tournament. ESPN reports that of the roughly 30 million entrants it has had over the 13 years, no one has come close to a perfect bracket, and that only one person has had a perfect first round in the last seven years. Binder told ESPN on Saturday he was in a rush when he was getting ready to leave for work when he filled out his NCAA tournament bracket online. Although he had entered his bracket on the Yahoo website -- he did his picks in less than five minutes -- Binder forgot to enter the Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge. Quicken is one of the sponsors. Quicken and co-sponsor Yahoo have an insurance policy sold to them by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which would cover the cost of any prize money. The companies did not disclose how many people entered the challenge. Binder said that ""never in a million years"" did he think he would be in this position. ""I was about to leave for work, and I was in a rush,"" Binder said. ""I filled it out, and that was kind of it. I didn't even really think about it. However, if I can reach out to Mr. Buffett, if he would consider grandfathering me in to be eligible and if he can make an exception, that would mean a lot to me and give everyone, I guess, a perfect bracket to root for.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Exports of French Bordeaux, Italian Tuscans and Spanish Riojas could get more expensive in China if a tit-for-tat tariff war bubbles over between the world's most populous country and the European Union. On Wednesday, Beijing launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of European wine. The inquiry follows new EU tariffs, only announced Tuesday, of nearly 12% on China-made solar panels that begin June 6. The European Commission has accused China's state-subsidized panel makers of flooding European markets with unfairly cheap products. In a public statement, China's Ministry of Commerce said it had ""received requests from domestic wine companies, accusing European wine companies of entering the Chinese market by dumping products, receiving subsidies and other unfair measures. Based on these requests, the Ministry of Commerce will initiate a serious investigation according to laws and regulations."" ""This is what we call 'strategic play' in game theory. It is an action which is intended to have benefits in negotiation,"" says Dr. Xu Bin, Professor of Economics and Finance at the China Europe International Business School, or CEIBS, in Shanghai. China is smart to pick on Europe's wine industry, adds Xu, because it is ""not core to Europe's economy"" yet ""symbolic enough"" that it will have an ""immediate impact"" on people's hearts and minds. If a tariff war ensued, ""it would be very damaging for France,"" says Carl Crook, Managing Director of Montrose Wines, one of China's biggest importers of foreign wine. France is China's number one exporter of wines. In 2012, the country shipped more than 700,000 bottles to China, more than four times the volume of second-ranked Australia, according to the China Customs Information Center. Yet Crook believes a tariff war -- if kept brief -- may actually help the bottom lines of China's foreign wine importers in the longer term. From 2002 to 2012, China's total imports of foreign bottled wine rocketed nearly 15,000% to more than 1.3 million bottles. But from 2011 to 2012, growth trickled to an anemic 8%. ""There has been a lot of enthusiastic buying that needs to be depleted,"" says Crook. ""There is excellent inventory to last a short trade war. I'm not as alarmed as I think I should be."" While a quick tariff war might encourage Chinese consumers to drink their imported wine stocks -- and replenish their supplies -- a longer tariff war would have a more ambiguous impact, with potential winners and losers both in China and around the world. ""New world wines are waiting for this opportunity,"" says Crook. ""Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa are well positioned."" Both Chile and New Zealand recently implemented bilateral trade agreements with China that lowered duties on wine imports to zero percent, he adds. ""I don't think it's a good thing for us,"" says Judy Leissner, President of Grace Vineyards, a well-known domestic Chinese boutique label that aims to keep volumes at or below two million bottles each year. ""Yes, we are in competition with imported wine, but that imported wine helps educate consumers. If consumers are more highly educated then it's better for us all."" Leissner expects a tariff war would only lead to a short-term jump in sales and that big-name, high-volume Chinese wine suppliers like Great Wall, Chang Yu and Dynasty would benefit most. ""If prices rise because of a tariff war, China's wine companies will have less reason to do better,"" adds Leissner. ""Human beings are lazy."" Looking ahead, early August is the deadline to a tariff resolution. In two months, the EU tariff of 11.8% on Chinese solar panels will rise to an average of 47.6%. If talks fail before then, the EU will decide in December whether to impose duties on panels for a maximum of five years. ""Ideally it would be better for both sides to retreat from their current positions,"" says Xu of CEIBS. ""I understand the European economy is not in good shape, so there is a lot of pressure from domestic lobbies for protection from other countries."" ""In the end, both will yield some inches,"" says Xu. ""There is no winner in a trade war.""","China launches anti-dumping, anti-subsidy inquiries into European wine imports .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Not too long ago, the generation gap meant parents didn't understand why ripped jeans cost twice as much as regular ones or why every other word coming out of their child's mouth was ""like."" Now the gap means employers don't understand why twentysomethings straight out of college expect a high salary and lots of vacation time. Employees under the age of 29, also known as Generation Y, expect their employers to provide more benefits and other perks than their older counterparts, according to a new survey from CareerBuilder.com and Harris Interactive. Gen Y workers want better pay, a flexible work schedule and company-provided BlackBerrys and cell phones. Eighty-seven percent of hiring managers and HR professionals say Gen Y exhibits a sense of entitlement that older generations don't. But not all Gen Y-ers see it that way. Mark Treichel, a recent college graduate, says it's more an expectation of give and take than a sense of entitlement. ""Employers expect entry-level employees to have substantial work experience, be top of their class, dress professionally, et cetera,"" Treichel says. ""Personally, I worked hard at two year-round internships while still going to school my last two years. I don't expect high pay and a BlackBerry, but I do expect to be compensated for the hard work I put in preparing for the position."" Alison Bailin, 27, also believes her generation wants to see a significant return on years of education. ""College expenses have skyrocketed, leaving many of us in debt,"" says the account executive. ""Many career fields require one year or more of a [usually] unpaid internship, so we are joining the work force with a year or more experience than many previous generations."" Technology is largely responsible for the shift in expectations and employers' willingness to adapt to them. Some of the world's most visited Web sites, such as Facebook and YouTube, made their creators millionaires before their 30th birthdays. For some Gen Y-ers, this is ammunition when entering the work force. ""Companies desperately want to be a part of the Web 2.0/user-generated content, MySpace, YouTube phenomenon. Who better to guide that shift than Gen Y?"" asks Matt Dornic, 26, president of the public relations firm 3 Dog Communications. Dornic reminds employers that this generation of workers not only grew up during a technological revolution, they participated in it. ""We are a people that had cell phones in high school,"" he says. ""Of course we are going to expect to have the most up-to-date gadgets in order to compete in today's sleepless digital market."" Bailin agrees. ""I think if other generations had such technologies as cell phones and BlackBerrys, they would work toward getting them financed through work as well."" Bailin's assessment emphasizes just how much her generation has incorporated technology into daily life. Forty-nine percent of employers cite Gen Y's preference for e-mail or phone calls over face-to-face meetings as the biggest communication gap between Gen Y and co-workers. So what are companies going to do about it? Fifteen percent of employers reported modifying their policies in order to appease their Gen Y employees. Of those employers who made changes, 57 percent implemented more flexible work schedules and 33 percent created new recognition programs. ""As companies' cultures evolve with each generation, you see all workers benefiting from a variety of viewpoints and work styles,"" says Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder.com. Just how much Gen Y-ers and their employers will accommodate one another has yet to be seen.

"(CNN) -- As a nation, Brazil might be better known for its round rather than oval-ball prowess but the World Cup host has been granted automatic spots in the rugby sevens at the 2016 Olympics. Sevens is making its Olympic bow in Rio de Janeiro and increasingly teams in the Brazilian city are seen practicing on the iconic Copacabana Beach and elsewhere - overall in the country, rugby participation in Brazil has risen by 25% since 2011. On the international stage, Brazil is far from a powerhouse of the sevens discipline but the International Rugby Board has now decreed that, as hosts, it will automatically qualify for both the men's and women's tournaments. It means the qualification criteria for the rest of the Olympic hopefuls is even tougher with one less place up for grabs. IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset explained: ""The decision to include Brazil is good for rugby, good for Brazil and good for the Games. Rugby in Brazil is experiencing rapid growth and inclusion will generate further impetus and excitement while giving the Brazilian rugby family and sports fans across the nation something really special to look forward to at their home Olympics. ""We are excited and honored for rugby sevens to be making its Olympic Games debut in Rio and believe that the Games will be great for rugby and rugby will be great for the Games."" Rugby is thought to have been brought to Brazil by British immigrants in the late 19th Century, the first recorded match taking place in 1888 in Sao Paulo. But the game has struggled to take off, in part due to the vast size of the country and partly because of the lack of infrastructure. The IRB are seeking to address that and last year injected $400,000 into rugby in Brazil in order to increase participation, while 9,000 children have been introduced to the sport via its Get Into Rugby Program. Rio will also host round three of the IRB Women's Sevens World Series from 21-22 February.","IRB grant automatic qualification spots to Brazil men's and women's teams for 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Five former Blackwater Worldwide security guards indicted on voluntary manslaughter and other charges in connection with killings in Iraq were released on their own recognizance Monday after a court hearing. Dustin Heard, an ex-security guard from Blackwater Worldwide, surrenders Monday in Salt Lake City, Utah. The charges, which the Justice Department announced Monday, stem from a September 16, 2007, shooting that killed 17 Iraqis in a Baghdad square. A judge ordered the ex-guards to appear for another court hearing in Washington on January 6. The 35-count indictment charges each of the former guards with 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime. Prosecutors do not believe they have enough evidence to bring manslaughter charges on three of the 17 deaths. If convicted, the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each manslaughter count, seven years in prison for each count of attempted manslaughter and a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms charge.

The attorneys for the defendants say that Blackwater's employees in Iraq are exempt from the provisions of the act because the company has a contract in Iraq with the State Department, not the Defense Department. Mark Hulkower, defense attorney for Slough, blamed the killings on insurgents who used civilians as ""shields"" in Iraq. Hulkower said his client and the other defendants were just trying to do their jobs in a very chaotic situation. ""These young men were fighting for their lives in a crowded area,"" Hulkower said to reporters on the steps of the courthouse Monday. ""What happened was a tragedy, but not every tragedy is a crime. We are confident that this case will be dismissed."" The federal magistrate judge in the case initially ordered all five suspects barred from using firearms as one of the conditions for their release. Attorneys in the case argued against this vigorously, saying the suspects were hunters and one of the suspects needed to use a gun for his job as a court bailiff. The judge allowed the court bailiff, Ball, to use his gun for work but barred the others from using firearms. The hearing was packed with relatives of the suspects, and about a dozen soldiers in uniform could be seen in the courtroom. Defense attorneys pushed for the Utah judge to have a probable cause hearing, a preliminary hearing that determines if the government has enough evidence to go to trial. But the judge ordered that the probable cause hearing should occur on January 6 in Washington. The six guards were informed during the summer that they were targets of the investigation into the 2007 shooting. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The former guards' company, Blackwater Worldwide, will not face charges. In a statement released shortly after the indictments were announced, Blackwater reiterated its position that its former employees had not acted improperly. ""Based on the information available to us, we understand that these individuals acted within the rules set forth for them by the government and that no criminal violations occurred,"" the statement said. Blackwater also complained about a number of ""misguided assumptions and generalizations that surrounded this unfortunate incident. ... [Blackwater's] work has been mischaracterized and all of our personnel unfairly maligned."" At the same time, the company noted that if ""it is determined that an individual acted improperly, then Blackwater supports holding that person accountable."" None of the former guards has worked for Blackwater since 2007, company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said. An Iraqi official familiar with the investigation said that an FBI team and two U.S. prosecutors working on the case will meet in Baghdad on Saturday with more than 60 Iraqis involved in the incident. The meeting is intended to brief the Iraqis on the status of the case. Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents. The guards returned fire, Blackwater said. But an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder"" and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately. The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene told military investigators they found no evidence the contractors were fired upon, a source familiar with a preliminary U.S. military report told CNN. The indictments are ""a step in the right direction,"" said Mohammad Abdul Razzaq, whose 9-year-old son, Ali, was killed at Nusoor Square in Baghdad. ""It was heinous crime and a painful incident, [but] we can overcome that if a just verdict is handed down."" Hassan Salman, an Iraqi lawyer wounded in the shootings, said that the ""American judicial system, known for its integrity, should hand down [to] the perpetrators of this heinous crime against the Iraqi people nothing less than death sentences."" The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors. Among the potential problems is that the law under which the charges are expected to be brought covers contractors working for the U.S. military, but the Blackwater guards were contracted by the State Department. Some independent legal experts question whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction in this case. Also muddying the waters are alleged assurances of immunity given to the guards by State Department diplomatic security agents investigating the incident before the FBI got involved. The State Department said its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution but only promised that statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution. But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity, FBI agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again, complicating the FBI probe. The shooting heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws. Security contractors had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put in place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. But starting next year, under a U.S.-Iraq security agreement that Baghdad approved last week, Iraq will have the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. contractors and their employees. The State Department, which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees, renewed Blackwater's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government.

"(CNN) -- Scientists examining the 7,000-year-old remains of a hunter-gatherer found in Spain have discovered that African versions of pigmentation genes determined his skin color, but that he had blue eyes now associated with northern Europeans. Baptized ""La Brana 1"" by scientists -- after the La Brana-Arintero site where his remains were found -- the man lived during the Mesolithic period, which lasted from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago. The Mesolithic hunter-gather period was followed by the Neolithic period and the advent of farming. As a result, La Brana 1's diet differed from Neolithic man, and researchers said he had been lactose intolerant. ""The biggest surprise was to discover that this individual possessed African versions in the genes that determine the light pigmentation of the current Europeans, which indicates that he had dark skin, although we cannot know the exact shade,"" researcher Carles Lalueza-Fox from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) said. ""Even more surprising was to find that he possessed the genetic variations that produce blue eyes in current Europeans, resulting in a unique phenotype in a genome that is otherwise clearly northern European."" A genome is the full map of an individual's DNA. La Brana 1's closest modern descendants, in genetic terms, live in northern Europe in places like Sweden and Finland. The research -- carried out by the CSIC in partnership with Denmark's Centre for GeoGenetics -- has been published in the scientific journal ""Nature."" Manuel Vidal Encinas, archaeologist of the Council of Castilla y Leon, found and excavated the La Brana-Arintero site, near Leon, in 2006. Scientists said the cave is located in a cold mountainous area with a steady temperature -- conditions that contributed to the ""exceptional"" preservation of the DNA of La Brana 1 and the remains of another individual found there. Researchers say they will now try to recover the genome of the second set of remains, which were not as well preserved.","Remains of two people from Mesolithic period were found in Spain in 2006 .

"(CNN) -- A Texas woman accused of killing her toddler daughter and dumping the body in Galveston Bay has been found guilty of murder by a jury in Galveston, Texas. Kimberly Dawn Trenor received a life sentence without possibility of parole in the murder of her daughter. Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, showed no emotion as the verdict was read late Monday. Trenor had pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence in the case, but pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge. She received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The body of Trenor's daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers, was found in October 2007 in a large blue plastic container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay. Two-year-old Riley Ann's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body. Authorities didn't know her identity, and police dubbed her ""Baby Grace."" After authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on July 24, 2007. Another piece of evidence shown to the jury during the trial was a page of Trenor's journal where she talked of beating the child, according to CNN affiliate KTRK. ""I just kept hitting her with the belt again and again. I don't know how long, but I remember her trying to get away and me knocking her back down,"" the journal said. Trenor's husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 25, also faces capital murder and evidence tampering charges, but is being tried separately. A court date has not been set in that case.","Body of Kimberly Dawn Trenor's daughter found on Galveston Bay island in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- If an e-mail popped up in your inbox promising a house for $100, you'd expect to see it sent from a guy in Nigeria asking you to wire him several thousand dollars first. Zeb Smith lies on his front lawn and spends a quiet afternoon with his neighbors. But this depressed housing market dream is real. And Detroit, Michigan, artist Jon Brumit and his wife, Sarah, are living it. The couple never counted on owning a home. ""It's not that we have a little money,"" Jon Brumit said, laughing. ""I'm saying we have no money."" But the couple began entertaining the idea of a permanent nest when their friends Mitch Cope and Gina Reichert, also artists, started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city, where the average home price dipped to $11,533 in April, according to the Detroit Association of Realtors. Dragging down the average are homes that are long abandoned or foreclosed on that are selling for pennies on the dollar. Detroit already had the lowest market value houses in Michigan before the latest rounds of job losses at GM and other huge employers, market analysts say. ""Those artists are doing a good thing; they are at least helping to stabilize neighborhoods that would be all but lost,"" said Mike Shedlock, an investment adviser who blogs frequently about Detroit's economy. For less than a few thousand dollars, Cope and Reichert snapped up a dilapidated bungalow in a north Detroit neighborhood called ""BanglaTown,"" for its unexpected mix of Bangladeshis, African-Americans, Polish and Ukrainians and the occasional shady character. Scrappers had cleaned the house to the bone. The copper had been stolen; the electrical wiring was stripped. But no matter. Here was a chance for Cope and Reichert, who run a popular Detroit art store, to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings, with solar panels, LED lights, recycled wood and high-end insulated windows. They're installing a security system that exemplifies elegant efficiency with hurricane-proof windows and steel doors replacing burglar bars. They are also experimenting with running their air-conditioning on a car battery. The project became known as the Power House. Cope and Reichert wanted to create a central place to power homes nearby and, in turn, revive a neighborhood's sense of community. The trick was getting their friends not only to cheer the concept but invest in it by moving next door. ""It was much easier than we thought it might be,"" Cope said. ""We told everyone that Detroit is an interesting city to work in as an artist, and the neighborhood is diverse. But, really, it came down to money."" ""I kept telling Mitch, 'Wow those are an awesome, ridiculously good deals but if you find anything that's less, let me know,"" Brumit said. ""Like, if something comes along for next to nothing, cool."" A few weeks later, Cope e-mailed Brumit a photo of an abandoned home on his block. Its windows were boarded up and plywood was nailed across the front door. The huge hole in the roof was courtesy of the fire department. A neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice. Pricetag: $100. Brumit called a real estate agent with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who confirmed that bids on the foreclosed property started at $95 for the property, $5 for the house. There were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house, it had been empty for so long, Brumit said. Cope, also a designer and builder, and an inspector did a walk-through. ""Inspection was fine and Mitch told me the foundation was good,"" Brumit said. ""He just said, 'If you didn't mind scraping some peeling paint, doing some surface treatments, putting in new utilities, windows and repairing the roof ... this could be pretty interesting.'"" Now, when he's not hauling loads of rubble away or knocking out walls to create a single, open studio space, Brumit's searching Craigslist for a furnace. In exchange for designing the business Web site of a local barn recycler, he's getting materials to turn that hole in his roof into a skylight. ""I saw it as a project,"" the artist said. ""I'm a builder. I've been building skateboards since I was 12."" Skateboards are one thing. Rebuilding homes where the plumbing has been ripped out or the cabinets destroyed in a fit by an upset foreclosed homeowner is another. Michigan housing authorities acknowledge that there's little incentive for people who aren't quite as handy as Brumit. In two weeks, the state will begin offering $25,000 to anyone who buys a home, as long as they pay 1 percent of the total cost and live in it.  Landlords or speculators aren't eligible. Part of a $263 million grant given to Michigan and other states under 2008's Housing and Economic Recovery Act, the funds are intended to help buyers bring trashed properties up to code, according to Mary Townley, a director with the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. She and other housing officials CNN spoke with said Michigan's economy has some extremely frustrating woes. A report from the nonprofit think tank Brookings Institution said Detroit had the lowest performing economy out of 100 U.S. cities it analyzed -- scoring the worst in unemployment and average wages, the highest foreclosure rates and the lowest market value homes. The artists in BanglaTown are careful to say they are not looking to change a city. Their goal is simply to improve a neighborhood, one house at a time. New neighbors, freelance photographer Corine Vermeulen-Smith and her husband Zeb Smith, a designer, are always checking out www.freecycle.com, where a stainless steel kitchen sink can be bought for $65. The Smiths bought their 660-square-foot home for $549.99 from Cope and Reichert, who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $500. ""We knew the property, we knew it had been sitting there empty for at least a year, and it had been trashed,"" Vermeulen-Smith said. ""But we wanted to own a home."" All the copper in their ""micro-home"" had been ripped out, as well as every electrical outlet, Vermeulen-Smith said. Trash had to be hauled out in several loads. ""You have to get over that fear that the house had that history, that you're going to be a victim of a crime or something,"" she said. ""Crime is everywhere. My husband and I have lived in the city for a long time; we know that people look out for each other here. We don't have that kind of fear."" Careful not to entice thieves again, the Smiths replaced the copper with plastic. They are considering taking the home completely off the grid by installing a mini-wind turbine, but for now they are happy to put in the basics. A bathtub from Habitat for Humanity cost them $100. And Zeb Smith, who works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close. ""This is, for us, very exciting to believe that we could totally reinvent a space,"" she said, ""and prove that having a home isn't about having money.""","Detroit artists buy a trashed, abandoned house for $100, fix it up .

"London (CNN) -- Monkeys and bananas. It's as natural a pairing as squirrels and nuts or movies and popcorn. Not any more, says one zoo in southwest England. Paignton Zoo in Devon is grabbing bananas out of its monkeys' hands, giving them leafy veggies and sprouts instead. This is no monkey-business diet fad, though. The zoo says the high calorie and sugar content of bananas grown for human consumption -- which are sweeter than those found in the wild -- are bad for the monkeys' health and can rot their teeth. ""Bananas grown for human consumption are full of sugar and calories, and bear no relation to fruit grown organically,"" said zoo spokesman Philip Knowling. ""Life in the wild is hard work and in a zoo you can sometimes look after the animals too well and it isn't good for their health."" Thicker, better fur . Humans can continue gobbling up their bananas, just keep them away from monkeys. ""Sweet and juicy bananas are good for humans but not for monkeys,"" Knowling said. ""Animal nutrition has become a problem. Bananas and monkeys is a bit of a cliche, but they're not a good combination."" The zoo has not been able to find a supplier for the kind of wild-grown bananas that would be more suitable for the monkeys, he said. So, it decided it was time to put them back on the shelf. The zoo has seen ""definite changes"" in the monkey's behavior since the bananas were slowly withdrawn from their diet, Knowling said. ""We've noticed a net improvement in their coat and their fur is thicker and better. Some of the smaller monkeys are less aggressive,"" he said. Thailand's annual 'monkey buffet' Diabetes risk . According to the zoo's head of conservation, Amy Plowman, the bananas' high sugar content could cause the monkeys to develop diabetes or similar conditions. ""It can also cause gastrointestinal problems as their stomachs are mostly adapted to eating fibrous foods with very low digestibility,"" she said. Zoos are getting smarter in the way they feed their captive animals. Rather than throw in ready chopped and prepared food, many now try to make the animals ""work"" for their calories by searching for scattered foodstuffs or doing puzzles to release treats. This is just the next step, Plowman said. Knowling said there was no obvious sign that the monkeys were missing the fruit. In fact, they could well be happier without the extra sugar. ""Smaller monkeys such as tamarins and marmosets are highly strung animals and live in tight-knit social groups which can be quite aggressive at times,"" said Matthew Webb, senior head keeper of mammals. ""Reducing the sugar in their diets has calmed them down and made their groups more settled.""

"(CNN) -- The women's spring 2013 runway shows have wrapped up in New York, London and Milan and Paris, previewing what's newest and next in ready-to-wear. But a handful of fashion museums — from the Big Apple to Amsterdam to Kobe, Japan — offer year-round peeks into the history of high style. Thanks to their rotating exhibitions and permanent collections, they help visitors connect the cultural dots between the history of fashion and what's happening now. You don't have to be a designer-obsessed fashionista to check them out. ""Everybody from a 2-year-old child to a grandmother has a sense of the role of fashion in their lives,"" says Dr. Valerie Steele, director and chief curator of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, whose New York exhibitions include ""Gothic: Dark Glamour;"" ""Love & War: The Weaponized Woman"" and ""The Corset: Fashioning the Body."" ""People get information about fashion from so many sources. The museum is just one more medium, but it's outside the commercial realm. We're not trying to sell them anything—just to inspire them."" A history of the little black dress . Fashion museums, whether in the United States, South America, Europe or Asia, tend to specialize in certain aspects of style. In The Netherlands, Amsterdam's Tassen Museum Hendrikje is all about bags and purses; thanks to its namesake's footwear roots, Museo Salvatore Ferragamo in Florence, Italy, offers a well-heeled walk through Hollywood. Others, like The Museum at FIT (which considers itself a ""think tank,"" Steele says) not only stage chronological and historical exhibits and yearly symposiums, but also introduce visitors to student-created fashion collections. ""All of the time, we try to reach out to make it accessible to the general public, as well as for students, industry professionals and fashion connoisseurs,"" says Steele, a professor and author who The New York Times has called a ""High-Heeled Historian."" ""We go the extra mile about not just showing pretty dresses, but to think about what they mean in the cultural sense.

In July, it earned accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums, the highest national recognition possible for a museum. Founded in the late 1960s, it is visited by 100,000 people each year. With a permanent collection of 50,000 garments and accessories from the 18th century to the present, the Museum at FIT places an emphasis on ""aesthetically and historically significant 'directional' clothing, with an eye toward contemporary avant-garde fashion. Kent State University Museum . Kent, Ohio . Housed on a university campus in northeast Ohio, the Kent State Museum contains important collections of fashion and decorative arts, with eight galleries featuring rotating exhibitions of work by artists and designers. Affiliated with Kent State's Shannon Rodgers and Jerry Silverman School of Fashion Design and Merchandising, the museum gives students an up-close-and-personal look at historic and contemporary fashion and costumes from global cultures. Accredited by the American Association of Museums, Kent State's collections span from the 17th to the 21st centuries. Kobe Fashion Museum . Kobe, Japan . ""The first museum in Japan to specialize in fashion,"" the Kobe Fashion Museum houses materials open to students, industry professionals and those working in the business of fashion. The museum's fifth floor offers a space for young people to gather for events and entertainment, designed to promote ""a new culture of fashion in Kobe."" The collection here not only includes garments from Asia, but also from around the world. Les Arts Décoratifs . Paris . Located in the west wing of the world-famous Louvre museum, Les Arts Décoratifs houses three museums in one: Arts Décoratifs, Publicité and Mode et Textile — and it's this one that's home to temporary but dramatic fashion exhibitions. The currently staged ""Louis Vuitton Marc Jacobs"" traces the careers of the French-born creator of 19th-century trunks and accessories and the American designer who spent 15 years as artistic director at the house Vuitton built. With more than 81,000 works, the two-floor Mode et Textile space owns collections of design legends including Paul Poiret, Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparelli. Fashion Museum . Bath, United Kingdom . The English town of Bath seems an unlikely place for a museum dedicated to high style, but it has been home to the Fashion Museum (formerly the Museum of Costume) since 1963. About 100,000 visitors come each year to check out its annually rotating exhibitions, guided tours and interactive displays. A bonus: family-friendly ""dressing up activities,"" in which kids can try on replica archery costumes and Victorian garb over their own clothes. Tassen Museum Hendrikje . Amsterdam, The Netherlands . With 4,000 bags, purses, trunks, pouches, cases and accessories, this Dutch museum claims to have the ""world's largest bag collection.""

"Washington (CNN) -- He's the leader of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which runs the VA hospitals where dozens of U.S. veterans died waiting for simple medical screenings. Yet in the six months that CNN has been reporting on these delays, Eric Shinseki has been silent. And he hasn't spoken out on the matter to any other news organization, either. Early Friday evening -- after this story appeared on CNN.com -- the VA gave a response, via spokesman Drew Brookie. He explained that the VA's inspector general's office (referred to as OIG), which is probing the matter, ""advised VA against providing information that could potentially compromise their ongoing investigation at the Phoenix VA Health Care system."" ""Accordingly, VA may not be able to respond with respect to specific inquiries that may fall within the bounds of the OIG investigation on this subject,"" Brookie said. ""VA will work with OIG to ensure that any information provided balances our need to keep the public informed with the obligation to preserve the integrity of the OIG's investigation."" We first began examining the delays in appointments and care for veterans last fall, and immediately reached out for an interview with Secretary Shinseki on November 12. Our initial report on delays in care at VA hospitals in Georgia and South Carolina published a week later. Since then, we've submitted numerous written requests and last month we verbally requested an interview with Shinseki at an April 9 House hearing on the delays prompted in part by CNN's reporting. Most recently, we started looking into the Phoenix VA, where sources told us that the hospital concocted an elaborate scheme to cover up long wait times there. The sources said more than 1,400 vets were placed on the purported secret list and that documents were shredded to hide the evidence. According to sources, at least 40 U.S veterans died waiting for care at the facility, many of whom were on the list. According to CNN's sources and documents, more than 120 veterans -- including the 40 in Phoenix -- have died, are dying or have suffered serious injuries waiting for care at VA facilities. The VA has acknowledged that 23 veterans have died as a result of delayed care in recent years. Our requests for interviews with Arizona officials were repeatedly denied, until finally the local top VA officials in Phoenix agreed to an interview on Tuesday -- nearly a week after our initial story aired on CNN's AC360 and CNN.com. The Arizona officials told CNN Tuesday they had never instructed their staff to create a secret list, or to maintain a secret list, or to shred any evidence, and they said they never issued any instructions about it to their staffs. They acknowledged an electronic waiting list for veterans but said there may have been confusion among their staff about how it worked. They admitted some patients on the waiting list have died, but that they said they do not know if those deaths were tied to delays. CNN's exclusive investigation quickly drew attention in Washington: on Monday -- a day before the Phoenix VA officials agreed to speak to us -- President Barack Obama announced he has called for an investigation into what has happened in Phoenix. Shinseki issued a written statement Thursday, announcing that the director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system and two others have been placed on administrative leave amid claims of a secret waiting list and claims that 40-plus veterans died waiting for care. ""We believe it is important to allow an independent, objective review to proceed,"" Shinseki wrote. ""... These allegations, if true, are absolutely unacceptable and if the Inspector General's investigation substantiates these claims, swift and appropriate action will be taken."" Still, Shinseki has refused all CNN requests for an interview. Shinseki has served as VA secretary since 2009, appointed by President Obama who hailed him as someone who ""always stood on principle."" The former Army Chief of Staff under the Bush administration earned high praise among Iraq war critics for his testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee one month before the U.S. invasion into Iraqi, saying he believed ""several hundred thousand troops"" would be needed to keep order in a post-invasion Iraq. That was more than double the number of forces the Pentagon had estimated. ""No one will ever doubt that this former Army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans,"" Obama said when he nominated Shinseki to the post.

"(CNN) -- The father of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza said his son would have killed him if he'd had the opportunity. ""With hindsight, I know Adam would have killed me in a heartbeat, if he'd had the chance,"" Peter Lanza told New Yorker magazine in an interview that appears in the March 17 issue. It's the first time Peter Lanza has spoken publicly about his son. ""The reason he shot Nancy four times was one for each of us: one for Nancy; one for him; one for (his brother) Ryan; one for me,"" he said. Authorities say Adam Lanza, 20, killed his mother, Nancy, before fatally shooting 20 children, six staff members and himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Peter Lanza said his son talked with many mental health professionals but none saw violent tendencies in his personality. He said he may have overlooked troubling signs himself by accepting a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, though he doesn't think Asperger's caused the violence.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the man behind the kingdom's committed policy to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has stepped down from his intelligence post, according to the country's official news agency. Considered one of the most familiar faces in the Saudi Royal House, Prince Bandar was relieved of his post as chief of General Intelligence on Tuesday ""upon his request."" General Staff Yousif bin Ali Al-Idreesi has been assigned to act as Chief of General Intelligence immediately, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Prince Bandar bin Sultan served as the Saudi ambassador to the United States for 22 years until 2005, and was appointed the chief of General Intelligence in 2012. ""Even though he was ambassador to the United States for 22 years and very close to the Bushes, he was no friend of the United States for the last three or four years,"" Christopher Dickey, foreign editor at The Daily Beast, said Wednesday in an interview on CNN. Bandar took on the thorny task of building and implementing Saudi Arabia's policy on Syria. He became a staunch supporter of the rebel cause, supporting the Syrian Free Army in trying to topple al-Assad's government, and leveraged his close ties with his traditional friends in the West, calling on them to arm the Syrian opposition. However, a lack of international action on Syria and a thawing of Western ties with Iran marked a watershed in Saudi's global orientation. Iran backs the al-Assad regime. ""Bandar was extremely hawkish on Iran even before he had this official position,"" said Dickey. ""One time or another he's tried to take on Iran, and he hasn't been very successful at that."" In October, Prince Bandar was widely quoted as saying the kingdom would be making a ""major shift"" in dealings with Washington. This new stance, analysts say, could signal a pendulum swing when it comes to Saudi Arabia's policy toward Syria. ""I think the American Saudi partnership in the region will probably be less rocky than when Bandar was running the show,"" Dickey said. U.S. President Barack Obama, who visited Riyadh in March for the first time since 2009, discussed ""tactical"" differences with Saudi Arabia over the question of the arming of the Syrian rebels. A senior administration official told reporters after President Obama's face-to-face meeting with Saudi's King Abdullah that the United States and Saudi Arabia are ""very much aligned"" despite recent policy differences over Syria and Iran. ""I think the moderates are coming in and they are going to set the agenda for the next stage,"" said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, professor of political science at UAE University. The United States and Saudi Arabia have a longstanding history, an alliance forged most notably by oil and most recently by the rise of al Qaeda-affiliated networks in the region.","Prince Bandar bin Sultan was appointed as the chief of intelligence in July 2012 .

"New York (CNN) -- The federal trial of Abu Hamza al-Masri, a radical Islamic cleric accused of conspiring to kidnap Americans in Yemen and planning to establish a jihad training camp in rural Oregon, began in New York with opening statements on Thursday. The prosecution described al-Masri as a terrorist trainer who hid behind religion. The defense portrayed him as a man who expressed strong opinions but did not participate in criminal acts. The terror trial opened less than a month after Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, was found guilty in the same federal courthouse of helping al Qaeda terrorists conspire to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists. Federal prosecutors said Ghaith, a Kuwaiti cleric, played a crucial role as the organization's principal mouthpiece and recruiter, helping ""restore al Qaeda's trove of new terrorists"" as deadly missions turned its members into martyrs. Al-Masri, who once called the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a ""hero,"" pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of terrorism in 2012. The fiery, one-eyed cleric stands trial in an American courtroom years after losing a lengthy legal battle to avoid extradition to the United States from Britain. The charges against al-Masri include conspiracy in connection with the 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen, and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutor Edward Kim told the jury that the defendant's ""cause was war, and it was all consuming."" ""He was a trainer, a terrorist, and he used the cover of religion so he could hide in plain sight in London,"" Kim said. Weapons and gas masks were found at al-Masri's London mosque, the prosecutor said: ""Tools of war stockpiled in a place of worship."" In Yemen, al-Masri allegedly gave the kidnappers satellite phones as well as instructions, Kim told the jury. A year later, the defendant allegedly sent two men to Oregon to establish a training camp, providing them with money and instructions on throat-slitting, shooting and building silencers, Kim said. From London, one witness is expected to testify that he took an al Qaeda fighter to Afghanistan at the direction of al-Masri. Defense lawyer Joshua Dratel, however, told the jury there was no evidence linking the cleric to the alleged crimes -- ""not in Yemen, not in Oregon, not in Afghanistan."" Dratel said his client ""never gave directions or orders to people"" and served merely as a ""commenter on events and issues."" ""These are ideas, not acts,"" he said. ""These are expressions, not crimes."" The weapons seized in the London mosque were found in a large building and never connected to the cleric, Dratel said. In the Yemen kidnappings, al-Masri was an intermediary trying to resolve the situation, the lawyer said. Al-Masri wanted deliver his own opening statement, but District Judge Katherine Forrest rejected the request. The prosecution's first witness was Angelica Morris, whose husband was an imam at a Seattle mosque where, she said, al-Masri was the ""dominant ideological influence."" She testified that in 1999, the couple visited a sprawling ranch in Oregon where mosque members practiced using assault rifles, shotguns and handguns. There also were throat-slitting demonstrations, she said. Defense lawyer Jeremy Schneider sought to discredit the witness, suggesting that she had received money from investigators. Al-Masri was one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain, where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north London mosque and other terrorism-related charges. Born in Egypt in 1958, he traveled to Britain to study before gaining citizenship through marriage in the 1980s. A one-time nightclub bouncer in London's Soho district, al-Masri -- also known as Mustafa Kamal Mustafa -- has said he lost both hands and one eye while fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He often wears a hook in place of his missing hand. In 1997, al-Masri became the imam of a north London mosque, where his hate-filled speeches attacking the West began to attract national attention and followers. One of those followers was Richard Reid, the ""shoe bomber"" who attempted to blow up a Miami-bound passenger airplane three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ""a towering day in history"" and described bin Laden as ""a good guy and a hero."" He also described the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003 as ""punishment from Allah"" because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish.","Abu Hamza al-Masri stands trial on numerous terrorism-related charges .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities arrested a man suspected of taking part in a plot to abduct a prosecutor's father on behalf of a prisoner serving a life sentence in North Carolina, the FBI said Monday. The FBI's Philadelphia bureau took Jakym Tibbs, 21, into custody early Monday at a residence in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said. He was expected to appear in federal court in Harrisburg later in the day, Lynch said. The FBI had offered a $25,000 reward for Tibbs and Quantavious Thompson, 18. Thompson was arrested last Wednesday and is scheduled to be in court later this week. ""It is too soon to determine whether the reward offered played a role in his capture. The investigation into the kidnapping of Frank Janssen from his home in Wake Forest, North Carolina, is ongoing,"" Lynch said in a statement. Tibbs' apprehension marks the seventh arrest in the April 5 abduction of Janssen. He was rescued by police five days later at an apartment in Atlanta. The kidnappers sent demands to Janssen's family ""for the benefit"" of Kelvin Melton, an inmate at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant related to criminal complaints against the defendants. Janssen's daughter, Colleen Janssen, is an assistant district attorney in Wake County and had prosecuted Melton, officials said. Melton is serving a life sentence without parole. Authorities said they traced a call to Melton's prison cell, from where he allegedly communicated with the kidnappers. The FBI said the group planned to kill Janssen and bury him at the apartment complex, which is near the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. CNN's Michael Martinez, Vivian Kuo and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","FBI: 2nd man arrested after $25,000 reward issued in two-state kidnapping plot .

"(EW.com) -- For many, ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" remains Steven Spielberg's most indelible film, holding a special spot in moviegoers' hearts. (I know it does for me.) But when the movie was re-released in theaters in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, Spielberg tried to fix something that was not broken and ""updated"" the movie's visual effects. He gave E.T.'s face a CG makeover, added back in a couple deleted scenes, and -- most controversially -- switched out the rifles held by police officers chasing down Elliott and his bicycle buddies with walkie-talkies. Fans cried foul. ""South Park"" mocked the decision. Last year, Spielberg himself even admitted he regretted making the changes, vowing that the Blu-ray release would just be the 1982 theatrical version of the film. And by gum, it's exactly that. As you'll see in the trailer for the 30th-anniversary Blu-ray edition of the film, out this October, those walkie-talkies are no more. While the Blu-ray won't have walkie-talkies, it will have two new bonus featurettes, one chronicling the day-to-day events of making the movie, the other a new interview with Spielberg reminiscing about the movie. Those two deleted scenes will be available separately from the cut of the film, and many of the bonus features from the previous DVD release of ""E.T."" will be available on the Blu-ray as well.

"LILONGWE, Malawi (CNN) -- Like most African countries, Malawi has suffered from a severe shortage of nurses and key health workers. Godfrey Mdzudzuma, a nurse at Embangweni Mission Hospital, delivers a baby in the maternity ward. In the past, workers in the tiny southeast African nation of just 13 million inhabitants have been lured abroad by the promise of higher wages and better working conditions. But, the country best-known as the homeland of Madonna's adopted children now has another claim to fame: It has succeeding in halting -- at least for now -- its crippling brain drain of nurses. Malawi's solution? To expand educational opportunities for nurses at all levels and keep them out of poverty by paying modestly more money. Countries don't come much poorer than Malawi, but its healthcare system worked well back in the 1970s and early 1980s. When the former British colony gained independence in 1964, president Hastings Banda, himself a physician, maintained a high level of training for nurses that included teaching all classes in English. By the late 1990s, however, Malawi was reeling from the AIDS epidemic. As if that weren't bad enough, the government also had to cut spending on health care and education as a condition for getting help from the U.S. and other countries to liberalize its trade and economy. The publicly funded health system, on which more than 95 percent of Malawians still depend for treatment, quickly started to fall apart. Watch a report about the impact of Malawi's nursing shortage » . Registered nurses began leaving in droves. ""Every day I received reports from Nurses' Council that so many nurses are now at the airport,"" Ann Phoya, the former head of nursing services for all Malawi told CNN. ""It was obvious that we needed to do something drastic."" Phoya worked with others in Malawi's Ministry of Health (MOH) to come up with an emergency plan that focused on nurses as they provided most of the primary care. The MOH then applied for around $160 million (£100 million) in international funding for their six-year initiative, primarily from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. The money was to be used to pay higher salaries to nurses -- quite a radical move in global development as donors worry it is unsustainable in the long haul. However, the situation in Malawi was getting desperate. The gamble paid off: The number of registered nurses leaving Malawi fell from a high of 111 (the equivalent of two years of Malawi's entire nursing graduates) in 2001 to just six in the first half of 2008. Enrollment at Malawi's nursing schools jumped up by 50 percent. Success in one area has revealed a different problem -- that of an internal brain drain. As more international aid groups and universities set up health programs in Malawi, they are hiring nurses, all trained at Malawi taxpayer expense, away from publicly funded hospitals and clinics. The problem is even more acute in the rural areas, where most of Malawi's people live. Embangweni Mission Hospital in northern Malawi has a good reputation but is located at the end of a long, dusty road, far from major towns, let alone cities. ""Young nurses with families do not really want to work here,"" said Catherine Mzembe, head of nursing at Embangweni. ""The local market is very small and although the hospital has running water, that is not the case in many homes."" Even so, the hospital has made impressive strides in the past five years preserving mothers' lives during pregnancy, as well as cutting the number of deaths due to malaria among children and adults. And that is perhaps the most important lesson to draw from Malawi's efforts: it pays to look at how much has been accomplished with so little.","Malawi's innovative national program lifts nurses out of poverty .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've detained the father-in-law of one of the country's most wanted drug lords. Police Tuesday morning detained Ines Coronel Barreras, 45, on drug-related charges, officials told reporters. He is the father-in-law of Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, authorities said. In January, the U.S. Department of the Treasury described Coronel as a ""key Sinaloa cartel operative."" Weapons and packets of marijuana were seized in Tuesday's operation, but no shots were fired, said Eduardo Sanchez Hernandez of Mexico's interior ministry. Authorities said Coronel is the father of Guzman's third wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, whom he married in 2007. Guzman's nickname, which means ""shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug business. The Sinaloa cartel is one of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking operations, and Forbes has estimated Guzman's net worth at $1 billion. U.S. authorities arrested a woman believed to be Guzman's daughter in October. She was deported in December after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa. Coronel's arrest is one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The high-profile arrest comes two days before U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Mexico.

"(CNN) -- The Australian government has announced plans to establish the world's largest protected marine area in the Coral Sea. The proposed Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve will cover 989,842 square kilometers (around 380,000 square miles) -- an area roughly one tenth the size of the U.S. ""Australia's vast oceans provide a source of food and resources, and are a place of recreation. But we cannot afford to be complacent,"" Australia's environment minister Tony Burke said. ""In the space of one lifetime, the world's oceans have gone from being relatively pristine to being under increasing pressure. ""The environmental significance of the Coral Sea lies in its diverse array of coral reefs, sandy cays, deep sea plains and canyons. It contains more than 20 outstanding examples of isolated tropical reefs, sandy cays and islands,"" he added. The Coral Sea is located off Australia's northeast coast and stretches from the Great Barrier Reef to Papua New Guinea in the north and the Solomon Islands in the east. Its shallow reef systems, say the Australian government, support tropical ecosystems abundant in hard and soft corals, sponges, algae, fish communities and other creatures such as nautilus and sea stars. The largely uninhabited islands also support critical nesting sites for green turtles and a range of seabird species. Watch Philippe Cousteau on CNN's Going Green . Protect Our Coral Sea -- a environmental campaign group supported by several conservation organizations -- described the announcement as ""a good start,"" but said the plans fall short of full protection for coral and marine life. ""Only the eastern half of this ocean treasure has been set aside as a safe haven for marine life. The western half contains most of the species-rich coral reefs and critical spawning sites for black marlin and threatened tuna,"" Darren Kindleysides from the Australian Marine Conservation Society said in a statement. There now follows a 90-day public consultation period which the government says will assist in finalizing the proposals.","Australian government announces plan to create world's largest marine reserve .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona stayed five points clear of arch-rivals Real Madrid as both secured away wins in Spain's La Liga on Saturday. Barcelona reached 50 goals for the league season as Pedro Rodriguez scored in the narrow 1-0 win over Sporting Gijon. Real, who were missing the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, kept pace as Karim Benzema scored twice in the 3-1 win over Deportivo La Coruna. Esteban Granero headed Real ahead after 13 minutes in the Riazor where Real had not won for nearly 20 years. Striker Raul went close for Real with a volley before midfielder Guti produced a moment of magic to set up Benzema for his first. Bearing down on goal, he opted to backheel the ball into the path of Benzema who shot home. Deportivo, who are challenging for a Champions League place pulled one back with a late Ivan Riki penalty, but Benzema sealed the three points in injury time. ""I'm very happy for the win because traditionally it's a very difficult ground for Real Madrid. The team have played a very good game and we are pleased,"" said Real coach Manuel Pellegrini. But defending champions Barcelona are keeping up a fierce pace and in an earlier match saw Pedro put them ahead on the half hour mark as Andres Iniesta played him through with a fine pass. Barca should have added to their tally in the second half but Pedro and Lionel Messi both missed comfortable chances. In other matches on Saturday evening, a Luis Garcia strike saw relegation strugglers Espanyol beat European aspirants Athletic Bilbao 1-0.

"(CNN) -- In my travels around the world I have noted how attitudes toward women are a pretty accurate weather vane indicating what is happening in the wider politics of a country. In visits to Turkey in the past three years I saw rising anxiety about razor-sharp divisions between the secular and those who want a society where women ""breed"" for their country and wear the hijab. In May, Turkish women's rights activist Efsa Kuraner e-mailed me from Istanbul, ""Things are fast going down the plughole, it's pretty depressing. The Islamic twist is becoming suffocating with how the prime minister keeps trying to cajole women to stay home and have three to five children. They are offering early retirement to women for having upwards of three kids..!! Divorce is frowned upon. Abortion is all but banned. Only there in name. I am afraid darker days are yet to come."" Her predictions were prescient. The divisions have now cracked wide open. A peaceful protest by Istanbulites against plans to chop down ancient trees and transform the city's largest public park, Gezi Park, into a large shopping mall has erupted into a far wider protest. BBC reports say the unrest has spread to 60 cities and towns across Turkey, including the political capital Ankara and popular tourism centers of Bodrum, Konya and Izmir. Is Gezi Park Turkey's Tahrir Square moment? On Saturday I received an e-mail with an eyewitness account from a women's organization with offices in the heart of Istanbul. It read: ""Three days ago at midnight bulldozers charged into Gezi Park, home to century-old trees. Concerned citizens quickly shared this information on Facebook, Twitter (#direngezipark,  #occupygezi), Instagram, and other social media, and numerous other people joined them to stop the destruction. From then on, protesters have been occupying Gezi Park day and night, despite being attacked by police forces with pepper gas and high-pressure water jets."" Opinion: Why Turkey's protests are no Arab Spring . Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for some time been alienating his liberal supporters. He seems out of touch. Last year, he characterized abortions and even cesarean sections as ""secret plots"" to hinder the country's growth. In January, Erdogan called on Turkish women to have ""at least four or five children"" in the name of the country's ""grandeur"" and faster economic growth. He assigned four government ministers to work on population policy and proposals for family expansion. The prime minister's Justice and Development Party has its roots in political Islam, but Erdogan insists he is committed to Turkey's secular state. The protesters, unconvinced by his claim, are waving flags emblazoned with photographs of past President Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, who, beginning in 1923, began Turkey's transition from Ottoman Empire into modern, Western-style secular state with a program of political, economic and cultural reform. Thousands of new schools were built, and primary education was made free and compulsory. AtatÃ¼rk's message to the 1935 International Alliance of Women - Congress in Istanbul was: ""The exercise of civil and political rights by women is a necessity for the happiness and prestige of humankind."" The Turkish media appear slow to respond to the events of the past few days. Kuraner e-mailed me on Monday: ""....total black-out of Turkish media. ... we are quite speechless. ... never seen the media of any country remain soooo silent while a mini revolution was raging all around. ... a supposed democratic country that is!!"" After winning three elections, Erdogan has grown overconfident. Many complain about his increasing authoritarianism. He is scheduled to leave Turkey this week for a four-day visit to North Africa. Some hope he won't return and will step down so things won't escalate. Erdogan has been in power since 2002. His electoral success was mainly due to the economy; Turkey is the sixth biggest economy in Europe. The decade of rule of Erdogan's AK party has coincided with a time of prosperity. Per-capita income has tripled, exports have increased nearly tenfold and Turkish banks are in good health. The opposition parties (save the Kurds) have until now been weak and divided. The challenge to both the protesters and the government is to achieve change through the ballot box, not though police brutality nor the bullet. The Turkish government's future policies toward women will be an indicator of the future direction the country will take. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lesley Abdela.","Lesley Abdela: Treatment of women a good weather vane for wider state of politics in Turkey .

"(CNN) -- The life of a jockey is far from glamorous -- a world away from the confines of the rarefied, hushed atmosphere of London's National Portrait Gallery. It's a life of blood, sweat and mud-splattered silks and it's also a hazardous profession, with jockeys at frequent risk of serious injury. That gritty reality has been key to a photograph of jockey Katie Walsh winning a prestigious portrait competition featuring esteemed subjects like former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan. British photographer Spencer Murphy took the award-winning picture of Walsh -- sister of famed Irish jockey Ruby Walsh and the daughter of trainer Ted Walsh -- during a promotional shoot at Kempton racehorse. Walsh is pictured in the colors of the racehorse Seabass, who she rode to third in the 2012 Grand National steeplechase at Aintree. ""I wanted to show both her femininity and the toughness of spirit she requires to compete against the best riders in one of the most demanding disciplines in horse racing,"" Murphy, 35, said in a statement after picking up the $19,000 Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize. ""I chose to shoot the series on large format film, to give the images a depth and timelessness that I think would have been hard to achieve on a digital camera."" It was a sweet success for Murphy, who was awarded third place in last year's competition.

""In my mind it was clear what I wanted to do,"" said Abrar, who had previous experience of photographing Annan, ""and this portrait took literally three minutes!""

"(CNN) -- A mysterious, circular structure, with a diameter greater than the length of a Boeing 747 jet, has been discovered submerged about 30 feet (9 meters) underneath the Sea of Galilee in Israel. Scientists first made the discovery by accident in 2003 using sonar to survey the bottom of the lake but published their findings only recently. ""We just bumped into it,"" recalls Shmuel Marco, a geophysicist from Tel Aviv University who worked on the project. ""Usually the bottom of the lake is quite smooth. We were surprised to find a large mound. Initially we didn't realize the importance of this but we consulted with a couple of archaeologists, and they said it looked like an unusually large Bronze Age statue."" The structure is comprised of basalt rocks, arranged in the shape of a cone. It measures 230 feet (70 meters) at the base of the structure, is 32 feet (10 meters) tall, and weighs an estimated 60,000 tons. It is twice the size of the ancient stone circle at Stonehenge in England. Its size and location, say Marco, who also took video of the structure during a scuba dive to examine it, indicated it could have been constructed underwater as a type of fish nursery. However archeologists think it more likely it was built on dry land and later submerged by the lake. ""From a geophysical perspective, it is also important to the history of the lake, because it means the water level was lower than it was today,"" says Marco. According to Yitzhak Paz, the archeologist who led the study, the fact that the structure is underwater has made it a particularly difficult study. ""If the site was inland, it would be much easier to investigate. By now we would have excavated, but because it's submerged we haven't yet been able to. It is a much harder process, both physically and financially. It is very expensive to raise support for such an enterprise."" Watch: Bringing ancient Babylon back from the dead . The exact age of the structure has been difficult to pinpoint, but calculations based on the six to ten feet (two to three meters) of sand that have accumulated over the bottom of the base -- sand accumulates an average of one to four millimeters per year -- as well as comparisons to other structures in the region, put the estimate anywhere between 2,000 and 12,000 years old. The possible purpose of the structure is even more enigmatic. Dani Nadel, an archeologist from the University of Haifa, who partnered on the site, and who has led several prehistoric excavations in the region, notes it shares similarities with communal burial sites, though he's quick to discourage anyone from drawing a definitive conclusion. ""This is such a huge structure that it truly is something unusual. It could have been a big ceremonial structure, or a ramp. There could have once been statues on top of people in certain rituals. I mean, I'm really going wild here. The truth is we don't know how it was constructed, what its exact age is, how it was used, or how long ago it was used. We have several speculations, but we don't know much except that it's there and it's huge."" Despite the limitations of examining underwater ruins, Nadel says that once they do raise the funds to excavate, there is a good likelihood that their findings will be more complete than would be possible with a land-based structure. Read more: UAE's desert lake causes eco-controversy . ""Above land, many organic remains are decomposed by worms, and other creatures needing oxygen. Underwater, you don't have oxygen, so the process of decomposition is on a much smaller scale,"" he says. Nadel points to Ohalo II, a site he excavated near the Sea of Galilee that had been submerged for 23,000 years before a drop in water level made it easy to excavate. Ohalo II is significant because it was one of the best preserved prehistoric sites in the world. ""In most sites, you're lucky to find five or ten seeds. At Ohalo, we found 150,000. We learned a lot about the diet (of the inhabitants), what fish they were eating, what animals they were hunting. When a site is underwater it gives us the opportunity to see history in much more detail."" What archeologists are certain of is that the monument was likely of great importance to the people who built it. Marco notes that the nearest basalt outcrop was a few hundred meters from the site, and that the stones, which were three to six feet (one to two meters) in width, would have weighed over 200 pounds (90 kilograms) at times. ""We see a society that was capable of organizing the construction of such a large structure. It's unique to transport these stones and unique to arrange them. You need to plan and to mobilize people, because they're too heavy to be carried by a single person."" Nadel points out that given the harsh environment such a structure was a particularly impressive accomplishment. ""You have to imagine,"" says Nadel, ""these people were building something that was more durable than their brush huts.""","Ancient structure twice the size of Stonehenge found submerged .

"New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the slaying of a 32-year-old man in the Greenwich Village neighborhood early Saturday as a hate crime because the gunman made multiple anti-gay comments, they said. It is at least the fourth violent attack in two weeks believed to be motivated by anti-gay bias, police said. The suspect's anti-gay remarks were noted before the shooting took place, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. The man was seen urinating on the street outside a bar before going inside and making anti-gay comments to the bartender and brandishing a silver handgun. A little after midnight, the gunman and two other companions confronted the victim, Marc Carson, and another man he was with on the street. The suspect reportedly made anti-gay remarks and asked them whether they were ""gay wrestlers,"" Kelly said. Carson and the other man turned toward the taunts, but backed down and kept walking away. They didn't know it, Kelly said, but the suspect followed them. The gunman confronted the two men again, before shooting Carson in the face, police said. Carson was pronounced dead on arrival at Beth Israel Hospital. Around 4 a.m., a police officer, responding to a radio alert of the shooting, came across the alleged gunman and apprehended him. The suspect turned over a silver Taurus .38-caliber six-shot revolver, according to police. Police later identified the suspect as Elliot Morales, 33. Police said the suspect had forged identification and they used facial recognition technology to determine his true identity. Morales faces a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime, authorities said. The identities of the suspect's two companions -- at least one of whom Kelly said left the suspect before the shooting -- are still not known. Kelly said that the killing appeared to be ""a hate crime, a bias crime."" There were no words that would aggravate the situation, and the victim did not know the perpetrator, he said. According to Kelly, there have been 22 bias-motivated events this year. That's up ""significantly"" from 13 this time last year. On May 10, five men brutally beat two gay men near Madison Square Garden after the couple was denied entry into an after-hours billiards bar, according to Port Authority Police. The victims suffered severe facial injuries. Police were able to arrest two of the five men; the rest fled the scene. On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said. There was another attack on gay men on May 5, outside of Madison Square Garden following a New York Knicks game. One of the victims told CNN affiliate WCBS he believes the attack wasn't an isolated incident. ""There is no words to describe the pain, 'cause this was not an attack on us, this was an attack on all of us,"" he said. Kelly said authorities do not believe the acts are connected, but the investigations are ongoing. ""It's not a pattern,"" he said, ""but something that concerns us.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Thursday closed its criminal investigation of the deaths of two prisoners in CIA custody, ending a controversial investigation that Attorney General Eric Holder had approved more than a year ago. The investigation, conducted by veteran Justice prosecutor John Durham, examined alleged CIA interrogation abuses in connection with prisoner deaths at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003 and at a secret prison in Afghanistan in 2002. If the probe had led to criminal charges against CIA officers or contractors, it could have ignited a firestorm of objections by Republican lawmakers and the national security community. Holder acknowledged that he made a controversial decision to appointed Durham in 2009 to examine allegations of CIA interrogation abuses in about 100 cases. His aides say he was aware the Obama White House wanted the torture controversies put behind it, but Holder pressed on. Republican lawmakers and the CIA were upset about the new review of alleged detainee mistreatment. In June 2011, Durham concluded that nearly all of the allegations should not be prosecuted. However, he said he would look into two cases in which prisoners died while in custody. On Thursday, Holder said no charges would be brought in those cases. ""Assistant U.S. Attorney John Durham has now completed his investigations, and the Department has decided not to initiate criminal charges in these matters,"" Holder said in a written statement. While praising the work of the men and women in the U.S. intelligence community, he left unanswered whether he believes inappropriate actions were taken against prisoners during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Our inquiry was limited to a determination of whether prosecutable offenses were committed and was not intended to, and does not resolve, broader questions regarding the propriety of the examined conduct,"" Holder said. CIA Director David Petraeus sent a statement to all CIA employees marking the end of the investigation and ignoring the lingering controversies. ""As intelligence officers, our inclination, of course, is to look ahead to the challenges of the future rather than backwards at those of the past. Nonetheless it was very important that we supported fully the Justice Department in its efforts,"" he said.","Justice Department closes criminal investigation of alleged CIA abuses in 2002, 2003 .

"(CNN)  -- Lionel Messi grabbed a brilliant hat-trick as Barcelona routed Tenerife 5-0 on Sunday to maintain their two-point advantage at the top in the Spain's La Liga over arch rivals Real Madrid. Barca, who went into the late kickoff temporarily trailing Real, who had won 2-0 at home to Real Mallorca, made a slow start and might have been behind. Alejandro Alfaro had three good chances to put the hosts ahead but the Tenerife striker hit the crossbar on was denied twice by goalkeeper Victor Valdes. They were made to pay as World Player of the Year Messi scored the opener in the 36th minute after getting a pass from Bojan Krkic inside the area. Messi's free kick saw Carles Puyol head home the second in the 44th minute and on the stroke of halftime a move involving Andres Iniesta and Krkic set up Messi for the simplest of third goals. The Argentina international notched his 12th league goal of the season and his hat-trick with an impudent cruling chip over goalkeeper Sergio Aragoneses into the top corner. Ezequiel Luna completed the rout with an own-goal in the 85th under pressure from Pedro to leave Barcelona with 43 points from 17 matches. Real Madrid were totally dominant against a Mallorca side who had exceeded expectations to occupy fourth place in the Primera Liga going into the match. With freezing weather affecting the bulk of Europe, the match was played wintry conditions, with a snow being seen at a match in the Bernabeu for the first time in 30 years. But Real put on a performance to warm their fans huddled in the giant stadium, with Gonazalo Higuain putting them ahead with a stunning eighth minute strike as he cut inside to fire past Dudu Aoarte. The home side should have increased their advantage just before the break as Cristiano Ronaldo shot wide from an excellent position after a flowing home move. Higuain crossed for Esteban Granero to score Real's second on 50 minutes as he volleyed past Aoarte. Granero should have notched a clinching third soon afterwards as his fierce shot from a Kaka cutback was brilliantly turned away by Aoarte. Brazil star Kaka lasted just over an hour after an injury layoff before being replaced by Karim Benzema. Earlier, Valencia strengthened their grip on third place behind the big two with a 3-1 win at bottom club Xerez. The home team, who have just seven points after 17 rounds, looked set to spring a surprise when Carlos Calvo equalized Juan Mata's opener. But Valencia re-established their command with a goal from Spanish international star David Silva and a fine individual strike from Carlos Marchena sealed three points. Deportivo maintained their bid for a Champions League slot with a 1-0 win over Osasuna to go fourth. Juan Rodriguez scored the only goal of the game as he met Andres Guardado's cross in the 50th minute. Osasuna were down to 10 men when midfielder Javad Nekounam was red carded in the 67th minute. In the relegation battle, Malaga stretched their unbeaten run to 10 matches in all competitions but were held to a 1-1 draw by Athletic Bilbao. Fernando Llorente denied Malaga a deserved three points with a late penalty for Bilbao to earn a share of the spoil after Weligton's opening goal at the start of the second half.","Lionel Messi scores a hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-0 win over Tenerife .

"Washington (CNN) -- White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel used former President Bill Clinton as an intermediary last year as part of a failed administration effort to dissuade Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak from running for the U.S. Senate, according to a publicly released memorandum from the White House legal counsel's office. Top White House lawyer Robert Bauer conceded that ""options for Executive Branch service were raised"" for Sestak, but insisted that administration officials did not act improperly. He characterized the attempt to influence Pennsylvania's Democratic Senate primary -- ultimately won by Sestak -- as no different from political maneuvers by past administrations from both political parties. Key Republicans disagreed with Bauer's assessment. Several House GOP members sent a letter to the FBI Friday asking for an investigation. The White House was instrumental in last year's switch by Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter from the GOP to the Democratic Party. President Barack Obama backed Specter in his bid for a sixth term in the Senate, and the administration was eager to clear the field of any primary opponents. Bauer stated in the memo that efforts ""were made in June and July of 2009 to determine whether Congressman Sestak would be interested in service on a presidential or other Senior Executive Branch Advisory Board, which would avoid a divisive Senate primary, allow him to retain his seat in the House, and provide him with an opportunity for additional service to the public in a high-level advisory capacity."" Sestak would not have been paid for any advisory work, Bauer insisted. Emanuel ""enlisted the support of former President Clinton who agreed to raise with ... Sestak options of service,"" Bauer said. Sestak declined the suggested options, he said. ""Last summer, I received a phone call from President Clinton,"" Sestak confirmed Friday in a written statement. ""During the course of the conversation, he expressed concern over my prospects if I were to enter the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. ... He said that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had spoken with him about my being on a presidential board while remaining in the House of Representatives. I said no."" Bauer said that the White House, contrary to one widely circulated rumor, did not offer Sestak the position of secretary of the Navy. He noted Obama nominated Ray Mabus for the position on March 26, 2009, more than a month before Specter switched to the Democratic Party. Bauer insisted there was no impropriety in the White House's efforts. ""The Democratic Party leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the House,"" he wrote. The White House's attempt to keep Sestak out of the Senate race was ""fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements."" California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who has pushed for the appointment of a special prosecutor to examine the incident, vehemently disagreed with Bauer's conclusions. The White House ""has admitted to a misdemeanor ... and co-opted President Clinton"" in it, Issa insisted. ""Is Rahm Emanuel going to stay if in fact he violated the law?"" Clinton ""of all people would be held to a standard of knowing exactly where the line is,"" Issa said. ""If he crossed it, he crossed it knowingly."" Issa said that it is ""not the job offer [but] the quid pro quo. ... It's the 'I will give you this job to clear a primary.' "" Issa joined several other House Republicans in urging the FBI to investigate allegations of bribery. ""Assurances by the Obama White House that no laws were broken are like the Nixon White House promising it did nothing illegal in connection with Watergate. Clearly, an independent investigation is necessary to determine once and for all what really happened,"" they wrote in a letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller. Sestak, a former Navy admiral and two-term Philadelphia-area congressman, dismissed the GOP's allegations of wrongdoing, telling reporters that if he had thought something was wrong, he would have reported it. ""Washington, D.C., is often about political deals,"" Sestak said. He insisted that Clinton spoke to him only once about the proposal. Obama said Thursday that he can ""assure the public that nothing improper took place."" The president, however, refused to give any more details, even as some Democrats have demanded the White House be more forthcoming about the matter. Since Sestak's May 18 primary victory, Republicans have been relentless in keeping the controversy in the news. On Wednesday, all seven Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee called for a special prosecutor to look into the matter. One of the unpaid positions that the White House suggested offering Sestak was an appointment to the president's Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives the president independent oversight and advice. But it was determined that Sestak could not serve on the board, since he was an active a member of Congress. It appears that Emanuel picked Clinton as a go-between with Sestak because of the former president's stature as an elder statesman and prominent figure in the Democratic Party, and because Sestak worked on the National Security Council during Clinton's years in the White House. Sestak backed former first lady and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. According to a source at the State Department, Emanuel remains on a trip to Israel and is not expected to be back in the country until Monday. CNN's Dana Bash, John King, Suzanne Malveaux and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Sestak says Clinton spoke to him only once, insists nothing improper occurred .

"(CNN) -- Are clues to alleged murders hidden in tattoos on the right forearm of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez? Police and prosecutors have charged Hernandez, 24, with two counts of first-degree murder in the July 2012 killings of two men in Boston. They are now seeking the help of tattoo artists who may have inked him after the homicides. Hernandez is in jail awaiting trial in the separate 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. A grand jury indicted Hernandez last week in the 2012 shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, and he is to be arraigned on the new charges on May 28. ""Boston Police and Suffolk prosecutors are seeking assistance from tattoo artists who may have inked Aaron Hernandez in the aftermath of the 2012 homicides of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado,"" the Suffolk County district attorney said in a statement. The artists being sought for potential evidence are considered witnesses and are not accused of any wrongdoing, the statement said. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley has said de Abreu and Furtado were ""ambushed and executed"" while driving home along Shawmut Avenue in Boston's South End early on July 16, 2012. In addition to the two counts of first-degree murder, Hernandez has been charged with three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the district attorney said. The latter four counts reflect shots fired at three people, one of whom was wounded, inside the car that de Abreu and Furtado were in, Conley said. Conley said that Hernandez was driving an SUV that pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near a nightclub and that the former football star fired a .38-caliber revolver at them. Investigators are hoping to speak with the artist or artists who inked Hernandez with specific tattoos on his right forearm between February 2012 and June 2013, the statement said. During that time, Hernandez is known to have traveled to Hermosa Beach, California; Bristol, Connecticut; Palm Beach and Miami, Florida; Boston; and Rhode Island. ""In order not to taint any potential statements, authorities are not publicly describing the specific tattoos or the nature of the inquiry -- only that the artists may have made observations of evidentiary value in the pending Suffolk County murder prosecutions,"" the statement said. In the other case, Hernandez was charged with first-degree murder and weapons charges in connection with the shooting death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player, in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, about a mile from Hernandez's home. Lloyd was dating a sister of Hernandez's fiancee's. Anyone with more information is asked to contact Boston Police Sgt. Detective Marc Sullivan at 617-343-5839. Hernandez's jail visitors have included his fiancee and his cousin, Tanya Cummings Singleton, both of whom face charges in connection with the Lloyd homicide, court papers revealed in February. Last week, prosecutors announced that Singleton was charged with criminal contempt of court in connection with the de Abreu and Furtado slayings. She is to be arraigned June 2 on an additional indictment for criminal contempt of court.","Prosecutors seek tattoo artists who inked former NFL star between February 2012, June 2013 .

"(CNN) -- The mysterious, faceless green men have entered eastern Ukraine, looking much like they did last month in Crimea before Russia sliced off and swallowed that former province of Ukraine. What will President Barack Obama do now? Unlike Russia's Crimea invasion, the Ukrainian government is not rolling over as readily this time, vowing not ""to let the Crimea scenario repeat."" That is just what Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to justify an open military assault under the guise of ""protecting"" Ukraine's ethnic Russians. The possibility that war will break out is real. U.S. officials are convinced that the disciplined militias -- who have taken over government buildings in more than half a dozen Ukrainian cities, wearing no identifying marks on their uniforms -- are Russian special forces or ""paid operatives,"" deliberately stoking unrest, not part of a spontaneous groundswell of pro-Russia sentiment. Still, America's warnings of serious repercussions have fallen on deaf ears. With the crisis continuing to escalate, Obama can choose between four courses of action. 1. Stop making empty threats . Obama has repeatedly warned that ""there will be costs"" if Russia takes over Ukraine's territory. But that is exactly what Russia did. Efforts to line up European support for stern sanctions have faltered badly. The West's growl, its bark, seems increasingly toothless. The sanctions so far are underwhelming. Washington and its friends need to impose real sanctions and offer Ukraine real support, or else America's warnings will be meaningless. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry still give the impression, despite ample evidence to the contrary, that they think diplomacy and reasoning can dissuade Putin from pushing ahead with his goal to dominate Ukraine, fearing that harsh sanctions will provoke him. But one way to reverse the course is to exact a harsh economic and political cost while keeping open a way for Moscow to roll back. Obama must make a decision: If the U.S. is not ready to impose muscular sanctions, it's time to stop issuing threats. America's ""red lines"" risk becoming an international punch line. Feeble threats against Russia's ""incredible act of aggression"" are hurting the U.S., making it look like a paper tiger and making its friends more vulnerable. Grave warnings of consequences without consequences do more harm than good. 2. Decide where to build a moat . If the U.S. is not willing to take risks for the sake of Ukraine, it is time to decide what part of the map matters. After World War II, the U.S. came to a decision to reluctantly allow Soviet control of Eastern Europe while protecting the western side of the Iron Curtain. That was a cold calculation for which the people of Poland, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere paid a steep price. But it sent a clear message to Moscow to stop at the edge of that military and ideological barrier. Washington could just as coldly concede Ukraine, or part of it, to Russia and build a (figurative) moat around it or choose another place on the map to do that. The U.S. must decide how far is too far. It wasn't Crimea. Is it eastern Ukraine, western Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltic states? Opinion: U.S. giving Putin green light in Ukraine? 3. Consider military action . The chances that the U.S. will go to war over Ukraine are extremely small, but the option exists. If Russia unleashes its military power across the border, the folder marked ""military action"" will land on the table in the situation room. Wars are unpredictable and always bring unexpected consequences. Fighting on the border of the European Union will put NATO on high alert and trigger a new set of possible outcomes. If Ukraine and Russia go to war, the calculations will change drastically and dangerously. 4. Say goodbye and good luck to Ukraine . There's one more option for Obama. He can turn his back on Ukraine, wish it well and move on. The U.S. could make a decision that it would rather try to continue working with Putin on issues like Iran and Syria, and allow Russia to do what it wishes in ""its part"" of the world. It's a course of action that would satisfy American isolationists, as well as those who accept Russian claims that the troubles are America and Europe's fault. That, unfortunately, would invite even more challenges to world peace, as it would empower bullies everywhere. American policy aims, unsuccessfully, toward option No. 1, but the threats are far ahead of the action. Several weeks ago, I suggested that there was a chance that ""when the stakes grow high enough, the U.S. and Europe may rise to the challenge."" That may yet happen. But so far it has not. Putin's platoons of masked green men are wreaking havoc in Ukraine, and the U.S. still hasn't quite decided how it plans to respond. In the long run, Russia will suffer from the ill will it has engendered with its bullying tactics. But in the short and medium term, it is gaining ground.","Frida Ghitis: What will President Obama do about the Ukraine crisis?

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Trader Jerome Kerviel was found guilty of all charges Tuesday for betting 50 billion euros ($61 billion) of a French bank's money without its knowledge. The judge sentenced Kerviel to a five-year sentence but suspended two years of it, meaning he will serve three years in prison. He was also ordered to pay 4.9 billion euros ($6.75 billion) in damages to the bank. Kerviel was not immediately jailed and left court after the verdict and sentencing. Kerviel, a former employee of French bank Societe Generale, went on trial in June on charges of forgery, breach of trust and unauthorized computer use. The banks says the unhedged bets cost it almost $6 billion. The damages he was ordered to pay was far more than prosecutors had asked. It was thought before the verdict that Kerviel would face a fine of as much as 375,000 euros (about $460,000). Kerviel's lawyer, Olivier Metzner, called the verdict ""unreasonable"" and said he planned to appeal. He has 10 days in which to do so. Kerviel had pleaded guilty to the charge of computer abuse, but Metzner had asked jurors in his closing arguments to acquit his client of the charges of breach of trust and forgery. Metzner previously told CNN that Kerviel's behavior was strongly influenced by the environment at Societe Generale. ""The banks are the ones to blame for the banking system and the systematic economic crisis, not Jerome Kerviel,"" he said. Kerviel traded European index futures for the bank. He was the only person ever charged in the case, despite claiming he did everything with the knowledge of his superiors. ""I am convinced the criminal file is full of elements proving that my superiors knew and covered for me. At least I shouldn't be the only one in the dock,"" he told CNN after the release of his memoirs, ""Trapped in a Spiral: Memoirs of a Trader"" in which he pleads his innocence. ""During three years, these managers earned colossal amounts of money out of bonuses based on the ever-growing results that I was making for the bank,"" he said. Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI on Monday said he plans on resigning the papal office on February 28. The following is the full text of Benedict's declaration: . Dear Brothers, . I have convoked you to this Consistory, not only for the three canonizations, but also to communicate to you a decision of great importance for the life of the Church.

I am well aware that this ministry, due to its essential spiritual nature, must be carried out not only with words and deeds, but no less with prayer and suffering. Papal resignation: What happens next? However, in today's world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me. For this reason, and well aware of the seriousness of this act, with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome, Successor of Saint Peter, entrusted to me by the Cardinals on 19 April 2005, in such a way, that as from 28 February 2013, at 20:00 hours, the See of Rome, the See of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a Conclave to elect the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is. Sorrow and surprise as Pope steps down . Dear Brothers, I thank you most sincerely for all the love and work with which you have supported me in my ministry and I ask pardon for all my defects. And now, let us entrust the Holy Church to the care of Our Supreme Pastor, Our Lord Jesus Christ, and implore his holy Mother Mary, so that she may assist the Cardinal Fathers with her maternal solicitude, in electing a new Supreme Pontiff. With regard to myself, I wish to also devotedly serve the Holy Church of God in the future through a life dedicated to prayer. From the Vatican, 10 February 2013 .

"(Mental Floss) -- People have been eating pickles ever since the Mesopotamians started making them way back in 2400 B.C.E. Here are some even more important things you should know about them. Pickles have gotten credit for health and beauty and winning football games. 1. In the Pacific Islands, natives pickle their foods in holes in the ground lined with banana leaves, and use them as food reserves in case of storms. The pickles are so valuable that they've become part of the courting process, helping a man prove he'll be able to provide for a woman. In Fiji, guys can't get a girl without first showing her parents his pickle pits. 2. Cleopatra claimed pickles made her beautiful. (We guess it had more to do with her genes.) 3. The majority of pickle factories in America ferment their pickles in outdoor vats without lids (leaving them subject to insects and bird droppings). But there's a reason. According to food scientists, the sun's direct rays prevent yeast and mold from growing in the brine. Mental Floss: 8 disastrous product names . 4. In the Delta region of Mississippi, Kool-Aid pickles have become ridiculously popular with kids. The recipe's simple: take some dill pickles, cut them in half, and then soak them in super strong Kool-Aid for more than a week. According to the New York Times, the sweet vinegar snacks are known to sell out at fairs and delicatessens, and generally go for $.50 to a $1. 5. Not everyone loves a sweet pickle. In America, dill pickles are twice as popular as the sweet variety. 6. The Department of Agriculture estimates that the average American eats 8.5 lbs of pickles a year. 7. When the Philadelphia Eagles thrashed the Dallas Cowboys in sweltering heat in September 2000, many of the players attributed their win to one thing: guzzling down immense quantities of ice-cold pickle juice.

In his famous 1492 voyage, Columbus rationed pickles to his sailors to keep them from getting scurvy. He even grew cucumbers during a pit stop in Haiti to restock for the rest of the voyage. 9. Speaking of people who get credit for discovering America, when he wasn't drawing maps and trying to steal Columbus' thunder, Amerigo Vespucci was a well-known pickle-merchant. 10. Napoleon was also a big fan of pickle power. In fact, he put up the equivalent of $250,000 as a prize to whoever could figure out the best way to pickle and preserve foods for his troops. 11.

"(CNN) -- When TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in 1996, it took more than a year to recover the bodies of all 230 passengers and crew. After suicide hijackers destroyed the World Trade Center in 2001, it took a decade or more for investigators to identify the fragmentary remains of some of those killed. Some have never been identified. And when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon burned and sank off Louisiana in 2010, the bodies of 11 men were never found. At a memorial service two months later, each family was presented with a bronze hardhat to represent their loss. Now, it's the loved ones of the 239 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 who face what one expert called the ""unspeakable challenge"" of grieving for someone whose final resting place may never be found. They ""will have to reconcile what is for most of us unimaginable,"" said Ken Druck, a psychologist who specializes in aiding disaster survivors. ""They will have to somehow find a way to put their minds at peace, to let go of the idea that the body of their loved one is going to be recovered,"" he said. ""Or there may be bits and pieces of things that are recovered, but there is a chance that they may not. And it may not ever be enough or satisfying, and they're going to have to find peace in some other way."" Heidi Snow, whose fiance was killed on the TWA jet, said one of the hardest moments for her was when authorities closed the center that assisted families before the body of her fiance, Michel Breistroff, had been found. China treads carefully amid anger and grief of relatives . ""I had to go home and go back to life as normal, but it was not normal,"" Snow told CNN's ""New Day."" ""You kind of have to start all over again, and also start again with the grieving process without really having hope to hold on to, but also not really having concrete evidence either that they're gone,"" she said. ""So there's still that moment of fluctuating back and forth, and still holding out some hope."" Snow is now the head of AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, or ACCESS, which offers counseling and help to the surviving relatives of crash victims. Authorities are now combing thousands of square miles of the Indian Ocean in search of the wreckage of Flight 370. The Boeing 777 has been missing since the early-morning hours of March 8, and Malaysian authorities declared Monday that it had most likely been lost with all aboard in the remote sea far off Australia. Best lead yet? Satellite spots possible debris . Most of the passengers on the Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing flight were Chinese, some sole sons or daughters under China's longstanding one-child policy. Others were mothers and fathers themselves. Cheng Li Ping, whose husband interrupted a vacation in Malaysia to return to Beijing for business, said she hasn't been able to bring herself to tell her two young sons that daddy may not come home. Mystery surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy . ""I have no courage,"" she said. ""Every day, I am scared to call my sons because once I call them, they will cry out ""Daddy, Mummy,"" and my heart can't handle it. I don't want to hurt my children."" Judy Ho, a clinical psychiatrist, said the families had been asked to keep their hopes up before Monday -- ""and even as the confirmation came, there is no definitive evidence."" ""That's even harder for the families to put an end point to this journey for themselves,"" Ho said. Text fail when delivering tragic news . Druck said families of Flight 370 are stuck in a state he called a ""living loss,"" trying to make sense of the few bits of information that are now known. ""It is grieving, except it's even more torturous in some ways, because we don't know whether they've died,"" he said. ""Our minds are like computers going wild in search mode, and yet we don't know what happened. But at the same time, they're coming to some degree of resignation that they will most likely have to go on and spend the rest of their lives without someone they love."" Druck founded a grief-counseling group, the Jenna Druck Foundation, after his daughter was killed in a 1996 bus crash in India. He worked with the families of the TWA crash and the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attack that brought down the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,700. Between 5% and 10% of the families the foundation has helped have had loved ones disappear, he said. And until the sea gives up its secrets, the families of Flight 370 will be facing the same woes. ""They will have to find a way to hold their loved ones in their hearts, good thoughts and prayers and allow that to be enough,"" Druck said. ""That's no easy task. But that is a challenge -- the unspeakable challenge -- that people who've had to endure this kind of loss must face, and it is attainable."" Your questions answered .

This great responsibility is our responsibility towards our nation. Our nation is a great nation. In over 5,000 years of civilization, the Chinese people have made indispensable contributions to human development. In recent history, our nation has suffered. The Chinese confronted its gravest moments. Since then, numerous Chinese patriots have waged hard struggle for the sake of a great revival of the Chinese nation, but time and again, they have failed. After the founding of the CPC, it has rallied and led the people, it made great efforts and turned the poor and backwards China into a new China, ever closer to the goal of national prosperity and strength. The great revival of the Chinese nation has thus embraced a bright prospect never seen before. Our responsibility is to rally and lead the whole party and the Chinese people from all ethnic groups, take up the historic baton, and continue working hard for the great revival of the Chinese nation, so that we will stand rock firm amongst nations of the world, and make fresh and greater contribution to mankind. This great responsibility is our responsibility towards the people. Our people are a great people. In the long course of history, the Chinese people, with our toil, courage and wisdom, have developed a beautiful homeland where all ethnic groups live together in harmony, and nurtured a splendid culture that is time-honored and forever new.

They hope for better education, more stable jobs, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, medical services with higher standards, more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment. They wish that children will grow better, work better and live better. The people's desire for a better life is simply the target of our endeavor. All happiness in this world can only be created with hard work. Our responsibility is to rally and lead the whole Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, in continuing to liberate our way of thinking, carry on reform and openness, further unleash and develop social productive forces, work hard to resolve the difficulties people face in both work and life. And stand firm on the road for prosperity for all. This enormous responsibility is our responsibility towards the Party. Our Party is the Party that whole heartedly serve the people. The Party has led the people in achieving accomplishments that has captured the attention of the world, we have every reason to be proud. Proud but not complacent, and we will not rest on our achievements. In this new environment, our Party is confronted with many severe challenges. There are many pressing problems within the Party that needs to be resolved urgently, especially the graft and corruption cases that occurred to some of the Party members and cadres, being out of touch from the general public, bureaucracy and undue emphasis on formalities -- they must be resolved with great efforts. The whole Party must be vigilant against them. To forge iron, one must be strong. Our responsibility is to work with all comrades in the party, to make sure the party supervises it's own conduct and enforces strict discipline, effectively deals with the prominent issues facing the party, earnestly improves the working style of the party and maintains close ties with the people. By so doing we will ensure that our party will always be the firm leadership core of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. History is created by the people, and people are the true heroes. The people are sources of our strength. We deeply know that the capability of any individual is limited, but as long as we unite as one, there is no difficulty we can not overcome. An individual only has limited time in office, but there's never a limit to serve the people heart and soul. Our responsibility is as heavy as Mount Tai, and our journey is long. We must always be heart-to-heart with the people, share the joy and challenges with the people, be united with the people and strive together with the people, work hard day and night, aim to deliver a satisfactory answer to history and the people. Friends from the press. China needs to know more about the world, the world also needs to know more about China. I hope that, in the future, you will continue to make efforts and contribution to deepen the mutual knowledge between China and countries of the world. Thanks to everyone.","Chinese Communist Party faces ""severe challenges,"" Xi says .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- At least 37 people died in rioting across Bangladesh after the leader of the country's largest Islamist party was sentenced to death on decades-old allegations of war crimes. Supporters of the Jamaat-e-Islami movement battled with police in several cities after 73-year-old Delwar Hossain Sayedee was sentenced to hang by a war crimes tribunal. The two-time member of parliament was convicted of eight of 20 counts involving killings and rapes during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. During that war, between 1 million and 3 million people were killed, and hundreds of thousands of women were raped. In 2010, Bangladesh set up a court called the International Crimes Tribunal to finally bring to justice those it accused in the massacre. Sayedee is the third of seven Jamaat party leaders to be charged with war crimes and the second to be sentenced to death. Tens of thousands of people, including many of those who fought for the country more than 40 years ago, celebrated the judgment against Sayedee. But furious Jamaat supporters rioted in Dhaka and other cities after the decision, leaving at least four police officers among the dead, police and other officials said. Police around the country fired gunshots and tear gas shells to disperse the mobs, who also exploded a series of homemade bombs. Most of the people were killed in the districts of Rangpur, Gaibandha, Satkhira, Thakurgaon and Chittagong. At least two of the police officers were beaten to death in the streets, while a bomb killed a pedestrian in Dhaka, authorities said. Monirul Islam, a Dhaka police spokesman, said two grenades were found near Shahbag Square, where thousands of people were celebrating the court verdict. The grenades, which were later defused, were found abandoned on the pavement near the five-star hotel Ruposhi Bangla, he said. Home Affairs Minister Shamsul Haque told reporters that the government has stepped up security nationwide. Paramilitary troopers have been called in to patrol the troublesome cities, and the government has imposed ban on rallies and gatherings in some districts. Since early February, widespread rallies have sprung in Dhaka's Shahbag intersection, with protesters calling for justice against war criminals and rejecting fundamentalism in politics. But Jamaat has called the Shahbag participants ""anti-Islamic atheists."" Increasingly, the Islamists are letting their presence known with larger and larger rallies and strikes first in cities outside Dhaka and then in the capital city. Violence has been reported with police firing shots and tear-gas to disperse mobs. Jamaat-e-Islami called a nationwide general strike Thursday to protest the trial, which it called ""politically motivated. Physically separated by India, Bangladesh had been the eastern part of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a war. Jamaat-e-Islami opposed East Pakistan's struggle for independence and has decried what it calls a smear campaign against it. CNN's Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.","Riots claim dozens of lives after an Islamist leader's death sentence .

"(CNN) -- Each day more than 55 million students attend the country's 130,000 schools. Each day, parents and guardians entrust some 7 million teachers with the education of our children. And on a normal day, that is all we expect teachers to do -- teach. But on those not-so normal days we are reminded that for six hours a day and more, five days a week, teaching is not the only thing teachers are charged with doing. On those not-so-normal days, we are reminded that teachers are also asked to be surrogate parents, protectors, heroes. Monday was one of those not-so-normal days. The nation watched in horror as a 2-mile-wide tornado with winds up to 200 mph tore through Moore, Oklahoma. As sirens blared and the ground shook, the full force of the twister hit Plaza Towers Elementary School around 3 p.m. It was full of students, young scared children who had nowhere to hide as the tornado ripped off the roof, sending debris everywhere. Heroes or just doing their jobs? Teacher save lives during tornado . ""We had to pull a car out of the front hall off a teacher and I don't know what her name is, but she had three little kids underneath her,"" a rescuer said. ""Good job teach."" And that teacher was not the only one whose body shielded children from harm. A couple of years ago, as state and local officials were looking for ways to cut spending, a study from the American Enterprise Institute emerged in 2011, asking a provocative question: Are teachers overpaid? Using abbreviated metrics -- such as comparing private sector employees' SAT and GRE scores with those of teachers -- the study's co-author Jason Richwine said the findings suggested that ""years of education could be an overestimate of cognitive skills."" A counterintuitive and insulting proposition. But in retrospect that shouldn't be too surprising considering Richwine's doctoral dissertation advocated keeping out immigrants with low IQs, which he maintained are lower than those of the ""native white population."" He also co-authored an attack on immigration reform for the Heritage Foundation. And he resigned as the group's senior policy analyst shortly afterward. Nevertheless, as educators in Chicago voted to strike and benefits such as tenure came under scrutiny, the question that study proposed sparked a national conversation and helped turn 2012 into a year in which teacher-bashing became a popular past time. But when I think of the importance of teaching in this country, when I think about the heroism demonstrated in Oklahoma, I find it impossible to overpay teachers. We can certainly talk about the realities of the economy, debate the best method to evaluate effectiveness and discuss the drawbacks of unions. But anyone who characterizes teachers as overpaid is forgetting what we entrust them with each and every day. Our children. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . On a normal day, you don't think about that too much. But on a not-so-normal day, that is all you can think about. Anne Marie Murphy, a mother of four, died trying to protect 6-year-old Dylan Hockley as Adam Lanza terrorized the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. When police found the two victims, Murphy was still holding Hockley in her arms. And five other educators did not run away from the threat but gave their lives trying to protect students, trying to protect children. How do you overpay for that? Obviously no parent or guardian drops their children off at school thinking tragedy is going to happen. But perhaps we should be grateful that if something terrible does happen, that there are these angels in the building who will do right by our kids. Who will give anything -- sometimes even their lives -- to protect them in our absence. One of the Plaza Towers teachers reportedly was lying on top of six students in a school bathroom to shelter them from the horrific storm. I'm sure that is not in the job description. So yes, it is fiscally responsible for a community to talk about loss of tax revenue and budget deficits. But we ought to be careful not to vilify this profession while doing so. Teachers are not glorified babysitters with summers off. Their profession fuels all others, and on a normal day that is amazing enough in and of itself. But on a day that's not so normal, we hope and pray that they are willing to do much more. And time and time again, in the face of terrible tragedies, we have learned that many of them do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Oklahoma tornado another case where teachers tried to shield kids from harm .
LZ: A report saying teachers are overpaid, union problems led to a lot of teacher bashing .
LZ: How could you overpay a teacher who risks or loses her life to shield kids?
We should not vilify teachers, he says. Even on a normal day, what they do is amazing enough ."

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Even though he can't set foot in the United States for fear of arrest, fugitive National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has joined the speakers' roster at this year's South by Southwest Interactive Festival. Snowden, who fled the United States in June with thousands of top-secret documents, will appear via teleconference Monday from Russia for a discussion about how the tech community must defend itself against mass surveillance. Snowden will chat with Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. ""The conversation will be focused on the impact of the NSA's spying efforts on the technology community and the ways in which technology can help to protect us from mass surveillance,"" an SXSW news release says. Audience members will be allowed to ask questions, and The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit media organization, intends to livestream the session. Josh Baer, a tech entrepreneur who has been attending the festival for more than 15 years, said he is excited to hear what Snowden has to say. ""The news and the government each have so many different perspectives,"" Baer said. ""It's always refreshing to get it straight from the source."" Hugh Forrest, director of SXSW Interactive, said it took more than three months to secure Snowden's participation and called it an essential part of this year's programming. ""The growth of social media has fueled so much of the growth of the online ecosystem, but the revelations from the summer of 2013 expose the costs and downsides of this growth,"" he said. Forrest added that Snowden ""wants to talk to a tech-focused audience about the importance of building the next generation of online tools that protect user privacy."" Privacy and government surveillance is a subplot of SXSW Interactive's programming this year, with other slated speakers to include journalist and civil liberties lawyer Glenn Greenwald as well as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Assange and Greenwald helped Snowden disseminate stolen NSA documents, and both will also appear via teleconference. Greenwald moved to Rio de Janeiro, the hometown of his domestic partner, David Miranda, and Assange was granted diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after Sweden sought to question him in connection with a sexual assault investigation. Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor who fled the United States after leaking details of the American government's spy programs, was granted temporary asylum in Russia last year. He faces felony charges of espionage and theft of government property in the United States, and has said he won't return until the U.S. changes its whistleblower-protection laws. ""Surveillance and online privacy look to be one of the biggest topics of conversation at the 2014 SXSW Interactive Festival,"" a festival statement says. ""As organizers, SXSW agrees that a healthy debate with regards to the limits of surveillance is vital to the future of the online ecosystem.""

"Pretoria (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius -- the standout athlete now on trial accused of the murder of his girlfriend -- plans to sell his Pretoria home ""to raise the necessary funds to cover his increasing legal costs,"" a statement on his website said Thursday. The house is where Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead in February 2013. Pistorius hasn't returned since her death, according to the statement. A prosecutor in the Pistorius murder case unexpectedly announced Wednesday that he expects to rest early next week. Pistorius, 27, could take the stand in his defense as early as next week if the case goes ahead as planned. He admits firing the shots that killed his girlfriend but has pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he thought she was a burglar and he believed he was acting in self-defense. The statement, issued by his media representatives, said the sale of his home was forced by an unexpected extension of the trial from the three weeks initially scheduled. ""It is important to note that Mr. Pistorius has been funding his own defence (sic) from the outset. Due to the delay in finalising (sic) the trial, the decision to urgently dispose of his single biggest asset, has had to be made,"" it said. The house has been kept sealed since it was handed back to Pistorius over a year ago, and the athlete ""cannot contemplate ever returning to live there again,"" it said. Some of Pistorius' neighbors on the estate have been key witnesses in his trial. The trial has also seen extensive photographs of the interior of the house, including the bloodstains found in the toilet room where Steenkamp was shot. The property, in the luxury Silver Woods Estate on the outskirts of Pretoria, was listed in an affidavit filed by Pistorius last February, only days after Steenkamp's death, as being worth 5 million Rand. That's around $465,000 at current exchange rates. Pistorius also listed ownership of three other South African properties of lesser value in the affidavit, as well as cash investments, ""household furniture and effects, motor vehicles and jewelery."" His occupational income on the affidavit was listed as about 5.6 million Rand a year. However, he has not competed professionally as an athlete since he was charged with Steenkamp's murder. Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Police used lasers to track gunshots .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A singer is being sought for questioning in connection with the death of a woman following a cosmetic procedure, police said Friday. Claudia Aderotimi, 20, died early Tuesday, shortly after receiving buttocks enhancements in a hotel room near Philadelphia International Airport, according to police. The procedure allegedly cost $1,800. Police say singer Black Madam -- whom they have identified as Padge Victoria Windslowe, 41 -- is believed to be the person who injected Aderotimi with a substance that was supposed to be silicone. Officers searched Windslowe's apartment for medical supplies, according to a search warrant. She was not home at the time, and authorities are looking for her. Aderotimi and three other women had traveled from England to undergo the cosmetic procedure in Philadelphia, police said. A woman who allegedly helped arrange the trip told police that ""Black Madam"" carried out the procedure, according to an affidavit. Shortly after the injection, Aderotimi became short of breath and complained of chest pains. She was rushed to a hospital, where she later died, police said. The preliminary cause of death has been linked to the injection, according to the affidavit. Underground cosmetic procedures have become a growing cause of concern for health regulators. Last month, New York officials arrested a woman for allegedly illegally injecting liquid silicone as part an underground business she ran out of her home, according to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. She allegedly charged more than $1,000 for a round of shots and faces up to three years in prison if convicted. Last year in New Jersey, state health officials launched an investigation into infections related to cosmetic injections after six women were hospitalized for complications. The women developed symptoms after injections for buttocks enhancement and received surgical and antibiotic treatment, according to the state health agency. All the injections apparently were administered by unlicensed medical providers. Investigators have had a difficult time tracking these procedures because they are performed by unlicensed providers. ""It's hard to tell how many people are utilizing that [type] of service,"" said Dr. Tina Tan, a New Jersey state epidemiologist. Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said. Not surprisingly, injecting these materials can result in serious health complications and death, she warned. ""In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized,"" she said, adding that injection procedures should be performed by licensed health providers. ""We do not recommend going in a hotel room with people who you don't know their credentials.""","A 20-year-old woman died this week after a cosmetic injection .

It's a marked change in tone and topic since March 2013, when she became infamous for sending Drake a lewd tweet. That July, after accumulating various run-ins with the law, Bynes was initially detained for a mental health evaluation when she was involved in a residential disturbance. That detainment turned into a psychiatric hold that lasted until December, when she was released into her parents' custody. Bynes' mother's lawyer, Tamar Arminak, said at the time that Bynes was continuing treatment as an outpatient several times a week, and was ""excited to be home ... and especially happy to re-establish a loving relationship with her parents.""

"(MNN.com) -- From not-so-sudden bouts of naughtiness to tips for safe pet travel, my dog Lulu inspires most of my columns. Her fun, frisky outlook on life inevitably colors my own. It's hard to be mad at that face, even when it has destroyed shoes, leather-bound books and countless dog beds. Thanks to Lulu, I take more time to enjoy the little things in life, such as cuddle time or endless shades of blue on display during our morning walks. Pets can teach us so many things, but only if we pay attention. Here are a few lasting lessons from pets that made news in 2011. 1. A dog's loyalty has no match . A massive earthquake caused a tsunami last March that eviscerated communities in Japan. Struggling to find signs of life in the ravaged community of Sendai, one camera crew discovered a dog carefully guarding its injured four-legged companion. That heartbreaking scene generated millions of views on YouTube and serves as a lasting reminder of one dog's loyalty â€” even in the midst of chaos. According to the Nippon Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Mei Chan, the Brittany spaniel that stood vigil over her injured friend, has been reunited with her guardian. The search for Lee Chan, the injured dog, continues. 2. Pets don't decide how much they will eat; people do . Lulu may gain a few extra pounds during winter months, but I try to keep her weight in check. She's much easier to handle at bath time when there's less junk in the trunk. Unfortunately, plenty of pets and people seem to be losing their battle of the bulge. A study by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention found that more than half of the cats and dogs in this country are overweight or obese. Weight gain can increase the risk for diabetes, a pricey and preventable health condition. Dr. Jennifer Monroe of Eagles Landing Veterinary Hospital in Georgia offers simple advice to correct this growing pet health issue: ""We have a responsibility to [pets] as their caretakers to make sure they stay healthy. The best way to make sure they stay healthy is to keep their weight in a reasonable range."" Grab a leash or some interactive toys. Pronto! MNN: 7 incredibly loyal dogs . 3. Love conquers all . For every happy reunion, countless military families cope with devastating loss. A Labrador retriever named Hawkeye placed that pain into razor-sharp focus during the funeral for his owner. Navy SEAL Jon Tumilson was one of 38 killed on Aug. 6 when a rocket-propelled grenade took out a U.S. Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan. During the funeral, Hawkeye approached Tumilson's casket and remained at his side until the end. 4. Breed-specific legislation breeds lawsuits . Pit bulls have received plenty of bad press, leading several U.S. cities and some states to ban the breed. Pit bull lovers argue that breed-specific legislation fails to punish negligent owners. Enforcing such bans also can be costly for taxpayers. The most recent example involves a pit bull named Snickers and his owner, disabled veteran Jim Sak. Although Snickers is certified with the National Service Animal Registry, Saks was forced to place his pit bull in a kennel due to a ban on the breed in his new hometown of Aurelia, Iowa. Saks and the Animal Farm Foundation filed a lawsuit, arguing that the Americans with Disabilities act does not prohibit pit bulls from being service dogs. A federal judge ruled in favor of the Saks, and now Snickers is going home. 5. The skies aren't quite so friendly for pets as cargo . Dogs, cats, snakes and hamsters take to the friendly skies on a regular basis. But horror stories like that of Jack, the JFK cat that never made his flight from New York to Los Angeles, still make me nervous about pets flying as cargo. Jack escaped when a clerk placed his kennel on another kennel and it fell, opening on impact. Over the next few months, concerned pet lovers took to Facebook with messages about the missing feline. Although Jack was found 61 days later, he was euthanized because of malnourishment and dehydration, which made him prone to severe infection and organ dysfunction.

In May of 2011, residents of Joplin, Missouri, faced one of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history. More than 120 people died and 1,000 more were injured. News reports that followed indicate that some residents may have ignored initial warnings. If you live in an area that's known for weather emergencies, act as soon as you hear a warning, says Toni McNulty, team lead for animals in disaster with HumanityRoad.org (@Redcrossdog on Twitter.) ""When pets sense urgency, they hide and you lose valuable time trying to find them,"" she says. Prepare an emergency plan that includes your pets. Keep food, health records, leashes, collars and crates ready at a moment's notice, along with emergency contacts. When disaster strikes, you must be your own first responder. 7. Your pets may outlive you . News that designer Alexander McQueen committed suicide shocked the world. In July 2011, BBC reported that the troubled artist had left $82,000 to care for his dogs. It served as a painful reminder that pets require care long after we are gone. Pet owners have several options for legally establishing long-term care, including a contract, will or pet trust. Several states also offer general guidelines for pet trusts. But the first and most important step involves identifying friends or family members who are up for the task of caring for your pets. MNN: How to include pets in your estate plans . ""Nobody likes surprises,"" says Atlanta attorney Steve Dubner, adding that your top choice isn't required to accept the responsibility. It also helps to create an emergency contact list that includes friends or neighbors who can quickly reach your pets. Carry a copy in your wallet or purse, just in case. 8. You're never too old to learn a few new tricks . Pet adoptions tend to spike during the holiday season. If you have a furry new addition to your home, start things off on the right foot with obedience training, regardless of the pet's age. ""Everyone needs to be working with the dog,"" says Kate Jackson of Jabula Dog Academy in Decatur, Georgia, who encourages the entire family to participate in training efforts. ""At home, the dog will only respond to who puts work into it."" Ask your vet to recommend obedience classes in your area or seek referrals for a reputable trainer. Starting early is the key to a long and happy relationship with your pet. MNN: Hiker and dog rescued from L.A. cliffside . 9. Seize the day, every day! For my Lulu, a simple tennis ball leads to hours of unspeakable joy. Too bad we all can't be that happy-go-lucky. Bookmark this link to the Happiest dogs on YouTube and watch it any time you need a mental lift. Then grab a tennis ball and seize a few minutes of playtime with your pet. Sure, the emails and to-do list will still be there. But they may just be a little more tolerable once you've rolled around on the floor with reckless abandon. 10. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . The American Pet Products Manufacturing Association estimated that pet owners spent more than $14 billion on veterinary care in 2011. A large portion of that bill goes toward treating preventable issues such as arthritis, diabetes and heart disease. To reduce the chance of unnecessary illness or injury, it pays to keep your pet mentally and physically stimulated. Dr. Arhonda Johnson, owner of The Ark Animal Hospital in Atlanta, offers this pearl of wisdom for a healthy 2012: ""The best way to keep pets out of the veterinary clinic is proper nutrition and exercise, just like with people. Feed them good, nutritious food and walk them regularly."" © Copyright 2011 Mother Nature Network .","Pets can teach us so many things, but only if we pay attention, the author says .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. marshal fatally shot a defendant in a Utah federal courtroom Monday morning after he rushed at a witness as his trial began, officials said. Siale Angilau, an alleged gang member charged with racketeering conspiracy, was shot several times at a Salt Lake City federal courthouse after Angilau attacked someone who was on the witness stand, Judge Tena Campbell said in a court document about the incident. He later died at a hospital after being shot in the chest, the FBI said in a news release. ""There were people yelling at him, telling him to stop, and he just didn't stop,"" Sara Josephson, who was in the courtroom, told CNN affiliate KSTU. ""He kept going forward with his furiousness."" The station quoted FBI Special Agent in Charge Mark Dressen, who said Angilau grabbed a pen and charged a witness. ""I believe he was shot in the chest multiple times,"" Dressen told KSTU. People were ducking behind benches, Perry Caldwell told the station. He said one person yelled, ""Get on the floor!"" ""He (Angilau) was falling as (the marshal) was still shooting him,"" Caldwell said. Witnesses told CNN affiliates that the witness was a prisoner who was testifying about his life in a gang. Angilau was the only person shot, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney for Utah. Campbell declared a mistrial, noting the shooting happened in front of jury members, who were ""visibly shaken and upset."" ""The court finds that this occurrence in the courtroom would so prejudice Mr. Angilau as to deprive him of a fair trial,"" Campbell wrote. Angilau was one of nine alleged members of the Tongan Crip Gang charged in a 2010 indictment with racketeering conspiracy. The indictment alleges Angilau committed several convenience store robberies in Salt Lake City and assaulted the stores' clerks from December 2002 to July 2007. Angilau was charged with several other crimes, including assaulting a federal officer. 2 women, gunman killed in Delaware courthouse shooting . 2013: Capital murder charges in killings of Texas prosecutors .

"(CNN) -- It may not be scenic and showy like Sydney, Australia's biggest city, but Melbourne is arguably the most rewarding of all Down Under urban destinations. The Lucky Country's second city is home to the buzziest bars, quirkiest cafes, best restaurants and most eclectic shopping, not to mention a stunning riverscape. Here are seven compelling reasons to visit Melbourne, as rich an Australian treasure, in its own edgy way, as Ayers Rock and the Great Barrier Reef. Wining and dining . Even Sydneysiders, as those residents call themselves, don't disagree that Melbourne boasts Australia's most happening restaurant scene. A huge melting pot of Italian, Greek, Vietnamese and other Asian immigrants has made fusion cooking an authentic local cuisine, and there is a plethora of affordable dining as well as fancier restaurants. As the food will never disappoint, head for one of the most hopping neighborhoods on any given night and hit the bistros du jour. There are great eats to be had in Fitzroy, notably Cutler and Co.; St. Kilda; Prahran; Carlton and South Yarra as well as in the little ""laneways"" of the Central Business District. Here, the Press Club and Vue de Monde in the iconic Rialto building represent the top-end aristocracy, and MoVida is a rising star. Picnickers, self-caterers and those who just want to ogle the world's most beautiful food should not miss a trip to Prahran market, also good for otherwise hard-to-find Asian ingredients. Retail therapy . Retail therapy is where Melbourne's neighborhoods come into their own. Sure, there's good fashion shopping in the city center -- notably Bourke Street, Collins Place and Swanston Street -- but much more eclectic offerings are just a tram-ride away. Check out Fitzroy's Gertrude Street and Brunswick Street and South Yarra's Chapel Street and Greville Street for cool, kooky, elegant and vintage finds, respectively. Expect to be waylaid by stylish housewares as well as locally designed garments and great accessories. A couple of names to look out for are Dinosaur Designs in South Yarra, where they make fabulous resin and glass earrings, and Market Import in Armadale for highly original decorative items for the home. Hit the Queen Victoria Market or smaller South Melbourne Market if you prefer to pick through stalls piled high with junk and treasures rather than browse shop windows. If the choice seems too overwhelming, narrow them down with the help of one of several savvy shoppers offering guided tours to small groups of fashionistas looking for the inside track. Art to admire and to buy . Art is everywhere in Melbourne, on the street as well as in slick galleries selling everything from newly fashionable aboriginal art to contemporary Western-style paintings, sculptures and installations. Don't miss the Blender Studios, a gallery and studio space dedicated to nurturing up-and-coming art. The National Gallery of Victoria in the heart of downtown is a great place to get an overview of Australia's fabulous landscape tradition, but you'll want to hit the sidewalks to see what the cutting edge is up to. The ""laneways"" of the CBD are the place to gallery-browse -- head for Flinders Lane and Little Collins Street, then just follow your nose -- and eyes. Gallery tours are offered by Jane O'Neill, whose Art Series hotels -- the Cullen, Olsen and Blackman -- are aimed at the arty set. But there are street art tours, too. Whether their schtick is old-school graffiti, stencil art or ""paste-ups,"" Melbourne's street artists are pioneers, and you may need a guide to help discover their best work. Getting caffeinated . The whole sophisticated Italian-Australian coffee movement started in Melbourne, which has so many iconic cafes, there's even a tour devoted to them. It starts at coffee-break time, natch, and guests move from one temple of caffeine to another with a reusable cup, tasting as they go. Food always comes into the mix in Melbourne, where most cafes have some little gourmet goody for a crowd drawn initially by the best beans and baristas but often lured to stay on by a little bit more. For those planning their own discovery tour, award-winners include Proud Mary in Collingwood (duck ravioli), Dukes in Windsor (ham and cheese toasties), Auction Rooms in North Melbourne, the Final Step in South Yarra and Seven Seeds in Carlton. Take in the water . The Yarra cuts its way through Melbourne and has thrown up a fabulous area for both nightlife and daytime strolling and grazing along its south bank. The new South Wharf Promenade has become the city's hottest drinking and dining destination, where hot names include the Sharing House, Meat Market and the Common Man. Although Melbourne feels like an urban, land-locked city, it actually has seaside life, notably in the delightful old suburb of St. Kilda, an easy tram ride from the city center. There's an interesting juxtaposition between the old-fashioned kibitzing cafes of Acland Street, where European retirees chew the fat every morning, and seafront joints like the Stokehouse, packed to the gills after sundown with the young downing pizzas and homemade cakes with a few frosties. Enjoy the architecture . Who needs an opera house that looks like a sailboat when your cityscape is punctuated by the best of 19th- and 20th-century architecture? The charm of Melbourne lies in a profusion of wonderful old buildings, including Victorian and Edwardian bungalows with porches and parapets edged in lacy wrought iron. There are also magnificent art deco edifices, like the Manchester Unity building on Collins Street and the nearby T&G building at the junction with Russell Street. Melbourne's art deco glory days center around the city's 1934 centenary, which generated a building boom cut short by World War II. When peace came, many iconic Victorian buildings were demolished in the rush for the new, but important relics of the old glory days include the Olderfleet and Rialto buildings, Block Arcade, the Gothic Bank, Hotel Windsor and a whole slew of government buildings. Stroll the streets on your own or enjoy an art deco heritage tour. Enjoy the great outdoors . Melbourne is surrounded by beautiful countryside, from the vineyards of the Yarra Valley to the laid-back beach towns of the Mornington Peninsula. Popular excursions include the resorts along the Great Ocean Road and Phillip Island, home to thousands of tiny penguins that waddle out of the sea to parade to their homes in the dunes as dusk descends. There are also koalas on Phillip Island, but these shy little creatures can be seen much closer to town at the Healesville Sanctuary, where they live in beautiful, natural bush alongside other iconic Australian creatures including wombats, kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils and the amazing duck-billed platypus.","Melbourne is defined by a melting pot of immigrants .

"(CNN) -- Nearly three-quarters of Americans say that the government wastes their tax dollars, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday also indicates that roughly half the public believes the tax system is unfair, and as a result, four in 10 say they're angry about the amount of taxes that they pay. Seventy-four percent of people questioned say that a lot of their tax dollars are wasted by the government; 23 percent say that some of their tax dollars are misspent and three percent say that not much of their tax dollars are wasted. Americans are split on their overall opinion of the country's tax system: 49 percent say it's fair and 50 percent say it's unfair, according to the poll. ""Six in 10 Democrats say that the tax system is fair,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Republicans are split down the middle, with 49 percent calling it fair and 51 percent thinking it is unfair."" Four in 10 questioned say that they are angry about the amount of taxes they pay; 36 percent say they're satisfied and just under one in four say they don't have particular feelings on the issue. Nearly half of Republicans questioned say they're angry, but that figure drops to 44 percent among Independents and 29 percent among Democrats. The poll indicates growing public frustration with taxes over the past couple of decades. ""This is a significantly higher level of anger than existed during the 1980s,"" Holland added. ""In 1985, only 27 percent were angry about the amount of taxes they had to pay, possibly a reflection of the tax cuts that Ronald Reagan instituted in his first year in office."" However, it appears that Americans aren't taking their anger out on the Internal Revenue Service. ""Only a quarter of all Americans think that the Internal Revenue Service should be abolished,"" Holland said. Six in 10 say that the tax cuts passed in 2001 under George W. Bush that are set to expire this year should be made permanent, according to the survey. The poll was conducted April 9-11, with 1,008 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Americans split on overall opinion of the country's tax system, poll says .

"RAYNHAM, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- It's a crisp New England day and Paul Monti is sitting in the backyard garden he built to honor the memory of his son, sipping coffee from his favorite Boston Red Sox mug, and nursing what he calls a ""morning cigar."" Sgt. Jared Monti always put others first, as a boy and as a soldier, his dad says. These are daily rituals that help him deal with his son's death three years ago, while serving the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. ""I come out here and sit on the bench and sit in the flowers,"" says Monti, a retired schoolteacher. ""This is where I get my solitude."" And that's when the stories start pouring out of this proud dad, stories about how Sgt. Jared Monti -- who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama on Thursday -- always had the instinct to help other people. There was the time that Jared was in high school and came home, to this house with the American flags flying on the porch, and asked his dad if he could cut down one of the spruce trees in the front yard. A single mom down the street in this tiny town outside Boston couldn't afford a Christmas tree, and Jared wanted to take care of her family for the holidays.  Watch more on the life and death of Sgt. Jared Monti » . Or the time that Jared was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and chipped in with a roommate on a $500 dining set for their apartment off base. One day the roommate came home and was infuriated to find the furniture missing. ""He said, 'Jared, where's the kitchen set?' "" recalls the dad. ""Jared said, ' Well, I was at one of my soldiers' houses today and his kids were eating on the floor and they needed the kitchen set more than we did. So we're going to have to find another place to play quarters.' So that's the kind of thing he did."" But even that kind of generosity pales in comparison to what young Monti did on June 21, 2006, in the rugged northeast corner of Afghanistan near Pakistan. According to a Pentagon account and CNN interviews with soldiers who were there, Sgt. Monti was leading a small patrol that was ambushed by dozens of Taliban fighters. As rocket propelled grenades flew past his head, Monti got on the radio to call for backup. Sgt. Clifford Baird was on the other end of the line. ""We could start hearing the RPGs and the small arms fire, and then that's when we started getting the calls over the radio to start giving them indirect fire support,"" says Sgt. Baird. ""Just needed as much firepower as we could give them and as fast as we could give it. ... I would definitely say he was calm. Definitely knew how to stay calm under fire."" In between his calls for help, Monti was using his own rifle to engage the enemy. Suddenly he noticed that a young private named Brian Bradbury was badly wounded, unable to move, desperately exposed to enemy fire. Another sergeant said he would run out and try to save Bradbury, but Sgt. Derek James heard Monti say no. ""I remember him saying that Bradbury was his guy, so he was going to be the one to go get him back and bring him back to us,"" says James. But with bullets flying, Monti had to take cover. He ran out a second time, but the enemy fire got more intense, so he stopped and yelled for help. Risking his life yet again, he then ran out a third time to try to save Bradbury. ""We knew he was going to get Bradbury -- then we all kind of heard him scream,"" recalls James. Monti was mortally wounded and knew he was dying. So his family was in his final thoughts, which still touches his dad back in Massachusetts. ""He said the Lord's Prayer and he said, 'Tell my family I love them,' "" recalls Paul Monti, struggling to control his emotions. ""And that's about the most meaningful thing that there is. That he thought of us in his last moments."" Inspired, his squadron beat back the enemy, thanks in part to the backup that Monti had calmly called for earlier. But then there was a terrible twist. A U.S. helicopter lowered a medic to grab Bradbury, the young private Monti had tried to save, in order to get him quickly to a hospital. As the two men were being raised into the air, a cable snapped. Bradbury and the medic plunged to their deaths. Paul Monti says it's frustrating that U.S. troops have never had the proper resources in Afghanistan. But he insists his son did not die in vain. ""He died doing what he felt he had to do,"" he says. ""It didn't matter the end result because that was him. He just did what the soldier's creed says: 'You never leave a soldier behind.' "" When Jared Monti was just a young boy, the family traveled to Washington and stood outside the White House gates to pose for a photo. As they return Thursday to honor their fallen son, Paul Monti is going through a mix of emotions. ""It's wonderful meeting the president and it's wonderful having my son receiving the Medal of Honor, but I would give all of it up to have my son back -- everything,"" he says, next to a shrine in the living room with some of his son's personal effects, including his uniform. ""There's nothing I wouldn't give. Even my own life to get my son back.""","Sgt. Jared Monti was posthumously awarded Medal of Honor on Thursday .

"Anaheim, California (CNN) -- Disney's Cars Land opens June 15 at Disney California Adventure, and it's big, bold and amazing. As Mater says, ""If I'm lying, I'm crying."" Kids of all ages will rev their engines and step on the gas. Cars Land is the capstone of a five year, estimated $1.1 billion dollar reimagining of Disney California Adventure. While Cars Land shifts California Adventure into the fast lane, only time will tell if it will save the town (as Lightning McQueen did for Radiator Springs) and turn Disneyland into the world-class destination it aspires to be. No doubt the top dogs at Disney hope the renewed focus on movie magic will mean magic for the resort that executives have admitted is not up to brand standards. Cars Land is the centerpiece to the relaunch of California Adventure. During the past five years, Disney has added more than 20 attractions, including Little Mermaid and Toy Story rides, upgraded hotels and new shops. The upgrades are important considering a big complaint about California Adventure was that the attractions didn't measure up to other Disney parks. It didn't have enough of the Disney magic: strong themes, characters and stories. Perhaps the main problem was that California Adventure was too nostalgic for the California of yesteryear, especially Paradise Pier. Nostalgia doesn't appeal to the younger audience. The makeover embraces the movie icons the younger generation has grown up with. Considering that Disney is rumored to have spent more for the relaunch than it cost to build the original park (which opened in 2001 and cost approximately $1 billion), everyone's expectations are going to be high. Along with Cars Land, other changes being unveiled on June 15 include the addition of Buena Vista Street, the new entrance to the park and a nostalgic look at Los Angeles in the 1920s and 1930s, when Walt Disney arrived. Again, it's not just nostalgic, but connected to the movies. The park's icon has changed from Grizzly Peak (a man-made mountain in the shape of a Grizzly Bear, California's state animal) to the Carthay Circle Theater, the theater where ""Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs"" debuted in 1937. ""Cars"" itself is a movie about nostalgia. Good old Route 66 with its zany cast of characters changes the brash Lightning McQueen into a racer with heart. Cars Land invites guests to cruise low and slow down the main street of Radiator Springs. Thankfully this is the version Lightning repaved. The major attraction is Radiator Springs Racers, but fans will also love Luigi's Flying Tires and Mater's Junkyard Jamboree. The estimated $200 million Radiator Springs Racers ride is a giant slot car system that also features elements that take place in the dark. The cars are electric, and work much like a gigantic version of the slot cars kids play with. This is the same technology that powers Test Track, an Epcot ride. After boarding the six-person car, you take a leisurely, scenic tour of Ornament Valley. Soon you enter a nighttime section, where you'll find old friends from Radiator Springs and have adventures including tractor tipping with Mater. Next, after an upgrade of tires or paint, and a quick visit to Doc Hudson, your crew chief, the ride turns into a thrilling race for Piston Cup glory. Disney has brewed a potent mixture here, a cross between the animated character fun of Peter Pan's Flight with the thrilling excitement of a 40 mph race through the desert. The scariest (and most fun!) part was when the car plunged through a wall of fog. This ride is destined to have long lines for years to come. (My kids went crazy, then immediately demanded to ride again.) Though not as thrilling as Radiator Springs Racers, Luigi's Flying Tires is still unlike anything you've ever ridden, unless you happened to ride Flying Saucers at Disneyland between 1961 and 1966. Or you have shrunken down and ridden on an air hockey puck. In this update of the Flying Saucers concept, giant tires float on a cushion of air supplied by a bunch of small air jets. Riders lean to make their tires move. Adding to the fun is a bunch of beach balls that riders can run into, poke and bat at each other. (Thumbs up from the kids.) Riders of Mater's Junkyard Jamboree sit in a cart mounted to a baby tractor and the tractors square dance to seven songs sung by Mater himself. (A simple ride, but it got big smiles from the kids). Cars Land spends a lot of time on the little details, including funny set decoration. There is excitement enough for the kids and humor for the parents. Also, Cars Land embraces an important ""Cars"" cast member that people forget, Radiator Springs itself. The movie wouldn't be the same without Route 66, Radiator Falls or the Cadillac Mountains. Cars Land really embraces the scenery, right down to the blinking stoplight. As Sally says in maybe the most poignant line in ""Cars,"" ""Well, the road didn't cut through the land like that interstate. It moved with the land, it rose, it fell, it curved. Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time."" Disney seems to be taking this to heart.","Updates to Disney's California Adventures open June 15 .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea announced Sunday that it reached a deal with the United States that allows Seoul to extend the range of its ballistic missiles, a move a senior security official says will deter military provocation from North Korea. The announcement from South Korean national security adviser Chun Yung-woo comes amid increased tensions between the two Koreas following Pyongyang's test firing in April of a long-range rocket, which exploded shortly after it was launched. The deal with Washington revised the range of Seoul's missiles from 300 kilometers (186 miles) to 800 kilometers (497 miles), Chun told reporters. ""The important goal in revising the missile pact is to deter armed provocation from North Korea,"" Chun said. ""If North Korea is to attack or provoke, we are able to incapacitate its nuclear and missile (capabilities) in the early stage. We have guaranteed various capabilities to protect the life and safety of our people."" At that range, the missile range would include North Korea's northern peninsula. Under the amended pact, South Korea also can increase its current restricted payload of 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), depending on the range of the missile. The plan allows for three times the current payload for ballistic missiles with a range of 300 kilometers. South Korea first agreed in 1972 to limit its missile range to 180 kilometers (112 miles) in exchange for access to U.S. missile technology. A bilateral agreement between the two countries was signed in 1979, though the guidelines were revised in 2001 to allow for a range of 300 kilometers. The two Koreas signed an armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean war, though a peace treaty was never signed. Technically, the two countries remain in a state of war. Roughly 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. New North Korean missile or parade float? North Korea test-fires 3 short-range missiles, Seoul says .

"New York (CNN) -- Controversial fashion designer John Galliano -- fired and convicted over anti-Semitic comments in 2011 -- is heading to a New York design classroom this spring. The former chief designer for Christian Dior will teach a three-day master class at Parsons The New School for Design. The class will give Parsons students an opportunity to learn from ""an immensely talented designer,"" according to a statement from the school. Galliano was fired from the fashion giant in March 2011 after making anti-Semitic remarks in Paris. Later that year, a French court found him guilty for making public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity. ""I love Hitler,"" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. ""Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead."" In his trial, he said that alcohol and drugs were major factors, which he realized during a stint in rehab after he was fired. Galliano apologized, saying, ""Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society."" He added: ""I only have myself to blame and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion."" Abraham Foxman, national director for the Anti-Defamation League, said Tuesday in a statement, ""I think it's time that John Galliano be evaluated on his skills."" ""He apologized, he repaired, he reached out. We should just move on. I think that's the fair thing to do. I'm delighted for Parsons and I'm delighted for him,"" Foxman added. Parsons acknowledged the controversy in its statement, saying, ""We believe that over the past two years, Mr. Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions.""

"(CNN) -- Democratic Senator Wendy Davis took to the floor of the Texas Senate at 11:18 a.m. in pink tennis shoes and began what she hoped would be a nearly 13 hour filibuster of an abortion bill. As the day went on, the story of Senator Davis' filibuster caught fire on Twitter, and by the evening it was trending worldwide. There were at least 730,000 total tweets about the filibuster on Tuesday. The excitement peaked at 11:58 p.m. central time, just two minutes before the midnight deadline, with 5,776 tweets per minute about the story, according to Twitter. Ultimately, after much confusion, it worked. Senate leaders tried to push a vote through, but didn't do so until a couple of minutes after midnight and, around 3 a.m., the state's legislature declared a special session over. It even caught the attention of the official President Obama Twitter account, which tweeted out ""Something special is happening in Austin tonight"" with a link to The Texas Tribune during the filibuster's ninth hour. Senate Bill 5 (SB 5) would ban abortions after the 20th week of a pregnancy. According to opponents, new abortion clinic standards in the bill would effectively shutter 37 of the state's 42 abortion clinics. The bill would give Texas some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Strict senate rules for filibusters added to the drama. According to the rules, Senator Davis was not allowed to sit down, take a restroom break, go off topic or even lean. By 10:30 p.m., the YouTube channel live streaming the special senate session passed 100,000 viewers, and the number jumped when Senator Davis was found to be in violation of senate rules for straying off topic. It was her third violation, which opened the window for a vote on whether or not she must cease the filibuster. Other senators who opposed the bill filled the remaining time with questions and points of order to run out the clock. With fewer than five minutes left until the midnight deadline and an outcome still murky, the YouTube live stream had more than 180,000 viewers glued to their screens. On Twitter, the topic was trending worldwide. At different points during the evening, #standwithwendy, #SB5, #texlege ""Wendy Davis,"" ""Texas,"" ""Robert's Rules of Order"" and ""Midnight in Texas"" were all trending on the social network. The #standwithwendy hashtag had 400,000 mentions on Tuesday, according to Twitter. Senator Davis' Twitter account was silent while she was on the floor, but her number of followers jumped from just under 6,000 to more than 48,000 during the course of the day, an 8x increase. Twitter also served as a rallying point for local protestors, who increased in numbers throughout the day to fill the senate chambers and line the rotunda. Many posted photos and Vines of the crowds. Chanting could be heard inside and outside the senate at midnight, when the floor erupted in confusion as it appeared senators were still taking a vote, even though the deadline had passed. .","A filibuster of a Texas abortion bill was trending worldwide on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- In an op-ed column released Friday by The New York Times, Woody Allen blames Mia Farrow's malevolence over their breakup for a two-decade-old false accusation that he molested their adopted daughter, Dylan, when she was 7. The film director's opinion piece follows renewed allegations that were made last week by Dylan Farrow, who accused him in an open letter published by the Times of sexually assaulting her as young girl. ""Not that I doubt Dylan hasn't come to believe she's been molested, but if from the age of 7 a vulnerable child is taught by a strong mother to hate her father because he is a monster who abused her, is it so inconceivable that after many years of this indoctrination the image of me Mia wanted to establish had taken root?"" Allen writes in the Times. Dylan Farrow stood by her accusations in a statement responding to Allen's op-ed. ""Once again, Woody Allen is attacking me and my family in an effort to discredit and silence me -- but nothing he says or writes can change the truth,"" she said. ""For 20 years, I have never wavered in describing what he did to me. I will carry the memories of surviving these experiences for the rest of my life."" The controversy dates back to 1992 after the revelation that Allen, then 56, was having an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, Mia Farrow's 19-year-old adopted daughter with composer Andre Previn. Allen and Soon-Yi Previn married five years later. Relatives take Allen's side . When Mia Farrow's 12-year relationship with Allen ended, the actress accused him of molesting Dylan, one of two children she had adopted with Allen. ""Twenty-one years ago, when I first heard Mia Farrow had accused me of child molestation, I found the idea so ludicrous I didn't give it a second thought. We were involved in a terribly acrimonious breakup, with great enmity between us and a custody battle slowly gathering energy,"" Allen wrote. ""The self-serving transparency of her malevolence seemed so obvious I didn't even hire a lawyer to defend myself. It was my show business attorney who told me she was bringing the accusation to the police and I would need a criminal lawyer."" The charge triggered a child-custody battle, with Allen going to court to get both adopted children and Satchel, their biological son, who now goes by Ronan Farrow. But a police investigation of the allegations ended with no charges against Allen. At the time, Allen lashed out at authorities who handled the case and accused prosecutors of scheming to keep it open to influence his custody battle. Adopted daughter says Woody Allen sexually assaulted her . Even as the decades passed, the scandal permanently damaged Allen's image -- that of a neurotic but amusing schlub with a talent for slapstick and witty one-liners. He denied the accusations from Dylan and said his relationship with Farrow, which had been painted in storybook colors by the press, was not actually all that strong. However, the scandal has always been near the surface, and the open letter in The New York Times is one of a number of instances in recent months where the allegation has been raised. He did marry Soon-Yi Previn in 1997, and after the marriage came a slightly more public Woody Allen. The couple were the focus of a 1997 Barbara Kopple documentary, ""Wild Man Blues,"" which portrayed a generally happy pair. Allen was also the subject of a 2011 Robert Weide film, ""Woody Allen: A Documentary,"" which briskly addressed Farrow's allegations from Allen's point of view. In her open letter, Dylan Farrow admonished actors by name for ""turning a blind eye"" and for continuing to work with Allen. But in the opinion piece, Allen questioned whether Dylan Farrow wrote the letter of her own accord or was guided by her mother in writing the letter. ""Does the letter really benefit Dylan or does it simply advance her mother's shabby agenda? That is to hurt me with a smear. There is even a lame attempt to do professional damage by trying to involve movie stars, which smells a lot more like Mia than Dylan,"" Allen wrote. In a November Vanity Fair article, Allen was condemned by Mia Farrow's children, especially Dylan. After that article's publication, a representative for Allen told CNN, ""The article is so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment."" The article, Dylan Farrow's letter and Twitter postings by Ronan Farrow attacking his estranged father come as the 78-year-old director and his latest film -- ""Blue Jasmine"" -- are up for honors during Hollywood's annual award season. When the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave Allen a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes last month, his son tweeted: ""Missed the Woody Allen tribute -- did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?"" Dylan Farrow's letter appeared in Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's blog just hours before the Writers Guild Awards ceremony, for which Allen had been nominated for best screenplay for ""Blue Jasmine."" He did not win. Academy voters begin casting Oscar ballots on February 14. Allen and his cast are up for three Academy Awards, including best original screenplay for Allen, best actress for Cate Blanchett and best supporting actress for Sally Hawkins. CNN's Alan Duke and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","NEW: Dylan Farrow stands by her accusations .

"(CNN) -- A former flight attendant whose repeated bomb threats caused massive headaches for United Airlines and inconvenienced thousands of travelers has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. A federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Patrick Cau, 40, on Monday, ordering him to pay $304,495 in restitution to United and $8,838 to the Los Angeles Police Department. Authorities said Cau, a German national also known as Patrick Kaiser, made eight bomb threats in late 2012 and early 2013 to United after being fired by the airline. Most of the phone threats targeted United jets on his old route between Los Angeles and London. Some of the calls occurred while he was training for a new flight attendant job with American Airlines. The bomb threats disrupted law enforcement agencies and inconvenienced passengers. Officials evacuated planes, re-screened passengers and searched bags and cargo, but did not find explosives. Cau, of Dallas, pleaded guilty in August to one count of false information and hoaxes, but in a plea agreement admitted to making eight bomb threats. Cau's lawyer, Craig Charles, said Cau was given credit for the six months he has already served, leaving him with about a year left on the sentence. He faces possible deportation to Germany when he gets out, Charles said. ""My client was very clear that he was remorseful for the things that were done. He wishes to put this behind him and move on with his life,"" Charles said.","Repeated bomb threats caused problems for United Airlines .

"London (CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton has signed a three-year contract to race for the Mercedes Formula 1 team beginning next season. Friday's announcement by the team ends weeks of speculation about the Briton's future with McLaren -- a team he joined when he was 13 years old. ""Looking ahead to 2013, I am delighted to welcome Lewis Hamilton to our team,"" Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn said in a statement. ""The arrival of a driver of Lewis' caliber is a testament to the standing of Mercedes-Benz in Formula 1 and I am proud that Lewis shares our vision and ambition for the success of the Silver Arrows,"" Brawn added. Hamilton, who won his only world championship title with McLaren in 2008 said he was looking forward to the challenge. ""I am very excited to begin a new chapter racing for the [Mercedes] team. Mercedes-Benz has such an incredible heritage in motorsport, along with a passion for winning which I share,"" Hamilton said in a statement. Hamilton will partner Nico Rosberg in 2013 with Michael Schumacher making way. Brawn thanked the seven-time world champion, who came out of retirement to join Mercedes in 2010, for his contribution during his three seasons at Mercedes. Hamilton focuses on championship chase as Mercedes rumors persist . ""His energy and commitment have never wavered, even when results have not matched our own expectations, and we are determined to finish the 2012 season together on a high. As always, it has been a pleasure to work with Michael,"" Brawn said in a statement. In a statement, Schumacher said he had enjoyed his three years at Mercedes even if they didn't do as successfully as he would have liked on the track. ""I wish Lewis well and for the team to achieve the success we worked so hard for in the build-up. I would like to thank the team for their trust and all the guys for their unconditional commitment. I will now concentrate on the next races,"" the 43-year-old said. Hamilton's replacement at McLaren will be Sergio Perez. The 22-year-old Mexican who currently races for the Sauber team will partner Jenson Button from 2013. ""I'm thrilled and delighted to have become a [McLaren] driver. The McLaren name is one of the greatest in the history of Formula 1,"" Perez said in a statement. ""For more than 40 years McLaren has been a team that every racing driver has aspired to drive for ... and I'm truly honoured that they've chosen me to partner Jenson from 2013 onwards,"" Perez added. McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh praised Perez's ""giant-killing performances"" and ""podium finishes"" this season. ""He's perfectly poised to develop into a world championship challenger,"" Whitmarsh said in a statement. Whitmarsh also passed on his thanks to the departing Hamilton, whose performances wrote ""a huge chapter"" in his and the team's life. ""It goes without saying that we all wish him well for the future ..."" Whitmarsh said. Meanwhile, the race schedule for 2013 has been released with doubts still surrounding the New Jersey event. The Grand Prix is scheduled for June 16 but has yet to be finalized with concerns surrounding whether the track will be completed in time. The season will start with the Australian Grand Prix on March 17 with the showpiece Monaco event taking place on May 26. Silverstone will host the British Grand Prix on June 30 -- a week earlier than last year as not to clash with the Wimbledon men's final.","Speculation about Briton's future at McLaren ends with three-year deal with Mercedes .

"(CNN) -- Minutes after locking out a social worker who'd brought his two sons for a visit, a man in Washington state blew up his house on Sunday -- killing himself and his boys, whose mother went missing more than two years ago, a sheriff's spokesman said. Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer told CNN that the explosion ""was done intentionally,"" saying Josh Powell committed a ""double homicide"" in addition to killing himself. ""This was all on him,"" Troyer said of Powell and the blast. ""He set this up, he did it."" Days earlier, in an affidavit seeking custody of the children, Powell said that he had proven himself as a ""fit and loving father who provides a stable home even in the face of great adversity."" ""My inherent resilience as a person makes it increasingly difficult for (critics) to pursue their agendas,"" he wrote in the document, which was filed Wednesday in a Pierce County court, referring to those blaming him for his wife's disappearance. ""I am standing tall for my sons."" On Sunday, authorities said Powell met a foster-care worker who had brought his two boys -- ages 5 and 7, having both celebrated birthdays in January -- to their father's residence for what was supposed to be a supervised visit. As the children got close to the door, Powell brought them inside but prevented the case worker from getting in as well, according to Troyer. She tried ""pounding the doors, trying to get in,"" with no success, he added. The case worker reported smelling something similar to gas, said Graham, Washington, Fire and Rescue Deputy Chief Gary Franz. About two minutes later, as she was calling her supervisor, the house exploded. ""All the walls in the house were on fire, almost immediately,"" neighbor Ryan Mickle told CNN affiliate KIRO, adding that the blast ""shook my whole house."" ""I didn't hear anybody inside. It was quite a scene."" Authorities first heard of the explosion in Puyallup, Washington, around 12:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. ET), according to Troyer. The fire was still ""burning hot"" and smoke continued to rise from it some four hours later. By 7 p.m., and despite initial concerns that the house collapse, the bodies finally had been recovered, said Troyer. While a medical examiner had yet to definitively identify the bodies, the sheriff's spokesman said Sunday night that ""we believe it is the three of them"" -- referring to Josh Powell and his two sons. ""This was something that was done deliberately and intentionally, and the plan was carried out very quickly,"" he added of authorities' initial take of what happened, noting that ""obviously"" an ""accelerant"" was used to fuel the blast. There were no other injuries and no other houses in the neighborhood in Puyallup, which is about 10 miles southeast of Tacoma, appeared to be damaged, said Troyer. He added a chaplain was at the scene with the social worker, who he described as physically OK but emotionally devastated by the blast. Troyer said the sheriff's department has copies of a brief e-mail that had gone out to Powell's family and friends, ""stating that he couldn't live with what was going on."" Authorities haven't confirmed the message came from Powell, but ""we have no reason to believe it was not from him,"" he said. ""It shows that there was intent, and this was what he intended to do -- which is to kill his children and kill himself,"" Troyer said of the e-mail. In the affidavit seeking custody of his children from his wife's parents that was filed last week, Powell claimed that his sons ""sustained severe injuries in the care of their grandparents,"" adding that, ""for the sake of my sons, we can all do better."" ""If anyone wants to be honest with themselves and the situation, the real story is not that anyone is a bad person, including me,"" he said. ""The story is one of overcoming and rising above what many people think are insurmountable challenges."" The Washington court denied the motion from Powell to gain custody, said Jeffrey Bassett, a Washington lawyer who was representing Powell. Troyer said a judge also ordered Powell to ""go through different types of evaluations and counseling,"" though supervised visits could continue. Powell had said that he last saw his wife, Susan Cox-Powell, on a cold December night in 2009. That night, he said that he and his two sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left after midnight to go camping in below-freezing weather in a desert area in Tooele County, Utah. Powell-Cox's sister eventually reported the mother, who would now be 29 years old, as missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved from Utah to the state of Washington. While there have been no arrests or charges filed related to his wife's appearance, Josh Powell was identified as the lone ""person of interest,"" according to Sgt. Mike Powell -- no relation to Josh or Susan Cox-Powell -- with the West Valley City, Utah, police. The woman has not been found. Through their attorney Anne Bremner, Cox-Powell family issued a statement Sunday asking ""for time, privacy and prayers after today's horrific events."" Since September 2011, Josh Powell had been engaged in ongoing custody battle with his wife's parents Judith and Charles Cox, according to Washington state court records. As part of the investigation after Cox-Powell's disappearance, authorities last year searched a house in Washington state where Powell, his two sons and his father, Steven Powell, were living. In the course of the search, detectives from West Valley City ""discovered numerous images and recordings of adult and juvenile females,"" according to a release from the Pierce County sheriff's department. Steven Powell subsequently was arrested, in September, and charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, according to court documents. He was still in custody on those charges in Pierce County as of Sunday, according to official records posted online. The house that blew up was on a cul-de-sac, about four blocks from the one that had been searched in 2011, Troyer said. Authorities involved with the case were struggling Sunday to come to grips with what had happened, from the violence of the explosion and the two boys being caught up in it. Troyer said many law enforcement agents in Washington state have worked with their counterparts in Utah on the Susan Cox-Powell case, as well as spent time playing, coloring and getting to know her sons. ""Our guys have spent a lot of time and effort and blood, sweat and tears on this case,"" said Troyer. ""We have detectives who are close with the kids, ... and know them. The whole thing is just sad."" CNN's Deanna Proeller, Greg Botelho and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: In an affidavit filed last week, Powell said, ""I am standing tall for my sons""

"(CNN) -- Promising the royal treatment or a picture-perfect all-inclusive resort, many of the world's finest hotels made the cut for the second annual Fodor's 100 Hotel Awards announced Wednesday. While U.S. hotels account for nearly a quarter of the Top 100 winners, hotels in 41 countries made the list. Fodor's Travel team of 700 global contributors nominated 4,000 hotels from the 17,000 properties they review annually. The winners were chosen by Fodor's senior editorial team, which examined the nominations as well as the hotels already singled out as Fodor's Choice picks. ""We look for properties with great amenities and stellar service that offer a unique experience to guests,"" explained Arabella Bowen, Fodor's Travel executive editorial director, in a statement. ""Every traveler will find a dream hotel on this list, no matter what their travel personality happens to be."" Fodor's chose one hotel in each category to recommend to CNN.com readers. New and noteworthy: St. Regis Bal Harbour (Miami) One of the most hotly anticipated hotel openings of this year, the elegant and glamorous St. Regis Bal Harbour is drawing the high-end crowd away from South Beach. Located on an island 15 minutes north of South Beach, the resort offers a private beach and perfect location for a luxurious stroll at the Bal Harbour Shops. ""The design of the resort is stupendous, art deco glam, very smart and current and also harkens back to the city's art deco past,"" Bowen says. ""And the beach is better than anything you'll find in South Beach."" Global icon: Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac (Quebec, Canada) The Chateau Frontenac, with beautiful views of the Saint Lawrence River and Old Quebec City, has been a landmark in Quebec and all of Canada since it was built in the late 1800s by the general manager of Canadian Pacific Railway. ""It's a tremendously historic property and probably the most photographed hotel in Canada,"" says Bowen. ""It really does feel like a slice of old France. You can have afternoon tea and stay in the turrets and feel a bit like you're living in a fairy tale."" Trendsetter: The Out NYC (New York City) The Out NYC advertises itself as New York's first straight-friendly urban resort, and that's just one of the ways it plays with its ""out"" identity as a gay-focused hotel in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. It's also an urban retreat with everything a happening gay person might want in a getaway outside the city: lounges, a pool, spa, restaurant, nightclub and more. ""It's one of those properties that is changing the hospitality landscape,"" says Bowen. ""You could do everything you wanted to do and never leave the property,"" although the pull of Broadway theater nearby might draw you out of your room or massage or nighttime dance party. Trip of a lifetime: San Camp (Botswana) For the trip of a lifetime -- a honeymoon, 25th anniversary or 50th birthday -- you're going to splurge, right? And maybe you want to go somewhere not everyone you know has already been? That's when Bowen recommends San Camp in Botswana. While Fodor's is noticing an increase in travel to Botswana for safaris, San Camp is much more than a safari experience. This ""very intimate"" site hosts a maximum of 12 guests and offers safaris, bird watching, cultural and archaeological visits, stargazing and other activities, Bowen says. ""It's a vast and quiet place,"" she says. ""You feel a little bit like you're at the end of the world."" Local experience: The Ahwahnee Hotel (Yosemite, CA) For a hotel with an authentic sense of place in Yosemite, one need go no further than the Ahwahnee Hotel. Located in Yosemite National Park with an award-winning restaurant, ""it's hard to get more local than the Ahwahnee,"" says Bowen. ""The hotel does evoke its sense of place."" The hotel, which tends to book up quickly, has hosted all sorts of high-profile guests such as Brad Pitt, Lucille Ball and John F. Kennedy. Ahwahnee tends to get booked up very quickly. ""It's so much more than you'd expect from a national park lodge,"" Bowen says. City chic: Hotel Monaco Seattle . The recently renovated Hotel Monaco Seattle doesn't just qualify as ""city chic"" because of the contemporary design typical of the Monaco brand. Another requirement, says Bowen, is that the hotel attract locals to hang out at its bar and restaurant. They appreciate the long hours of the gourmet happy hour (4-8 p.m.) and the tasty treats served up by Sazerac hotel restaurant chef Jason McClure. ""The hotel has definitely upped the ante in that respect,"" she says. ""They feature local musicians. You're in the center of town and part of the local scene."" Royal pedigree: Ciragan Palace Kempinski (Istanbul) With global attention on the marriage of the British royals and the popularity of television programs such as ""Downton Abbey,"" hotels with any sort of royal pedigree are proving quite popular. People want to live like royalty, even if only for a few days . Guests can live like rulers of the Ottoman Empire at the Ciragan Palace Kempinski, once the 19th-century home of an Ottoman sultan on the Bosphorus Strait. ""The rooms are absolutely spectacular, and you can imagine being waited on there by handmaidens back in the day,"" says Bowen. ""The 11 palace suites come with 24-hour butler service. It's a perfect retreat in Istanbul."" Fun for all ages: Ocean House (Watch Hill, Rhode Island) Ocean House is one of those special hotels that adults and kids can enjoy together and separately. ""Family bonding time excellent but being able to do things on your own is also good,"" says Bowen. Guests can swim at the private beach or pools, enjoy the spa, play croquet, participate in a cooking demonstration, go on winery tours or visiting a nearby lighthouse museum and carousel. ""It's such a fun property even people without kids could consider going,"" she says. Generations of families vacation here together, often coming year after year. Best all-inclusive: The BodyHoliday (St. Lucia). There are no worries at the all-inclusive BodyHoliday resort, where everything's included in the rate, even a daily massage and the tips. The property on the island of St. Lucia also offers singles relatively good rates. The BodyHoliday's focus is on wellness, however the guest wants to pursue that goal. ""You can get fit, relax, learn how to scuba dive and enjoy wine tastings and gourmet menus,"" says Bowen. Go online for a complete list of this year's Fodor's Top 100 Hotel Awards.","Fodor's 100 hotels were chosen from 4,000 nominations; winners are in 41 countries .

"(CNN) -- Would it help you manage your stress level to get a warning that the text message you're about to read is your boss or partner chewing you out? The creators of a new mobile app think so. Stress @ Work is an Android app developed by a student at England's University of Portsmouth. It color-codes incoming messages on Facebook, Twitter and via text, using their choice of language to predict their tone. Green means positive, blue is neutral and red is a warning of potential nastiness. Masters student Lorraine Chambers said she created the app so people know whether to expect to feel better or worse after checking in. ""The ultimate objective of this application is to make the user aware of the negative contents they receive so they are able to manage their stress in the best possible way,"" Mohamed Gaber, a senior lecturer at the university, added in a news release. ""For example, if most of what is received from social media websites by a user on a particular day was negative, it is important that the user attempts to take an action in order to not get stressed, especially if this may affect the individual's performance at work and/or their behavior at home."" On a sample image provided by the school, a tweet from a sender saying he had a great time the night before showed up in green, as did a text wishing the recipient a happy weekend. Two Twitter posts with links to news stories (a movie review and a political story) earned neutral blue. Another one announcing that the next day's weather will be bad (""hope you brought a jacket"") and one saying that the sender is tired and had taken the wrong bus were flagged in red. (No word on whether the app can detect irony or sarcasm.) Chambers and Gaber plan to present the app at a September conference in Spain. It is still in the testing phase and not yet available. They said they plan to release it for free in the Android Market. If there is enough interest, they then hope to make a version for Apple mobile devices.","A new app would warn users whether incoming messages are positive or negative .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's interim leaders declared the nation's freedom Sunday, ushering in a new era after the death of longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi. ""Libyan lands have now been completely liberated,"" said Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, vice chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council. Cheering crowds packed a central square in Benghazi Sunday afternoon for a ceremony that leaders said formally marked victory after eight months of fighting. ""We are now united. We have become brothers in love,"" said Mustafa Jalil, the council's chairman. He called on Libyans to have ""honesty, patience and tolerance"" as the nation moves toward reconciliation. The location of Sunday's ceremony was significant. Uprisings against Gadhafi's regime began in Benghazi in February. Audience members carried signs, waved flags and batted around balloons. As leaders spoke, the sound of celebratory machine-gun fire filled the air. Officials urged Libyans to lay down their arms, but not to let down their guard. ""Our people have achieved this freedom by the blood of our brothers, sisters and martyrs. Freedom is great and it's got a great price. It is costly. So turn your teeth into nails and bite on it very hard. Because preserving it is more difficult than attaining it,"" one military official said at the ceremony. Earlier Sunday, doctors completed Gadhafi's autopsy at a Misrata hospital, with the chief pathologist confirming the former strongman died Thursday of a gunshot wound to the head. Dr. Othman el-Zentani, the pathologist, did not disclose additional findings. Doctors also also conducted autopsies on the bodies of Gadhafi's son Mutassim and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis. Zentani said the three bodies would likely return to the cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market where people lined up to view the corpses over the weekend. As Libya now faces the arduous task of building a new society after 42 years of Gadhafi's rule, the NTC said it will hold elections in the coming months. Mahmoud Jibril, the chairman of the National Transitional Council executive board, put the timetable ""within a period of eight months, maximum."" The first vote will be for a national Congress that will draft a constitution. After that, parliamentary and presidential elections will be held. Already, some signs of improvement have emerged. Jibril said that oil-rich Libya is currently producing about 300,000 barrels per day, up from near zero during the depths of the eight-month Libyan conflict. The country should be back at its prewar output of 1.6 million barrels of oil per day within 15 months, he said. But even as some Libyans celebrated liberation Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had visited thousands of newly arrested people in the battle-scarred nation, where committee representatives observed more than 30,000 displaced people, mass graves and nearly abandoned cities. More than 7,000 detainees are held in about 50 places throughout the country, the committee reported. ""When necessary, we have called upon the authorities to place detainees in proper detention facilities instead of makeshift structures such as schools,"" ICRC delegate Hanan Salah said in a statement. NATO, which launched a military operation in March to protect Libyan citizens against the Gadhafi regime during the Libyan war, plans to end its mission there by October 31. ""The work to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in Libya is just beginning. We are proud of everything we have done to assist so far, and stand ready to help the Libyan people in the future,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement Sunday. U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated leaders of Libya's interim government after Sunday's ceremony and said the council must now ""turn its attention to the political transition ahead."" ""We look forward to working with the (NTC) and an empowered transitional government as they prepare for the country's first free and fair elections,"" Obama said in a statement Sunday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon similarly cheered the liberation declaration and said that it marked a historical juncture. ""Today marks an occasion for Libyans to celebrate, to look forward to a future of liberties and opportunities, from the right to express an opinion freely to the right to elect their own government,"" he said, promising support to the Libyan people as they work to build a ""brighter future."" Gadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership ""to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,"" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported. The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death amid questions over the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life. They want to know whether Gadhafi was killed in crossfire or executed by fighters. The United States supports calls for an independent investigation into how Gadhafi was killed, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. Clinton also said that after Sunday's ceremony announcing liberation, U.S. officials will again request that convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi be imprisoned. ""Once there's a government in place, we will renew our calls that Megrahi, who should never have been released in the first place, be returned to serve the rest of his sentence for the terrible crime against those passengers on Pan Am 103,"" she said. Al-Megrahi was freed from a prison in Scotland in 2009 after serving eight years of a life sentence for blowing up the Pan Am jet in 1988, killing all 259 on board and 11 in the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, below. Doctors who had been treating him for prostate cancer gave him just three months to live, and he was released on compassionate grounds.

"(CNN) -- A moon circling Jupiter has sent up a small flare. It may be telling astronomers that life could be supported there, and it may offer a way of finding out. The scientists have recognized a puff of water vapor sprouting 125 miles high above Europa in a special image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA said Thursday. ""We pushed Hubble to its limits to see this very faint emission,"" said Joachim Saur, the telescope's lead investigator on the project. They're not quite sure yet, but Saur, a professor at the University of Cologne in Germany, believes that a geyser on Europa's south pole blustered the vapor up from a water source under the moon's surface. Aquatic life . Many scientists feel certain that a deep ocean lies beneath the icy, miles-thick shell that covers the moon, the American Geophysical Union said. The whole celestial body looks like a white, scratchy ball of ice. Europa, which is too far away from the sun to enjoy the warmth of its golden rays, has surface temperatures as low as -328 degrees Fahrenheit, the AGU said. It's hardly a temperature anything living could survive at. But the moon is probably heated from within. Friction caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull on its core keeps the internal ocean from freezing, scientists believe. Its water might have the right chemistry to sustain some very basic aquatic life. And this newly recognized vapor trail may offer an easier way of finding that out, astronomer Lorenz Roth told NASA. He analyzed the data Hubble collected. ""If those plumes are connected with the subsurface water ocean we are confident exists under Europa's crust, then this means that future investigations can directly investigate the chemical makeup of Europa's potentially habitable environment without drilling through layers of ice. And that is tremendously exciting."" A cheaper flight . Instead of having to land there with heavy borer rigs loaded onto a large, expensive spacecraft to collect a water sample, a probe could now just fly into the vapor, suck some of it in and analyze it. Money is important, when it comes to studying Europa. Most of what astronomers know about it comes from data picked up by the Galileo mission to Jupiter, which ended in 2003 and was plagued with funding blackouts, the AGU said. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been trying to come up with lower-budget experiments to make funding for a mission more likely, according to the AGU. They would involve an orbiter to observe the surface long-term and a spacecraft that would fly there to take radar images of what's underneath the ice. Now, there may be another, even more enticing and equally thrifty experiment to add to the list. Need more pics . But before all that can happen, Hubble needs to snap few more images of the plumes to confirm the discovery. And even then, it may take Saur and his colleagues a while to feel comfortable with their analysis of the spectrographic images that discern light waves from Europa. The vapor is not visible to the naked eye. Hubble was able to detect it only because electrons crashed into it, converting it into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Thursday's announcement was based on images recorded in December of last year, NASA said. It took that long to be reasonably sure that the clouds weren't caused by something else, like charged particles flying there through Jupiter's magnetic field or a meteor crashing down. Dolphins? Nah . If a mission to Europa gets launched, don't expect it to turn up a dolphin. Because of the extreme conditions in that ocean -- if it exists -- scientists would probably find -- if anything -- the kind of microbes that live under Earth's arctic caps or near undersea volcanoes, the AGU said. This isn't the first time scientists have found water vapor coming from another planet's moon. A NASA orbiter has detected similar spouts on one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus, NASA said. But this is a sensational find, if it is confirmed. It may represent the closest place to Earth where scientists could find still-existing life outside of our planet.","Scientists strongly believe there is an ocean hidden under the ice surface of Europa .
The Hubble Space Telescope captured a spectrographic image showing water vapor .
Astronomers believe it came from a geyser connected to the hidden ocean .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian authorities are investigating six suspicious deaths and at least one car explosion this week about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from the site of next month's Winter Olympics, they said Thursday. The deaths in southern Russia's Stavropol territory, which borders the province where the Olympics will be held in Sochi, have prompted security forces to conduct an anti-terrorism sweep there, state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. It's one of the latest moves to address security concerns before the games. The bodies of three men and explosive material were found Thursday in a vehicle in Maryinskaya in Stavropol province, Russia's Investigative Committee said on its website. A day earlier, a vehicle containing a body exploded in Tambukan, in the same province, as police approached it, and two other bodies were found in other vehicles in Zolskaya Wednesday, the Investigative Committee said. The latest alert comes amid heightened concern about security following twin bombings on public transit in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last month. No group has claimed responsibility for those attacks, but suspicion has fallen on Chechen separatist groups. Three people also died last month in a car bombing in the city of Pyatigorsk, in Stavropol territory. Dmitri Trenin, director of the Moscow Carnegie Center, said it appeared that the latest killings may be the work of Islamist militants from the tiny North Caucasus republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which neighbors Stavropol territory. The militants have carried out similar attacks on taxi drivers and other ordinary people in the past three to four years, he said. They are motivated by a vendetta against the local police and authorities and, more broadly, against the secular Russian state. The latest security incidents are not likely to be directly linked to the Winter Olympics in Sochi but are part of a bigger picture of unrest in the North Caucasus region, Trenin said. They are receiving more attention than usual because of the upcoming games, he added. There has been no official confirmation that militants from Kabardino-Balkaria were involved in the suspicious deaths in Stavropol territory. Cossacks boost Sochi security . A special exclusion zone went into force in Sochi on Tuesday, under which access to the Black Sea resort town is heavily restricted. About 400 Cossacks arrived Thursday in Sochi, where they will be deployed to assist the police during the games and provide security for visiting athletes and tourists, RIA Novosti said. They will accompany police patrols in full traditional uniform, including fur hats and swords, the news agency said, in a move that carries echoes of Tsarist Russia. The Cossacks are known for their military prowess. Security analysts have warned that terrorists targeting the games may try to strike elsewhere in Russia against softer targets than those in Sochi. Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Islamist Caucasus Emirate group, last summer called on his followers to do what they could to disrupt the games. One month before Olympics, Russia puts Sochi under high security . CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London and Nic Robertson reported from Moscow. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","Russian authorities are looking into 6 suspicious deaths in southern Russia .

"(EW.com) -- The wait for Glee fans is finally over! The Fox musical comedy returns Tuesday night with a brand-new episode titled Frenemies, where Santana auditions and snags the role of Rachel's understudy in Funny Girl, causing a feud resulting in Rachel moving out. Back in Lima, Tina and Artie battle to be the class valedictorian. Last month, Fox confirmed the show would be moving permanently to New York City for the remainder of the current season and for season 6, which will be the series' last. EW talked to the cast on the Glee set while celebrating their special two-part 100th episode airing March 18 and March 25, when several past members of the New Directions come back to McKinley for a week to celebrate what the now-disbanded (!) glee club did for them. Read on to find out exactly when we will be saying goodbye to Lima, plus some teases about upcoming performances. Can you say foam party? Bye-bye, Lima! So when will the show say goodbye to Ohio for good? The 100th episode is divided into two parts, and Lea Michele told EW that by the end of that second episode, it'll be the Big Apple from then on. Some are calling episode 101 the Lima season finale, as it will also feature the graduation of the current seniors before some of them make the move east. New to New York . Rachel, Santana, and Kurt will be joined in the city that never sleeps by Artie (going to film school), Sam (to model), and Blaine (to get married?). Michele also told us that Amber Riley's Mercedes will be popping up in a couple of episodes too. But what about Jane Lynch and Sue Sylvester? Lynch said she hasn't been written into any of the New York scripts yet but is not officially done with the show by any means. Fox confirms 'Glee' moving setting exclusively to NYC . ""I guess we have to get back into our characters"" Darren Criss wanted to make it clear that just because the show's setting is moving to New York, that doesn't necessarily mean the entire cast is. Joking that many people have asked if the show's move meant he had to move permanently too, Criss said, ""I don't know if you understand how TV works. We don't actually shoot in Lima, Ohio."" Of course a lot of the show will be filmed in New York, but the majority of production is likely to remain in Los Angeles, for now. But the vibe of the group seems different. Michele noted that at one point while filming, the cast was talking to each other and so in the moment catching up, that they didn't realize that they had actually begun to tape the scene and had called action. Whoops. Michele isn't sure if any of what they were actually talking about got into the episode but was quick to note at the time, ""I guess we have to get back into our characters."" No more school stories . The show is going to take on more adult-oriented stories in New York, dealing with real post-high school life issues. ""We are gonna take some time just in NY. See where that takes us,"" executive producer Brad Falchuk said. ""We're really excited about adult stories out of high school when nobody gives a hoot about you. How does that feel to suddenly be nobody from being the biggest hero?"" Klaine forever after? ""When you move in with somebody in any relationship, it's going to be a challenge. I think they are going to face some challenges together and see if they can get through them or not,"" Criss teased about the post-proposal life of Blaine and Kurt in New York together. ""There are some cool, very adult themes that are exciting to explore. Fans that have gotten older while watching the show can relate."" EW's 'Glee' coverage . The foam party you wish you were invited to . Though details are still wrapped up, Falchuk teased that guest stars Kristin Chenoweth and Gwyneth Paltrow, both reprising their roles from earlier seasons of the show, appear in some amazing musical numbers together, including one centered around Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and lots of foam. Luckily, everyone got to join in on the fun too. ""Let's just say, we party. It's a party like all the time on Glee. You might want to quote me exactly how I said that,"" Criss playfully said. Criss joined the show after both blond bombshells had already made their guest appearances, so he didn't get to work with them. But now? ""I was closer than I ever thought I would get to Gwyneth Paltrow in my lifetime, so I'll take it!"" Plus, here is the list of fan-favorite songs that will be in the 100th episode: . 1.

"New York (CNN) -- The Indian diplomat whose arrest sparked a testy exchange between the United States and India won a dismissal of a federal indictment Monday, according to court documents. Devyani Khobragade was arrested and strip searched by federal agents in New York City in December after federal authorities accused Khobragade of lying on a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper. She was indicted on January 9 by a federal grand jury on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. Khobragade then filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming she was ""cloaked in diplomatic immunity at the time of her arrest,"" according to the motion. The court agreed, stating that Khobragade was ""appointed a Counselor to the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, a position that cloaked her with full diplomatic immunity,"" according to court documents. She was appointed to that position on January 8, a day before she was indicted. ""Even if Khobragade had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now, her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal,"" U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin wrote. ""The government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when Khobragade was immune from the jurisdiction of the court,"" Scheindlin continued. Khobragade's attorney, Daniel Arshack, said in a statement that Khobragade is pleased that ""the rule of law has prevailed."" ""We are heartened that the court agreed with our legal analysis and rejected the prosecution's arguments by dismissing the case,"" he said. India's external affairs spokesman, Syed Akbaruddin, issued a statement welcoming the ruling. James Margolin, spokesman for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, did not rule out the possibility of further charges. ""As the court indicated in its decision, and as Devyani Khobragade has conceded, there is currently no bar to a new indictment against her for her alleged criminal conduct, and we intend to proceed accordingly,"" he said in a statement. Khobragade, who left the United States in January, is now working for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi. Her case drew international attention, with Indian officials demanding apologies from Washington, and the United States announcing it would withdraw one official from its embassy in New Delhi. CNN's Allison Malloy in New York and Harmeet Singh in New Delhi contributed to this report.","NEW: India welcomes the ruling .

"(CNN) -- In 1997, Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. It seemed like a watershed moment, recalling the rise of the machines long prophesied in science fiction. Yet in 2005, a freestyle chess tournament featured teams of humans partnering with computers in various combinations. Shockingly, two amateurs using three fairly weak laptops emerged victorious, beating grand masters and supercomputers in turn. This contrast is fittingly emblematic of two great visionaries of computer science, Marvin Minsky and J.C.R. Licklider. Minsky wrote canonical theories of self-replicating artificial intelligence and co-founded MIT's A.I. lab. Licklider proposed an alternate vision in his landmark paper, ""Man-Computer Symbiosis"". In Licklider's view, human intelligence should be complemented by machines, not replaced: ""Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions. ..."" Watch Shyam Sankar's TED Talk . Technology is too often viewed through a utopian or alarmist lens, and it's worth noting that Licklider's work spanned the sublime and sobering alike. He presaged much of the Internet revolution, and his research led to such breakthroughs as the modern graphical user interface. He also worked on a computer-aided missile defense system designed to collect and present data to a human operator, who would choose the appropriate response. It's easy to argue that life and death decisions should never be left to machines, but Licklider's vision was much broader, recognizing technology as an enabler for many human capacities. Since Kasparov and Deep Blue squared off, we have seen numerous examples of man-computer symbiosis, while A.I. relying solely on computers as Minsky theorized it remains tantalizing, yet distant. TED.com: Robots that fly...and cooperate . In terms of catalyzing human potential, the triumph of the chess amateurs in 2005 was just one glimpse of the future. Foldit, an online video game, allows nontechnical, nonbiologist players to visually ""fold"" protein structures, while computers calculate the chemical interactions corresponding to each arrangement. In 2011, Foldit players needed only 10 days to produce an accurate 3-D model of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, a protease whose structure had stumped scientists for 15 years. It was an astonishing triumph of human visual-spatial reasoning, and one of the first major scientific advances to come from playing a video game (though plenty of software engineers I know would argue that video games activate much more creativity than we care to acknowledge). The tension between the Minsky and Licklider visions has certainly been amplified in the age of so-called big data. Now, consider that most of what we think of as ""big data"" is created by deliberate human action: phone calls, Web logs, credit card transactions, etc. When we hear about big data ""solutions,"" they tend to focus on computational approaches -- storage, search and processing -- with human intuition largely absent. Yet the unraveling of big data into meaningful insight may depend just as heavily on the human side of the equation. Why is this? ""Pattern recognition"" is a frequent A.I. refrain, but computers can't learn to spot patterns they've never seen. The high-value targets in big data are invariably human: highly adaptive adversaries such as terrorists and cybercriminals whose ingenuity frustrates even the most advanced algorithms. TED.com: My seven species of robot . Yet even the nimblest fugitives leave clues, even patterns -- they're just buried in an expanding universe of data, a challenge that intensifies as we seek still more data, hoping it will yield more insight. Adaptive adversaries require adaptive responses, and this begins with asking questions rooted in human intuition. While technology can certainly be a force multiplier for good or evil, it's difficult to imagine a pure A.I. approach reverse-engineering the machinations of a terrorist mastermind. When U.S. intelligence tracked down Osama bin Laden, it was a function of brilliant, resourceful people asking questions and testing hypotheses using a variety of technologies. Cybercriminals, as explored in my first TED talk, tend to target the allegedly weakest links in the network: people. Yet how weak is something that can learn in ways even the most robust automated systems can't? TED.com: All it takes is 10 mindful minutes . Cyber security might always be an uphill, defensive struggle as techniques and technologies raise the stakes on both sides. Remember, though, that cyberwarfare is ultimately a human endeavor. Bot-nets, scripts and other automated tools play key roles, but they don't exist in a vacuum. This cuts both ways: Sooner or later, everyone makes mistakes, even evil genius types. That said, the enemy may well be two amateurs with a few weak laptops. Aspiring good guys must be absolutely relentless in refining the intersection of brainpower and computing power, each of which is vulnerable in isolation. Sometimes, the right combination of humans and technology can reshape the data landscape itself. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, my company partnered with veterans' organization Team Rubicon to coordinate relief efforts in the Rockaways. It began with identifying the hardest-hit areas and greatest needs. Soon, as help poured in, the focus shifted to tracking projects, allocating manpower, and coordinating more than 10,000 volunteers in real time. Through rapid iteration, a group of determined people using low-friction technology had created a vast, self-regulating system. Each discrete data point was simple enough -- the status of a project, levels of need, locations of assets -- but in aggregate, the effect was transformative. While experience teaches that each approach has its caveats, we have every reason to be excited about the possibilities of human-computer symbiosis. Almost 50 years since the identification of Moore's Law, and 10 years since the human genome was first sequenced, humans and machines are beginning a new arc of re-imagining and discovery -- together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shyam Sankar.","Shyam Sankar: Some say computers could attain artificial intelligence superior to humans .
A more realistic approach is to envision computers aided by human intelligence, he says .
Computers can spot patterns from the past but can't anticipate as people can, he says .

"(CNN) -- After months in hiding, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was finally tracked down in Libya's southern desert by fighters from the western Zintan mountains. Once seen as a potential successor to his slain father, Moammar Gadhafi, Saif al-Islam 's capture may mark the end to hopes held by loyalists that the Gadhafi family might seize power again. As the unrest in Libya began to swell earlier this year, Saif emerged as one of the regime's most visible defenders. He was the first to address the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it. Saif al-Islam later made very public vows to fight to the ""last bullet."" His alleged involvement in the bloody crackdown led the International Criminal Court to accuse him of crimes against humanity, including murder and persecution. It is not yet clear whether he will be brought to trial in Libya, as many military commanders would like, or handed over to the International Criminal Court in the Hague, in the Netherlands. His support for his father, if not altogether unexpected, surprised some who had previously seen the 39-year-old as the opposite of the elder Gadhafi. Whereas Moammar Gadhafi years ago launched a program to ""destroy imported ideologies, whether they are Eastern or Western,"" his son speaks fluent English, earned his Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times and was a frequent go-between in talks with international officials. Moammar rarely went anywhere without an ornate Bedouin tent and wearing distinctive tribal dress. The well-traveled Saif, meanwhile, was more likely to appear in Western business attire: a suit and tie. While the father ran the nation, his son's main job -- at least before his 2009 appointment as general coordinator, a position like many in the nation's government with few guidelines -- was heading a charity, the Gadhafi Foundation. And lastly, while the elder Gadhafi was known for his heavy-handed rule in Libya and its restrictions on civil rights and more, Saif fashioned himself as a human rights advocate and pushed for democratic and institutional reforms that could give more power and freedoms to the people -- at least before the popular uprising. Yet for all their differences, Saif's standing in the world was always defined by his father's role. While some saw the son as more open to change, there was little question -- particularly after the uprising began -- that his loyalty remained first with his father. At one point during the war, sources close to the elder Gadhafi said that any transition in Libya would have to involve Saif al-Islam, long seen as a possible successor to his father. He denied having any such desire to rule. Saif al-Islam had been on the run since shortly after the fall of his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital in August. His promised fight to the end was finally stopped in its tracks by rebels who had pursued him across the desert. His hand apparently bandaged from previous clashes but in good health, his final battle may now mean explaining his family's actions before a judge and jury. Responding to news of his capture, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the ICC's chief prosecutor, said Saif al-Islam had been a principal actor in the violence seen in Libya after February 13. ""He's arrested, he's alive, and now he will face justice. And that is the most important news.""

"El Fortin, Mexico (CNN) -- Roselia Rios cried as cameras rolled and headlines trumpeted a castaway's survival after more than a year adrift. The dramatic rescue in the Marshall Islands brought heartbreaking news for Rios: Jose Salvador Alvarenga had survived, but her son, who was with him, had perished at sea. ""For me, it was a devastating blow,"" she told CNN last week. ""The pain is so great I can't explain it. I wouldn't wish this on anybody. Losing a child is the hardest thing to bear in life."" Her son, 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, set sail from Mexico with Alvarenga in late 2012. Both men were members of a small fishing cooperative and had planned to spend a day catching sharks. But something went terribly wrong. Winds blew them off course, a storm raged and their engines failed, Alvarenga told authorities. Four weeks into their drift, according to Alvarenga, Cordova died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles. Eventually, he said, he threw the body overboard. ""What else could I do?"" Alvarenga said. Now, as Alvarenga begins his journey home to El Salvador, Rios is grieving her son's death, more than a year after he went missing. His bedroom in the family's home in the village of El Fortin, Mexico, remains exactly as he left it -- a simple green plaid blanket draped over the bed. Jovani Cordova says his brother was kind and worked hard to help their family. ""He was responsible for my mother. In fact, he worked in the sea because of her,"" he said. ""He wanted to improve himself. He didn't want to be poor like us."" The road in the rural community is so bad it's easier to travel by boat. A short ride took Cordova to where he worked, the nearby town of Costa Azul. Members of the cooperative, where fishermen make an average of $150 a week, still remember the frantic search to find him and Alvarenga after their boat went missing. ""My colleagues went to fish, and the next day they told me by radio that the engine failed and the GPS device was wet. We went to search for them for seven or eight days with the authorities,"" said Bellarmino Rodrigues, who owned the boat. ""The governor gave us a small aircraft, but it was impossible to find them."" Back at the family home, Rios told CNN she was focused on one thing. ""As a mother, I demand that the authorities allow me to talk to the survivor,"" she said last week. ""Only in that way will I know what happened and what he did with the body of my son. I deserve the truth."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Jose Salvador Alvarenga's survival at sea has drawn global attention .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- The cause of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370's disappearance remains a mystery, but it has put the spotlight on the wildly varying approach governments with a stake in the search have handled the sensitivities and the facts. The Malaysian government has been roundly criticized for weeks of muddled misinformation and its seemingly off-hand dealings with the distraught families of the passengers and crew of the missing airliner. China, which has more than 150 of its citizens aboard the Boeing 777-200, has been unrelenting in its criticism of Malaysia's handling of the search and the lack of transparency in information, while Thailand was accused of withholding what might have been critical information about the MH370's possible flight path because it said no one had asked whether it had any intelligence. Out of the fray emerged Australia and its conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a man known more for his pugilistic, take-no-prisoner style of politics, than his statesmanship and compassion. On neither count has the Australian Premier, until now, impressed. Spy claims . Abbott refused to apologize to the Indonesian President when the leaked Edward Snowden files revealed Australia had been spying on Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, including his wife. He has also run a tough, some say brutal, campaign against asylum seekers and the people smugglers who bring them to Australia across treacherous waters from Indonesia. Abbott, who accuses asylum seekers of illegally attempting to enter Australia, is comfortable with the policy masterminded by his predecessor, of sending those who seek refuge in Australia to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru -- neither considered by the UNHCR to be adequate to house them. Recently, the government announced it would stop funding legal assistance for asylum seekers who arrived by boat and are sitting in detention centers awaiting the chance to argue their case. But when he rose to his feet on March 20 to tell the Australian Parliament that new satellite images showed what might be aircraft debris in the Indian Ocean, some 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) off the coast of Western Australia and that an Australian-led search party would be investigating, Abbott made international headlines. Statesmanship peaked out from behind the curtains. When days later no debris had been found, Abbott deflected criticism that he had jumped the gun saying the search area was ""about the most inaccessible spot that you would imagine on the face of the earth. ""But if there is anything down there we will find it. We owe it to the families of those people to do no less."" Poll support . An informal poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed many thought the prime minister had acted properly in announcing news of the satellite images. His compassion was perceived as real rather than political opportunism. After announcing that there would be no time limit on the search effort and that his government would bear the cost of coordinating the international operation, an impassioned Abbott declared: ""If the mystery is solvable, we will solve it."" It was a personal commitment. His determination to deliver ""closure"" for the families of those on board the jetliner stands in stark contrast to the approach of his Malaysian counterpart. While Najib Razak sanctioned sending a text message to families informing them that the aircraft had likely ended up in the southern Indian Ocean, Abbott told the families of the six Australian passengers on the flight the country had ""an ache in its heart and nothing we can say or do will take that ache away."" And as the Australian-led search mission entered its second week, Abbott told grieving relatives what asylum seekers have never heard. ''I want them all to know ... that they will be in the arms of a decent country,'' he said. ''The government has decided to waive visa fees for any relatives wishing to come to Australia.'' 'Eloquent and diplomatic' Even Abbott's most fervent enemies would, if pressed, concede that the Australian premier has been both eloquent and diplomatic in the expression of his sorrow and grief for those who do not know if their relatives are by some miracle, still alive and if they are not, what caused their deaths. But the same fervent enemies might also question whether Abbott sees an upside to statesmanship and compassion. Tragedies of the scale of MH370 are rarely used for political gain without the real and imminent danger of significant political cost. But such tragedies can soften images, turn skeptical minds and give hope to those who've not been recipients of an open heart. When on February 16, a young Iranian asylum seeker was killed in a riot at the Manus Island detention centre, the Australian Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison, claimed Reza Berati had died after leaving the confines of the Australian-run center, placing himself where Australia could not protect him. ""This was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the center and place themselves at great risk,"" Morrison told Australian media. Soon afterwards, Morrison faced the media to admit Berati had in fact died inside the center. Abbott stood by him. ""You don't want a wimp running border protection, you want someone strong and decent. And Scott Morrison is both strong and decent,"" Abbott told parliament. Different leader . Coming after years of hardline railing against the number of asylum seekers landing on to Australia's shores, with many perishing en route, the government's attitude seemed hard, even callous. Many Australians were shocked and held candlelit vigils around the country. If Australians see the beginnings, perhaps even evidence of a different leader with Abbott's deep, heartfelt concern for the souls who boarded MH370 in Kuala Lumpar on route to Beijing, there's little chance this will wipe the memory of a leader who has shown little mercy to asylum seekers -- some of them children -- languishing in Australia's version of Guantanamo Bay. But Australians might be convinced their prime minister has the capacity to change.

"Garita Palmera, El Salvador (CNN) -- She talks to the pictures as if they could make her voice travel thousands of miles and reach her son's ears. ""Oh, my son,"" Julia Alvarenga, 59, says in a tender voice at her home in this coastal town. And then she says, ""I'm going to see him again."" The past two weeks have been an emotional roller coaster for the Salvadoran woman. First, she learned her son had been missing for 13 months. Then she was told he had turned up half a world away. And now she's getting news he might be back home soon. Her son, Jose Salvador Alvarenga, 36, appeared in the Marshall Islands on January 30 claiming to be a castaway. He told authorities he was lost at sea on a fishing boat for 13 months, eating raw fish and turtles. His assistant, Ezequiel Cordova, 23, died four weeks into the drift because he couldn't eat the raw food at their disposal, Alvarenga told CNN. He said the pair got caught in a storm soon after leaving Mexico on a shark fishing trip in December 2012. In Garita Palmera, the house is decorated for a homecoming. Balloons and ribbons are hung, and a banner reading ""Welcome Home"" is strung up on the palm tree archway that leads to the home. One of the castaway's nieces made a heart-shaped decoration. It welcomes him home, and adds, ""May God bless you."" But the family was not exactly sure when to expect Alvarenga's arrival. The government has not been in contact with them as his journey takes place. For Julia, a born-again Christian who attends the Iglesia Principe de Paz (Prince of Peace Church), the survival story was an answer to her daily prayers. Castaway moved to undisclosed location to avoid media crush . Three pictures of Julia Alvarenga's son are among her most treasured possessions. One shows him the way he looked the last time he visited. A second one shows him holding his only daughter when she was 18 months old. But her favorite one was taken when he was only 6 months old, back in September 1977. Julia and Ricardo Alvarenga have nine children, three of whom live in the Maryland area, and the rest in El Salvador, she said. Alvarenga's mother, who helps the family by selling groceries out of a room in their cinder-block house on a dirt street, also made a personal family revelation. She says Jose Salvador Alvarenga last visited their home in Garita Palmera eight years ago. The only thing they knew about him all this time, Julia says, was that he was working as a fisherman somewhere in Mexico. For missing man's mother, castaway's survival story is tale of grief . Jose hadn't called his family since. ""He easily forgets about things,"" she said. ""I would pray to my Lord Jesus Christ, 'You're all-powerful, and you know what's best.' And that was the only hope I had all this time. I would pray to God, and I won't lie to you, I was crying; but I never lost my faith,"" Julia said. As she told her family story, a clucking chicken ate seeds while the family dog, aptly named Doggy, took a nap on a plastic chair. Ricardo Alvarenga, a 65-year-old farmer, agreed, adding they didn't know their son was lost at sea until the story of the castaway made the news and his picture was shown around the world. Some neighbors came to tell them about it. Even though their son has yet to return home, he's already a celebrity in Garita Palmera and neighboring towns. Carlos Francisco Orozco, 46, owner of a chicken restaurant, said he's very proud of his fellow Salvadoran. ""He's a hero for my country,"" Orozco said. ""Not only a hero, but a Superman like (the character) on TV. He's truly a hero."" Many wondered whether they would have been able to survive in a similar situation, but no one would openly cast any doubts on Alvarenga's story. Alvaro Herrera, 38, who owns a shoe store in neighboring Cara Sucia, said he also admires Alvarenga. ""I'm telling you that he's a man of great courage because of what he went through. God was with him because God is good and does good things,"" Herrera said. At the Alvarenga home, Areli Barrera was also waiting for the castaway. She's his former girlfriend and the mother of their 14-year-old daughter, Fatima. She politely avoided answering questions about Alvarenga, saying only that she's glad he made it out alive. Fatima, who was not yet 6 the last time her father visited, said she remembers very little about him. ""I don't know him,"" she said. As for Julia, when asked what's the first thing she's going to do when she sees her son, she extended her arms around herself, the universal signal for a warm, heartfelt embrace.","It's been an emotional time for the parents of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga .
His mother, Julia, said her son didn't keep up, and they didn't even know he was missing .
""I would pray to God, and I won't lie to you, I was crying,"" she says .
For the excited residents of his town in El Salvador, Alvarenga is a hero ."
"(CNN) -- ""Hello 'true believers,' this is Stan Lee,"" said the world-renowned comic book creator as he filmed a video segment for CNN.com. His booming voice and magnetic demeanor made jaws drop and eyes widen everywhere in the room. There's something magical about Lee: He is like a superhero disguised in a button-down shirt and tan slacks. Lee played a major part in creating most of the world's favorite comic book superheroes. He conceived of -- or co-created -- and wrote decades of story lines for Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Thor, Daredevil, Doctor Strange and plenty others in the Marvel pantheon. All told, he has contributed to 90 percent of the company's comic book characters and made them recognizable through marketing and licensing. Lee said the secret to taking his superheroes through so many successful forays into different mediums was having fun. ""I never really think of which [business offers] to take and turn down, because almost everything that's offered to me sounds like fun,"" he said. ""I like writing, I like trying to create new characters and new concepts for entertainment. I'm very much a ham, I love doing those cameos I do. So, I turn down almost nothing unless there's no time to do it."" Marvel became known for its collaborative creative efforts (called the ""Marvel Method"") and Lee sees it as one of the reasons his characters have been so memorable. ""All of my life in comics I have worked with artists, so I've collaborated with them,"" said Lee. ""I would write down the original story, they would draw it and then I would edit it and do the art direction. So everything I've done has always been a collaboration. ""I feel, when you collaborate with talented people, they inspire you. I would hope that you spark them also. And I find that working with people whom you respect, and who are as eager as you to do things that will excite an audience, that's just the best way to go. I've been so lucky that I have found and worked with that caliber of people,"" he said. He points out that his latest venture, POW! Entertainment, stands for ""Purveyors of wonder! With an exclamation point!"" His exaggerated speech patterns and confident posture make it hard to comprehend that he is nearly 88 years old. If it's a carefully crafted persona, it's based on his hard-earned legacy. Through his prolific work and desire to entertain, Lee has influenced pop culture for 71 years. He started working as a writer and proofreader in 1939 for the comic book company that would become Marvel. He wrote his first entire comic book (Captain America No. 3) in 1941. By the early 1960s he was editor and chief writer at Marvel, leading what became known as the ""Marvel revolution."" In response to DC Comics' re-vamped version of ""The Flash"" and successful superhero team comic, ""Justice League of America,"" Marvel created a group of superheroes. They were distinguished in the comic book world for their complex narratives and continuity -- they all saved lives in the same world, and in some cases crossed over into each other's storylines. But it was Lee's promotion and licensing of those characters that gave them a lasting influence. Since 1965, Marvel superheroes have jumped from the pages of comic books to costume and toy stores, Saturday morning cartoons and blockbuster movies. He's not afraid to tackle serious issues either. He famously took the Comics Code Authority to task over rules banning the depiction of drug use. He used ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" to discuss the social problems of drug abuse in 1971. Despite the CCA's disapproval, Lee published the three-book story arc anyway, illustrating the havoc that LSD could wreak. It was so well received that the CCA changed the rules. Many of Lee's superheroes and villains are complicated characters, allowing him to weave social discussions into comic book story lines. ""I thought, even though these were action stories for comic books, I thought it would be rather interesting to the readers to have a third dimension to the stories, which I've always tried to do in a subtle way,"" he said. ""Inject a little bit of philosophy or a little bit of something to think about when the reader reads the stories."" X-Men characters ""Professor X"" and ""Magneto,"" for example, struggled with opposing philosophies as mutant outsiders who were persecuted -- even outlawed -- which was a struggle that comic book readers could see similarly played out in real life on the evening news. ""They were meant to emphasize the conflict between people who felt that we've got to all work together and find a way to get along, and people who feel 'we're not treated well, therefore we're going to strike back with force!' "" said Lee. ""With Magneto, whose people were hounded and hunted and almost tortured, he had every right to feel, 'We're trying to help mankind, and they're making us outlaws, and they're persecuting us, we've got to strike back.' "" Lee said he could understand that feeling, but could also understand Professor X's point of view, which was ""No, we've got to give them time to learn and to understand and to cooperate."" For all his success and fame and fortune, Lee reaches out to fans in a very personal fashion, fostering an in-the-club-like feeling while at Marvel Comics. In all his comics, he wrote a column called, ""Stan's Soapbox,"" as well as a page called ""Bullpen Bulletins,"" in which he wrote directly to the reader, more like a letter from a friend than a letter from the editor. ""And I would end my columns with little catch phrases, like 'Until next time, gang, hang loose!' or 'Face front!' things like that,"" he said. ""And I found, little by little the competition was using the same phrases. And I didn't like that! So, I thought, 'I'm going to try to dream something up that A) they won't know what it means, and B) they won't even know how to spell it!' "" The catchphrase ""Excelsior!"" -- which Lee pronounces egg-zel-see-or -- was born. Lee said he found the word on the coat of arms of the state of New York. It's an old English expression that means ""Upward and onward to greater glory!"" said Lee, emphatically. ""And I thought,"" he said, ""that's just perfect! So now I end almost everything that I write, when I'm just talking to the public or to fans, I end it with 'Excelsior!' And so far nobody has copied it. But of course now that I'm mentioning it here over the air, everybody is going to start doing it and I'm going to be sorry I said this."" Lee makes many cameo appearances in movies based on his comic books. He has appeared uncredited as himself in movies like 2007's ""The Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer."" He also makes more scripted appearances. Finding him in Marvel-based movies is almost like playing ""Where's Waldo?"" In 2000's ""X-Men,"" he was a hot dog vendor. In 2003's ""Hulk,"" he was a security guard. In 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" he appeared as Willie Lumpkin. In 2008's ""Iron Man,"" Tony Stark mistakes him for Hugh Hefner. ""Wow! If I could be in a movie called 'Cameo Man' and play all the cameos I've done, that would be my superpower. I have the ability to be anyone, anytime, anywhere, anyhow!"" said Lee. ""As soon as I get back to the POW! offices, and you know, you know the power that POW! wields, I'm going to start working on that."" ""That is, after I work on getting the movie academy to issue an Oscar for the best cameo of the year, and of course the television academy to do likewise,"" he said.","Stan Lee's comic book and entertainment career has so far spanned 71 years .

"(CNN) -- The Underwear Bomber failed. And our reaction to the failed plot is failing as well, by focusing on the specifics of this made-for-a-movie plot rather than the broad threat. While our reaction is predictable, it's not going to make us safer. We're going to beef up airport security, because Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly snuck a bomb through a security checkpoint. We're going to intensively screen Nigerians, because he is Nigerian. We're going to field full body scanners, because they might have noticed the PETN that authorities say was hidden in his underwear. And so on. We're doing these things even though security worked. The security checkpoints, even at their pre-9/11 levels, forced whoever made the bomb to construct a much worse bomb than he would have otherwise. Instead of using a timer or a plunger or another reliable detonation mechanism, as would any commercial user of PETN, he had to resort to an ad hoc homebrew -- and a much more inefficient one, involving a syringe, and 20 minutes in the lavatory, and we don't know exactly what else -- that didn't explode. At that point, AbdulMutallab's fellow passengers quickly subdued him. Yes, the screeners didn't notice any PETN in his underwear, but the system was never intended to catch that particular tactic. There probably were intelligence failures -- why wasn't his father's tip followed up on, and why wasn't his visa revoked? -- but it's always easy to connect the dots in hindsight. We're doing these things even though this particular plot was chosen precisely because we weren't screening for it; future al Qaeda attacks rarely look like past attacks; and the terrorist threat is far broader than attacks against airplanes. We're doing these things even though airplane terrorism is incredibly rare, the risk is no greater today than it was in previous decades, the taxi to the airport is still more dangerous than the flight, and ten times as many Americans are killed by lightning as by terrorists. In fact, we're focusing on the specifics of the plot, not despite these facts, but because of them. The Underwear Bomber is precisely the sort of story we humans tend to overreact to. Our brains aren't very good at probability and risk analysis, especially when it comes to rare events. Our brains are much better at processing the simple risks we've had to deal with throughout most of our species' existence, and much poorer at evaluating the complex risks modern society forces us to face. We exaggerate spectacular rare events, and downplay familiar and common ones. We can see the effects of this all the time. We fear being murdered, kidnapped, raped and assaulted by strangers, when it's far more likely that the perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend. We fear school shootings, even though a school is almost always the safest place a child can be. We worry about shark attacks instead of fatal dog or pig attacks -- both far more common. In the U.S., over 38,000 people die each year in car crashes; that's as many deaths as 9/11 each and every month, year after year. Overreacting to the rare and spectacular is natural. We tend to base risk analysis on personal story rather than on data. If a friend gets mugged in a foreign country, that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel in that country than abstract crime statistics. We give storytellers we have a relationship with more credibility than we give strangers, and stories that are close to us more weight than stories from foreign lands. And who is everyone's major storyteller these days? Television. I tell people that if it's in the news, don't worry about it. The very definition of ""news"" is ""something that hardly ever happens."" It's when something isn't in the news, when it's so common that it's no longer news -- car crashes, domestic violence -- that you should start worrying. But that's not the way we think. The more an event is talked about, the more probable we think it is. The more vivid our thoughts about the event are -- again, think television -- the more easily we remember it and the more convincing it is. So when faced with a very available and highly vivid event like the Underwear Bomber, 9/11, or a child kidnapping in a playground, we overreact. We get scared. And once we're scared, we need to ""do something"" -- even if that something doesn't make sense and is ineffective. We need to do something directly related to the story that's making us scared. We implement full body scanners at airports. We pass the Patriot Act. We don't let our children go to playgrounds unsupervised. Instead of implementing effective, but more general, security measures to reduce the overall risk, we concentrate on making the fearful story go away. Yes, it's security theater, but it makes us feel safer. As circular as it sounds, rare events are rare primarily because they don't occur very often, and not because of any preventive security measures. If you want to do something that makes security sense, figure out what's common among a bunch of rare events, and concentrate your countermeasures there. Focus on the general risk of terrorism, and not the specific threat of airplane bombings using PETN-filled underwear. Focus on the general risk of troubled teens, and not the specific threat of a lone gunman wandering around a school. Ignore the movie-plot threats, and concentrate on the real risks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","Bruce Schneier says the reaction to the failed bombing is wrongheaded .

"(CNN) -- So, when can we expect our refund checks? Because two can play this game. On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House. Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals -- no one forced any of them to take those jobs. They wanted them. Then ran for them. They got them. On the other side -- at least in a rational world, which this isn't -- is us. The taxpayers. Congress still gets paid -- it's in the Constitution . We pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation: We are handing our money over so that the federal government will run. Some people may not like how the government operates; some may not care for a particular president or a particular member of Congress or a particular government program. We accept that, as we pay our taxes. We pay those taxes because we have to. We know that we don't get to withhold those taxes just because we may dislike some of the people or programs the taxes are funding. But when we are told that the government has been shut down-- that it has been closed for business -- that's different. We paid for that service. We had no choice. Americans hurt as DC 'squabbles like kids' If we had paid for an airline ticket, and in the middle of our trip the airline informed us that one leg of our journey had been canceled, we would justifiably demand a refund. If we ordered an annual subscription to 52 weeks of a magazine, and then, a few months into it, the magazine told us that its new policy was to publish only 26 issues a year, we would, with good reason, ask for half of our money back. If we paid for a one-year membership in a health club, and the club announced that it would have to close for repairs for three months, we would expect a 25% refund. So ... exactly when can we expect to see our refund checks from the federal government? We have paid for it to operate. And -- with the exception of what, for now, are being deemed certain essential functions -- it is not operating. Opinion: Shutdown could be shock therapy . The people we have paid to operate it can blame each other all they want for what has happened. They can point fingers and say that it's all the other guys' fault. But whoever ultimately shoulders the blame, the fact is that the people who hired them -- the American taxpayers -- are not getting what they paid for. So the refunds, for the portions of government operations that have been shuttered, are owed. Or at least they should be owed, in any other kind of sane business. The longer the shutdown continues, the larger the refunds should logically become. As if logic has had anything to do with any of these developments. Congress and the White House might hear this request and say: That's preposterous. The government is hurting for funds -- it needs the money. Well, many of the people who pay for the government to run are hurting for funds, too. They need the money, too. The government, no matter what anyone thinks of its various policies, no matter where anyone positions himself or herself along the political and ideological continuum, is expected to do one thing: . Open its doors each morning. When it doesn't, the people who paid for it to do just that have a right to propose that they are owed -- for services not rendered -- their money back. With interest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","It's taxpayers who finance government operations, writes Bob Greene .
Now that much of government is shutdown, we deserve a refund, he says .
Consumers would demand refund from other providers who didn't provide services, he says .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- It was 4am when, still half asleep, we bundled ourselves into a van and headed to the southern Ukraine city of Kherson. We had spent the night in Odessa, famous for its giant stairway featured in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film, ""Battleship Potemkin."" And while we hadn't awoken before the sparrows just to go sightseeing, our diligent fixers unexpectedly took us on a tour of the apparent back streets of Odessa. They assured us it was the quickest way out of town, but I was anxious because we had just three and a half hours to reach Kherson where we'd be joining the 43 observers from the Organization For Security and Cooperation (OSCE) international observer team as they attempted to cross into Crimea. The delegates were all from various militaries. Punctuality had been drilled into them. They would not wait for a late television crew, even if we had been given exclusive access to their convoy. When we arrived in Kherson, the OSCE observers were getting a briefing about their planned route to Crimea. Are you in Crimea? Share your story with CNN iReport. Yes, they expected to meet armed pro-Russia military forces. No, they did not like their chances of getting through, but it was their mission to try. For almost three hours, we drove in a police-escorted convoy through sparse countryside and dilapidated Soviet-era towns. It was a joy to see the Black Sea but at the same time, I felt some trepidation as it indicated we were approaching the Chongar checkpoint and we really didn't know what to expect. We knew the men guarding the checkpoints up ahead were armed with assault rifles. The OSCE delegates we were travelling with were not carrying weapons and the Crimean authorities had made it clear they regarded any attempts by the OSCE to enter the peninsula as a provocation. The team of observers had already been blocked on a different route to Crimea the previous day. This was their second attempt. One delegate told me he was anxious about trying again. Another said the delegation needed to be more forceful this time. At first our convoy was met with celebratory scenes of people waving Ukrainian flags but the atmosphere changed further down the road as we approached the Chongar roadblock. The men guarding it were indeed armed and wore balaclavas and military fatigues with no insignia. They stood below Russian flags. Along the roadside, signs warned of land mines. While the armed guards looked threatening, they were remarkably calm as they faced not only repeated demands from the OSCE observers but were taunted by pro-Ukrainian protesters who had followed our convoy. ""This is our country. We will kill you,"" shouted a particularly irate elderly man. A shake of the head was the only response he got from one of the masked guards. For two hours, the OSCE officials repeatedly pressed their case, insisting they had a right to enter Crimea, but eventually they decided their efforts were futile. The armed men would not budge. The weather was turning foul. The delegates turned their convoy around and headed back to Kherson to assess their next move. We, however, stayed on. Our man and wife fixer team had suggested they try to get us into Crimea. And they were successful but not before a hairy moment. As we waited to be waved through, two shots were fired. Up ahead, we could see gunfire smoke near a car waiting to pass from Crimea into Ukraine. The pro-Russian forces manning the checkpoint immediately assumed defensive positions and stood back to back, weapons at the ready. But they remained calm, relaxed even. These masked men may not be wearing insignia but their discipline indicated that they had military training. After a few minutes, they waved us through. As we passed the white sedan that had been shot at, we could see that no one in the vehicle was hurt, but the front tire had been shot out. Hostile reactions in Crimea . After five days in Crimea, our team was due to head back to Kiev. But on the eve of our departure, Simferopol airport was closed to all flights except those to and from Moscow. We would have to look for alternatives. By car or by rail. A road trip would mean at least 10 hours of driving with no guarantee we would get through the checkpoints set up by pro-Russian forces between the Crimean peninsula and Ukrainian mainland. We had witnessed one of these gunmen shoot out the tires of a vehicle trying to cross into Ukraine at a checkpoint in Chongar. We didn't want to risk a similar situation. During our travels through the region, reaction to our cameras wasn't always positive. In Odessa we faced some aggression and were told that some pro-Russia activists did not look favorably on American-owned networks. So with road travel struck off the list, we turned to the train timetables. So it seemed, had everyone else wanting to get out. The Kiev-bound service was booked out but we managed to snare the last tickets on a train to Donetsk, another region in eastern Ukraine which identifies more strongly with Moscow than Kiev. So we boarded the Sevastopol-Donetsk express at 7.55 p.m. and immediately negotiated our way into first class to accommodate the 12 bags of camera equipment and personal luggage that we'd been dragging around the countryside from Kiev, to Odessa, to Simferopol and Sevastopol for the past seven days. The train conductor kindly gave up her two-bunk cabin for us and no doubt spent a restless night in an upright chair. That's not to suggest that we slept any more soundly. The heating was turned up to asteroid temperature and our kindly conductor woke us at 2 am to fetch her cigarettes that she'd left in the cabin. I guess she needed something to get her through the discomfort. Still, it was a markedly better and safer way to travel than by car. The carriages were full of young families and senior citizens heading to the Ukraine ahead of Sunday's referendum, there was a plentiful supply of tea with lemon and sugar, and at $15 for a standard ticket and $40 for first class, it was a bargain.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said South Sudan President Salva Kiir will meet rebel leader Riek Machar next week for talks. Kerry traveled to Juba on Friday to push for face-to-face meetings between the feuding leaders. Thousands of people have died in South Sudan because of drought and political violence. About a week ago, rebels slaughtered at least 400 people in the town of Bentiu. Kerry, speaking at a news briefing in Juba, said he'd spoken with Kirr, who was willing to go to Ethiopia for the talks. Machar had indicated a willingness to meet through Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Kerry said. He said the talks might take place early next week. South Sudan celebrated its independence from Sudan three years ago after an internationally brokered referendum. Last year, Kiir accused Machar, his former vice president, of planning a coup. New violence broke out in the war-torn nation. ""I fear that South Sudan's leaders are locked in a purely personal power struggle, with little or no regard for the appalling suffering that it inflicts on their people,"" said Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.","Thousands have died in South Sudan because of drought and political violence .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's transitional government picked an engineering professor and longtime exile as its acting prime minister Monday, with the new leader pledging to respect human rights and international law. The National Transitional Council elected Abdurrahim El-Keib, an electrical engineer who has held teaching posts at the University of Alabama and Abu Dhabi's Petroleum Institute, to the post with the support of 26 of the 51 members who voted. El-Keib emerged victorious from a field that initially included 10 candidates. ""This is a new Libya,"" El-Keib told reporters. ""It's been 42 years with our friends and people all around the world dealing with a brutal dictator, so concerns are in order, but I want to tell you there should be none of those. ""We expect the world to understand that we have national interests as well, and we expect them to respect this,"" he said. ""In fact, we demand respect of our national rights and national interests. In return, we promise respect and dealing according to international law."" But in response to questions about allegations of human rights abuses by the revolutionary forces that toppled longtime strongman Moammar GGadhafi, El-Keib said Libyans needed time to sort things out. ""I also need to remind myself that the Libyan revolution ended just recently in Bani Walid, Sirte, and in Tripoli only about two months ago,"" he said. ""We beg you , the media, to give us the opportunity and the time to think through all the issues that have been raised by yourself as well as other Arab media. But we guarantee you that we are after building a nation that respects human rights and that does not permit abuse of human rights, but we need time."" El-Keib, an NTC member representing Tripoli, has been a member of the Libyan opposition. He is to hold the prime minister's job while Libya writes a constitution and prepares for a national election to vote in a new government, and said he plans to meet a deadline to form a new government within a month of the October 23 declaration of liberation that followed Gadhafi's killing. It was not immediately clear when he returned to Libya from the United States, where he had lived since 1975. According to his university bios, he earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Tripoli in 1973, a master's at the University of Southern California in 1976 at a Ph.D. at North Carolina State in 1984. He joined the Alabama faculty in 1985 as an assistant professor and became a full professor in 1996, teaching in the university's electrical and computer engineering department and serving as director of the engineering school's Energy Systems and Power Quality Center, according to a university directory. He is currently listed as ""former faculty"" on the website of The Petroleum Institute, which said he served as chairman of its electrical engineering department and lists him as an expert in power system economics, planning and controls. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","NEW: El-Keib pledges to respect human rights, ""but we need time""

"Editor's note: Oren Gross is Irving Younger Professor of Law and director of the Institute for International Legal & Security Studies at the University of Minnesota Law School. Between 1986 and 1991, he was a senior legal advisory officer in the Israeli Defense Forces' Judge Advocate General's Corps. He is co-author of ""Law in Times of Crisis: Emergency Powers in Theory and Practice"" with Fionnuala Ní Aoláin. Oren Gross says torture is illegal even if a country is fighting terrorist groups that engage in it. (CNN) -- Popular clichés notwithstanding, not all is fair in war. The idea that war is subject to legal rules is an ancient one. Over time nations have come to accept that their decisions whether to go to war as well as how to conduct warfare once armed conflict has erupted are limited by legal norms. But do such limitations hold when the enemy is not another nation that itself plays, more or less, by the rules, but rather a nonstate actor such as al Qaeda that flagrantly ignores them? Does not following the rules in this context mean that we would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back? And if so, should not all be fair at least in war against such an enemy? Yes, yes, and an emphatic no. Al Qaeda does not pose a threat to the United States' (or any of its allies') existence. Its real threat lies in provoking us to employ authoritarian measures that would weaken the fabric of our democracy, discredit the United States internationally, diminish our ability to utilize our soft power and undermine our claim to the moral higher ground in the fight against the terrorists. In other words, the critical threat is not that the United States would fail to defend itself but that it would do so too well and in the process become less democratic and lose sight of its fundamental values. ""Whoever fights monsters,"" warned Friedrich Nietzsche, ""should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."" Yes, a democracy fighting terrorists seems to be fighting with one hand tied behind its back, but the fight is not merely about physical survival. It is also a struggle about our way of life and about our core values. Aharon Barak, former president of the Supreme Court of Israel (a country no stranger to the fight against terrorism), wrote in a court opinion that ruled certain interrogation methods to be prohibited under Israeli law, that despite being limited in its fight, democracy has the upper hand because ""the rule of law and the liberty of an individual constitute important components in its understanding of security. At the end of the day, they strengthen its spirit and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties."" When all is said and done, everyone -- even the lawyers who authored the infamous Department of Justice memos on interrogation techniques during the Bush administration -- agrees: Torture is prohibited, and committing it is a crime, under both the law of the United States and international law. The prohibition reflects a powerful taboo on practices that are considered moral evil. ""The torturer,"" declared the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals almost 30 years ago, ""has become like the pirate and slave trader before him hostis humani generis, an enemy of all mankind."" And as is the case with respect to piracy and slave trade, so to with torture, the law admits of no exceptions to the ban, no matter what the particular circumstances might be. The prohibition remains absolute even -- indeed particularly -- in wartime and in the face of other grave emergencies. And for good reason. Torture is intrinsically wrong. It violates the physical and mental integrity of the person subjected to it, negates that individual's autonomy and deprives him or her of human dignity. A categorical legal prohibition on torture not only reflects what decent people believe, but is also fundamental to the society we wish to live in and belong to. An absolute prohibition is also designed to prevent us from sliding down the slippery slope that would end in the use of torture in less than truly exceptional cases (just because interrogators have gotten used to employing it in ""exceptional cases"") or in applying similar methods to ""ordinary"" criminals. The Bush administration, euphemistically seeking to employ ""coercive"" interrogation techniques against al Qaeda detainees, pursued three major strategies of implausible deniability to bypass the uncompromising legal ban: It denied that certain national and international laws that prohibit torture applied to certain categories of detainees (a position squarely rejected by the Supreme Court in its 2006 Hamdan decision), it denied that the ""United States"" was engaged in torture (while, at the same time, outsourcing the business of torture to other countries), and it also denied that the United States was engaged in ""torture."" Orwellian legal constructions and definitional wizardry by lawyers demonstrating small-mindedness, technocratic reasoning, ideological motivation, and I-just-followed-orders mentality facilitated this last claim. Early Justice Department-Office of Legal Counsel memos, later repudiated by subsequent OLC memos, defined torture so narrowly as to make all interrogation practices practically appear legally permissible and approved as legal 10 specific interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. In doing so these memos not only misrepresented the law of the United States, but also showed utter disregard for, and ignorance of, international law. Other legal memos were no better. Their main purpose was to provide immunity for acts that are manifestly illegal and immoral. They were designed to give the CIA its CYA. Lawyers are not the only ones to blame. Doctors and psychologists had been involved in the process of devising and then carrying out torture. For its part, such inexcusable conduct by professionals was a link in a longer chain of systemic failures in decision-making processes and oversight mechanisms. Interrogation techniques such as waterboarding were officially imported into the CIA's arsenal without clear indication that such techniques actually worked and despite the fact that in the past those very techniques had been used in places such as Korea against American troops. Perhaps most troubling, all this happened with little, if any, meaningful and informed discussion among decision-makers. As Philip Zelikow noted, ""Especially in a time of great stress, walking into this minefield, the president was entitled to get the most thoughtful and searching analysis our government could muster."" Well, he clearly did not. And then those officials whose task it was to oversee such matters failed us again. Rep. Nancy Pelosi who, as the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee in 2002, was briefed on the interrogation methods, said that ""we were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used. What they did tell us is that they had some [legal] opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. ..."" Such excuses ring hollow and, frankly, insult our intelligence. Americans deserve better than that. And so the only claim left is the one made by former Vice President Dick Cheney and former CIA Director Michael Hayden -- that waterboarding and similar techniques actually worked. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that by ""worked"" they mean that through the use of such techniques the CIA got information that led to the foiling of future terrorist attacks. Let us even assume that such information would have been impossible to obtain using less radical methods of interrogation (both assumptions are controversial, of course). Even so, the use of torture would not become lawful. In this case, neither necessity nor effectiveness could render legal that which otherwise would have been illegal. And the absolute prohibition on torture recognizes, as we said earlier, no exceptions. As far as the law is concerned, it matters little whether torture resulted in useful intelligence leads or none at all. Consequently, no legal opinion could give advance authorization to use such techniques. If indeed such techniques had been effective that might, at most, be considered after the fact in the context of deciding whether to bring criminal charges against officials accused of violating the law or impeach them. It could also be considered in the context of ""jury nullification"" when a jury acquits a defendant despite its belief that the defendant is, in fact, guilty of the violation charged. And it might also be considered in the sentencing of officials when they are found liable for violation of the law such as by mitigating the penalties imposed on them, and in executive pardoning or clemency where criminal proceedings result in conviction. Even if any of the above takes place in the United States, the use of illegal interrogation techniques may still expose those who authorized their use and those who applied them to criminal and civil proceedings in foreign jurisdictions such as Spain and to international criminal prosecution. President Obama made it clear that he wished to move forward rather than spend energy laying blame for the past. But in order to move forward we must contend with the past. We need to deal with those who authorized and carried out crimes ""in our name."" We need to make sure that decision-making processes work as they should and that oversight mechanisms perform their functions. We need to return to an ethic of responsibility and accountability that is critical if citizens are to have faith in their government and the world is to respect this nation. This is not just a matter of the rule of law. It is a matter of national security. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Oren Gross.","Oren Gross: Torture under any circumstances is illegal and morally wrong .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier who survived a shooting this month at a Little Rock, Arkansas, recruitment center said Tuesday that he plans to stay in the Army, and he expressed gratitude for all the military has done for him and his family. Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula says he hopes to eventually become a drill sergeant. ""I like defending this country,"" said Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18. He said he was shot in his back and grazed on his head and ""my rear"" in the shooting June 1. Another soldier, Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, was killed. Authorities said the two were standing outside the recruitment center smoking when Abdulhakim Muhammad, 23, pulled up and opened fire. Muhammad is charged with one count of capital murder and 16 counts of engaging in a terrorist act, charges stemming from shots fired at an occupied building. Muhammad, a native of Memphis, Tennessee, and a Muslim convert, told authorities that he was ""mad at the U.S. military because of what they had done to Muslims in the past,"" Little Rock homicide detective Tommy Hudson said in a police report. Ezeagwula, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, said he was still a little sore but ""doing fine."" Appearing in uniform, he had little to say but added ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" when responding to reporters' questions at a news conference.  Watch Ezeagwula talk about the incident » . A recruiting commander who was with him said Ezeagwula could not comment on whether he is back home or comment at length on the shooting itself because of the ongoing court case. Ezeagwula's mother, Sonja Ezeagwula, said that when officials called to tell her about the shooting, ""I thought they were calling about my other son showing out at school."" ""I feel very good about him staying in the Army and wanting to represent the United States,"" she said. ""I think that's a wonderful thing, because most people would feel bitter or angry, but he's not. He doesn't feel that way, and I'm glad."" ""He said, 'Mama, they say I'm a hero. You believe that?' "" Sonja Ezeagwula said. ""I said, yeah. ... He was a hero before he got shot. He was our family hero."" She said her son stayed away from gangs and drugs as a youth and was doing something positive. ""He was supposed to have been a statistic from a dysfunctional family. Look what happened."" Ezeagwula and Long were part of a recruiting program called ""hometown recruiting assistance,"" under which soldiers tell their stories to potential recruits. Ezeagwula had not been deployed but was headed for Scofield Barracks near Honolulu, Hawaii, the recruiting commander said. Although his departure was delayed, he will still go there, the commander said. Ezeagwula said he joined the Army because ""I just want to help my family out. I thought it was a good way, and then when I got in it, I actually learned to love the Army."" He said he is a construction machinery operator but hopes to eventually become a sergeant and then a drill sergeant. He said he was participating in the recruitment program because he wanted to show his peers that there is more out there beyond Arkansas and that the Army is a good way to see it. He said Long's family ""welcomed me with open arms"" and has been supportive. And he expressed thanks to well-wishers and those who have offered prayers: ""I really appreciate what they have done for my family and Pvt. Long's family."" ""The Long family, those are some superb people. Extra-special people,"" Sonja Ezeagwula said. ""I just thank God. Every day, I thank God."" She said she was amazed by the outpouring of support after the shooting. ""I'm just overwhelmed with how much love Americans have for this country. I really am. And I'm glad I got a chance to see it."" She said her family is Christian, ""and we believe when something happens, God will turn it around,"" and good will come of it. Asked her feelings about Muhammad, Sonja Ezeagwula said she had no ill feelings toward him but said that she hopes justice is served and that the outcome for him, whatever it may be, is fair. Ezeagwula laughed when asked what runs through his head before he goes to sleep at night. ""I really don't know, sir,"" he said. ""A lot of things run through my mind at night. I'm still me. I really can't pay attention to that kind of stuff."" Ezeagwula said he had known Long for ""almost two weeks. He was a very nice person."" Standing outside the center before the shooting, he said, the two were discussing their trips away from Arkansas. Long said he had been to Georgia, and Ezeagwula had just returned from Missouri. When a reporter asked him whether he would quit smoking now, Ezeagwula didn't answer, but his mother said, ""Yes,"" adding that he had told her he stopped before the shooting. ""See how God will reveal it to you?"" she said.","Two privates were shot outside recruiting center last week; one died .

"(CNN) -- Facebook announced an update to Graph Search on Monday that will enable users to search for conversation topics within status updates, comments and posts. Some users with Graph Search can now browse Facebook for topics of interest â€” for example, ""posts about Breaking Bad"" or simply ""Breaking Bad."" The update also allows users to search for posts or comments from a certain time period or location (for example, ""posts by my friends from last month"") or posts that they already composed or commented on. The update makes Facebook much more conducive to real-time conversations, an area where it has been making major strides to compete with the likes of Twitter. The two social networks have been competing for eyeballs during primetime television events like the Emmys, the NFL's Monday Night Football, and Sunday's Breaking Bad finale. When users' eyes aren't glued to the TV screen, Facebook and Twitter want them to be having conversations or voicing their opinions on their respective networks. Opening up Graph Search to enable post and comment searches will help Facebook to do so. When a user logs into his profile during a primetime event, he can quickly scan all conversations about the game or his favorite show â€” even if he isn't near the top of the News Feed. If a user want to talk about an event hours (or even days) later, he can search for all relevant conversations on Facebook, something users can't easily do using Twitter. Facebook has been working to add partnerships around live media in an attempt to fuel this social conversation. Earlier this month, the social network announced a content deal with FOX Sports to promote Facebook data and conversations alongside live NFL and college football broadcasts. Facebook has also added features like searchable hashtags and verified accounts in an attempt to make finding topics of interest easier on the platform. Facebook reported on its Q2 earnings call that 88 to 100 million people are actively using the social network during primetime television hours â€” a number that Facebook advertisers will pay close attention to. Twitter is making similar efforts ahead of the company's IPO; the company is expected to file its public IPO papers as soon as this week. Just last week, Twitter announced ad partnerships with both CBS and the NFL, which will bring real-time video into your Twitter stream. Facebook's search update is not yet available to all Graph Search users, according to a company spokesperson. It will be tested starting on Monday with a small group of users and will roll out more expansively after that. Users will only be able to search for content that has been shared with them, in addition to public posts. In other words, your conversations should not appear in a search run by someone outside of your network unless your comments and posts are public.

"(CNN) -- He's won virtually everything on offer in the world of tennis, and Roger Federer took a step closer to a complete collection as he saved Switzerland from an embarrassing defeat in the Davis Cup quarterfinals on Sunday. Staring down the barrel against unfancied Kazakhstan following Saturday's doubles loss, the 17-time grand slam champion wasn't even sure he'd get to take the court in Geneva. However, his 2008 Olympics gold-medal-winning partner Stanislas Wawrinka bounced back for his first victory of the weekend to level the scores at 2-2. The Australian Open champion came from a set down to beat Mikhail Kukushkin 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 and set up a decider. ""I was hoping so much I was going to get a chance to play and not just watch Stan play,"" Federer said. ""I got the opportunity and I'm happy I lived up to the hype and the expectations, and I was able to get the boys through so very happy for them."" Federer's 7-6 (7-0) 6-2 6-3 victory over Andrey Golubev -- previously unbeaten in the competition this season -- gave him the record for most Davis Cup wins by a Swiss player, putting him past the 34 recorded by Jakob Hlasek. Hlasek was part of the only Swiss team to reach the final, losing to a star-studded U.S. team in 1992. ""I knew Stan was going to play better than Friday and I thought as well that he was going to do a better job with rhythm and against the type of player Kukushkin was, he'd find a way. That's what happened. It was tough for him for a long time,"" Federer said. ""Then personally for me, I just felt I was playing such great tennis the last six months that I would find a way as well and I did. It's a relief but it was a great feeling."" The Swiss will next play Italy, who also came from 2-1 down to end Britain's hopes of a first semifinal appearance since the World Group concept was introduced in 1981. Fabio Fognini handed two-time grand slam champion Andy Murray his first singles defeat in 19 Davis Cup matches, a run stretching back to 2005, winning 6-3 6-3 6-4 to delight the home crowd in Naples. Andreas Seppi then defeated James Ward 6-4 6-3 6-4 on the red clay to give the Italians a first semifinal appearance since 1998. France managed an even more impressive comeback, rallying from 2-0 down against Germany to set up a semifinal against two-time defending champions the Czech Republic in Nancy. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga leveled the tie by beating Tobias Kamke 6-3 6-2 6-4, then Gael Monfils completed a memorable victory as he won 6-1 7-6 (7-0) 6-2 against Peter Gowjowczyk. ""I'm just so proud of my players, because coming from 2-0 down on the first day was not easy,"" said France captain Arnaud Clement, who played in the team's 2010 final defeat against Serbia. It clinched another home tie, against a Czech side which completed a 5-0 whitewash of Japan in Tokyo.

"(CNN) -- If you love movies there is a different, and perhaps pleasingly preferable, way to spend Sunday evening other than watching the Academy Awards presentation. This will involve answering a three-part movie question. More on that in a moment. It has always been a little puzzling: why people reflexively flock to their television sets for awards programs, the Academy Awards being the oldest and most prominent. Why spend long hours watching people giving other people prizes? If you liked some of the movies that came out last year, that's fine and good -- but if you bought a pair of shoes that you liked last year, would you spend a Sunday evening in the only life you'll ever lead observing shoe manufacturers presenting awards to each other? A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week reported that 67% of Americans haven't seen any -- not even one -- of the movies nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars. That would seem to indicate a certain indifference, yet millions of people will be sitting in front of their TV sets Sunday. There is an alternate, and arguably more fulfilling, way for film lovers to affirm their appreciation for the magic of movies on Academy Awards night. From the time the multitude of pre-Oscars specials and red carpet coverage begins on various television channels late Sunday afternoon to the time the last of the post-Oscars analysis goes off the air, enough hours will pass for you to watch three feature films. We are in the golden age of being able to see, at home, the most outstanding movies ever made from every era of film history. It used to be, if you wanted to watch any movie other than what was currently in theaters, you were pretty much at the mercy of the over-the-air broadcast networks or of local stations that sometimes ran old movies very late at night. But today, with Netflix, with Amazon Prime, with various streaming services, with YouTube, with iTunes, with classic-movie channels such as TCM, with DVRs, with tablets, you have an unprecedented opportunity to all-but-effortlessly program your own home theater with wonderful movies from every era of cinema. The variety is breathtaking and endless. Sometimes we take that for granted. Roger Ebert, before he became a television presence and was still a young newspaper movie critic, used to urge his colleagues at the paper to accompany him to a seen-better-days theater in Chicago called the Clark. It was operated by a fellow named Bruce Trinz, who revered movies and who, every day of the year, would book a different double feature of classic, long-out-of-general-release films. At the beginning of every month he would mail out a leaflet with a calendar of each day's movies (he would describe them in rhyming couplets). He selected and showed 730 movies a year; the Clark was open 22 hours a day. It was a rare chance to immerse yourself in the best of movies from down through the generations. The Clark Theater is long gone, but today each person has far more movie-programming choices than the Clark ever offered. You are able to routinely stumble across movies that haven't seen the inside of a theater in years, but that can jolt you with their moments of brilliance and insight into the human condition and the mysteries of the yearning heart. Or you can just sit back and enjoy the talent and artistry in front of you; each motion picture, by its nature, offers its own enchantments, and the fact that people today can so easily make individual choices about what to see democratizes the viewing experience in a way that simply was not possible until recent decades. Years ago, when the idea of such choices sounded like a fantasy, I asked people to hypothetically consider what would happen if they were stranded on a desert island for the rest of their lives with only a movie projector and five films. What movies could they stand to watch over and over, with nothing else to keep them company? But now the options for people deciding on their own what to view are real, and, just as significant, they're infinite. So, as the Academy Awards ceremonies approach, here is a cordial invitation: . Name the three movies that, for you, would make the perfect triple feature to watch tonight. Movies that you've seen during your lifetime that have meant the most to you. Your choices don't necessarily have to be your nomination for the three greatest or most important or influential movies ever made (although they certainly could be). Just three movies that, tonight, you think would do for you the thing that movies have always done best: bring pleasure and entertainment, provoke thoughts, provide inspiration or laughter or comfort or tears. In other words: three movies to watch back-to-back-to-back tonight that will serve, better than the Academy Awards, to remind you of why you started to love movies in the first place. If you'd like, feel free to include the reasons why: What is it about your three movies that make them feel absolutely right to you? My own triple feature for tonight? I think I'll go with ""High Noon,"" the 1952 Western starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, about the power of quiet courage when it seems there's no one in the world willing to help; ""Hoosiers,"" the 1986 movie starring Gene Hackman, about a basketball team in small-town Indiana that triumphs over every obstacle; and ""That Thing You Do!"", the deliriously joyful 1996 movie written and directed by Tom Hanks, about a one-hit-wonder rock band from Erie, Pennsylvania, that briefly, in 1964, makes it to the top of the charts. Your three movies will be different. But if you decide to spend Academy Awards night watching them, by the end of the evening you will be the one who feels rewarded. And you won't even have to stand up and thank your agent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Why spend long hours watching people giving other people prizes?
Greene: Yet millions of people will watch the Academy Awards show on Sunday night .
He says instead, pick three movies that have meant the most to you for a triple feature .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to end military operations in Libya. The council adopted a resolution that rescinded its March mandate for military intervention in Libya, effectively ending the NATO mission there as of Monday. Meanwhile, U.S. officials said that 24 seriously wounded Libyan fighters will be taken Saturday to Spaulding Hospital in Boston, and six critically wounded fighters will be taken to Germany for U.S. medical care there. Their wounds can't be treated in Libya, officials said. The U.S. medical treatment was requested by Libya's National Transitional Council and is being offered as a humanitarian gesture and support for Libya's democratic aspirations, U.S. officials said. Libya's interim leaders declared their nation liberated last Sunday after the capture and killing of deposed dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, commended the NATO mission as putting Libya on a path to freedom but tempered her remarks with a word of caution. ""We're very concerned that, as we move forward, that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of Libyan society, and in which the rights of all Libyan people are fully and thoroughly respected, regardless of their gender, their religion, their region of origin,"" Rice said. ""But for the United States, and, I think, for the United Nations Security Council, this closes what I think history will judge to be a proud chapter in the Security Council's history."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague described the Security Council passage of Resolution 2016 as ""another significant milestone towards a peaceful, democratic future for Libya. Ending the no-fly zone and the civilian protection provisions demonstrates that Libya has entered a new era."" The French ambassador called it a completion of a mission to prevent Gadhafi from slaughtering his own people. ""During the seven months that have followed, we have seen dramatic events where the Libyan people have succeeded to free themselves with the support of NATO,"" said Gerard Araud. Meanwhile, Gadhafi's family will file a war crimes complaint with the International Criminal Court against NATO, a lawyer representing the family said Thursday. Members of the family believe NATO's actions led to Gadhafi's death last week, said Marcel Ceccaldi. ""All of the events that have taken place since February 2011 and the murder of Gadhafi, all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the International Criminal Court,"" Ceccaldi said. The ICC had previously issued a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest, accusing him of crimes against humanity. It still has warrants out for the arrest of Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law and intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Sanussi. Questions have been raised about how Gadhafi was killed. Amateur videos showed him alive when captured by the opposition. He died from a shot in the head, officials said, but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear. Ceccaldi said the Gadhafi family's complaint will be filed in the coming days. ""Now we will wait and see if the ICC is a judicial system which is independent and impartial,"" he added. NATO's Libya campaign began in March, after the Security Council adopted Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone in the country's airspace and authorized member states ""to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory."" There were no opposing votes on the 15-member council, but China, Russia, Germany, India and Brazil abstained. Germany said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict. The resolution became the basis for NATO's airstrikes in the North African nation. In ending the mandate Thursday, the Security Council expressed concern at the proliferation of arms in Libya and said it intends to address that issue further. The resolution also expressed ""grave concern about continuing reports of reprisals, arbitrary detentions, wrongful imprisonment and extrajudicial executions."" Last week, U.S. Admiral James Stavridis, commander of NATO's military forces, recommended that NATO wrap up its mission in Libya by October 31. NATO ministers gave preliminary approval to that plan. But U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said this week that Libya's National Transitional Council wanted NATO to stick around until it could establish governance. However, Libyan Deputy Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi told the 15-member council Wednesday that the Libyan people were looking forward to ending the NATO mission. While Libyans were grateful for the international community's support, he said, such measures felt like an infringement on Libya's sovereignty.","24 injured Libyan fighters will be treated in Boston; 6 more, in Germany .

"(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus has gotten plenty of attention in 2013, but that doesn't mean she's run out of things to say. In a recent interview with the New York Times, the year's resident bad girl discussed everything from the issue of race to whether she pressured teen heartthrob Joe Jonas to smoke weed. Here are five interesting things we learned from the interview: . 1. She's looking forward to the next Miley Cyrus -- whoever that may be. Cyrus is fully aware that America has a short attention span, even when it comes to celebs who like to stir the pot. ""Even when I hear that -- that someone, two years from now, is going to be the next kind of provocateur -- like, I can't wait to collab with whoever the hell that is, you know,"" she told the Times. ""I'm like, whoever that is, I'm going to ride that wave."" 2. It's rock 'n' roll, people! The singer would like to remind people that she's a musician and they sometimes are edgy. The now 21-year-old former teen star says she has gone from ""people just thinking I was, like, a baby to people thinking I'm this, like, sex freak that really just pops molly and does lines all day."" ""It's like, 'Has anyone ever heard of rock 'n' roll?' "" Cyrus said. ""There's a sex scene in pretty much every single movie, and they go, 'Well, that's a character.' Well, that's a character. I don't really dress as a teddy bear and, like, twerk on Robin Thicke, you know?"" 3. Other stars don't want to be associated with her. Of course stars often hang out with other equally famous people, but Cyrus said she thinks some celebs are afraid of being associated with her. She doesn't have a ton of famous friends, she said, but she sometimes gets other celebs to cut loose -- only to quickly rein it back in for fear of the repercussions. ""I'll get someone to, like, flash me, and they'll be, like, 'You have to delete it!' I had to do that when I was 14 or 15, but even then I didn't care,"" she said. ""Like, if someone was videoing me ripping a bong, I didn't care, so it's just funny to me. I'm like: 'Dude, you're 30. Like, why can't someone see a picture of your (breasts)?' "" 4. Call her racist all you want; she knows the truth. Some people called Miley's controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards racist. She thought, ""How do I win? If I have white dancers, then I'm racist. If I have black girl dancers, then I'm racist."" Not only does she know she's not a racist, she said, but the criticism has not changed her thinking about race. Just like her 80-year-old grandmother never thought to see an African-American president in her lifetime, Cyrus said, she knows that people's thinking will continue to evolve. ""I really thought about it a lot when Nelson Mandela passed away, because I couldn't even imagine living this life and seeing how much it's changed,"" she said. ""So, you know, I look forward to when I'm older, my kids being like, 'What do you mean people ever even talked about what color your dancers were?' "" 5. She longs for the day rising star Ariana Grande can be free. If anyone knows about the confines of being a star to the masses of teens and tweens, it's Cyrus. That's why she says she would like to see singer and Nickelodeon star Ariana Grande be able to be a bit edgier. Grande has had a big year, with Top 40 hits and tons of exposure, but no way is she walking on the wild side like Cyrus. ""She's trying,"" Cyrus said. ""I see her wearing the shorter things. She comes in, and she goes, 'This made me feel like you.' And I'm like, 'That was like my sixth-grade prom dress.' ""","Miley Cyrus recently sat down for a chat with the New York Times .
She said she thinks other stars don't want to be associated with her .
She would like to collaborate with the next provocateur ."

"KIGALI, Rwanda (CNN) -- Twenty years on from the 100 days of the Rwandan genocide, and many here are still in search of closure. In April 1994 hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus were murdered by Hutu militias. The Rwandan government has asked that this be a time of reflection and unity, through forgiveness and reconciliation. But for many Rwandans the reality of what it actually takes to forgive is one they struggle with every day. Niyonsenga Erick Rafiki is 24 years old. His memories of his father, he says, have grown hazy with time. ""The night he was killed I don't really remember that since I can't even remember where I was,"" says Rafiki. ""But after the genocide had ended, I started following up on stories that were informing me on how he died that night."" Rafiki's search for answers eventually brought him face-to-face with his father's killers, and a day he says he feels he's waited all his life for. His father's killers have promised to help him find the body. ""I never had a chance to bury my parent as his child in a decent way and I didn't how he was killed, didn't even know how he was buried. This became a burden in my heart,"" Rafiki tells CNN. As Rafiki talks, a little distance away Sekamana Musa and two other man are digging, Musa served 10 years in prison for his crimes during the genocide, among them the murder of Rafiki's father. The locale is where, Musa believes, the body was buried 20 years ago. For victim and perpetrator, coming together to finally bury with dignity those who died has become an act of penance. ""I confessed and told the truth of what happened so I was released from prison -- when I came out I found the people we had committed crimes against,"" Musa said. ""Be it the mother of this boy and the boy himself. Even though I was scared, they also got scared to see me. I managed to get close to them though, through other people that helped me to get a better way of reaching them. And it happened slowly by slowly."" ""We came together saying these hands we are using are for all Rwandans -- because these hands destroyed the country, we have to use them to rebuild it."" Across Rwanda thousands of ""genocidaires"" as they're called are still in custody. Those found guilty of involvement in the genocide can only be released by presidential pardon. The last was seven years ago, when 8,000 were released back in to their communities. In Nyarugenge Prison 54-year-old Nyirandegeya Mwamini waits to hear whether she will be among those set free. Mwamini was part of the Interahamwe militia, the Hutu militia intent on wiping out all trace of the Tutsis . As she remembers the horrors she inflicted 20 years ago, even she is unable to explain how it happened. ""I am not proud of it. The people I lived with and the people I worked with could never understand why I became an Interahamwe, a killer ... Every time I think about it, I am crying always."" Her one hope, she says, is that one day she, too, will be able to eventually seek out those she wronged and play a role in her nation's healing. ""The genocide will never fade out -- even to killers or those who participated, like us, that picture, where (the) international community has seen you as a killer -- can never go away from you easily, and just say it is over,"" says Mwamini. ""But my hope is not for me -- it is for my children and those who are linked to me, that they can never be part of what I went through."" As the sun begins to set Rafiki and his father's killers are still digging and still hoping. Giving up, Rafiki says, is not an option. ""I will continue looking for him until I find him. Whenever they tell me that they suspect where he might be -- I will use all means possible to find him."" And when he does, Musa will be right by his side, hoping to finally make amends for the horrors he inflicted all those years ago. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans died during the brutal ethnic genocide .
The victims: Tutsis and moderate Hutus .
The killers: Hutu militia members .

"(CNN) -- This holiday season, families will gather by the fire -- or most likely by the television set -- to spend some quality time together, recording memories more valuable than any money could buy. Even during such precious moments though, the specter of materialism remains an ever present force. For as we all know, Christmas wouldn't be nearly as much fun without Santa paying us a fruitful visit. And come January, tempers fray when those eagerly awaited presents start to lose their shine and the bills need settling. That paradox was perhaps unwittingly highlighted by two of the world's most influential characters this year: one was the Pope; the other the Mayor of London. And just as the gap between rich and poor continues to yawn alarmingly wide, so too it seems does the difference in their approaches to money and the inequality it creates. Using the first peace message of his pontificate to preach against the cult of high finance, Pope Francis railed against huge salaries and bonuses. ""How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure,"" he asked, "" but it is news when the stock market loses 2 points?"" Without ""rejecting the absolute autonomy of the markets and financial speculation ..... no solution will be found for the world's problems,"" he said. The 77 year-old pontiff's criticism of the capitalist system has been so scathing of late that he has been forced to deny he is a closet Marxist after arguing today's ""idolization of money"" wasn't just morally wrong, it was devastating for society. Make no mistake. ""Such an economy,' he said, 'kills."" But does it really? Or does it motivate rather than maim? Boris Johnson, who granted isn't always mentioned in the same sentence as His Holiness, told Londoners recently to embrace the worship of wealth. Not only was greed good, he suggested in echoes of Wall Street's famous corporate raider Gordon Gekko, but the need to ""keep up with the Jones's"" was a powerful social stimulant for those who managed to maintain their place on life's treadmill. And for those who lost their footing? In Johnson's usual semi-serious view: charity -- not God -- would provide. ""Inequality is essential for the spirit of envy,"" he said, ""stimulating brain activity,"" and countering falling wages elsewhere. While the extreme views of London's Mayor may have shocked many outside the capital's affluent postcodes, a quick survey of my Twitter followers threw up the surprising revelation that even during these days of hardship, Johnson's unique brand of trickle down economics wasn't quite as unpopular as expected. Many called him a realist. In fairness, Johnson's speech was a calculated power play for the UK's hardline Conservative base, who have the luxury of planning how to build upon their net worth. By contrast, Pope Francis's words offer a thought provoking appeal for altruism to counter an increasingly selfish world. Perhaps predictably, they come from the heart of a man who has experienced hardships first hand, as a son of poor immigrants in Argentina, who when elected to lead the Catholic Church chose the name of a saint who turned his back on a life of riches. The two messages -- one cruel, the other caring -- if anything are evidence of today's increasingly polarized views on the importance of fortune and fate in today's post-austerity era. That's a debate which will become more prominent in 2014 as the economy flourishes once more and electorates ask themselves what they have learned from the last boom-and-bust cycle. Either way, if there is one thing these two statements do show it's that money -- however idolatrous it may be -- is just as important for bringing people together as much as tearing them apart. As we probably learn every holiday season as we sit down to unwrap those parcels ...","Even during the holiday season, the specter of materialism remains, writes CNN's Nina Dos Santos .

"(CNN) -- The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) takes very seriously its duty of protecting endangered and vulnerable species from extinction. Our European Endangered Species Programmes (EEP) have been established to ensure a viable future for endangered animals -- including giraffes -- despite the destruction of their habitats and rampant poaching of wild animals. More than 700 giraffes are kept within our institutions to the highest possible standards of welfare and care by zoos such as Copenhagen, and EAZA monitors breeding closely to ensure that the species has the genetic diversity it needs to have the best possible chance of survival in the long term. While we understand that some members of the public are upset by the euthanization of the giraffe at Copenhagen zoo, the protection of the species as a whole must be our priority. Our resources are regrettably finite, and as a result, the EEP must prioritize animals which can contribute to the overall genetic health of the captive population. This means that in rare cases (five in the case of giraffes in EAZA zoos since records began in 1828), animals must be removed from the population by management euthanasia. Compare this to the 60 billion+ healthy, young animals killed each year worldwide for human consumption. In-breeding is a serious problem that can lead to genes being passed on that increase the population's susceptibility to disease and other chronic conditions which threaten the future of the species in our care. Zoo staff get death threats . As for alternative solutions, we cannot in good conscience recommend the transfer of animals under our protection to zoos which are not our members and therefore not subject to our strict standards of animal husbandry and welfare; transfer within our network does not represent a solution to the unsuitability of the individual animal for breeding. Contraception is difficult and in its infancy for female giraffes, and can be irreversible. Castration of a male animal can have also undesirable side-effects, and a place that could otherwise be reserved for an animal that can contribute to its species' future is lost. Release into the wild of this single individual would almost certainly result in early death for the animal, after a long and stressful journey of thousands of kilometers -- reintroduction is an intensive and complicated matter and we would not countenance this unless recommended to by the IUCN, the paramount global body for nature conservation. All of these alternatives were explored, and none were found to be viable; in addition, EAZA's position is supported by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). EAZA members do not euthanize animals lightly, and we are saddened by the death of any animal in our care. Nonetheless, we strongly support Copenhagen Zoo, which has an exemplary record of animal welfare, education, research and conservation, and which took great pains to be transparent about the situation -- 7,000 visitors came to Copenhagen Zoo on Sunday, while 15 protesters stood outside. The Copenhagen public spoke with their tickets to the zoo and left knowing far more about the real threats to conservation of giraffes in the wild. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lesley Dickie.","The Copenhagen zoo is an institution of The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria .

"London (CNN) -- Latin goodbyes sometimes lack the finality of Anglo-Saxon ones. In Italian, for instance, the expression ""arrivederci"" doesn't mean a definite adieu but rather ""until we meet again."" Yet even in Italy there are occasions when people want their farewells to be lasting, as the country's ultimate comeback king may finally have to concede. After being convicted for tax fraud and facing more legal woes for cavorting with an underage call girl, Silvio Berlusconi will likely be banned from public office soon. A desperate attempt by the three-time prime minister to thwart a vote on his exclusion backfired in spectacular fashion, when even his anointed heir refused to follow orders and torpedo the government. The message to Berlusconi this time was not just ""goodbye,"" but ""good riddance."" Still, as lifelong opponents prepare to raise a glass to a fresh era, one can't help but wonder what this new Italy will look like without its familiar Silvio sideshow. READ MORE: Monti says Berlusconi will not be part of Italian parliament again . If the 77-year-old's antics were a welcome distraction from the country's slide down the world league tables, then what vision -- if any -- will this disparate bunch of successors have? Since rising to prominence during the power vacuum that followed Italy's corruption scandals in the 1990s, Berlusconi has dominated the political and business arena for more than two decades. His detractors will say he has done countless damage to their nation's reputation and taken a wrecking ball to its economy -- leaving generations to come with a hefty price to pay. READ MORE: The end for 'Il Cavaliere'? Furthermore, Berlusconi has undermined the rule of law by pursuing a personal vendetta against the judiciary and used parliament to pass bills that protected his interests. But for all his pantomime charades at home and abroad, one has to acknowledge the ex-premier has earned some quiet respect for at least staying the course. He may have been a polarizing figure but that cheeky charisma and flagrant disregard for the rules left no one unaware of who he was. Sly old Silvio, for all his schoolboy jokes, held together some of the longest-serving governments in the history of the Italian Republic and though his agenda today may not tally with that of a serious country, his party's latest incarnation won a third of the vote at the last elections. In Italy, one quickly learns that few actually admit to supporting Berlusconi yet each time the country votes his followers flock to the ballot box in droves. READ MORE: A look at Berlusconi's life . The truth is in years gone by Berlusconi's confidence and swagger were contagious. His secret: In the absence of any committed opposition to appeal to voters' guilty pleasures, even if that meant offending everyone from ethnic minorities to Angela Merkel along the way. Millions of Italians were lulled into a false sense of security by the kind of populist rhetoric only the really, really rich like Berlusconi can spout with a straight face. But in an age when Italy needs to re-establish its credibility and pay off its debts his views are outdated, vacuous and inappropriate. The tycoon's recent attempt to jeopardize his country's future wellbeing merely to save his fading political career was nakedly selfish and fatally misjudged. It bore the hallmarks of an increasingly desperate septuagenarian who faces the prospect of retirement with fear and dread. Not even the prospect of a fiancee almost 50 years his junior will be enough to keep him at home, much to Italy's chagrin. Even if he is ejected from the state's decision-making bodies, it's unlikely what's left of Berlusconi's clout will disappear overnight. His vast media empire will lobby from behind the scenes in print and on TV, employing guerrilla tactics to undermine the tough austerity Italy's new leaders must pursue if they have a hope of fixing its perilous finances. And so, as Berlusconi contemplates his future and a year's sentence under possible house arrest, the Italians may have finally realized this entertaining former leader is no longer good for their country. What they certainly know though is life will be more mundane without him.","Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's ultimate comeback king, might finally be out of politics for good .

"London (CNN) -- Writing almost a century after the Acts of Union joined Scotland with England, and 50 years since its Jacobite uprisings were brutally supressed, the bard Robert Burns bemoaned the real reason behind his nation's loss of independence: money and its ability to sway the vote. ""The English steel we could disdain, . Secure in valor's station; . But English gold has been our bane, . Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!"" Two world wars and countless upheavals have come to pass since, with Scotland standing valiantly -- if sometimes uneasily -- alongside the rest of the United Kingdom. Yet one question has never ceased to prey upon its people's psyche: would Scotland be better off on its own? And what would have happened had its own parliament, which Burns so bitterly berates, not condoned a merger between the two famous foes? On 18 September, some 300 years after that fateful marriage, the people of Scotland -- not England, Wales or Northern Ireland -- will finally have their chance to reverse that move in a ground-breaking referendum. And, once again, finances are likely to play a significant role. With a population less than a tenth the size of the UK's and a GDP worth a quarter of a trillion dollars, Scotland's inhabitants are relatively comfortable in comparison to many of their neighbors across the border. Scotland enjoys its own legal and education systems, as well as more generous healthcare provisions than England. It has its own parliament in Edinburgh and Scottish MPs can represent their constituencies in Westminster too, which in effect gives Scotland two voices in one home nation. Still, the ruling Scottish National Party believes that Scotland should be separate; that its foundations are not only sturdy enough to support an independent state, but also to nurture a new tiger economy in northern Europe, as Burns may well have enthused. How so? Because independence, the SNP argues, would give Scotland leeway to cut taxes and to lift those in need out of poverty. It would reduce the country's share of the UK's debt burden and bring back skills and manufacturing eroded by Margaret Thatcher's deeply divisive policies there three decades ago. What's more, with Britain often challenging its European neighbors on policy, Scotland would like its own dialogue with the international community, saying it aims to join the United Nations and NATO should independence be won. A noble cause for sure. But just like Burns's famous poetry, the plot is rich in idealism and light on practicalities, for many of Scotland's pro-independence arguments are based on the assumption that it would be granted automatic membership to a few key clubs without having to wait in line. One is the Bank of England, the other the European Union, and neither is sending Scotland a welcome message. Britain's chancellor recently ruled out allowing an independent Scotland into a shared monetary union. This means that if the nation were to keep the pound as its currency, Scotland would have no control over interest rates and no central bank to bail out its large financial services sector. And for those pro-independence Scots who thought adopting the euro could be a solution, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso appears to have scotched those plans as well, asserting Scotland would have to go through the whole rigmarole of EU accession first and may find its path blocked by existing member states, fearful of their own separatist movements like Spain. Whether Barroso is right, or as some former EU officials have declared, wrong, the roadmap for Scotland's independent state after a potential ""yes"" vote is so convoluted that some of the country's biggest businesses have already begun to draw up contingency plans. Standard Life, with more funds under management than the size of Scotland's entire economy, has become the first major firm to consider upping sticks and heading south should the sovereignty of its homeland be restored, in an action that could put 5,000 jobs under threat. Burns was right in saying gold was key to his country's future. But today ""black gold"" also comes into the equation. After years of alleged shoddy stewardship of Scotland's oil and gas reserves by Britain's central government, pro-independence campaigners reckon the country would be more effective at managing its own resources, keeping profits in a windfall fund that could be used to top up the budget where necessary. The UK prime minister David Cameron, however, is adamant those offshore wells would be best served by the ""broad shoulders"" of Britain and to prove the point he's committing money -- some 300 millions of dollars of it -- to recover 4 billion barrels lost in production. But let's not cry over spilled oil for Scotland! There's plenty at stake for the rest of the UK should Scotland choose to go it alone. And while the referendum has been presented as a binary choice, it's not a zero-sum game. The dissolution of the Union would have a profound effect on the both parties' clout on the world stage at a time when the EU is seeking a major free trade deal with the United States. As if to underline this very point, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel chose to speak of the role ''a strong United Kingdom'' should play in Europe in her state visit to the country. Surrendering large swathes of Scottish industry would make a mockery of Britain's plans to double its exports -- many of which coincidentally are headed for Germany -- to 1.6 trillion dollars by 2020 and throw businesses with branches on both sides of the boundary into disarray. So, if it's fair to say pro-independence Scots are not too clear on why their realm would be more prosperous alone, why continue to fight for freedom? Scottish separatism has as much to do with protecting the region's ancient cultural history and reviving auld allies as it does with managing the country's books. And an independent Scotland could affect the UK's entire defense strategy, opening up an unpredictable flank at its northern extremity in the very place where Britain currently houses its nuclear deterrent. The web of interests, at times, seems so interminable and the complexities surrounding Scotland's choice so hard to grasp that even the country's own politicians are now weary of talking in hypotheticals, not to mention the 16-year-olds who have been granted suffrage just in time. The truth is the fortunes of Scotland and England are now woven together more tightly than the finest Campbell Tartan. And when it comes to Scotland and its role within the UK, it's the trade ties that bind, even if the talk risks tearing them apart.

"(CNN) -- Outside the windows of a C-130 cargo plane, the ocean spreads out in all directions. Somewhere below, it is believed, are the remains of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on a journey from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. But a sighting has eluded searchers so far, and the mystery surrounding the plane grows. ""This is still a search and rescue operation as far as the Malaysian government is concerned,"" CNN's Saima Mohsin said as she accompanied the crew of the C-130. The military plane was flying at just 500 feet above sea level, with searchers peering out the windows. All that could be seen on the water were rescue ships, also on the mission. Search aircraft were covering an area of about 12,500 square nautical miles. Local fishermen have even been asked to help. ""Crucial time is passing,"" David Gallo, with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""That search area -- that haystack -- is getting bigger and bigger and bigger."" Indeed, that search area grew Tuesday. A senior Malaysian Air Force official told CNN that Flight 370 was hundreds of miles off course, traveling in the opposite direction from its original destination and had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared. If correct, those ominous signs could call into question whether someone in the cockpit might have deliberately steered the plane away from its intended destination, a former U.S. aviation investigator said. ""This kind of deviation in course is simply inexplicable,"" said Paul Goelz, former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. Nearly three dozen aircraft and 40 ships from 10 countries have so far failed to find any sign of the aircraft, which took off from Kuala Lumpur shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday (noon Friday ET). The Boeing 777-200ER was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Gallo described what will happen once some debris from the aircraft is found, though he stressed there's still no evidence the plane hit the water. ""Once a piece of the debris is found -- if it did impact on the water -- then you've got to backtrack that debris to try to find the 'X marks the spot' on where the plane actually hit the water, because that would be the center of the haystack. ""And in that haystack you're trying to find bits of that needle -- in fact, in the case of the flight data recorders, you're looking for a tiny little bit of that needle,"" he said. 'Not hopeless' According to the Malaysian Air Force official, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, the plane's transponder apparently stopped working at about the time flight controllers lost contact with it, near the coast of Vietnam. The Malaysian Air Force lost track of the plane over Pulau Perak, a tiny island in the Strait of Malacca -- many hundreds of miles from the usual flight path for aircraft traveling between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, the official said. If data cited by the source is correct, the aircraft was flying away from Beijing and on the opposite side of the Malay Peninsula from its scheduled route. Previous accounts had the aircraft losing touch with air traffic control near the coast of Vietnam. Rescue officials have expanded the search area. ""What I'm seeing here is clearly they have no idea,"" said CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. ""They know roughly the area, but even there they are starting to scrabble around as to -- was it going in this direction? Had it turned round?"" Quest described the search as ""extremely painstaking work,"" suggesting that a grid would have been drawn over the ocean and that teams are combing the area, bit by bit. Although the work is challenging, he is confident that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be found. ""It's not hopeless by any means. They will find it,"" Quest said. ""They have to. They have to know what happened."" U.S. officials expressed frustration Tuesday with the way the search has been handled. ""To me, every minute counts here. And that was such a key point -- that the plane actually reversed course and was flying back over Malaysia toward Indonesia. Why wasn't that made known? Why weren't jets scrambled? Why wasn't an alert put out on that immediately?"" said Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee. ""So far they seemed to have dropped the ball at every level. I hate to be the Monday morning quarterback, but it appears as if they've basically done nothing right so far,"" he said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers echoed King's comments when he spoke to CNN's Erin Burnett. ""The Malaysians have not been fully cooperative in making this a scientific search pattern using all the assets very wisely. So you start out in one place, and you're 500 miles away the next day. That tells me that they've got a lot of gaps to try to fill,"" he said. 'Still a mystery' Gallo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, speaks from experience. He helped lead the search for the recorders of Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. The Air France flight was en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of Flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. It took even longer to find the cause of the disaster. In 2011, the aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. ""In this case, I thought for sure -- in a highly trafficked area where there's lots of air traffic, lots of ship traffic, not far from shore -- that for sure this would be a more rapid finding of some remnants of the plane -- but nothing,"" Gallo told CNN's Blitzer, comparing the Malaysia Airlines and Air France flights. Cmdr. William Marks of the Navy's U.S. 7th Fleet also spoke to Blitzer. He said the Gulf of Thailand is ""pretty much saturated,"" but that the Strait of Malacca is ""not quite"" because ""it's harder to get things over there."" Marks spoke by phone while aboard the USS Blue Ridge, which is assisting in the search. ""It's not a matter of if we can see something. We certainly can. We've picked up small wooden crates on our radar. We've picked up something as small as a soccer ball or a basketball. So we can see if things are out there. ""Now this is U.S. Navy technology -- not everyone has this same technology,"" he said Tuesday. A day earlier, Marks told Blitzer the search area was growing on account of currents and the wind. ""It's a very large search area, but still a mystery -- still a lot of question marks."" Interpol 'inclined to conclude' Malaysia Airlines disappearance not terror .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Up a river without a paddle. That's the situation an adventurous California sea lion found himself in after swimming up the San Joaquin River, ending up at Mape's Ranch in Modesto, California, about a 100-mile drive from the Pacific Ocean. ""The pup traveled a mile away from the river, and surprisingly was found in the middle of one of our new baby almond orchards,"" said Billy Lyons, manager of the family-owned ranch. ""I hope everything turns out OK."" Luckily for the sea lion -- nicknamed ""Hoppie"" -- it looks like they will. The pup is recovering back along the coast at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California. He was underweight and malnourished when he arrived there last month but is eating well and gaining strength. After finding Hoppie, Lyons contacted the nearby San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge. Assistant wildlife refuge manager Eric Hopson arrived on site and with the help of ranch hands helped corral the sea lion into a trap, said Jack Sparks with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Photographs provided by Sparks show Hoppie in a crate. In one, he appears to be fast asleep, nuzzled up against white towels. Hopson then contacted The Marine Mammal Center, which agreed to take the pup. He met a representative from the center in the parking lot of a strip mall to make the hand off, Sparks said. Hoppie is not the first California sea lion to swim up the San Joaquin River channel, according to The Marine Mammal Center. Another sea lion -- nicknamed ""Chippy"" -- made the same journey in 2004. He was found by police officers atop a cruiser. Sick sea lion ends up on hotel patio . Lost sea lion pup visits neighborhood .

"Washington (CNN) -- New questions were being asked Wednesday after a video surfaced showing what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. Did U.S. intelligence officials even know the meeting was taking place? ""I can't imagine that they knew about this meeting. After all, there have been seven drone attacks in Yemen this year. There was one on April 1, so it's not like the drone program is being suspended,"" Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst, told ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""It seems to me we don't know for a fact if they did or did not know about this meeting, but common sense would suggest that they missed it,"" he said. U.S. officials aren't commenting on that, but every frame of the video is now being analyzed as a potential piece of intelligence. Analysts are looking at a flashy white truck that appears, leading a convoy. They are even analyzing the fruit juice being served as a possible clue. In the middle of the clip, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi is the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In a speech to the group, al-Wuhayshi makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" The video started appearing on jihadist websites recently, drawing the attention of U.S. officials and global terrorism experts. U.S. officials say they believe it's authentic. They believe the highly produced video is recent. With some fighters' faces blurred, there is worry it signals a new round of plotting. Asked by Blitzer why al Qaeda would release such a video, Bergen speculated that the group did it for propaganda purposes. ""To show we're here. We're still in operation,"" he said. ""This group is still potentially a pretty virulent threat, unfortunately."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. The CIA and the Pentagon have killed multiple AQAP leaders with drone strikes. But the group is now emboldened. Retired Gen. Mark Kimmitt said smaller al Qaeda affiliates are coalescing into a more organized base. ""Sooner or later, if they continue to get better, stronger and more organized,"" he said, ""they will be a direct threat to the United States."" It's unlikely the United States wasn't aware of the meeting shown in the video, Kimmitt told ""CNN Tonight."" ""The question isn't why didn't we know,"" he said. ""The question is: What are we going to do about it?"" CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E. Shoichet and Bill Weir contributed to this report.","A video shows what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years .

"(CNN) -- Spanish art dealer Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz helped persuade wealthy buyers to shell out millions of dollars for works he claimed famous masters of modern art had painted. But in reality, U.S. authorities allege, the works he sold as Rothkos and Pollocks were fakes painted by an artist he met on a Manhattan street corner. The alleged scheme stretched for nearly two decades, involved several New York art galleries and earned the conspirators more than $30 million, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court on Monday. Last week, authorities closed in on Bergantiños and his brother, arresting them in Spain, federal prosecutors said. The brothers, according to the indictment, face conspiracy and money laundering charges. The painter, Pei Shen Qian, was also indicted. He's accused of making false statements to FBI agents, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Investigators believe he fled to China as the alleged scheme started to unravel. The indictment is the latest chapter in a case that's rattled the modern art world, involving several galleries and wealthy buyers. Galleries made more than $80 million off of dozens of fake works, the indictment alleges. And Bergantiños and his associates made more than $33 million. ""Today's charges paint a picture of perpetual lies and greed. As alleged, the defendants tricked victims into paying more than $33 million for worthless paintings which they fabricated in the names of world-famous artists,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement Monday. ""The Bergantiños Diaz brothers then laundered and hid their illegal proceeds overseas. With today's Indictment, the defendants must now answer for their alleged roles as modern masters of forgery and deceit."" What started with a meeting between Bergantiños and Qian on a New York street corner evolved into an elaborate plot, the indictment alleges. Qian would paint works in his home in Queens, New York. Then Bergantiños and his associates would peddle them through galleries to unsuspecting buyers who paid millions, the indictment says. The alleged forged works purported to be paintings by famous artists, including Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell and Clyfford Still, the indictment says. But long before the works of art were sold, according to the indictment, Bergantiños played a role in the forgeries. To make the paintings more convincing, Bergantiños bought old canvases at flea markets, stained newer canvases with tea bags to make them look older and gave Qian old paint to use. Then, after the works were completed, according to the indictment, Bergantiños ""subjected many fake works to various processes, such as heating them, cooling them, and exposing them to the elements outdoors, in an attempt to make the fake works seem older than they actually were."" In at least one instance, the indictment says, Bergantiños used a blow dryer to heat up a forged painting. Authorities have said his girlfriend, Glafira Rosales, was a key player in the alleged conspiracy. After pleading guilty last year to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and filing false federal income tax returns, she's awaiting sentencing in federal court. In an interview with Bloomberg in Shanghai last year, Qian admitted imitating modern masters' works, but said he never intended to pass them off for profit. In court documents, prosecutors allege he received between several hundred and several thousand dollars for paintings the art dealers and galleries sold for millions. ""I made a knife to cut fruit,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""But if others use it to kill, blaming me is unfair."" If the lawsuits filed against Bergantiños and his associates are any indication, there's already plenty of finger-pointing over the alleged forgeries. A number of civil cases against him are still pending, according to federal court records. It was not immediately clear whether Bergantiños had legal representation or whether Spanish authorities plan to extradite him to the United States. Confiscated art collection returned .

"(CNN) -- Oprah, if you're reading this, for goodness sake return this woman's calls. Ask your assistants if there's a box of yellowing fax messages lying around somewhere in Harpo Studios -- she sent you one daily for a while. Track down the ton of letters asking -- pleading -- for your help starting a Winfrey-style talk show in Africa. Because this isn't just another eager fan. Her name is Mosunmola Abudu, and in the last eight years she's done it -- and then some. With no TV experience whatsoever, Abudu has become the ""Oprah of Africa"" -- it's impossible not to read an interview with the glamorous 49-year-old without the moniker cropping up. And with good reason. Breezing into CNN's London studios, electric blue dress clinging to her slim figure, glossy pink eye shadow and lipstick to match, Abudu is in her element, the sound bites coming thick and fast. And why wouldn't the mother-of-two be comfortable in front of the camera? This is the face of ""Moments with Mo,"" the hugely successful talk show Abudu founded in 2006, attracting such high profile guests as Hillary Clinton and IMF chief Christine Lagarde. The manicured Mo and her guests lounge in plush apartments, chat over coffee, contemplate tasteful visual cues. Africa's first syndicated talk show was so slick that people initially questioned whether it could actually have been created in Nigeria. Abudu assured them it was. There was more to come. Nine months ago she started Ebony Life TV -- Africa's first global black entertainment network. Oprah who? ""When I started my journey into television, there was nothing that I didn't try, to reach this woman,"" says Abudu about her early attempts to contact Ms Winfrey. ""We sat for days on end, would send daily faxes, would send weekly faxes. At some point, when we didn't get a response, we realized that Oprah wasn't going to save us, she wasn't there to help us to get this talk show of Africa started. And then I just basically got out there and said 'let's just do the very best that we can.'"" Mo's big moment . Winfrey or not, in less than a decade Abudu has built a TV network creating 1,000 hours of programming yearly. And there are plans to make even more channels -- all under the Ebony Life banner. But what makes Abudu's story remarkable is not that she conquered African TV -- but that she did it without any prior media experience. ""I went on a training course for learning how to present, went back and said: 'Here I am and I want to produce my own talk show!'"" said the British-born entrepreneur in an interview with CNN's Stephanie Busari. ""Of course, there were many knock backs along the way, many people telling me 'you can't do these things.' But I think what's important in life is that you believe in yourself and the things you can do."" Before she was the queen of African chat shows, Abudu was a head of human resources at oil giant ExxonMobil for a decade. Then there's the consultancy firm she set up, the executive-training center she developed, and the charity she founded. The 'other' Africa . So where did this drive to be on TV come from? Abudu puts it down to a ""deep-seated passion to tell Africa's story."" Even if that meant standing in the middle of London with a microphone. ""A couple of years ago I stood there with a microphone, and just randomly stopped people in the street,"" explained Abudu. ""I said: 'When you hear the word Africa, what comes to mind?'"" ""I heard 'starving children, poverty, HIV, Mugabe.' I heard 'babies with flies on their faces.' And my next question was: 'Why do you think this of Africa?' And the response was: 'It's what I read in the newspapers, it's what I see on television.' Because that's the popular notion of Africa."" Not if Abudu has anything to do with it. Her show celebrates a very different continent, one brimming with entrepreneurs, academics, and artists, all taking their place on her coveted couch. ""It's glossy, it's got razzmatazz,"" she says about her network's distinctive style. ""It shows that there's a new generation of Africans out there that want this content they can identify with, that speaks to them."" Dream big . Born in London, Abudu spent her early years between the UK and Africa. On holidays she would visit her grandparents' cocoa farm, and remembers them spreading out beans to dry in the Nigerian sun. Growing up in 1960s Britain was tough for one of only three black children in her school. She was asked questions like: ""Do you guys live in tress? Do you dance around fires? What do you eat for breakfast?"" When she was 11 years old, Abudu's father died, and her 73-year-old mother still remains a huge source of strength and inspiration. ""She is very prayerful woman. I am very prayerful woman. So I find that through working hard and praying hard a lot of things just get done,"" she said. It seems the 'Oprah of Africa' doesn't need Ms Winfrey after all.

"(CNN) -- This morning in New York City, Rupert Murdoch held a press event announcing the launch of The Daily, the world's first iPad-only ""newspaper."" While I listened to the streaming audio, I was scanning the news -- and I spotted a headline that should probably make News Corp. nervous about its new venture: Apple blocks Sony e-book app. Is Kindle next? First, a bit about The Daily, per today's announcement: . According to News Corp, iPad owners can subscribe to The Daily with one click, at a weekly rate of 99 cents. An annual subscription costs $39.99. The publication also will display paid advertising. Furthermore, Murdoch confirmed that the iPad will probably be the only provider for The Daily for this year and next year. Eventually News Corp. will be developing editions for all tablet platforms, but for right now, it's effectively an iPad exclusive -- which means News Corp. is relying heavily on the terms of the deal it's worked out with Apple to make the economics of this venture pay off. Meanwhile, there's that Apple/Sony/Kindle flap, which was sparked largely by this New York Times article. In a nutshell, Apple rejected Sony's new iPhone/iPad e-reader app from its app store in part because that app would jump readers out into the mobile browser in order to buy e-books. This strategy skirts Apple's considerable 30% cut for in-app purchases -- and it's how Amazon's popular Kindle app has handled purchases from the beginning. Apple claims that this is not a bait-and-switch rule change. The Times ran this quote from an Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller: . ""We have not changed our developer terms or guidelines. ... We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app with in-app purchase."" Which is where Apple takes its 30% cut. I'm sure News Corp. has worked out with Apple a percentage of subscription revenues that go to Apple. And that's fair, since Apple is providing distribution for The Daily. But what if those terms were to effectively change without notice? This Sony decision could very likely be a red flag that Apple is willing to change the rules of how it does business without notice, in ways that could affect all of its app providers. News Corp. has invested lavishly in The Daily, reportedly $30 million, including a staff of 120 and prime Manhattan office space. They're betting heavily that The Daily will pay off big. But if I were Rupert Murdoch -- or Amazon, for that matter -- right now I would be afraid for my iOS-dependent ventures. Very afraid. It might be a good idea for News Corp. to bump up the development schedule for its Android edition.","News Corporation launched a iPad newspaper called The Daily .

"ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (CNN) -- ""Quick, I-V."" ""Is he breathing?"" ""Flip him over."" ""Heart rate? Pulse?"" The nurses' commands and questions filled the recovery room at an Egyptian hospital. Adnan Saleh's ""after"" photo. The tot from Egypt received surgery from Operation Smile to fix a cleft lip. Seven-month-old Adnan Saleh had just come out of surgery to fix a cleft lip. But suddenly his newly repaired mouth was filling with blood. The post-op nurses rushed to make sure he didn't choke. ""Mother! We need a mama,"" one of the male nurses shouted in his South African accent, once Adnan was stabilized. ""Speak to him!"" Adnan's mother did what we've all seen our own mothers do: pretend that she wasn't crying. ""Habibi, habibi,"" Ghada Saleh tried to say in as singsong-y a voice as she could muster, so Adnan would recognize her. ""My love, my love,"" in Arabic. At the same time, she attempted to discern her only son behind the stitches on his nose and lip, and wires everywhere else. ""Adnan, Adnan! It's me, Mommy,"" she bravely and desperately called out in Arabic. Just a moment earlier, I had come out of the operating room, running with the doctors and anesthesiologist to the recovery room, to tell his worried parents that everything had gone well and Adnan looked great. But now, this complication. His father's usually jovial demeanor was stiff. Once the commotion started, he left the room. I couldn't help but tear up. I would be lying if I said I hadn't gotten attached to Adnan and his family. I had been following their entire journey of ""kissing his cleft lip goodbye"" with the Operation Smile volunteers at their mission site in Alexandria, Egypt. I tried imagining what Adnan would have looked like without the surgery. Even with the cleft lip, he was ""Gerber baby"" cute -- but what about when he grew up? In countries like Egypt, people with cleft lips and/or palates are looked upon as ""cursed"" and virtually shunned from society. ""I just want my son to have a chance,"" Adnan's father told me the first day we met. Mohammed Saleh and his pregnant wife waited for hours for their turn with the Operation Smile doctors. The global rate for cleft lip and/or palate is about 1 in 750 births. In the United States, we don't think about the condition much because the surgery to repair it is routinely performed soon after a baby is born. But in Third World countries, the corrective surgery is expensive and hard to come by -- especially for families like the Salehs.  Experience the sights and sounds of Adnan's journey » . ""Papa! We need the father,"" the nurse called out again, after Adnan had awakened. I pushed open stainless steel doors and motioned with my head. Saleh came back in, calmer and smelling of cigarettes. It was the ""after"" moment. Adnan's eyes were closed, his face was puffy from the medication, but his nose and mouth were aligned, like the real ""Gerber baby."" His parents quietly studied their son. After spending a week with this family, I thought I could read some of the wonder and fear in their eyes. Wonder at the possibility of what their son could now become, be it doctor, lawyer or policeman. Fear at the prospect of going through this journey again with the baby on the way. The doctors I spoke with don't know exactly what causes the deformity. They point to genetic, environmental and nutritional factors. For example, they say in Third World countries, the lack of folic acid and the practice of intermarriage increase the likelihood of cleft lip and/or palate. Operation Smile focuses on the areas with the greatest need, from Bolivia to Bangladesh. The organization received a burst of publicity during the last presidential race: Republican nominee John McCain's wife, Cindy, has volunteered at the organization since 2001 (the couple's youngest daughter, adopted from an orphanage in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was born with a cleft palate). The doctors and nurses who volunteer their time and skill come from all over the world, pay their own way, are housed in places like military barracks (as we were), and work long days through the screening, surgery and recovery process. Despite the long hours, hard work and rustic conditions, all the professionals I encountered woke up and went to bed with a smile, knowing they were giving these youngsters a chance to do the same. I left the hospital to go to the airport while the Salehs were still sleeping, together, on one hospital bed, in a room with five other families just like theirs. Since then, I've received e-mail updates from Mohammed Saleh. ""Now he has the chance to do anything he wants, anything that makes him happy. The father is happy when the son is happy,"" Saleh wrote, ending with a smiley-face emoticon.","Reporter volunteers for Operation Smile mission in Egypt; meets Saleh family .

"(CNN) -- Eagles may be thin on the ground for most golfers at the Bear Trace course at Harrison Bay. But up in the treetops, it's a different matter. Bald eagles Elliott and Eloise have been par for the course at the Tennessee club for the past three and a half years, scoring highly with both local and global audiences thanks to a camera installed by their nest in a pine tree behind the 10th green. ""The eagles came in and started building a nest in December 2010,"" explains golf course superintendent Paul Carter. ""The first year they had two eaglets and both fledged successfully. We were just watching them from the ground not really knowing what was going on until about mid-May when two black heads popped up out of the nest."" The discovery prompted Carter to install an Eagle Cam which has been live since early 2012. This year, the pair -- who were given their names by Carter's daughter -- welcomed two more eaglets who go by the more functional names of HB5 and HB6. Bald eagles were once on the U.S. endangered species list, but numbers of the nation's symbol have risen since the government banned the pesticide DDT -- which contaminated the birds' food sources. The wingspans of the female eagles, which are larger than the males, can be up to eight feet. ""Tennessee has had some good success with its eagle population, but this is the only one on a golf course that I know of. We are trying to show that golf courses can be a sustainable habitat for wildlife,"" Carter told CNN ahead of Earth Day -- an initiative started in 1970 aimed at improving the world's environment, and marked globally this year on April 22. Bear Trace's round-the-clock live feed has received almost a million views to date. The virtual presence has also helped business at the club. ""I've been in the pro shop several times and people come in and ask which hole Eagle Cam is on,"" Carter says. ""We've definitely had a considerable amount of play off it."" The project is one of many environmentally-minded measures Carter and his colleagues have tended to in recent years. ""It's not just about how we mow the grass or what fertilizer we're putting down. We have an education center which has environmental information, awards and pictures of the course,"" he says. Carter, who also writes about environmental improvements on a blog and gives talks, was recently recognized for his green leadership. Last November, Golf Digest magazine awarded the course its Green Star Award and in February Carter was crowned overall winner of the Environmental Leaders in Golf Award for 2013. The prestigious prize, which is open to golf courses around the world, is jointly run by the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America and Golf Digest. Historically, golf courses haven't attracted praise for their green credentials but rather criticism, often being held up as examples of resource profligacy for over-watering and widespread use of chemicals. But this view may now be outdated says Ray Semlitsch, curators professor of biological sciences at the University of Missouri. ""Golf courses are aware of some of these negative things and actually they have done a very good job over the last 10-20 years of trying to improve environmental practices,"" says Semlitsch, who recently led a study on the effects of golf course development on salamander populations in the southern Appalachians. ""We studied 10 golf courses interviewing golf superintendents and managers. These were young, highly educated people -- many had degrees in biology, turf science or wildlife management. ""They are well aware of these problems and very excited and very willing to make changes and use environmentally sound practices."" Carter says things have shifted ""180 degrees"" since 2001 when he started at Bear Trace, a Jack Nicklaus-designed course -- noting that the club has substantially reduced mowing, fertilizer use and water consumption. ""We've removed over 50 acres of highly maintained earth in the last decade. When you figure that out from a water standpoint, we save 7.39 million gallons annually."" As individuals and organizations around the globe mark Earth Day, it's good to know that people like Carter are keeping an eagle eye on the environment not just today but all-year-round.

"Washington (CNN) -- A California company has recalled more than 3,000 pounds of fresh ground beef patties and other packages of ground beef products that may be contaminated with the E. coli bacteria, the U.S. Agriculture Department said Saturday. The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service said it became aware of the problem ""when contacted by another federal regulated establishment who believed they had received suspect product."" American Food Service of Pico Rivera recalled the products, which were produced on January 31, the USDA said in a press release. The products subject to recall bear the establishment number ""EST. 1913"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. They were sent to restaurants throughout Southern California. Some of the products may be frozen and in restaurant freezers, the department said. E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and in severe cases, kidney failure.

"(CNN) -- When Congressman Paul Ryan opined recently that there was a ""real culture problem"" in poor communities, ""in our inner cities in particular,"" and that this culture was behind some of the country's economic troubles, he didn't realize how half right he was. People are continuing to debate fiercely what Ryan said and whether he meant to propagate racially coded explanations of poverty's roots. But put that aside for a moment. Here's what he was right about: There is indeed a culture in America that is pathological and now threatens our social fabric. It's not the culture of poverty, though. It's the culture of wealth. We live in an age of extreme concentration of wealth in America. The problem is not just that the 1% have managed to nearly triple their share of national income in the last three decades. Nor is it just that the 1% increasingly are fed, schooled and housed in a bubble apart from the rest of their fellow citizens. The problem is that today's concentration of wealth is breaking the golden link that Ryan and others take pains to emphasize -- the link between work and reward. Economist Thomas Piketty's landmark new book ""Capital"" unpacks this delinking in great statistical detail. It turns out that increasing numbers of Americans in the 1%, .1% and .01% have done little to ""earn"" their wealth or privilege. Contrary to myth, most of today's plutocrats are not the kind of Steve Jobsian visionary risk-taking entrepreneurs or superstar celebrities. The .01%, for instance, tend overwhelmingly to be high-end corporate managers and executives, particularly on Wall Street, operating in interlocking networks that inflate the standard of what an executive is ""worth."" Or they are the heirs of the great entrepreneurs (4 of the 10 richest Americans are children of Sam Walton), inheritors of fortunes of which it can truly be said, ""someone else built that."" An aristocracy is emerging in America, a class of insiders that corrodes the promise of equal citizenship. And with this compounding of unearned advantage, certain antisocial values and behaviors have taken root among the superrich -- norms that threaten to corrupt the rest of American society. What's in this dysfunctional culture of concentrated wealth? Look around Wall Street. You'll find tribal insularity, short-term thinking, personal irresponsibility, cynicism about playing by the rules, an aversion to socially productive labor, a habit of shameless materialism, an inability to defer gratification and a lack of concern for what ""message"" all this sends to the youth raised in such an environment. In short, you'll find the very things typically imputed to the culture of poverty. Now, to be sure, there are poor people who do exhibit these antisocial values and norms. And there is no question that plenty of poor people are poor because they made bad choices and behaved in self-destructive ways. But rich people who exhibit such values have something the poor don't: Money. Money buys exemption from bad choices. Money confers power -- in particular, over the poor. It confers the power to frame public narrative and policymaking and to determine whose behavior -- whose culture -- is (and isn't) called pathological. Today, as it was during the last Gilded Age, the concentration of wealth gives the rich the political clout to further concentrate their wealth. (And now, as then, the Supreme Court greases the skids in the name of ""liberty""). This clout is wielded in plain sight now, without any pretense of civic equality. And it calls to mind the warning attributed to Justice Louis Brandeis: ""We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."" When the richest 400 families in America have more wealth than the bottom 155 million Americans combined, the danger to the republic is far more clear and present than that posed by the ""welfare queens"" of lore or by anecdotes of shiftless inner-city men. That would be true even if the super-rich today had entirely benign or merely neutral policy preferences. But in fact they've rigged the game of policy, subsidies and tax preferences to amplify and hoard their gains. This isn't to suggest that all super-wealthy people are ""welfare kings"" (they're not) or to imply that they have a monopoly on selfishness or sociopathic attitudes (they don't). Yet if it's unfair to paint everyone in the 1% with the same unflattering brush of ""dysfunctional culture,"" isn't it far worse to do the same to the poorest 20%? Wealth and advantage are as strongly self-reinforcing as poverty and disadvantage. It's possible to recognize this fact while also championing grit, gumption and good values. In fact, it's essential. But culture doesn't explain everything. And where it matters isn't only among the poor or nonwhite. If we're going to reform the norms in this country so that opportunity is truly reflective of effort and talent, we have to do more than pick on those with the least. We have to start at the top.","Congressman Paul Ryan says America has a problem in culture of poverty .
Eric Liu: Actually, we live in a dysfunctional culture of concentrated wealth .
He says certain antisocial values and behaviors have taken root among the rich .

"(CNN) -- After more than 12 years and under a blanket of security in Kabul, Canadian military operations in Afghanistan came to a formal close this week. As the Canadian flag was lowered at NATO headquarters in a low-key ceremony, officials looked back at a mission that began in 2001 and cost the country 158 military lives. Two Canadian civilian contractors, a diplomat and a journalist also died during Canada's involvement in Afghan operations. Canadian troops were active in the restive Kandahar province in the south of the country, dubbed the ""home of the Taliban,"" from 2006 and have latterly been involved in training Afghan National Security Forces in the capital, Kabul. Over 40,000 Canadian troops have been rotated in and out of the country since NATO's ISAF operations began -- the largest deployment since the end of the Second World War. The remaining 100 Canadian military personnel will leave the country by the end of the week. In a statement released to mark the occasion, Minister of National Defence Rob Nicholson said, ""From the first arrival of our ships in the Persian Gulf, to our combat and leadership roles in Kandahar Province, to our most recent training operation in Kabul, the contribution of the CAF will be honored by Canadians as we express our heartfelt thanks for the strength of this commitment."" Major-General Dean Milner, commander of the NATO Training Mission - Afghanistan led 3000 Canadian troops in Kandahar from September 2010 to July 2011 and said that his troops had made a real difference in the troubled region. ""I think that we held the fort well and I think we enabled that part of the country to improve and take off and the progress has been ... it's been night and day,"" he said in a video looking back at Canadian involvement, prepared by the ISAF. ""I think that we can feel proud about our accomplishments down in Kandahar."" The Canadian contingent has been credited for the development of a network of roads connecting key districts in the province, amongst other key infrastructure and civic work. Milner also recognized the ""sacrifices"" made by Canadian troops during their deployment. Tributes to the the Canadian military efforts also came from allies on the ground. ""The Canadian Armed Forces have been a reliable and significant partner in the success of the ISAF mission,"" US General Joseph Dunford, ISAF commander, said in a statement. The ISAF also reports that the Canadian government has committed to spending $330 million to help fund Afghan security forces. The withdrawal comes as part of a larger commitment by NATO to remove all combat troops from the country by the end of 2014, although there are ongoing negotiations over an extended advisory role for the security organization. The withdrawal coincides with China's apparent willingness to cooperate internationally on matters of security. During the National People's Congress in Beijing, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China will work with regional neighbors -- including Afghanistan, with which it shares a short border -- to ""resolutely fight against all terrorist forces.""

"(CNN) -- United States President Barack Obama has now paved the way for imposing economic sanctions against Russia. However, these would be an ineffective and naive response by the U.S. to the crisis in Ukraine. Economic sanctions have little independent usefulness for the pursuit of non-economic goals. This is not to say that sanctions never work, but rather that 95% of cases are unsuccessful. In many cases, sanctions will make the political situation worse. Nationalism often makes states and societies willing to endure considerable punishment rather than abandon their national interests. Modern states, simply put, are not that fragile -- sanctions can hurt a regime, but they cannot break it. In this way, imposing economic sanctions on a state is similar to backing an angry dog into a corner -- in most cases, the dog will become more vicious, and more defensive. History might seem to indicate otherwise. Economic sanctions often go hand-in-hand with military intervention, which can sprout misleading conclusions. This is true of the sanctions we imposed on Iraq in 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait: U.S. military intervention in 1991 was still necessary to force his retreat. Few would say that economic sanctions were successful in kicking him out. Indeed, sanctions continued after the Gulf War with little to no effect, until we finally removed the regime by force in 2003. Further, sanctions typically take the form of a great power or coalition seeking to leverage a relatively weak state. The suggestion that they might be effective against a major global power like Russia is seriously flawed. Even those who do believe sanctions might work on Iran would likely find the idea of imposing sanctions on Russia to be preposterous. There are two reasons why. First, even if economic sanctions were an effective form of leverage, Russia can squeeze us almost effectively as we can squeeze them. Sergei Glazyev, a Kremlin economist, simply threatened to not repay debt to U.S. bankers in response to American-imposed sanctions. Between great powers, leverage is a two-way street. Second, Putin is clearly prepared to incur economic costs to accomplish his objectives in Ukraine. Even without sanctions, the deployment of troops to Crimea has already affected the Russian economy. On March 3 the Moscow stock market fell more than 10% which, as a Reuters article pointed out, wiped nearly $60 billion off the value of Russian companies -- more than the $51 billion spent on the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Meanwhile, Putin's approval ratings remained high. By threatening sanctions, Obama is not giving Russia President Vladimir Putin enough credit. Of course the Russian leader has considered this scenario, and it did not deter him from occupying Crimea. Furthermore, if we impose sanctions and Russia breaks commitments with U.S. bankers in response, what would be the effect? From a strategic standpoint, none. We certainly wouldn't let Russia use economic threats to dictate our foreign policy, no matter what the economic cost; why should we expect the Russian leadership to budge? But if sanctions are a bad idea, what is the alternative? The key to keeping Ukraine unified is to take away support for Russian annexation. This means solidifying support for the new government in Kiev among the Russian population in the East, especially in Crimea. Obama must encourage the new government in Ukraine to strengthen economic and political ties with the pro-Russian population. This means bringing in election monitors to encourage faith and participation in the new regime, and creating new economic programs to bolster well-being in the eastern part of the country. The U.S. should offer support to fund those efforts. The West must remember that in 2011, 70% of Crimeans considered Ukraine their ""motherland,"" despite most of them being Russian-speaking. In other words, until the proposed EU deal went sour, there was little sentiment in Crimea for secession or annexation. A return to these conditions in Ukraine, and not economic sanctions against Russia, is the key to stopping Putin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Pape.","Robert Pape argues economic sanctions against Russia would not work .
He argues that while sanctions can hurt a regime, they cannot break it .

"(CNN) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was released Sunday after four days in police custody in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army, police in Northern Ireland said. Adams, 65, has long denied having any role in the death of Jean McConville, a widow who was reportedly killed by the IRA four decades ago because the group believed she was a spy for the British army. Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland and who has long been associated with the IRA, once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein. Today, Sinn Fein is Ireland's second-largest opposition party. ""Let me be very clear: I am innocent of any involvement in any conspiracy to abduct, kill or bury Mrs. McConville,"" Adams said soon after his release. He told reporters he bears no animosity toward anyone and spoke about the need to move forward. ""I'm an activist. This is my life, and I'm philosophical, and I understand that I have detractors and opponents -- and I especially understand that there [are] sinister elements who are against the changes Sinn Fein and others are committed to achieving,"" Adams said. He added: ""There's only way for our society to go -- and that's forward."" Adams had surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday evening and his detention had threatened the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, a peace Adams is in part credited with bringing about after decades of sectarian tensions. The questioning of Adams was not unexpected. Adams said he told authorities last month that he was willing to meet with investigators. Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, said last week in Belfast that Adams' arrest was unnecessary, unjustified and politically motivated. He said that he had seen the ""dark side"" of Northern Ireland policing ""flex its muscles in the course of the past couple of days"" and that the arrest was a ""'deliberate attempt to influence the elections that are due to take place in three weeks' time."" A number of other people have been arrested and questioned in the investigation into McConville's abduction and killing. One man has been charged with aiding and abetting the crime. He denies wrongdoing. The IRA admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as ""The Disappeared,"" those who vanished during the so-called Troubles, a 30-year conflict between Protestant loyalists who wanted to stay part of the United Kingdom and Catholic nationalists who wanted to see the north united with Ireland. Among the victims was McConville, 37, whose remains were found partially buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003. She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.

"(CNN) -- Benfica has one foot in the quarterfinals of the Europa League after beating Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 in the first leg of their last 16 tie at White Hart Lane on Thursday. After being thumped 4-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League last weekend, Spurs manager, Tim Sherwood bemoaned his players' lack of character and guts. If he was hoping for a response after the public dressing down, he didn't get one as Spurs produced another error-strewn performance. The visitors opened the scoring after 29 minutes when Ruben Amorim's through-ball set Rodrigo free down the right before the Spanish striker unleashed a clinical left-foot finish past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Amorim helped earn the Portuguese side's second of the night after catching Spurs striker Harry Kane in possession yards outside his own penalty area. The midfielder's snap shot was then tipped over the bar by Lloris. But there was nothing the French keeper could do from the resulting corner as an unmarked Luisao headed home to double the lead with just under an hour played. Christian Eriksen halved the deficit with a brilliant free kick in the 64th minute to give the home fans some hope of a revival, but it was Jorge Jesus' side who continued to look more threatening in attack. Benfica's persistence paid off with six minutes remaining as former Brazilian international Luisao scored his second and his team's third of the night. The defeat was Spurs' first at home in 11 European fixtures while last year's runners up stretch their winning run to five in the competition. There was also joy for FC Porto who beat Rafael Benitez's Napoli 1-0 at the Estadio do Dragao. Benitez, who guided Chelsea to glory in the competition last season, will require all his famed tactical nous in the return leg next Thursday after Colombian striker Jackson Martinez's 57th minute strike handed Porto the advantage. Over in Bulgaria, Benitez's old club Valencia -- who he steered to the UEFA Cup success in 2004 -- has all but booked a place in the quarterfinals after a 3-0 against Ludogorets Razgrad in Sofia. The visitors won convincingly despite having Seydou Keita sent off in the 25th minute for a foul on Roman Bezjak inside the penalty area. Bezjak couldn't convert the spot kick and Valencia, who were already a goal to the good thanks to Antonio Barragan's fifth minute strike, made the most of the slip, despite the numerical disadvantage. Fede Cartabia doubled the lead in the 33rd minute before Philippe Senderos put the match, and most probably the tie, beyond the Bulgarians with a third away goal. Elsewhere, Switzerland's FC Basel drew 0-0 with Austrian side Salzburg while the all-Italian clash between runaway Serie A leaders Juventus and fourth-placed Fiorentina ended in a 1-1 draw. In the all-Spanish tie, Real Betis, who are anchored at the foot of La Liga, recorded a fine 2-0 win at seventh-placed Sevilla. French side Lyon has almost guaranteed passage through to the last eight with a comprehensive 4-1 win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen while Dutch side AZ Alkmaar will take a slender advantage into the second leg against Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala after winning the first leg 1-0 at the AFAS Stadion.

"(CNN) -- If Liverpool end this season with a first English league title since 1990, then perhaps the club can look back to a hand dealt by fate on April 6, 2014. Multiple hands, in fact, and some arms -- as Brendan Rodgers' team returned to the top of the Premier League table with a controversial 2-1 win at West Ham. First the outstretched limb of home defender James Tomkins, seeking to stop the progress of Luis Suarez, allowed Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to put his team ahead from the penalty spot. Then the flailing hand of former $50 million Reds flop Andy Carroll clouted the head of Simon Mignolet at a corner. As an encore, he knocked the visiting goalkeeper's arm away from the ball, allowing Guy Demel to equalize in stoppage time. Referee Anthony Taylor overruled his linesman, who had flagged for a foul by Carroll -- much to the anger of the Liverpool players watching the replay on the big screen at Upton Park. If Taylor got that wrong, he made up for it in the second half by awarding Liverpool another penalty which Gerrard again converted. West Ham keeper Adrian had appeared to make contact with the ball with his outstretched hand before the onrushing Jon Flanagan sprawled to the grass. Rodgers, however, believed the official got that one right. ""The first penalty was clear and I thought the second one was a penalty as well,"" the Liverpool manager said. ""Jon gets a touch on the ball and touches it past the goalkeeper. The keeper gets a touch on the ball, but also takes him."" West Ham counterpart Sam Allardyce, whose team remained mid-table and seemingly safe from relegation, was less impressed. ""Flanagan is going down before Adrian plays the ball,"" he said. ""(The ref) thinks Adrian hasn't played the ball and he has. ""I feel let down, the lads feel really let down. We took Liverpool right to the wire."" And that is where the title race appears to be headed, with five rounds remaining for most teams. Liverpool, four points clear of third-placed Manchester City having played two games more, will face a big test of their aspirations when the two teams meet at Anfield next Sunday. The Reds then go to struggling Norwich before hosting Chelsea, second in the table at the end of this weekend -- two points adrift, also with five to play. It was Liverpool's ninth successive win, and the club will likely have to beat the record of 12 in a row set back in 1990 to have a chance of denying City a second title in three seasons. ""We'll just keep our focus, keep that concentration. It didn't matter that Manchester City or Chelsea won yesterday -- it can't affect us,"" Rodgers said. ""We have to control ourselves and our own emotions and get the job done. That was a real tough game today, but we got a great result."" Rodgers said Liverpool have extra incentive to win the title, with this month being the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough stadium disaster which claimed 96 lives during a crush at the FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest. ""There are 96 people in the sky that will always be supporting this team,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""We want to do it for the great support and the football family of Liverpool. If we're to achieve anything this year, certainly they will always be in our thoughts -- the 96 in the sky and the families that go with them."" Meanwhile, the race for England's fourth place in next season's Champions League turned in Everton's favor on Sunday as Liverpool's city rivals thrashed the incumbents Arsenal 3-0. Strikers Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku scored before former Everton favorite Mikel Arteta netted an own-goal, putting Roberto Martinez's team just a point behind the Londoners with a game in hand. ""The implications today were quite unique. We were hoping for a result but what was needed today was breaking many barriers,"" said the Spanish manager, who has impressed since taking over after David Moyes left to join Manchester United. ""In 22 games we have played against Arsenal we only scored one goal or less: today we kept a clean sheet and scored three and looked like we could have scored more. ""The performance had an arrogant focus which was very pleasing to see."" Arsene Wenger, whose team had topped the table for large parts of this season, admitted Arsenal's morale was flagging after some heavy away defeats against the leading teams. ""They have taken something of our charisma from the team. Is that belief? Is it fear? Is it confidence?"" said the Frenchman, who has guided Arsenal into Europe's top competition for 16 successive years. ""I wouldn't question the spirit of this team. They are focused and want to do well but they have lost something on the confidence front."" Norwich sacked manager Chris Hughton on Sunday after the 1-0 defeat by West Brom left the club one place above the relegation zone, but five points clear of the bottom three teams. The club's under-18 team coach Neil Adams was appointed to take the place of the former Tottenham player until the end of this season.","Sunday's 2-1 win at West Ham puts Liverpool back on top of English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Chrysler took the preemptive step this week of recalling nearly half a million vehicles because of issues with the active head-restraint function found in several makes and models. The problem is related to a ""potentially faulty microcontroller (that) entered the supply chain after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused a worldwide microcontroller shortage,"" Chrysler Group said in a news release issued Wednesday. Because of such defective microcontrollers in some vehicles, the active head restraints -- which are supposed to automatically move forward during some rear-impact crashes, thereby helping prevent neck injuries -- aren't working properly. The Chrysler Group said it doesn't know of any injuries or accidents tied to the issue. Some 442,000 vehicles sold in the United States are affected by the recall, as well as 25,000 in Canada, 10,000 in Mexico and 12,000 elsewhere. Makes and models affected by the recall are: . -- 2011 to 2013 Chrysler Sebrings, Chrysler 200s and Dodge Avenger midsize cars. -- 2011 to 2012 Dodge Nitro SUVs. -- 2011 to 2013 Jeep Liberty SUVs. The Chrysler Group's recall comes weeks after the company resisted the federal government's attempt to make it recall vehicles over a potential fire hazard. Chrysler stated earlier this month that it would not comply with the demand to recall vehicles that, the government said, had a high risk of catching fire when struck from behind. But it reversed course on June 18, hours before a government deadline. Even then, the company still claimed the 2.7 million recalled vehicles -- 1993 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees and 2002 to 2007 Jeep Libertys -- are safe.

The man who gave the bicycle to police did not want to be identified, said Leong, who refused to answer questions about how the man came across it. Leong said the man who turned in Armstrong's bicycle ""is not a suspect at this time"" and did not ask about a reward offered by Armstrong's team for its return, he said. The bike is one of three believed to have been stolen Saturday from a trailer used by Armstrong's team, Astana, while the trailer was parked behind a Sacramento hotel, Leong said. The bikes disappeared hours after the first stage of the nine-day Amgen Tour of California, in which Armstrong and the team are competing. The two other bicycles, which belong to members of Armstrong's team, still are missing. Police have information ""that we're not putting out at this time"" about a suspect or suspects, Leong said. Officials initially said four bikes were stolen, but one of them was discovered Tuesday to have been misplaced in a storage room in the hotel, Leong said. Armstrong's bicycle, painted a distinctive black and yellow, ""would be hard to sell,"" Leong said. The bikes that disappeared were the first ones within reach of whoever opened the trailer, which held many more, Leong said. The California race is another step in Armstrong's comeback from a 2005 retirement. Armstrong, a cancer survivor and seven-time Tour de France champion, kicked off his return to professional racing last month at Australia's Tour Down Under. Armstrong announced the bike theft on his Twitter account Sunday morning and posted a photograph. ""There is only one like it in the world therefore hard to pawn it off. Reward being offered,"" he wrote. The 750-mile Amgen Tour of California ends Sunday. Armstrong, 37, said he is aiming for another Tour de France victory this summer. He also has said he is not trying to win the Tour of California but is riding in support of teammate Levi Leipheimer, who has won the race twice and leads this year's event. Armstrong was in fourth place Wednesday. Armstrong's comeback is not his first. He stopped racing in 1996, when he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors have him less than 50 percent chance of survival, but after treatment, he returned to cycling in 1998. He won the Tour de France -- cycling's premiere event -- every year from 1999 to 2005.","California police: Man turned bicycle in; he's not considered a suspect .
