"A 59-year-old woman buried her husband behind the porch in their backyard in San Bernadino, California because she couldn't afford funeral costs, police reports say. Yvonne Winn of Apple Valley dug a four- to five-foot hole in the yard of the couple's home and buried her husband Thomas Winn, 63, after he died in late May. Neighbors who heard of Yvonne Winn's plight have been raising money to help her pay for a proper burial for her husband. Burial: Yvonne Winn was unable to afford a funeral for her late husband, Thomas Winn so she buried his body in the backyard of their San Bernadino home . 'She seems like such a nice, hard-working, older lady,' neighbor Colin Wilson told the LA Times. 'I could imagine how difficult it might be, just the whole situation. I feel for her.' According to NBC4, authorities showed up to the home on Wednesday to do a welfare check on Thomas Winn. Yvonne Winn told them she had buried Thomas in the backyard after he died last month. The body was wrapped in two garbage bags when officials dug it out of the hole in the home's yard Thursday. Discovery: Police arrived at the doorstep of the Winn residence to do a welfare check on Thomas Winn before Yvonne Winn admitted she'd buried her husband . According to neighbors, the police spent three hours digging in the backyard of the Winns before exhuming a plastic-wrapped body. Wilson says Yvonne Winn was visibly upset as police dug up her husband's body. 'She appeared frantic, frustrated. She was definitely bawling, she was . crying. Just very out of sorts,' Wilson told NBC4, . describing the smell after the body was dug up as 'rancid'. After burying her husband, Yvonne Winn attempted to sell the house. A prospective buyer of the house told NBC4 that he was set to move into the house on July 31st but was now having second thoughts. Labor: According to neighbors, it took police about three hours of digging to exhume Thomas Winn from the hole his wife buried him in behind their porch . Yvonne Winn told the buyer that her husband had died after hitting his head. He'd gone to bed that night but in the morning, she hadn't been able to wake him, the buyer told NBC4. A spokeswoman for the San Bernadino sheriff's department said there was no suspicion of foul play in the death of Thomas Winn, and a spokesperson for the town said authorities had decided not to penalize Yvonne Winn for the illegal burial. Neighbors have rallied around Winn in her time of need to raise the money needed to have a proper burial for Thomas Winn. Community: Colin Wilson and his sister Emily, who share a common fence with the Winns, is raising money for a proper burial for Thomas Winn . 'It's a terrible feeling to know that just across your backyard there's someone that was so financially strapped that they felt like they couldn't bury their own family properly,' said Colin Wilson, who along with his sister has been fundraising through FundRazr for the Winns. So far, they've raised $2723 of a $3000 goal. 'Resident of Apple Valley Yvonne Winn recently suffered the tragic loss of her husband, Thomas Winn. In her time of immense grief and with no money for a casket, she desperately buried him in their backyard. Thomas Winn was a beloved man and an upstanding member of the High Desert Community. Please help Yvonne and her family give Thomas the proper burial he deserves,' says the page. 'I just feel terrible for her,' Wilson said. 'I can't imagine what she went through.'","According to police, Yvonne Winn, 59, buried her husband Thomas Winn, 63, in the couple's backyard .

"Islamic extremists have called on British Muslims to establish three independent states within the UK. The notorious Muslims Against the Crusades (MAC) group have named Yorkshire towns Bradford and Dewsbury and Tower Hamlets in East London as testbeds for blanket sharia rule. The medieval 'emirates' would operate entirely outside British law, . according to a document on the MAC website. Veiled women in the London borough of Tower Hamlets which has seen a rise in extremism. The Muslims Against the Crusades group says the medieval 'emirates' would function as autonomous territories and operate entirely outside British law, according to a document published on their website . Where the group envisages the autonomous areas being set up . The MAC group, led by Abu Assadullah, was . set up last year and has become notorious because of its violent protests, most . provocatively burning poppies during the Remembrance Day silence. Under the heading 'Muslims should set up Islamic emirates in the UK', MAC says: 'We suggest it is time that areas with large Muslim populations declare an emirate delineating that Muslims trying to live within this area are trying to live by the sharia as much as possible with their own courts and community watch and schools and even self sufficient trade. 'Likely areas for these projects might be Dewsbury or Bradford or Tower Hamlets to begin with. 'In time we can envisage that the whole of the sharia might one day be implemented starting with these enclaves.' The call is likely to cause anger among moderate Muslims and community leaders in the areas concerned. Ian Greenwood, leader of Bradford Council, said people would 'not allow extremists to provoke them into violence'.

Hamlets council was last year accused of falling under the control of . extremist groups following a documentary by the Daily Telegraph . journalist Andrew Gilligan. The plan is part of the MAC's response to the government's revised Prevent strategy to combat Islamic extremism. In its document, called Islamic Prevent, the fanatics also call for an end to CCTV cameras in and around mosques. It says: 'Muslims must get rid of all CCTV cameras from Muslim . institutions. Sadly many mosques have today adopted CCTV cameras to spy . on Muslims on behalf of the police and local authorities.' Other inflammatory instructions include demanding the release of all . Muslim prisoners, a ban on Muslims joining the police or armed forces . and a rejection of British democracy. The document ends: 'We can conclude that measures by the UK government are nothing more than an attempt by them to strip the Muslim community of their Islamic identity and to integrate them into the non-Islamic way of life.' The revised Prevent programme, announced last month, is aimed at tackling home-grown terrorism and radicalisation of students. It demands stricter controls on extremist literature and a more proactive approach by universities to prevent extremism. Councillor Greenwood added: 'Extremism is less likely to emerge when people get the opportunity to come together. 'Local voluntary, community and faith groups, the council, and other public and private sector partners, all work together in Bradford to strengthen community relations and encourage better understanding and respect between all our communities. 'We believe that this is one of the best ways to build a tolerant society in which extremism plays no part.'

"Danger threatens Manchester United in the discontent that is starting to build around the management of Louis van Gaal. The wheels of dissent are grinding audibly now and the noise may yet grow louder in March and April when United’s fixtures get tougher. It is important that United hold their nerve and show resolve this time in a way they failed to do when David Moyes was buckling under the pressure of trying to keep the club in the bright light where Sir Alex Ferguson had camped them for more than 20 years. Curing Manchester United is going to take time. The penny should have dropped by now that there is no quick fix, not even if you spend £150 million on new players in the summer. You need patience and you need a man like Van Gaal whose self-confidence knows no limits. Louis van Gaal is self-assured and Manchester United must back him to avoid falling further into the malaise . David Moyes was blamed for the fall of an empire, but United's problems are complex and deep-rooted . Sean Abbott is bowling every ball as if fuelled by the desire to honour the memory of his dead friend Phillip Hughes . England's humiliation: Outbatted, outbowled and out-thought… Eoin Morgan's men off to nightmare start . Q&A: Mail on Sunday's Chief Sports Writer on Jose Mourinho, Mario Balotelli and whether Lionel Messi is better than Cristiano Ronaldo . The first step towards rehabilitation and the return to greatness that United’s fans crave is to finish in the top four this season, but they are locked in an increasingly tense struggle with Southampton, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool for the last two places. It is possible they won’t make it and if that happens, strident voices will scream about the money Van Gaal has spent and the uninspiring football United have played and demand that he is sacked. United’s performance in the victory over Burnley on Wednesday, as so often this season, was anxious and uncertain. Their defence seemed bewildered by the movement of Danny Ings. Their opponents were unlucky not to get more out of the game, another familiar trend under Van Gaal. United are not winning any friends with their style as they cling to third place, trailing in the wake of Chelsea and Manchester City. But let’s get one thing straight: the very last thing that United should do in the summer, whether they make the top four or not, is to get rid of Van Gaal. It would not help their cause. In fact, it would deal a serious blow to their hopes of recovering their pre-eminence. It is not Van Gaal’s fault that United offered him the job knowing that he would not be able to start until last July because of his commitments with Holland. Van Gaal's success at the World Cup meant the Dutchman arrived at Old Trafford later than anticipated . The movement and pace of Burnley striker Danny Ings tormented United in midweek . It is not Van Gaal’s fault that the result was a late-summer super-market trolley dash that involved a panic signing like Radamel Falcao. It is not his fault that Falcao has been a shadow of the predatory, prolific striker he once was. Or that Robin van Persie is having another poor season. Or that United have been struck down by an epidemic of injuries. Robin van Persie has struggled to recreate the form which made him one of the world's best strikers . The handsomely-paid Radamel Falcao is a shadow of his former self and has struggled in England . Or that a welter of expensive signings were rushed into the team and expected to adapt immediately to each other and to the English game. Or that the club are so short of defenders he has had to play swathes of the season with novices like Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett. Or that United had failed to fill the vacuum of authority in central midfield by the time he arrived and that, in the absence of the injured Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney has often been the only creative option. Paddy McNair (left) was rewarded with a new deal to keep him at the Old Trafford club until at least 2017 . Tyler Blackett has been called up to the England Under 21s and is expected to be rewarded with a new deal . None of it his fault. In fact, Van Gaal has done a remarkable job of husbanding his resources and keeping United in the top four. The club were right to sack Moyes, even if events have proved that those who believed the Scot was the reason for all United’s travails badly misread the scale of the rebuilding job Ferguson left behind. It was obvious by then, even to Moyes’s allies, that the job was too much for him, that he was paralysed by the scrutiny and the expectation that came with being in charge of one of the world’s biggest clubs. Van Gaal wobbled last week, too. His ‘I have in my hand a piece of paper’ speech was fleetingly reminiscent of the wide-eyed territory Graham Taylor and Kevin Keegan have led us into in the past. But Van Gaal is made of sterner stuff. He will not disintegrate. For the most part, he has seemed utterly at ease with being boss and undaunted by the task of leading United back to the summit of English football. He does things his way, without regard for the court of public opinion. Whether that is playing three at the back or utilising Rooney in the centre of midfield, he is not swayed by the criticism of others. Van Gaal produced a dossier full of stats in a lively press conference after Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball' jibe . Graham Taylor's tortured England reign is best characterised by the 1994 documentary 'The Impossible Job' After Kevin Keegan's 'I would love it' rant after defeat to Leeds in 1996, Newcastle's grip on the title slipped . This is a man, after all, who has managed Bayern Munich and Barcelona. He is no stranger to the heightened tensions being in charge at super-clubs bring. I interviewed him in the late Nineties when he was under siege at the Nou Camp. When I came out of his office, Catalan journalists were eager for any information I could give. Van Gaal was not talking to them. Let’s not forget that even though he has been forced to blood Blackett and McNair, the back line has conceded fewer goals than anyone other than Chelsea and Southampton. It might not be sexy but it is progress. Let’s also not forget that they finished seventh last season and were in disarray with a squad that looked threadbare. Morale was shot to pieces. Confidence was low. A raft of new signings was desperately needed. Van Gaal's short stint at Old Trafford has already been an eventful one, but the club must stick with him . Under Van Gaal, United have  a habit of winning when not playing well and currently lie in third place . Van Gaal won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and   domestic titles in Holland, Germany and Spain . Despite their troubles, United lie third in the league . Things are better. Not spectacularly better. But they have improved. This may surprise you given the negativity that is being aimed at Van Gaal but over the last 15 Premier League games, United have won more points than anyone, with 34. Chelsea are next best with 33. As Van Gaal takes the flak, United are on a better run than anyone. The club are moving in the right direction with a manager who knows what steps he has to make and is not overwhelmed by what lies ahead. If they stick with him, they will continue the journey back to the summit. If they don’t, United will be plunged back into chaos. Time to ditch the greed . The Premier League have secured a new £5.1billion television deal and our great behemoth has grown even bigger. For some, the deal has confirmed their view that English football represents all that is meretricious about our society. Others suggest the country should be proud of the Premier League, as if it were a sister to the NHS or a brother to the works of Shakespeare. I’m proud of it, I suppose. I’m proud of the football it produces and the entertainment it brings. And, yes, the joy the English take in sport and the loyalty we show in our support of sport have become things that help to define us. Our modern football clubs also contribute much to their local communities: Manchester City’s regeneration of a hitherto neglected swathe of the eastern side of the city has brought new jobs and new facilities for local people. Manchester City spent £200m regenerating a dilapidated part of the city to build a stunning training complex . The new television deal will see over £5bn pumped into the national game, but clubs must show benevolence . But I would be more proud of the Premier League if our elite football clubs called a halt to the relentless disenfranchisement of their traditional fan-base. I would be more proud if our elite clubs now used their vast wealth to reduce ticket prices. I would be more proud if they increased the subsidy they pay to lower league clubs, which are so important to the fabric of the game in this country. I would be more proud if they improved their commitment to developing more grass-roots facilities. They have it in their power to become enlightened despots. They are businesses, not charities, but they have the best chance they will ever have to choose benevolence, not greed. The sacking of Paul Lambert as the manager of Aston Villa last week was a classic of its kind. The owner starves the club of investment, results suffer, unrest grows, the fans criticise the owner, the owner doesn’t like the heat, the owner sacks the manager. It’s football’s favourite formula. Paul Lambert was given his marching orders after a lamentable run of form at relegation-haunted Aston Villa . The atmosphere at Villa Park soured as fans turned against Lambert and owner Randy Lerner . There is a poignancy about the accelerating decline of Tiger Woods that will survive the fact he often wore the mantle of his hegemony without charm or grace. Woods’ curse is this: he is one of the greatest sportsmen there has ever been and yet his epitaph will be that in the chase to overhaul the record of 18 Major victories set by Jack Nicklaus, he fell short. Tiger Woods' descent into injury and loss of form culminated with the 14-time major winner taking a break . The incomparable Jack Nicklaus, who stands on 18 majors, is widely considered the finest golfer of all time .","The wheels of dissent are grinding audibly and the noise may grow louder .
It is important that Manchester United hold their nerve and show resolve .
If they stick with Louis van Gaal, they will continue journey back to summit .
Premier League clubs can choose benevolence, not greed, after the TV deal ."
"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has landed himself in hot water after declaring on social media that all Egyptians are white and treated 'blacks as slaves'. Social media users are urging people to boycott of Exodus: Gods and Kings, which tells the story of Moses, calling it ‘offensive’ and ‘unacceptable’ that white actors are playing the roles of Egyptians. The News Corp owner tweeted a post declaring that he didn't see what the problem was with  film director Ridley Scott's decision to cast white people in the leading roles because Murdoch all Egyptians he knows are white. Twitter followers launched into the 83-year-old who then dug an even bigger hole when trying to explain his remark. Scroll down for video . Rupert Murdoch's tweet that enraged social media users . Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has landed himself in hot water after declaring on social media that all Egyptians are white and treated 'blacks as slaves' Christian Bale (right) and Australian actor Joel Edgerton (left) in movie - Exodus: Gods and Kings . Murdoch was told he was ignorant and misinformed in tweets . Murdoch then attempted to explain his stance which only angered Twitter followers even more . Mr Murdoch's post that started the Twitter outrage says: 'Moses film attacked on Twitter for all white cast. Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are.' One follower sarcastically asked if Murdoch had attempted satire while simply asked him to 'STOP.' Omar X lashed out describing his statement as 'bull***t'. 'For someone who runs the world's media, you're a rather ill-informed moron.' he posted. Someone who goes by the twitter handle - Heauxbehavior - echoed those sentiments. 'You're funny. And TERRIBLY misinformed. And beyond ignorant.' While a woman named Amy ‏posted: 'Jesus Rupe, all that money and you know hee-haw about people.' Murdoch then attempted to explain his stance by saying: 'Everybody-attacks last tweet. Of course Egyptians are Middle Eastern, but far from black. They treated blacks as slaves.' However, Murdoch did not stop there and clearly became agitated by the negative comments . This added fuel to the Twitter fire for followers . This only angered Twitter followers even more. 'It seems @rupertmurdoch's Twitter account has been hacked by @rupertmurdoch,' Richard Robbins posted. 'Ever tired of being wrong?' asked someone who goes by the Twitter handle: StopSelfServatives. Twitter users did hold back on their thoughts of Murdoch's remarks . However, Murdoch did not stop there and clearly became agitated by the negative comments. 'Okay, there are many shades of color. Nothing racist about that, so calm down!' he posted. 'Uh oh, did Uncle Rupie say something racist again? #RacistRupert,' Jeff Cormier posted. Shawn Pasternak suggested that Murdoch should stop while he's behind. '@rupertmurdoch no really, delete your account,' he tweeted. Cindy Chin asked Murdoch if he was referring to his' Egyptian cotton sheets'. Director Ridley Scott said he would not have been able to finance its $40 millionUSD budget if he had hired unknown Egyptian actors instead of established Hollywood stars . The controversy has stemmed from Scott's decision to employ white actors in the leading roles claiming he would not have been able to finance its $40 millionUSD budget if he had hired unknown Egyptian actors instead of established Hollywood stars. The title role is played by Christian Bale, which one Twitter user said was ‘akin to casting George Clooney to play Malcolm X’. The film, which opens on Boxing Day, also features Sigourney Weaver, Australian Joel Edgerton and Aaron Paul, who is best known for his role as Jessie in the hit television series Breaking Bad. While a number of ethnic minority actors have also been cast, including Sir Ben Kingsley, the majority of the non-white performers are in background roles, often even playing slaves or criminals. The hashtag #boycottexodusmovie has been trending on Twitter as posters express movie fans' anger over the film's casting of white actors as Egyptians.

"A British company is developing self-healing fighter jets, transformers which split in the air when approaching the warzone and even 3D printers that could create drones while in the middle of a mission. The science fiction technology is being researched by BAE systems who believe some of the ideas could be deployed by 2040. Nick Colosimo, futurist with BAE's research and development department said the company wanted to show some of the ideas they were currently considering. Scroll down for video . The Transformer aircraft is seen as massive advance in military technology as the jet divides into several parts performing different roles once reaching the objective . Once completed, the jets can reform creating a single aircraft for the return to their home airstrip . BAE Systems are developing Direct Energy weapon systems - more commonly known as lasers . The first idea involves on-board 3D printers which could create small drones which could be deployed during a mission. The second involves an aircraft using nanotechnology which can repair battle-damage as soon as it happens. A third type of aircraft uses 'transformer' technology allowing it to split into several different machines, each with a different role. The final technology involves directed energy systems - laser beams more familiar to fans of sci-fi films such as Star Wars or Star Trek. The research is being conducted at BAE systems' research and development lab in Warton, Lancashire. Mr Colosimo said: 'Of course we don't know exactly what sorts of aircraft technologies will be used in 2040 with any certainty, but it's great to be able to show the public some concepts that might be possible through projecting where today's technology could get to. 'BAE Systems has a rich heritage in research and development, and our team builds on literally decades of previous R&D work by thousands of scientists and engineers.' The company has invested £117 million in research and development during 2013 alone. BAE describes the 'Transformer' as 'a flexible aircraft system that combines smaller jets for more efficient travel, before having them split apart to quickly adapt to any scenario.' An aircraft dubbed 'The Survivor'  uses nanotechnology to repair itself mid-air after suffered battle damage . According to BAE Systems, once the aircraft suffers battle damage, sensors determine exactly what is required to rectify the problem . A special fluid containing the nano-technology fixes the problem inflight allowing the aircraft to continue with its mission . By combining the jets on longer journey there could be potential gains to be made in terms of increased range and fuel savings by cutting the amount of drag, scientists claim. Once they have reached their destination, the craft can then split off and used for a range of activities. These could include going on the offensive if threatened, being used for surveillance or dropping off supplies. The Survivor is a lightweight adhesive fluid built inside the aircraft which allows jets to quickly heal themselves from damage sustained in flight. It is released to quickly 'set' in mid-flight and heal any damage. This advanced use of materials would create a highly survivable jet capable of entering even the most dangerous of scenarios to complete vital missions, according to a BAE Systems spokesman. BAE Systems sees the directed energy systems (DES) as an attachment weapon for aircraft that is capable of firing a concentrated beam of energy at the speed of light. Modern-day battlefields feature DES, complete with concentrated energy beams, which can be used to protect ground troops from incoming missiles or mortars. In the future this capability could be taken in to the air as an attachment for aircraft, allowing fast-moving jets to accurately destroy targets mid-air, the experts claim. The team works with the UK's leading aviation thinkers from universities, government and a range of companies to predict and explore how aircraft engineering might evolve.","BAE Systems planning sci-fi jets that can replicate themselves in battle .

"Mobile security experts set up a dummy banking app, pictured, to demonstrate how the technology can be hacked using reverse engineering . More than two thirds of us now use smartphones to make payments and check bank balances online. Many banking apps have a number of security measures in place - from two-step authentication to passwords and PINs - but they may not be as secure as first thought. A mobile security expert has revealed to MailOnline how these apps can be hijacked using free tools available online - and the hackers don’t need any of the user's login details. Winston Bond is technical manager at mobile security firm Arxan Technologies. To highlight the risks, he developed a dummy banking app before engineering it to connect it to an external server that could be run by a hacker. During a demonstration, as he signed into the app, the password was automatically revealed on the hacker’s server. During another demo, he sent money via the app. The server was able to piggyback onto the payment and even transfer money to the hacker’s account at the same time. Although this was a dummy demonstration, Bond explained it is the same process hackers are using to access official banking apps on mobile devices. The hacking technique used is called reverse engineering. The process involves taking an object apart to see how it works, either to replicate or improve it. As part of the engineering, expert Winston Bond connected the app to an external server that could be run by a hacker, pictured. During one demonstration, as he signed into the app on his iPad, the password was automatically revealed on this pretend hacker's server on a laptop, pictured . During another demonstration, Bond sent money to a person called Mark, via the app. The server was able to piggyback onto the payment and send money to the hacker's account, pictured here as A.Crook. Although this was a dummy demonstration, Bond said it is the same process hackers use to access official banking apps . Reverse engineering is the process of taking an object apart to see how it works, either to replicate or improve the object. It . is not just used for hacking purposes, and is often used by programmers . to find mistakes or errors in code in order to fix them. In . the case of apps, software reverse engineering involves translating a . program's binary code back into the source code that it was written in. This . source code reveals to the hackers how the app works, the steps it . takes to complete certain tasks and details about the app’s structure. A reverse engineer can use a various tools to disassemble a program. One . example is called a hexadecimal dumper, which prints or displays the . binary numbers of a program in hexadecimal format, making it easier to . read than binary. Another tool is a disassembler. This reads the binary code and displays each instruction in text form. Reverse engineering is not just used for hacking purposes, and is often a technique programmers use to find mistakes or errors in code in order to fix them. In the case of apps, software reverse engineering involves translating the program's binary code back into the source code it was originally written in. This source code reveals to the hackers how the app works, the steps it takes to complete certain tasks, and details about the app’s structure. Hackers are able to manipulate this source code by adding in lines that connect the app to an external server, for example, or code that tells the app to reveal the password each time it’s entered. More complicated code is used to create a rule, for example, that means every time a payment is sent, the same amount is sent to the hackers account. Accomplished hackers can also edit the code to hide these changes from the program, so the software assumes everything is working as it should. Once the changes are made, the edited code is uploaded back onto the company’s server. And, as Winston Bond explained, all of these steps can be carried out using tools freely available online. There are even online video tutorials that show programmers, as well as a hackers, how to access the source code of software. He did point out that iOS apps and software are more secure and closely monitored than Android, for example - except on jailbroken devices. 'Jailbreaking' is the process of removing . certain restrictions Apple places on apps and downloads, for example, . and makes it easier for developers to adjust settings. Reverse engineering is the process of taking an object apart to see how it works. It is not just used for hacking purposes, and is often used by programmers to find mistakes or errors in code. Software reverse engineering involves translating a program's binary code, stock image, back into the source code it was written in . Many apps are now using additional software, including those developed by Arxan Technologies to prevent hackers from reverse engineering their products. However, firms do not reveal if they are protected by such services so users are advised to only download apps from official app stores. People should keep an eye on bank statements and report any irregularities. They should also check in the phone's settings for any unusual looking processes running in the background. If any look suspicious, users can search online for the names of processes to see what they do. Experts also suggest installing antivirus apps on mobile devices. In many of the cases where banking apps are hacked, Bond continued the attack only works when a user . downloads a separate, malicious app. The demonstration was created after an Arxan study found hackers attacked 78 per cent of the top 100 paid Android and iOS apps last year. It revealed there were hacked versions of 100 per cent of the top 100 paid apps for Android, and 56 per cent of the top 100 paid apps for iOS. Last year, Arxan found attackers modified 80 per cent of free Android apps, and this year, this was down to 73 per cent in the same category. On iOS devices, 40 per cent were hacked last year, compared to 53 per cent this year. The research unveiled cracked versions of popular financial apps to be at 53 per cent for Android, and 23 per cent were Apple iOS hacked variants.","Mobile security expert has demonstrated how a banking app can be hacked .

"10 years on: Why Arsenal were the greatest Premier League side . Click here to read more about Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk . An air of trepidation descends upon Arsenal at Annual General Meeting time. Manager Arsene Wenger, majority shareholder Stan Kroenke and chief executive Ivan Gazidis all sat on the top table, perched like sitting ducks, waiting for one disgruntled shareholder or supporter to unleash his or her wrath. They needn’t have worried this time, though, as Thursday's AGM passed without serious incident. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger attended the Annual General Meeting on Thursday with several shareholders . The AGM was quiet and on the whole calm, perhaps due to Arsenal ending their trophy draught last season . Wenger celebrates at the FA Cup winners' parade after his side's triumph at Wembley . ARSENAL v HULL . Kick-off: 3pm at the Emirates. Arsenal should be looking forward to playing Steve Bruce’s men. In their last 12 Premier League visits to the capital, Hull have lost nine times and won just once. The good news for Hull fans? That win came this season at QPR. There was no repeat of 2012’s angry affair when fans vented their fury at Gazidis and Kroenke before Wenger emerged as the club’s hero once more with a rousing call to arms. Of course, last season’s euphoric FA Cup win has helped placate some supporters; no longer did they have the club’s near 10-year trophy drought to use as a battering ram on such occasions. There are those who believe a solitary trophy since 2005 still isn’t good enough for a club of Arsenal’s stature. However, but for one awkward question from an unhappy supporter asking Wenger why he failed to sign a new central defender during the summer transfer window, even Wenger’s biggest critics were far from vocal on Thursday. Things, however, aren’t quite so serene at the club’s medical department back at their London Colney HQ. Arsenal have nine first-team players unavailable for Saturday's clash against Hull City. Wenger’s biggest concern is in defence, with Laurent Koscielny (achilles), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended) all unavailable for the repeat of last year’s FA Cup final. Virgil van Dijk is once again being tipped for a move to north London but any deal for the Celtic defender will have to wait until January. Laurent Koscielny will miss the Hull game with an achilles problem, but Wenger says he doesn't need surgery . Koscielny’s long-term fitness is a major concern. His injury is a long-standing problem which has deteriorated in recent weeks. ‘It has got worse, he finds it difficult to play with at the moment,’ said Wenger, who insisted the France international does not require surgery. ‘If you wait for it to be better, it can be a short time. If you want to get rid of it completely, it is long term. We will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play.’ The fear is Koscielny’s injury could manifest into a problem that could see him miss months rather than weeks, leaving Wenger with the dilemma of whether to hand Koscielny an extended break or continue playing him and risk aggravating the injury further. Koscielny’s absence means Wenger is almost certain to use left back Nacho Monreal as a makeshift central defender alongside Per Mertesacker against Hull in a back four that could also consist of rookie right back Hector Bellerin and Kieran Gibbs. Arsenal’s lack of central defensive options merely gave weight to shareholder Nigel Payne’s question about why Wenger failed to sign a new defender following the exit of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona. Given the opportunity to answer Mr Payne’s query by chairman Sir Chips Keswick, the Arsenal manager declined, much to the fan’s anger. ‘That was a disgrace. I asked a question which every Arsenal fan I know feels so strongly about, which is why we went into this season with a very vulnerable defence,’ said Mr Payne. ‘I wanted to know if funds were available to strengthen the defence. The chairman said they always backed the manager. He offered Arsene Wenger the chance to respond and he didn’t.’ Nacho Monreal (pictured chasing Mathieu Flamini) could fill in at centre back this weekend . Thomas Vermaelen signed for Barcelona in the summer and Arsenal are yet to find a replacement . Virgil van Dijk could be on his way to Arsenal in January as the Celtic defender has impressed . However, Wenger did explain how he plans to solve the club’s defender shortage in 2015. Speaking at the start of the meeting, Wenger explained: ‘I agree we could have bought one more player but we didn’t find one. ‘But we will try in January to rectify that because we are a bit short because of the injuries we’ve had.’ Van Dijk is the leading candidate to fill the void. Scouts have made regular checks on the former Holland Under 21 centre half, who was called into the senior squad for the first time last month, and Sportsmail understands the club failed in a £7million deadline-day attempt to land the 23-year-old. The club, however, maintain an interest in Van Dijk and are primed to return for the Dutchman once the transfer window re-opens. Hopefully, that will calm Mr Payne’s angst. The big-money captures of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez over the past 14 months have helped dispel the theory from some supporters that the club’s board are happy to sit on vast cash reserves. Around £25m will be made available to Wenger in January to help strengthen the squad. But Gazidis, often the man left facing the brunt of hardline questioning at recent AGMs, sought to obliterate the notion that the club are holding back in the transfer market. ‘Inaccurate and superficial analysis leads to stories that we are hoarding a huge cash balance. That is simply not the case,’ insisted the club’s chief executive. ‘It’s quite untrue to suggest that the club is sitting on a huge cash pile which, for some unspecified reason, it refuses to use.’ Wenger will hope the remainder of the season is as smooth as the AGM. Van Dijk (left) challenges fellow defender Mikael Lustig at Celtic training as boss Ronny Deila (right) looks on . Virgil van Dijk is a 23-year-old Dutch centre back who plays his football for Celtic. He’s been extensively scouted by a host of top English clubs. What’s his pedigree? He came through the ranks at Willem II in Holland before moving to Groningen as a teenager, where he played in the same side as Southampton’s Dusan Tadic. He has played for the Dutch Under 19 and Under 21 sides and in 2013 he moved to Celtic for £2.6million. What kind of player is he? He’s 6ft 4in, so it’s no surprise to hear that he’s strong in the air. But he’s composed on the ball too. He’s particularly strong in one-on-one situations. What else would we look out for? For a defender, he’s not exactly goal-shy. He’s already scored twice this season and last year hit one of the goals of the season in the Scottish Premiership, dribbling from inside his own half to score against St Johnstone. Can he cut it at the top? Yes, at least according to Giovanni van Bronckhorst. The former Dutch star says Van Dijk can potentially be ‘the best central defender in Europe in the next few years.’ Van Dijk's career path . Groningen (2010-2013) Games 62 Goals 7 .

"If Republicans take control of Congress next month, their first orders of business should be to green light the Keystone pipeline and repeal Obamacare, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz says. Cruz, the vice chair of Senate GOP's campaign arm, made a 10-point pitch for Republicans on Sunday in USA Today and argued that the party should make it their goal to 'jumpstart the economy, safeguard constitutional liberties, and strengthen our national security' if they reclaim the Senate and keep a majority in the House. Republicans are all but certain to maintain the edge in the lower chamber, but the fate of the Senate still hangs in the balance and as many as 10 seats are still up for grabs. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz addresses a crowd at a Houston, Texas church last Thursday. The Republican firebrand made a 10-point pitch to Republicans on Sunday that includes a call to action to repeal Obamacare . Though Cruz is second-in-command of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, he is not part of the formal leadership structure in the Senate, and the presumed 2016 presidential candidate's list reads as much like the beginnings of a manifesto for higher office as it does a governing document. In it Cruz advocates for a 'pro-jobs, growth agenda' and 'fundamental tax reform.' He also makes the case for a balanced budget amendment. His other priorities include reigning in the Environmental Protection Agency, 'stopping illegal amnesty' and securing the border, blocking the appointment of activist judges, auditing the federal reserve, ending the culture of corruption in Washington, rebuilding the military and repealing Common Core and restoring America's leadership. Cruz said Republicans should also pass legislation that 'strips American citizens who join ISIL of their U.S. passports against innocent men and women.' In a nod to his presidential aspirations Cruz also called for the restoration of America's leadership international community. 'We should lead boldly. No Washington games,' he said. 'We will either pass a serious agenda to address the real priorities of the American people — protecting our constitutional rights and pulling us back from the fiscal and economic cliff — or the Democrats will filibuster or veto these bills,' he continued. 'And, if they do so, we will have transparency and accountability for the very next election.' Cruz is surrounded by well-wishers after he addressed the crowd on Thursday. The freshman senator if expected to announce his intention to seek higher office after the midterm elections conclude . Even if Republicans manage to wrestle control of the Senate away from Democrats they'll still have to contend with the president's veto power. If Obama sends a bill back to Congress the Constitution dictates that only a two-thirds vote in both chambers can override his decision. Cruz addressed that scenario in his op-ed in USA Today and argued that a presidential veto may be easier to overturn than it would appear at first glance. 'Democratic senators may not be quite so eager to join their 2014 colleagues in losing their jobs over Obama's refusal to listen to the people,' he said in the section on Obamacare. The Texas Republican argued that even if the GOP is unable to eliminate the president's signature law, it should try to gut as much of it as possible. 'We should pass repeal legislation (forcing an Obama veto), and then pass bill after bill to mitigate the harms of Obamacare,' he said. 'In 2017, I believe a Republican president will repeal Obamacare in its entirety,' he posited. 'n the interim, we should pass positive healthcare reform to start over, allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, and making health insurance, personal, portable, and affordable.' Cruz has not formally announced his intentions to run for president yet but political insiders expect him to throw his hat in the ring sometime later this year or early next year, potentially setting off a messy competition between Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be the state's favorite son. Perry has indicated several times that he's preparing to run for president for a second time in 2016, having lost the GOP nomination to Mitt Romney during the last election. At least two dozen other Republicans are also considering presidential campaigns next year. Among them are Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Bush led an ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday with 15 percent of the vote. Paul and Huckabee were close behind with 12 percent and 11 percent of the vote respectively. No other candidate received double-digit support in the survey, and Cruz ranked in the bottom of the pack, receiving support from just four percent of prospective voters.","Republicans are all but certain to maintain their edge in the House, but the fate of the Senate still hangs in the balance .

"It is panda-monium in pet shops in China as dogs that look like the country's unique and rare bears become all the rage. These dogs that look like pandas are selling out in pet stores across the country. In Chengdu city in southwest China's Sichuan province pet shop owner Hsin Ch'en cannot satisfy demand among the country's new middle class who want the cute dogs as pets. Dogs that look like pandas have become a huge hit with China's middle class as more and more of the nation's citizens look to own a dog as a companion . The cute animals have been selling out at pet shops across China. The panda dog is groomed and coloured in a certain way to make it resemble the nation's unique bear . 'Ten years ago the natural instinct of a Chinese person was to eat a dog,' he said. 'Now we are like westerners and want one as a companion. The cute breeds like French bulldogs and Labradors were the favourites, but now it is the panda dog.' Actually Hsin Ch'en is being disingenuous. The panda dog is not a separate breed of pooch at all, but rather a chow which has undergone a lot of cosmetic tomfoolery to make it resemble the panda. In Chengdu city in southwest China's Sichuan province pet shop owner Hsin Ch'en cannot satisfy demand for the cuddly-looking creatures . The real thing: Pet owners in China are willing to pay extra to have their dogs look like giant pandas . Pet shop owner Hsin Ch'en says there are 'no chemicals or cruelty' involved in turning chows into miniature panda lookalikes . He went on: 'I perfected the technique here and now it is spreading across the country. 'With a bit of careful grooming and colouring it is easy to turn a chow into a panda dog in about two hours. 'Then the look will stay with the dog for around six weeks and the owners bring them back for some touching up. 'There are no chemicals or cruelty involved. 'But the price of the dog does rise significantly because of the amount of grooming that goes into it. People don't mind paying the extra though - they like the fact that heads turn in the street and they can tell their friends: ""I have a panda dog"".' Cuddly: It takes about two hours to groom and colour a normal dog so it looks like a panda.

"Five men have gone on trial accused of trafficking a 13-year-old girl and taking it in turns to abuse her after she ran away from home. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was allegedly told she was a 'nice, beautiful girl' before being coerced into having sex with the men in hotel rooms and private flats in August last year. A jury heard how Mohammed Shapal, 22, and Shakeal Rehman, 26, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, and Usman Ali, 21, Bekir Rasheed, 36, and Yaseen Amini, 36, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, arranged her travel before abusing her. Scroll down for video . Court appearance: Shakeal Rehman, 26, from Bradford, pictured left, and Usman Ali, 21, right, from Sheffield, are on trial at Sheffield Crown Court where they are accused of abusing a 13-year-old girl . Thomas Storey, prosecuting, told Sheffield Crown Court that the girl had only just turned 13 when she took a bus from her hometown of Sheffield to Bradford, where she was befriended by a group of men. Mr Storey said Rehman and Shapal picked the girl up in the centre of the city. 'After driving around with her for a while they took her to a hotel for the night with the intention of some sexual activity taking place,' said the prosecutor. 'Once she was at the hotel she was raped by Rehman. 'He forced himself upon her, holding her down. 'He left the room and was replaced a little later by Shapal, who spent the night with her. 'During the night he too entered into sexual activity with her. Five men, including Bekir Rasheed, 36, from Sheffield, left, and Yaseen Amini, 36, also from Sheffield, right, are accused of abusing a girl aged 13 in hotel rooms and private flats in August last year . 'The next day, having been abandoned, she was picked up by Ali in his car. He drove her a short distance before he too had sexual intercourse with her in his vehicle. 'A number of days later she was taken by Rasheed to a party at Amini's home. It must have been clear to them that some sexual activity was going to take place.' Addressing the jury, Mr Storey said: 'This case is about child sexual exploitation of a 13-year-old girl by these five defendants and others, in the summer of last year. The court heard that Mohammed Shapal, 22, from Bradford, met the 13-year-old in Sheffield city centre and had told her she was 'gorgeous' and 'a nice, beautiful girl' 'Last summer a young girl ran away from home in Sheffield, at the time she had only just had her thirteenth birthday. 'There was an extensive police search but she was found a week or so later in Bradford.' The court heard that when the girl was interviewed by police, she worried about getting into trouble, and was embarrassed to disclose embarrassing information to adults she had never met before. The jury was told at the outset of the trial that when the girl got to Bradford, she fell into conversation with a man she had never met before, called 'Shaz'. The man is currently wanted by police for questioning about the exploitation. The girl was then allegedly taken to his home in Bradford and spent two nights there. While she was there he allegedly had sexual intercourse with her and he slapped her when she knocked over a drink. Mr Storey said the girl spent a little while wandering around Bradford after being dropped off by 'Shaz', and was followed by some other boys. The prosecutor said it was at this point when a silver VW Golf pulled up, being driven by Rehman, with Shapal as a passenger. 'He told her he was called Baby,' said Mr Storey. 'They said they wanted to help her so she sat on the backseat and told them her name. 'Rehman kissed her and told her that he loved her, and this no doubt made an impression on a vulnerable young girl.' The court heard the girl was taken to a hotel in Bradford, where Rehman booked a £40 room. That night, after the girl had been left alone, Rehman allegedly returned and knocked on the door, before she let him in. Mr Storey said: 'He pushed her on to the bed and kissed her and touched her. 'He took off his top and removed her clothes. 'He held her around the neck so she could not breathe and raped her. 'She told him that she was just 13 years old.' Rehman then left the hotel, before Shapal returned, the court heard. He described her as 'gorgeous' and 'a nice, beautiful girl', and despite her telling him she was too young, it 'didn't seem to bother him'. The girl told police that 'he had not abused her and beaten her up,' and that he 'was not rude to her'. Shapal returned to go to mosque, telling her he would be back, but he never returned to the hotel. Rehman denies rape and trafficking. Shapal denies sexual activity with a child and trafficking. Ali denies sexual activity with a child. Amini denies sexual activity with a child and trafficking. Rasheed denies trafficking. The trial continues.

"Phil Neville certainly caused some controversy with his comments on Match of the Day 2 on Sunday night by saying he would have gone in two-footed on Tomas Rosicky for showboating. I think it was a tongue-in-cheek comment more than anything, but perhaps ‘robust challenge’ would have been a better choice of words… . There’s no doubt, though, that if you are on the receiving end of some unnecessary trickery, it winds you up. The red mist can descend and you instantly think: ‘This player’s taking the p***.’ I found that more often than not things like this would happen near the touchline. Partly because of the type of flair players who play on the wing but largely due to the proximity of the crowd. Tomas Rosicky looks one way but passes another during the build up to his spectacular goal . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 win against Brighton . Phil Neville made the comments on Match of the Day, but later claimed it was 'tongue in cheek' Showboating and tricks are done to impress the fans and when you’re on the touchline, you are right next to them – players love playing to the crowd. As soon as a trick comes off, you can sense the reaction straightaway. You get this ‘wahey’ from the terraces and it can feel as if everyone is laughing at you. If players started doing step-overs in front of me, I tried to home in the ball. My thoughts would be: ‘Right, you’re taking the mickey here so now you’re going to feel the full force of a big challenge.’ It was a gamble because, if they nick it past you, you end up looking foolish but it was always a good feeling if you won the ball and were able to give your opponent a bit of a clump at the same time. I would go in with one foot – using two feet always felt unnatural to me – but that didn’t mean you couldn’t be strong to make sure they stopped. Rosicky celebrates his goal while Aaron Ramsey rushes over to congratulate him . Former Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale dived too late to keep out Rosicky's perfectly executed strike . It’s especially bad if the player is only doing tricks for themselves. When Cristiano Ronaldo was a young United player, he was ridiculed for his self-indulgent skills but now he uses that talent to win games. Rosicky had a good game against Brighton but the feints were designed to dummy his opponent so he could release a pass – it was done with the team in mind. Perhaps he went a bit over the top but I don’t think it was too disrespectful. He was playing with great confidence in a game where everything was coming off for him. Whether he would have done that against City the previous week is another matter. But every player can be tempted into showing off occasionally. When Arsenal won the league against Everton, even I had a go at a few step-overs. I thought if the crowd saw me pulling off a few tricks then they knew it must be a good day! If you overstep the line, though, and over-indulge, you’ve only got yourself to blame if you’re on the end of a few strong challenges. Cristiano Ronaldo was criticised for trying too much during his early days at Manchester United .","Phil Neville said he would have two-footed Arsenal playmaker Tomas Rosicky if he had attempted a no-look pass in training .

"Miss World is synonymous with scantily clad women strutting their stuff on stage. But this year the pageant will be significantly more subdued, after organisers announced that they are scrapping the traditional bikini round in a bid to avoid offending the Muslim hosts. The contest, which will crown a global beauty queen chosen from 137 participants, will take place in September on the island of Bali in Indonesia. Pageant: Miss World will not feature a bikini round this year. Last year's contest, won by Miss China, is shown . Wannabes: But whichever of these young women is selected to be Miss England will not have to take her bikini to the competition in Indonesia . The area plays host to millions of foreign tourists every year, and is known for its idyllic beaches where Western visitors are frequently to be seen sporting skimpy swimwear. However, Indonesia is a predominantly Islamic country, with more than 200million Muslims living in the South-East Asian nation. The country's top Islamic body, the Indonesian Ulema Council, has called for the Miss World pageant to be cancelled. And in a nod to conservative public opinion, organisers have decided that the contestants will not wear bikinis during the 'beach fashion' round of the event. Tradition: Miss World's 1989 finalists are pictured posing in their swimwear during the contest . Iconic: The 2003 contestants pictured posing in bikinis for a photo shoot on China's Hainan Island . Instead, they will cover up with garments such as sarongs which avoid revealing the body shape. Julia Morley, chair of the Miss World Organisation, told AAP that the decision was taken in order to show 'respect' for the hosts and other participating countries. 'I don't want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful,' she said. 'We treasure respect for all the countries that take part in the pageant.' Bizarre: Tourists pictured in Bali, where foreign visitors frequently wear skimpy swimwear on the beach .

"Passengers traveling overnight from London to Scotland can expect to travel in style - whatever the outcome of September's referendum. Caledonian Sleeper operator Serco - an English company -  has pledged to see out its 15-year contract for the service between London and Scotland regardless of the outcome of the election. They have also promised to improve the service with brand new trains, spending up to £50million on refurbishment, and potentially providing more jobs. Overnight service: Serco's pledge to see out its contract has caused controversy among rail unions . But rail unions have attacked the decision to take the sleeper out of Scottish hands and give it to an English company with Spanish trains and 'a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services'. Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said ministers 'had no choice', and insisted the appointment will herald 'a new beginning' for the service. Jamie . Ross, business development manager at Serco, said: 'We are fully . committed to a 15-year contract. Our new chief executive joined a month . ago and totally immersed himself in the sleeper bid. Refurbishment: An artist's impression of the en-suite berth on the new fleet of Caledonian sleeper trains . 'There . are no plans for staff reductions. Because this is being split out from . the main ScotRail franchise, if anything the total number of people . employed will go up. 'There's . a huge push to get local suppliers involved, most obviously in food and . drink but also in getting things like Shetland blankets, so benefits . flow out much wider than the network.' Mr Brown said the current sleeper is 'less than ideal' and Serco offers 'a dramatically improved prospect at a reduced price.' He said: '(Independence) wouldn't be a material consideration for them although we have seen in the past different franchise operators essentially ditching the contracts, in the East Coast Main Line for example, although we have no intention to see this change. It's a 15-year contract and that's what we intend to see through. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This decision flies in the face of everything (Scottish First Minister) Alex Salmond has been saying about an independent, financially strong Scotland. Planned upgrades: An artist's impression of the pod flatbed on the new fleet of the trains . 'He has taken the contract away from an Aberdeen-based Scottish firm and handed it to an English-based firm which will be given a £60 million subsidy to build new trains in Spain. How does that create any new jobs in his dreamland of an independent Scotland?' Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, said: 'No-one has taken on board the concerns of the staff who are currently involved, and their futures. We shall be contacting all parties on behalf of our members.' But Mr Brown added: 'We have no choice in (the franchise), we have to go with who wins the bid and the best bid came from Serco.' Eating in style: How the new brasserie-style club car might look . Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, a Highland MP, said the sleeper is 'a vital service for many Highlanders and an important link to the UK capital'. 'That is why the UK Government has set aside £50 million, with an additional £50 million expected from the Scottish Government, to refurbish rolling stock and support the long-term future of the route. 'As someone who uses the route, I am looking forward to the excellent service provided by staff being matched by facilities which will make the Caledonian Sleeper an experience to savour.'","English company Serco pledges to see out 15-year contract .

"A paedophile who was spared jail after molesting a five-year-old girl went on to rape a child by posing as a babysitter on the internet. Red Saunders, 23, raped a girl of eight and sexually assaulted another seven-year-old girl after tricking two families into believing he was a legitimate babysitter. He was hired through Gumtree, a popular online classifieds noticeboard, after using his brother’s name to pose as a child minder. 'Hoodwinked': Using a false name, Saunders advertised his services as a babysitter on Gumtree despite being convicted of molesting a girl when he was 15. Social Services even raised fears over his 'disturbing and profound predatory interest in young girls' The parents of the girls had no idea he . had been banned from working with children in 2005 for molesting a . five-year-old girl while working as a playgroup organiser at a gym. 'Your conduct amounts to every parent's nightmare' Judge Peter Rook QC . When . they asked Saunders to provide a document to show he had been vetted by . the Criminal Records Bureau, he claimed it was ‘on its way’. Following his arrest, police found a terrifying ‘abduction diary’ in . which he described how to kidnap girls, abuse them, kill them and . dispose of their bodies. Officers also discovered more than 4,000 videos . and pictures he had taken of children over the past two years. So badly decomposed: Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe at Old Bailey (pictured) that because Mr Corey's body was found 11 days after his death, the cause of death could not be established causing 'further distress to the family... the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence' He was described as ‘every parent’s nightmare’ as he was jailed for life . at the Old Bailey yesterday for a string of child abuse charges. He . will serve a minimum of eight years before he is eligible for parole. Cunning: : Judge Peter Rook QC told Saunders after sentencing him to life in prison, 'You inveigled yourself into the lives of decent families with great cunning' Judge Peter Rook QC told him: ‘You are obsessed with young girls. ‘It is clear to me that you are an intelligent young man. You spurned . your talents in order to plan carefully the systematic abuse of young . girls who had been entrusted to your care. 'You have acted out your . sexual fantasies without any thought as to the consequences of your . actions. Your actions represent a massive breach of trust. Your conduct . amounts to every parent’s nightmare. ‘You inveigled yourself into the lives of decent families with great . cunning. You presented yourself as plausible, charming, someone who . appeared to interact cheerfully and well with children. ‘It is quite clear your sexual offending is well entrenched. You have . been downloading indecent images of children since you were 12. I am . absolutely clear that you represented a high risk of serious harm to . young girls.’ Saunders, an art and photography student at Wimbledon College of Art in . South-West London, was banned from working with children for life and . his name will be on the Sex Offenders Register for life. In October 2011, Saunders abused a seven-year-old girl at her home, . filming it using a camera on a tripod. In April 2012, he raped and . sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl at her home on two consecutive . days, which he also filmed. He edited the footage and called the clips . Paedo Productions and My Legacy. Prosecutor Edward Lucas said: ‘In each case he provided an aide memoire . for himself, setting out what he proposed to do to both girls under the . guise of playing games. All of the details were a choreographed . step-by-step guide to what he was going to do to both children.’ Saunders, from Redhill, Surrey, was placed under a supervision order at . Guildford Crown Court in October 2005 after he admitted touching a five . year-old girl during a game of hide and seek at a local gym.

"Cocktail lovers rejoice! Australian researchers have developed what could be the ultimate ingredient for the piña colada of the future. In what is thought to be a world first, they have developed a new breed of pineapple that is not only sweet and juicy but which has the added tropical taste of coconut. Australia's Department of Agriculture today announced it is in the final stages of developing the new variety. The pina colada pineapple: Researchers with the Australian Department of Agriculture believe they are the first in the world to develop a coconut-flavoured pineapple - which could revolutionise cocktail making . The agency's research station in in Queensland has been working on the new breed, to be known as the AusFestival pineapple, for more than a decade. 'Taste tests tell us that AusFestival is a winner - it has this lovely coconut flavour, which you won't find in any other pineapple in Australia,' horticulturalist Garth Senewski told the Australian Broadcast Corporation. The piña colada was first served on August 15, 1954, at the Caribe Hilton’s Beachcomber Bar in San Juan, Puerto Rico by head barman Ramón 'Monchito' Marrero. According to legend, Monchito's managers had asked him to mix a new signature drink for the bar that would delight the demanding palates of its star-studded clientele. Monchito accepted the challenge, and after three intense months of blending, shaking and experimenting, the first piña colada was born. He made the drink using local Don Q rum mixed with Coco López coconut cream, which was invented the same year at the University of Puerto Rico. These days the International Bartenders Association defines the piña colada as a Collins-Type Long Drink and stipulates that it must contain one part white rum, one part cream of coconut, and three parts pineapple juice. Mix the ingredients in a cocktail shaker with crushed ice until smooth, then pour through a strainer into a chilled glass, garnish with a pineapple wedge and enjoy. 'It's sweet, low acid, very juicy,' he said, adding that its unique taste should prove popular with customers. The new breed of pineapple has the potential to revolutionise cocktail mixology. Currently piña colada cocktails are made by shaking rum, cream of coconut and pineapple juice together with ice, before straining the resulting mixture into a goblet-type glass. The AusFestival would do away with any need for coconut at all. Mr Senewski said the researchers did not initially intend to create a pineapple that tasted like coconut. 'When we're doing the breeding, we're not actually looking for a coconut-flavoured pineapple or any other particular flavour,' he told ABC. 'We're looking for a nice flavoured pineapple. We're looking for a variety that is sweet, low acid and aromatic.' The Department of Agriculture confirmed the development but said anyone hoping for a 'pina colada' pineapple will have to wait. It will be two years before the first are planted commercially.","Australia's Department of Agriculture announces it is in final stages of developing the revolutionary new fruit .

"Once, table salt was just a big tub of Saxa decanted into a shaker. Today, a host of salts in a rainbow of colours are claiming pride of place in our dining rooms. So, are they worth their designer prices? HIMALAYAN PINK SALT BRICK . £85, 12in platter, divertimenti.co.uk . WHAT IT IS: A huge, round slab of pink salt that looks more impressive than my marble kitchen. Top chefs are serving seafood on salt blocks instead of plates. It’s also a fun dinner party trick (just wipe with a damp cloth after each use). Salt is a part of most foods but rarely given a second thought . Alternatively, a smaller block can be passed between guests with a grater, like a block of Parmesan, so they can serve their own salt. The blocks are harvested from the Himalayas in northern Pakistan. Salt deposits were formed 600 million years ago when an inland sea evaporated, leaving behind crystals in an eye-catching pink shade due to the presence of iron oxide. BEST FOR: As a platter to serve a starter of prawns, scallops or smoked salmon. Or grate over tomato and mozzarella salad for a pretty glitter. VERDICT: I served prawn mousse wrapped in smoked salmon on this slab and my guests loved it. The saltiness is absorbed delicately by the food. I used a second slab so we could grate salt onto our main course of chicken ballotine. 5/5 . GAEA SMOKED SALT . A Greek salt harvested in the shallow Messolonghi lagoons using techniques that are centuries old . £8.99 for a trio of 85g salts, lakeland.co.uk . WHAT IT IS: A Greek salt harvested in the shallow Messolonghi lagoons using techniques that are centuries old. The salt is collected, dried and smoked slowly over a beech wood fire. Paprika is added, lending a burst of colour and a mild spice kick. The result is small crystals of an intense pink hue and an overwhelming smoky aroma. BEST FOR: Adding a distinctive smoked flavour to blander dishes. It works well on salmon fillets (sprinkled with salt and lemon and cooked in foil), scrambled eggs or in soup. VERDICT: When Lakeland told me this smoked salt works brilliantly with creme brulee, my favourite dessert, I thought they were joking. I’m still not convinced they weren’t, though it certainly turned this custard pudding into a talking point. Use sparingly. 3/5 . WINEMAKER’S DEEP RED SALT . £4.50 for 70g, souschef.co.uk . WHAT IT IS: If you love steak seasoned liberally and washed down with a fine red wine, then this is the perfect salt for you. It’s infused with Merlot and Cabernet, turning it a blood- red colour. This creates such a dramatic effect that its Facebook page has been shared almost 1,000 times, making it the first salt to become a social media star. BEST FOR: Rubbing into steak as a seasoning. The red wine flavour combines with the bite of the salt for a deep-flavoured steak and succulent juices. Alternatively, sprinkle on a salted caramel pud for a dash of blood-red drama. VERDICT: My children loved the look of these large crystals. I added it to lasagne — the wine taste and deep colour made a wonderful difference. 4/5 . BART BLACK SALT . Striking black flakes of sea salt . £3.19 for 45g, bart-ingredients.co.uk . WHAT IT IS: Striking black flakes of sea salt. Mediterranean sea water is filtered in Cyprus, placed into large stainless steel vats and heated until salt crystals form on the bottom. These are then dried and mixed with charcoal made in Sri Lanka from burning coconut husks. The result looks like tiny flakes of coal. BEST FOR: Using as a decorative salt to transform ordinary food into the extraordinary. Sprinkle on a pizza topped with ripped mozzarella and Parma ham for a simple yet memorable supper. VERDICT: This tastes like any other salt, but using it transformed me from tea-time Mum into a culinary superstar. I stirred it into chilli instead of the usual table salt and it turned my mince a deep, rich, plum colour. For a dinner party, I melted white chocolate and poured it into discs, then sprinkled black salt on the top and allowed the discs to set. The results looked incredible and my guests loved the combination of chocolate and salt. 5/5 . SEL DE MER . £2.75 for 250g, bart-ingredients.co.uk . This salt is harvested from salt flats on an island off the French coast . WHAT IT IS: This is harvested from salt flats on an island off the French coast. Water collects naturally and is then evaporated by the sun and wind. The natural crystals are scraped up with rakes. It is stored, but not fully dried, giving it a softer taste and the texture of wet sand. BEST FOR: Cooking with rather than sprinkling. If you want your poached fish to have a sea water taste, it’s perfect. Also good for casseroles. However, this ‘wet’ salt doesn’t work as a garnish at the table, as it doesn’t break down easily, leaving big lumps. VERDICT: Don’t make the mistake I did and put it into a salt grinder. It sticks and won’t sprinkle. I liked the milder taste — it tastes like a mouthful of sea water. Taking advantage of its wet texture, I mixed it with herbs and rubbed it on pork to make spectacular crackling. 2/5 . AUSTRALIAN MURRAY RIVER SALT . £10 for 120g, eicfinefoods.com . WHAT IT IS: Peach-coloured flake salt is extracted from Australia’s biggest river basin, which is dominated by the Murray and Darling rivers. Originally, it was farmed for use in the building trade. Then chefs tried it and discovered it was as delicious as it is pretty. The delicate colour comes from sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron suspended within a crimson coloured brine in river basins. Peach-coloured flake salt is extracted from Australia’s biggest river basin, which is dominated by the Murray and Darling rivers . Tens of thousands of years old, the brine changes composition and colour according to the weather — bleaching in the sun, but darkening in the winter — so your salt can be apricot, pale peach or almost crimson at various times. BEST FOR: It melts quickly when you cook it, breaking down into the food, so you can adjust the seasoning quickly without having to wait for the saltiness to kick in. However, this salt is so pretty it is best used as a garnish for baked potatoes, grilled meat and fish. I wet the rim of a Margarita glass, dipped it in the pink flakes and served spectacular cocktails to my friends. VERDICT: So mild in flavour that the Australians say you can eat it out of your hand — and they are right. If you can’t stomach strong tasting salt, this is the prettiest alternative you’ll ever find. If Disney did salt, it would look like this! 4/5 . PERSIAN BLUE SALT . £10 for 250g, eicfinefoods.com . WHAT IT IS: Said to be one of the oldest and rarest salts in the world, it is famed for its blue colour and sharp, distinctive flavour. When the crystals formed more than 260 million years ago, some were highly compressed without oxygen or light, causing them to turn sapphire blue. BEST FOR: Adding a quirky decorative twist to white fish or sprinkled over beef carpaccio. The bright blue colour adds impact, but it tastes like any normal salt. VERDICT: It comes in a jar sealed theatrically with wax and labelled so beautifully in blue and gold that it looks more like luxury bath salts than the edible kind. Taste-wise, it is like any rock salt — crunchy and hard. I don’t like rock salt on salad because I find the taste too harsh, so I tried this on poached white fish. The crystals melted into the fish, leaving an occasional startling blue speck. But you are paying for the colour, not the taste. 3/5 .","The slab of pink salt looks is more impressive than a marble kitchen .

"Facing jail: Jordan Higgins, 31, has admitted holding up a newsagent near his home at dawn and stealing £2,000 of cigarettes . Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins' son faces jail today after he admitted holding up a newsagent at dawn and stealing £2,000 of cigarettes. Jordan Higgins, 31, and a masked accomplice burst into a shop near his home in Cheadle near Manchester, in January. They pushed shopkeeper Steven Gee off his stool and then emptied the cigarettes off the shelves into a duvet cover. Both men were wearing headgear to hide their identities but no weapons were reported. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Higgins - who was given the middle name Alexander from his father - pleaded guilty to robbery. Dressed smartly in a suit and speaking in a quiet voice, Higgins also confirmed his name and details before being told he will be sentenced later following the preparation of reports. Higgins, of Cheadle  was given bail pending sentencing on November 13 but Judge Andrew Lowcock told him: 'The court is obviously going to be considering an immediate custodial sentence.' After the case Higgins was later seen outside court smoking with friends. Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - became World Champion. Alex Higgins famously sobbed as he hugged then wife Lynne and  daughter Lauren, then one. His son Jordan's Facebook page is littered with videos featuring famous moments in his father's playing career. Accompanying them are messages with one posted last March when the Hurricane would have been 65. It read: 'Happy birthday dad bit late was yesterday just woke up now after a mad weekend never forgotten xx.' Jordan was a pallbearer at his father's funeral alongside snooker stars Jimmy White and Ken Doherty. The Hurricane won the UK Championship in 1983 and the Masters in 1978 and 1981, making him one of nine players to have completed snooker's Triple Crown.

"Lamborghini today unveiled the world’s most expensive car - a super-aggressive model costing a staggering £3.36 million. The jaw-dropping Lamborghini Veneno Roadster is a limited edition hypercar which goes without a roof. It has been designed by the Italian firm to drive like a race car while being entirely road legal - making it one of the most extreme vehicles ever built. A little more expensive: The Lamborghini Veneno Roadster is a limited edition hypercar which costs more than £3.3million . Stylish: The Lamborghini Veneno Roadster looks more like a fighter jet than a 221mph hypercar . Acceleration: The Veneno Roadster should be able to go from 0-62mph in just 2.9 seconds . Lamborghini has fitted the Veneno Roadster with a 750bhp V12 engine which gives the topless motor a 0-62mph time of just 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 220mph. The radical machine, made of lightweight carbon fibre, follows the hardtop version which was limited to just three and came with a £3 million price-tag.

"Even after the passion has faded a little, a goodnight kiss doesn’t seem too much to expect from your partner. But according to research, it probably is. Eighty per cent of couples no longer kiss each other good night, it found – because they’re so focused on getting to sleep. Looking away: The survey of 2,000 couples found that 90 per cent do not say 'I love you' before they turn the lights out and 46 per cent of Britons sleep with their backs to their partners . A quarter said they cannot bear their . partner to touch them in bed, while 90 per cent don’t even manage to say . ‘I love you’ before they turn out the lights. And such is their mission to get a good night’s rest that 46 per cent said they sleep with their backs to their partner. But that might not be as bad as it sounds. Corrine Sweet, a relationship . psychologist, said the back-to-back position shows innocence and trust – . and body language during sleep cannot be faked. She said: ‘Inevitably, once the first . flush of lust wears off, with couples naked and entwined, it is more . likely that the need for a good night’s sleep predominates, so sleeping . back to back becomes a favourable position in bed.’ Indeed, only 1 per cent of the 2,000 . couples surveyed by Travelodge said they sleep in what the researchers . called the ‘heroic romantic movie scene sleeping’ position, with the man . lying on his back and the woman’s head on his chest.

"Change: Under Jeremy Hunt's reforms, patients will be able to register at any doctor's surgery they like, allowing people to sign up with a GP near work or their children's school . Patients will be able to register at any doctor’s surgery they like from next October. Traditional catchment areas will be abandoned, allowing people to sign up with a GP near work or their children’s school. Patients will also have the option of switching to popular surgeries, which will have Ofsted-style ratings under Jeremy Hunt’s reforms. The Health Secretary has appointed a national inspector to put GP practices into four quality categories, helping patients decide which to use. ‘GPs will have the freedom to take on more patients,’ Mr Hunt told the Mail last night. ‘You will be able to find the most convenient GP practice for you. Whether this is near to your work, your university, your school. This will help to reduce long-term pressures on our A&E services, give real choice to hard-working people, and drive up GPs’ standards.’ By allowing patients to register anywhere, it is expected that highly-rated GP practices and those which offer longer opening hours will thrive. Families who move house will be able to stay with their trusted doctor rather than re-register at their new address. Doctors will still be paid for the number of patients they have, so a surgery which is in demand will get more funding to cope with the greater workload. Patients who join a practice a long distance away will not be eligible for home visits, but the local GP commissioning groups, and NHS England which oversees them, will work on a system over the next year to ensure these patients can have visits if they become too ill to attend a surgery. Mr Hunt announced in yesterday’s Mail that he had torn up the controversial GP contract, signed under Labour, which had ‘broken the link’ between GPs and patients. From April, Britain’s four million over-75s will have a personal doctor to oversee their care and telephone consultations day and night. This reform is also expected to ease the pressure on casualty units. Mr Hunt said the botched GP contract had led to nine out of ten surgeries closing in the evening and at weekends. Richard Vautrey, a family doctor in . Leeds and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP . committee, said catchment areas would continue, except for ‘a different . type of patient who can register in any practice anywhere’. Success: By allowing patients to register anywhere, it is expected that highly-rated GP practices and those which offer longer opening hours will thrive . He added: ‘It would benefit those who are regularly away from home so they would not need to take time off work for appointments. But it is fraught with problems which will need to be worked out over the next year. People being able to join a GP practice anywhere could have unintended consequences.’ Under a separate deal, also aimed at improving transparency and choice, doctors’ pay will be published to help patients evaluate whether they are getting value for money. Doctors will no longer have automatic pay rises for long service but will be paid for the number of patients they have. The £450million handed out in seniority pay and inducements for hitting tick-box targets, which doctors say waste their time, will instead be given to GPs to invest in patient care and prevent unnecessary admissions to A&E. Only their income from the taxpayer will be published, not that for private work. Jamie Reed, a Labour health spokesman, said: ‘People should be able to join a convenient surgery, but the important part is whether they can get an appointment. Under this Government, it’s getting harder to see your family doctor.’","Reforms to surgeries proposed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt .

"When Sumo the cat was brought into the RSPCA last week he became the fattest cat to have waddled through their doors for decades. 'He is the biggest cat I've ever seen and I've been a vet for 45 years,' said Vicki Lomax, RSPCA veterinarian who works at the Wacol RSPCA in Brisbane where Sumo was brought in. Tipping the scales at 14.3kg, the nine-year-old ordinary domestic short hair weighs almost three times what he should. The nine-year-old cat is being cared for by Tanya Boland and her daughter Aislynne (pictured) for a month. Tanya is a vet nurse form the RSPCA and has put him on a special diet . Sumo, held here by Tanya Boland, is at risk of diabetes, as well as heart, liver and kidney disease and arthritis . To tell if your cat has packed on a few too many pounds, Vicki Lomax says you should feel the skin over their ribs. 'If it's difficult to feel their ribs, that usually means the cat is overweight,' she said. Owners should also weigh their cats - either at the vets or by holding their cats and subtracting their own weight from the total - to see if weight loss is working. To make sure you're not overfeeding your cat, check the back of the pet food packet and compare the recommended serve with how much your cat eats. 'If you're feeding it too much, you should feed it what the packet says. If that doesn't work, you should decrease the amount the cat's being fed by 25 percent,' recommends Ms Lomax. If owners don't see a change after a month, Ms Lomax recommends taking the cat to the vet, where the vet can check for hormonal problems or recommend a special diet. 'For a cat like him, 5 to 6 kg would probably be a reasonable weight,' said Ms Lomax. Sumo came to the RSPCA because his owners were moving house and could not take him with them. When he was brought to the RSPCA centre staff decided to name him and settled, for obvious reasons, on Sumo. As with humans, Ms Lomax said, pets get overweight from a combination of overfeeding and lack of exercise. 'Cats can be very persistent, there are cats that will follow you to the fridge and more or less demand food. There are owners who have trouble saying no, I guess it's like parents saying no to the kids,' said Ms Lomax. 'Overweight cats are pretty much subject to the same problems we have when we're overweight,' said Ms Lomax. Some of the dangers to Sumo's health posed by his size include heart and kidney disease, diabetes, muscle atrophy, and arthritis. Sumo is currently being fostered by one of the vet nurses at the RSPCA, Tanya Boland. She has put Sumo on a strict diet, he is now fed less than two cups of low- calorie dry cat food per day. On his new diet, Sumo should lose about 250g per week, which would put him on track to be a much healthier animal. Though his weight loss will present an interesting challenge to the RSPCA vets. 'I'm not sure what we're going to do with all his skin when he's done, he might need a nip and a tuck,' said Ms Lomax. 'I'm sure we can find a vet who can deal with it.' The cat weighs 14.3kg, almost three times its ideal weight of five to six kg .","Sumo has astonished RSPCA staff and is the biggest cat they've ever seen .

"Forecasters will soon measure the weather in space from a new operations branch set up by the Met Office. The Space Weather Operations Centre will open next week in Exeter after years of preparation and millions of pounds of investment. It was created in 2011 after the Government added Solar Storms to the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are among weather phenomenons forecasters will be watching out for in the new space weather centre . From next week, anyone will be able to find out about weather in earth's orbit and look out for potential disruptions. While immediate effects of weather in space are not always experienced on earth, solar storms can cause power outages or satellite failure across the world. Coronal mass ejections . Coronal mass ejections (or CMEs) are huge bubbles of gas threaded with magnetic field lines that are ejected from the Sun over the course of several hours. They disrupt the flow of the solar wind and produce disturbances that strike the Earth with sometimes catastrophic results. Solar flares . Another type of explosion that occurs on the sun which can disrupt earth's connection to satellites. Information provided by NASA . The need to monitor such risks has become even greater, say experts, as society is ever more dependent on technology. The Met Office has teamed up with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to build the centre which opens on Wednesday. Among the team's tasks will be to pinpoint possible sources of disruption near the sun. 'We'll be analysing sun spots to see how complex they are,' Chris Bulmer, a Met Office space forecaster told the Guardian. 'We know that certain sunspot groups are very unlikely to produce coronal mass ejections, wheras others are highly likely to. 'So we can forecast an elevated risk of a big solar flare or one of these CMEs happening.'","Met Office is to open a Space Weather Operations Centre on Wednesday .

"Paddling furiously through choppy waters off the Kent coast, extreme rower Charlie Head was almost on the closing stretch of a gruelling bid to row 600-miles from Cornwall to London. But when the 'gobsmacked' 33-year-old spotted a bedraggled Shih Tzu puppy stranded on rocks, he dropped all thoughts of his endurance challenge and swiftly changed course to pluck the terrified animal from the rising water and safely onto his paddle board. Mr Head, who said the dog - called Bam Bam - would have been submerged within ten minutes had he not spotted him, even captured video footage of the heroic rescue thanks to a camera fitted in his helmet. Scroll down for video . Lucky dog: Stranded Bam Bam, seen safe in the arms of rescuer Charlie Head, was moments from death when the extreme rower paddled past . Mr Head, from the Isle of Wight said: 'I was gobsmacked. I couldn’t believe my eyes. 'He was just sat there wondering what the hell to do. He was absolutely terrified. 'In about ten minutes the rock would have been covered with water. I managed to paddle out to him and then get him on my board.' The rower, who said tiny Bam Bam was the type of dog more likely to be discovered peeping from a woman's handbag than venturing into choppy waters, said the petrified pup snuggled down on the board as Mr Head paddled it to safety. 'He was terrified when I picked him up but I think he soon realised I was trying to help. 'And when he felt safe he snuggled up between my legs and we headed back to shore. It is incredible that he was able to get out there - this is not a big tough dog. 'It is the sort of animal people carry around in their handbags.'

The intrepid rower rescued Bam Bam on Monday as he rounded Hampton, off the Kent coast, en route from Cornwall to London as part of his training for a 3,000 mile cross-Atlantic trip in a one-man rowing boat. Mr Head embarked on the challenge in July, setting off from Land’s End and . rowing as far as he could every day before sleeping rough or staying with friends . each night.

Charlie is training on his paddle board as he prepares for a 3,000 mile cross-Atlantic trip in a one-man rowing boat . Heart-warming: Mr Head rowed Bam Bam to the safety of a nearby pub where the adorable pup was tended to by barmaid Chelsea Clark . After Mr Head rowed Bam Bam to safety the dog was whisked to the nearby Hampton Inn pub, where landlord Stuart MacKenzie took it under his wing and barmaid Chelsea Clark wrapped up the shivering pooch. 'He was stranded on the furthest rock out,' the barmaid said. 'He would definitely have drowned as there was no way to get back and the tide was coming in. 'We were calling him Pebbles until the dog warden look at his microchip and found out his real name,' she said, adding that she planned to keep Bam Bam if the Shih Tzu's owner isn't traced. Canterbury City Council spokesman Rob Davies said: 'We are trying to contact the owner. For the meantime Bam-Bam is safe at the Lord Whisky Animal Sanctuary.' Mr Head, who went on to complete his journey, is preparing to set out on his epic trip across the Atlantic in two months' time. 'It was great to help the little dog hopefully the good deed will bring me a little luck and help me complete the rest of the challenges,' he said.

"The first flying cars are set to go on sale to the public as early as 2015. Terrafugia has announced its Transition design, which is part sedan, part private jet with two seats, four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven . like a car, will be on sale in less than two years. The Massachusetts-based firm has also unveiled plans for a TF-X model that will be small enough to fit in a garage, and won't need a runway to take off. Scroll down for videos . An artist's mock-up of what the TF-X model will look like during flight. Terrafugia announced today that it's working on the TF-X, a flying car that can take-off from standing still, and is hoping it will be available within 12 years . Motorised rotors attached to the wings of the TF-X, announced today, make it possible to take off from standing still. This means cars could switch from driving to flying when they encounter traffic. However, the wingspan requires a diameter of 100 feet to do so . The Transition can reach speeds of around 70 miles . per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using a 23-gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 . gallons per hour in the air. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon. It has rear-wheel drive when on the road. The Transition comes with two passenger airbags, and a full-vehicle parachute. Last year, the Transition successfully flew at 1,400 feet for eight minutes. Commercial jets fly at 35,000 feet. However, it will not be cheap - the Transition will cost £190,000 ($300,000) And Terrafugia says owners must have pilot's licenses, and will need to . pass a test plus complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the car. Despite the advances in technology the Transition demonstrates, critics have said that it is still not the vision of flying cars seen in many sci-fi films. To answer these critics, Terrafugia has now also released designs for a TF-X Model of its Transition range. The Transition flying car, built by Terrafugia, making a banking turn in the sky above Massachusetts. The car flew for eight minutes at 1,400 feet during test flights last year, before completing the public flights in Wisconsin in July . This shot shows the Transition plane switching from drive mode to fly mode. The wings fold into the side of the car, built from a Sedan design. Drivers can only take off in the Transition from a runway. The Transition has a maximum flight speed of 115mph . A Terrafugia test pilot fills up the Transition flying car with petrol. The Transition can hold 23 gallons of usable fuel and uses 5 gallons per hour during flight. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon . Whereas the Transition requires a runway, the TF-X can take off from a vertical position because of motorised rotors on the wings. These rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors. Being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways, car parks and even when stuck in traffic. Although you will still need at least 100 feet in diameter in order to open the wings. According to Terrafugia, the vehicle will carry four people 'in car-like comfort'. It is expected to be able to fly, nonstop, for 500 miles. When the TF-X - a new flying car design announced by Massachusetts-based firm Terrafugia - is in drive mode, the wings fold into the side of the car and the rotors, which make it possible to take off in the TF-X from standing still, also fold away and tuck into the chassis . When the wings are folded away, the TF-X will be small enough to fit in a single-car garage. Terrafugia announced plans for the TF-X today and is hoping it will be road-ready in 12 years . The TF-X model has not been tested yet, and prices haven't been announced. Terrafugia hopes to have working models of the TF-X available for sale within eight to 12 years. Like with the Transition, you will need 20 hours of flying and a pilot's licence to drive it, though. The flying car has always had a special place in the American imagination. Inventors have been trying to make them since the 1930s, according to Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst who owns R.W. Mann & Co. in Port Washington, New York. But Mann thinks Terrafugia has come closer than anyone to making the flying cars a reality. The government has already granted the company's request to use special tires and glass that are lighter than normal automotive ones, to make it easier for the vehicle to fly. When its not soaring in the air, the Transition's wings fold up, pictured, to make it a road-ready two-seat car . Special rules: The federal government has eased certain regulations to allow vehicles like the Transition to come closer to reality . The government has also temporarily exempted the Transition from the requirement to equip vehicles with electronic stability control, which would add about six pounds to the vehicle. Mann said Terrafugia was helped by the Federal Aviation Administration's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport aircraft. The standards govern the size and speed of the plane and licensing requirements for pilots, which are less restrictive than requirements for pilots of larger planes. Inventors and engineers have been working on the flying car concept since the 1930s. Here, a 1947 Convair Model 118 ConvAirCar is seen in flight . Unholy alliance: The 1973 AVE Mizar attached a Cessna Skymaster airframe to a Ford Pinto. Its inventor was killed when the wings collapsed during a test flight . The 1930s Waterman Aerobile, pictured, was the first simple flying car to successfully be produced. A total of five were built and flown . Mann questions the size of the market for the Transition. The general aviation market has been in decline for two decades, he said, largely because of fuel costs and the high cost of liability for manufacturers. Also, fewer people are learning how to fly. 'This is not going to be an inexpensive aircraft to produce or market,' he said. 'It has some uniqueness, and will get some sales, but the question is, could it ever be a profitable enterprise?' Mann sees the western US as the most likely market, where people could fly instead of driving long distances. Terrafugia has been working on flying cars since 2006, and has already pushed back the launch once. Last summer the company said it would have to delay expected 2011 deliveries due to design challenges and problems with parts suppliers.","The £190,000 ($300,00) Transition is part-sedan, part-private jet and is due to go on sale in 2015 .

"Authorities in Florida on Wednesday arrested a 'fetish model' for her role in a collection of pornographic videos that police say show the gruesome killings of several barnyard animals, including the decapitation of chickens. Stephanie Hird, 29, is the second 'model' arrested on animal cruelty charges for her role in the videos, in which she is seen allegedly killing and torturing animals as a form of animal-torture fetish porn. Miami police arrested Hird as she attempted to board a plane at Miami International Airport. Her arrest comes less than two weeks after 28-year-old Sara Zamora was arrested on similar charges. Scroll down for video . Fetish: Stephanie Hird was one of two women arrested for allegedly torturing and killing animals in animal-torture fetish porn films . 'Giantess': Hird was featured on TLC in a 'giantess fetish' film where she pretended to be 1,000 feet tall to fulfill a fan's fantasy . Zamora has been hit with eight felony counts of animal cruelty for allegedly decapitating chickens and beating rabbits, amongst other forms of alleged torture. Authorities say that Zamora and Hird were hired to star in the videos by Adam Redford, a fishing boat captain who authorities believe was producing animal 'crush' videos, which are pornographic movies that show female actresses killing and torturing animals while engaging in sex acts. Authorities first caught wind of the videos when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals directed investigators to a website called 'SOS Barn,' according to the Miami Herald. Redford has been listed as a co-defendant in the case but is yet to be taken into custody. 'Torture': In one scene, Sara Zamora was seen groping a man's genitals with one hand and cutting off a chicken's head with the other . 'Producer': Adam Redford also has been charged but is yet to be taken into custody. Authorities say he was the 'producer' of the films . According to the Herald, Redford just completed probation after he was convicted of similar animal cruelty charges. Redford was arrested last year for a video filmed on his property that showed two rabbits shot with an air rifle at point blank range by a woman as part of a 'crush' video. After the animals are shot, they squealed and squirmed around before dying from their injuries. According to the Naples Daily News, Hird was named as the woman who appeared in the video. However, she was never charged with a crime in the case. According to the Herald, the recent video shows Zamora groping a man's genitals with her left hand while 'repeatedly cutting a chicken’s neck using hedge clippers with her right..' In other videos, Zamora posed in 'sexy outfits' after chopping the head off of a screaming bird. She is also seen in the videos beating chickens to death with a wooden spoon and karate chopping the necks of several rabbits, authorities say. Giant: Hird was hired to play a 'giant' in a video featured on TLC's Strange Sex series . Hird also advertises her sexual services on social media websites. 'Are you in touch with your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life . for yourself where you can experience them,' she wrote on her public . Facebook page in February. 'I have. I am f***ing crazy.' Hird even posted a photo of her and Zamora on Instagram with the hashtag '#PartnersInCrime. Hird's other fetish work includes starring in a video with a man who likes being manhandled by women - 'giant' women, specifically, which seems to be inspired by the cult classic 'Attack of the 50-Foot Woman.' In the video - which was featured on the TLC show Strange Sex - Hird acts like she's a giant while her male co-star rolls around on the ground pretending that he is being crushed by her giant feet.","Stephanie Hird, 29, also appeared in a 'giant fetish' video that was featured on TLC .

"A husband who lured his estranged wife to her death as part of an 'honour killing' and then wore her clothes to convince her family and friends she was still alive has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Ahmed Al-Khatib put on Rania Alayed's jeans and headscarf and then carried the mother-of-three in a suitcase less than an hour after she dropped their children off at his brother's flat in Salford, Greater Manchester, on June 7 last year. After killing his wife the Syrian-born Muslim, who fled the Middle East for Britain, drove her to the North Yorkshire area and buried her. Murderer: Ahmed Al-Khatib from was convicted of the murder of his wife Rania Alayed and sentenced to life with a minimum of 20 years in prison . Disguise: CCTV footage of Ahmed in Mrs Alayed's jeans and headscarf . Police have yet to find the site where the Syrian-born mother-of-three was buried despite numerous searches. A police officer today called the 'honour killing' a 'horrific act of self-pity', adding that Al-Khatib's 'male ""pride"" clearly couldn't take a strong woman trying to determine her own fate'. Al-Khatib, 35, was today convicted by a jury of her murder and sentenced to life. He admitted killing her but claimed he pushed her to the floor and she banged her head after she appeared to him in the form of an evil spirit. Manchester Crown Court heard the marriage was 'marred by violence' and that Ms Alayed, who previously lived near Middlesbrough, left him after years of serious domestic violence. She feared for her life and had sought help from the Citizens Advice Bureau, the police and eventually a solicitor - which had angered her husband's family. Brothers: Muhaned Al-Khatib (left) earlier pleaded guilty perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to three years in prison, while Hussain Al-Khateeb (right) was today convicted of the same charge and was sentenced to four years . The defendant's brother Muhaned Al-Khatib, 38, said he was not present at the time that any violence was used against Ms Alayed in his flat and did not bear any responsibility for her murder. He was cleared by the jury of that charge. Both he and Ahmed Al-Khatib, of the Gorton area of the city, had pleaded guilty to intending to pervert the course of justice by transporting and concealing the body of Ms Alayed. A third brother, Hussain Al-Khatib, 34, also of Gorton, was found guilty by the jury of intending to pervert the course of justice. Ms Alayed's body was in a suitcase which was later moved to Muhaned Al-Khatib's motorhome, which travelled towards the North East in the early hours of the next day. Muhaned Al-Khatib was jailed for three years, while Hussain Al-Khatib was imprisoned for four years. Opening the case, Tony Cross QC, prosecuting, said Ahmed Al-Khatib said he had been 'commanded' to bury his wife by the djinn, a demonic spirit in Islamic folklore, but the Crown rejected his defence of diminished responsibility as lies. The defendant said he went on to bury her between trees near to the A19 in Thirsk. He had lured his wife to her death on the pretence that she would drop off their children at the home of his brother to spend the weekend with him. Her brother-in-law left the address with the children some 45 minutes later and shortly after her husband walked out wearing her clothing. Ms Alayed's body was in a suitcase which was later moved to Muhaned Al-Khatib's motorhome, which travelled towards the North East in the early hours of the next day. Ploy: CCTV footage of Rania leaving with the children.

CCTV footage of Rania ariving at Arthur Millwood Court . CCTV footage of the children leaving Arthur Millwood Court, where the defendant's brother lived . In this still Muhanned leaves Arthur Millwood Court with a holdall . The jury was told that telephone, Facebook and message services were deployed to pretend to others that Ms Alayed was still alive. Ahmed Al-Khatib was arrested on July 4 and made no complaint of any mental illness, the court heard. He told police the relationship had been trouble-free until January last year when his wife rang police about a row when he had taken her phone. He said he had seen pictures of his wife in underwear. Detectives were told he had not seen her since April and he had tried to contact her 30 times but believed her to be in Turkey or Syria. Mr Cross told the jury: 'Quite plainly, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of these facts were lies. He knew full well. He had killed her.' The next day, Muhaned Al-Khatib told police that Ms Alayed was not alive and she was buried at the side of a layby on the A19. He denied helping his brother to bury her or murder her and said he had not seen her body.' Police outside a house on Knutsford Road in Gorton, Manchester in connection with the murder of Rania Alayed . He added: 'The court heard he agreed to show police where her grave was but the location could not be found. Greater Manchester Police said the search for Ms Alayed's body goes on. So far, GMP have scoured a number of lay-bys on a 15-mile stretch of the A19 with the assistance of North Yorkshire Police and the military. Following today's sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Reade, of GMP's Major Incident Team, said: 'Rania was a young mother-of-three with everything to live for. 'She was beginning to put an abusive and violent relationship behind her and had genuine cause to be optimistic for the future. 'But at the point, when she thought she might be able to create a better life for her and her children - free of the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of Al-Khatib - her husband snatched it all away in the cruellest and most despicable way possible. 'Invited to a neutral meeting place, he murdered her in cold blood while her children were in the next room. We might never know whether they heard or saw anything of their mother's last movements. 'To deprive his own children of their mother is both sickening and chilling in the extreme. To later attempt to justify the killing by claiming a Jinn was about to attack him is both insulting to Rania's memory and counter to all the evidence of a pre-planned honour-killing. 'And, make no mistake, this was an honour killing. Honour-based violence is committed to protect or defend the ""honour"" of a family and/or community, usually against young women, where they have acted outside perceived acceptable female behaviour patterns. 'Al-Khatib's murderous actions were motivated by his outrage and jealousy that Rania would attempt to take control of her own life and live a more Westernised life, after suffering years of abuse at his hands. Detective Chief Inspector Phil Reade said: 'She was beginning to put an abusive and violent relationship behind her and had genuine cause to be optimistic for the future' 'His male ""pride"" clearly couldn't take a strong woman trying to determine her own fate, so he carried out one final act that would ensure she could never defy him again. 'The irony is that this horrific act of self-pity has brought nothing but shame on him and his family. 'He has also told a catalogue of lies to wriggle out of his date with justice, which has not only created a considerable amount of additional work for detectives, but also prolonged the agony of Rania's family and has prevented us finding her body. 'We continue to employ the most hi-tech methods to search for her and we will not stop until we find her and she can be given the dignified burial she deserves.' Manchester Crown Court was told Al-Khatib and Syrian-born Rania had married in December 1987 when she was just 15 and had three children together. Prosecutor Tony Cross QC said it was a 'love marriage' rather than an arranged one but only came about as Rania’s sister was married to Khatib’s brother. Al-Khatib and Syrian-born Rania had married in December 1987 when she was just 15 . They fled Damascas initially for Greece but emigrated to the UK in 2004 and after living in Stockton-on-Tees for five years moved to Manchester where Muhned was already living. In that same year Rania began confiding in friends her husband was beating her. Mr Cross said a friend witnessed the aftermath of an attack and added: 'She saw Al-Khatib angry like a monster shouting he would kill her. It became clear to her that he and his family were controlling of her. 'It appears he was violent, sexually and physically and would force her to give him money. She told one friend she feared he would kill her. How right she was. 'He was prone to anger and openly displayed. He was contemptuous of females. He was also jealous. 'She had the courage to free herself from him using a solicitor and began to become a little Westernised. She went to college and had friends, male and female. 'This was all too much. During this period she was making friends outside her family circle. No doubt this was deeply resented by the defendant and in all probability by the rest of his family.' Rania left the family home in Longsight, Manchester with the children to move to a hostel and later in May 2013 rented a property in Cheetham Hill and filed for divorce. She had also formed a relationship with a married man she met through an internet site. Rania was last seen alive on June 7 last year when she met a friend in Manchester’s Piccadilly Gardens and told of a plan to drop off her three children with her estranged husband via Muhaned’s flat for the weekend. That evening at around 8pm she was killed at the apartment after Muhaned’s partner was told to stay away due to a 'family meeting.' Later Rania’s body was driven away in Muhned’s camper van and at 3am the following morning, the Leyland DAF 200 vehicle was spotted parked in a layby on the A19 by an HGV driver. Three hours later the camper van broke down and an AA man described the smell inside the vehicle as a 'rancid stench'. Another man said of Al-Khatib, Muhned and a third brother Hussain, 34, who was also in the vehicle: 'All three stunk, smelt dirty and looked like they had just run a marathon.'","Ahmed Al-Khatib killed Rania Alayed an hour after she dropped off children .

"Rumours that the health of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is deteriorating continue to grow, with the leader absent from his customary seat as the country convened its rubber-stamp parliament. Seoul officials said the absence from Thursday's meeting appeared to be Kim's first since he took power after his father Kim Jong Il died in December 2011. It has been claimed that Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese. Weight gain: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions . The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp. Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic. Kim has not been a presence in state media since attending a Pyongyang concert on September 3. There's been no discussion of the absence in the authoritarian North's media. Inspiration: Experts believe Kim Jong-un may be using his love of Emmental (left) to deliberately gain weight in order to look more like his corpulent grandfather late Kim Il-sung (right) North Korea is not accepting American offers to send a high-level envoy to seek the release of three detained Americans, it has been claimed. Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, said freeing the detainees could provide a diplomatic opening between the nations, also snared by Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons. But he said Washington would not give into attempts to 'extort' political gain from the detentions. North Korea last week sentenced 24-year-old Matthew Miller of Bakersfield, California, to six years hard labor, deepening U.S. concern over the cases. Miller, who according to the court tore up his visa on arrival in Pyongyang in April, was convicted of entering the country illegally to commit espionage. Another trial is expected soon for Jeffrey Fowle, of Miamisburg, Ohio, who was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at a sailor's club. North Korea's official Korean Central Television says the Supreme People's Assembly approved the promotion of Hwang Pyong So as the vice chairman of the country's powerful National Defense Commission. Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat. Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror. North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung. He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s. Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. 'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'","Kim Jong-un's health said to be at risk due to his high cheese consumption .

"The mother of a missing Ohio State football player has told police he texted her about his prior concussions the morning he disappeared. A missing-person report filed with Columbus police Wednesday evening says defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his mother he was sorry if he was an embarrassment but concussions had his head messed up. His mother told police the text was sent at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday. The 6-foot-5 senior missed practice Wednesday and Thursday and has not been heard from. A missing-person report filed with Columbus police Wednesday evening says defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his mother he was sorry if he was an embarrassment but concussions had his head messed up . His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused. The team's physician said Friday he's confident in the policies in which athletes are returned to play after injury or illness. He was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices. Karageorge was last seen at his apartment around 2 a.m. Wednesday, his sister, Sophia Karageorge told The Columbus Dispatch. She said her 22-year-old brother apparently was upset, and roommates said he went for a walk, dressed in black from his hat to his boots. The team's physician said Friday he's confident in the policies in which athletes are returned to play after injury or illness . Police said a missing-persons report was filed on the bearded, 6-foot-5, 285-pound former wrestler. Team spokesman Jerry Emig confirmed that Karageorge missed practice Wednesday and Thursday. Ohio State coach Urban Meyer described Karageorge as a hard worker and an important player in practice. 'Our thoughts continue to be with the family of Kosta Karageorge, and we pray that he is safe and that he is found soon,' Meyer said in a Friday statement. Karageorge, a former Buckeyes wrestler, joined the football team as a walk-on this season. He has played in one game and is among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at their final home game Saturday against rival Michigan. Karageorge's sister said he left without his wallet or his motorcycle. He has a history of concussions, including one a month ago, and might have become disoriented, she said. 'We're very concerned that he's not himself and that he maybe doesn't know what's going on,' she told the newspaper. She said after each concussion, he has followed trainers' instructions and received proper care, but 'his repercussions from (concussions) have been long-term or delayed.' Karageorge, a former Buckeyes wrestler, joined the football team as a walk-on this season . The team's physician, Dr. Jim Borchers, said Friday that he could not comment on the medical care of student athletes. But, Boarches said, 'We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness.' The Dispatch reports that about 100 people gathered Friday afternoon in Columbus to post fliers with the player's photo and description.","A missing-person report filed with Columbus police says defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his mother he was sorry if he was an embarrassment but concussions had his head messed up .

"With the rise of online dating, there has never before been as many ways of meeting potential partners as there is today. But one single man has taken up a rather different, and apparently successful, approach in his bid to find his soulmate - plastering posters advertising his search for girlfriend a across New York. Artist Dan Perino, 50, is pasting 500 flyers a day round Manhattan emblazoned with the message 'Looking for a Girlfriend', along with his picture and mobile number. Scroll down for video . Artist Dan Perino, 50, has been plastering posters across New York advertising his search for a girlfriend . The posters, which Mr Perino sticks to walls, lampposts and telephone boxes, have seen him inundated with more than 1,600 calls in over a week - and he has now even got a couple of dates lined up. He said: 'I'm not desperate - I just want to find a more meaningful relationship. I have already got a couple of dates lined up thanks to the posters.' The artist from East Village turned his back on more modern match-making methods such as dating apps and sites after being single for two years following the break up of his marriage. But in a spur of the moment move, he decided to print 500 flyers bearing the message: 'I'm really looking for a girlfriend. This is not a joke. Just tired of the singles scene and hoping to meet the right person. I am a professional artist and creative person. You know who you are. To me each and every person is beautiful. Open to the possibility of the relationship morphing into something more profound.' In the first few hours after posting the initial batch, Mr Perino received more than 100 calls - and despite a number of those being prank calls, he decided to carry on the campaign for one whole month. He is now even being recognised in the street as pictures of his posters are shared across social networking sites. The posters, which Mr Perino sticks to walls, lampposts and telephone boxes, have seen him inundated with more than 1,600 calls in over a week - and he has now even got a couple of dates lined up . Mr Perino said: 'It has been interesting to see the reactions of people. You'd be surprised at the amount of female attention it has drawn. 'Of course there have been some odd phone calls. But there has been an overwhelming amount of women getting in touch too. 'My family and friends think I'm crazy, but they see it works. Some days I wake up to hundreds of texts.' Some women however have not been too impressed by the campaign, with one female New Yorker telling local TV she thought it was 'kind of weird, and a little scary.' The artist from East Village turned his back on more modern match-making methods such as dating apps and sites after being single for two years following the break up of his marriage . Mr Perino remains confident his relentless flyer campaign will find him true love. He said: 'It definitely works, it is just my choosing and pickiness that is holding it up. 'I'm abstaining from sex right now because I'm looking for the right girl, not just a sexual encounter - I've had plenty of opportunities for sex over all those phone calls. 'I thought at first that it would take a week, but I'm hopeful that within a month I'll have found the right girl.'","Dan Perino pastes 500 flyers each day across Manhattan in search for love .

"Two scientific papers which claimed statins can do more harm than good in patients with a low risk of heart disease should not be withdrawn, an investigation has found. The articles, published last year in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), caused controversy by suggesting that the benefits of the cholesterol-lowering drugs in healthier patients did not outweigh the risks of side effects. Professor Sir Rory Collins, co-director of the Clinical Trials Research Unit at Oxford University, said the papers overstated the risks of statins 20-fold, and could put lives at risk by discouraging patients from taking them.

But an independent panel set up by the BMJ found there were no grounds for retraction. The journal did withdraw the claim that one in five people taking statins suffers side effects, but said the two papers as a whole ‘enhanced scientific debate on a topical issue’. Reported side effects of the drugs include type 2 diabetes and muscular pain. Professor Collins criticised the decision not to retract the papers, and said in his experience side effects are reported by less than 1 per cent of patients. A recent study of 27 trials, led by Professor Collins, concluded that even low-risk patients can benefit from statins. This led NHS watchdog Nice to last month recommend much wider use. Between five and ten million Britons currently take the drugs.","Prof Sir Rory Collins, co-director of Clinical Trials Research Unit at Oxford University, said papers overstated risks of statins 20-fold .

Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has made it clear he has no issue with Drake or his music, in an effort to clear the air and put an end to their war of words . After his near loss to Czech Republic's Jirí Veselý in the third-round at Wimbledon last month, Nick Kyrgios blamed Drake's music for his flat performace . Drake is yet to respond, but the tweet appears to be a peace offering after Kyrgios claimed the performer's music was to blame for his near loss to Czech Republic's Jirí Veselý in the third-round at Wimbledon last month. Following the match, Kyrgios blamed his bad start and general lacklustre performance on the music he was listening to before the first set. 'I came out really flat, so hopefully I won’t listen to that again! It was actually Drake. Didn’t do the job for me,' Kyrgios said after the game. Clearly rubbing Drake the wrong way, the performer hit back at the tennis prodigy's comments last Friday during a teleconference talking about hosting US-based Entertainment and Sports Programming Network's annual sporting awards the Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards this Wednesday, reported Stereogum. Drake hit back at the comments on Friday, saying he wants to meet the tennis player and 'chop him right down' About a week-and-a-half before his clash against Veselý, Kyrgios tweeted 'Own it- Drake', the name of a track off the artist's current album Nothing Was the Same . 'I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music,' the rapper said. 'I also want to meet that guy and look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. 'Nick whatever-his-name-is — 'cause he didn't win, so that's how he's going to be remembered: ""Nick whatever-his-name-is"".' Contrary to Drake's comments, Kyrgios won the match and went on to beat world number one Rafael Nadal before going down to Milos Raonic in the quarterfinals. About a week-and-a-half before his clash against Veselý, Kyrgios tweeted 'Own it- Drake', the name of a track off the artist's current album Nothing Was the Same. Nick Kyrgios, was spotted driving around his home-town of Canberra in a flashy new silver Mercedes on Monday . The 19-year-old arrived home to his family in Canberra on Sunday . On Monday Kyrgios was spotted driving around his hometown of Canberra in a new silver Mercedes after arriving back home on Sunday. The teenager has been enjoying some down time with a few friends at home since his stellar Wimbledon appearance. 'It was great to come home to my Mum and brother Christos, the reception at Canberra Airport was so special and to see so many people come out to greet me was more than I could have asked for, it was very humbling actually and I felt a little embarrassed that they were there for me,' Kyrgios wrote in his blog on Saturday. 'I've managed to catch up with my mates and hang out with the boys, shoot some hoops and eat copious amounts of Sushi and Chinese foods since I've been home although from today I will eat cleaner as I have one eye on next week and heading down to Melbourne for a few days with Todd to start my training block.' 'I've managed to catch up with my mates and hang out with the boys, shoot some hoops and eat copious amounts of Sushi and Chinese foods since I've been home,' the tennis player said . Kyrgios also reflected on his loss to eight seed Milos Raonic, who knocked him out of the Wimbledon competition on his blog . 'People keep talking about how my life will change forever and although I feel exactly the same and believe me, my mates and my family will not allow me to change but I have noticed a change in the way people are now towards me. 'I notice a lot more people stare and point, others come and say well done and what not which I prefer, but it's all positive.' Kyrgios also reflected on his loss to eight seed Milos Raonic, who knocked him out of the Wimbledon competition. 'In the quarters as you could probably see, I was cooked and really needed that day off in between but I guess that is the nature of the beast playing on grass at Wimbledon, the schedule is something that can change more than at any other slam and you have to take the rough with the smooth,' he said. 'I'll go away and work harder to make sure I am better equipped for that next time.' The tennis star will spend the next few weeks training in Melbourne and Canberra for the US Open.

"Jose Mourinho is keeping an eye on Raphael Varane's contract situation at Real Madrid ahead of showdown talks with Bernabeu bosses over a new deal. Chelsea boss Mourinho is still in the market for a defender and a striker, despite an already busy summer transfer window, and rates Varane as Europe's finest young defender. The 21-year-old's representatives will meet senior staff in Madrid next week as the French centre back looks to at least treble his £25,000-per-week wages to a figure more in line with other members of Real's squad. Class act: Raphael Varane is exactly the sort of defender that Jose Mourinho is in the market for . Watchful eye: Mourinho will consider a move for the France centre back is his contract talks falter . Varane has three years left on the deal he signed upon joining the European champions, under Mourinho's tutelage, in 2011 and is hoping his rise through the ranks to become first choice centre back at the Bernabeu will allow him to negotiate an impressive new deal. But if Real bosses do not submit to the French international's demands he would consider a move to Stamford Bridge - and his close bond with The Special One would allow him to encourage Chelsea's interest. Madrid have tried in the past to tie down their star youngster but without success and will be wary of Chelsea and Mourinho's interest which could see one of Europe's hottest prospects quitting the Spanish capital for a move to London. Although a fee is yet to be considered with Varane's position uncertain, the bidding for any potential deal would likely start at around £25million.

"A British dog breed which was rarer than the giant panda has been saved from extinction following a concerted effort by breeders. There were only 52 Sussex spaniels registered with the Kennel Club in 2011, compared with 50,000 labradors. And there are believed to be up to 2,000 giant pandas living in the wild and more than 250 in captivity. Numbers of the dogs - first bred in Hastings in the 1800s for hunting - have been fragile since, dropping to only seven after the Second World War. But now the Sussex spaniel has increased by 29 per cent  to 74 registrations  to meet demand for the compact dogs. Finley takes off in wintery weather - Sussex spaniels are very active dogs . Megan Bowe plays in the garden with Sussex puppies bred by her granny . The Sussex spaniel breed has hazel eyes, a liver-coloured nose and a frowning brow . They are expected to hit three figures this year, after a group of breeders clubbed together to save the spaniels. It is hoped last year's births will help the population into a sustainable future as they become old enough to be used for breeding. Sheila Appleby, secretary of the Sussex Spaniel Association, said: 'It is a small breed so most of us know each other and we all love and care about our dogs. 'In 2011, a group of people who knew the breed just all together decided to have a litter in 2012. 'There were eight litters in the first quarter of 2012, six in the second and two in the third. It is not that many litters compared to other breeds, but it is progress. Okimat of Fourclovers (left), a fine example of he breed, was born 1930 and owned by Mrs Freer.

Grin, Bertie and Tollie all belong to Sheila Appleby, secretary of the Sussex Spaniel Association . These Sussex spaniels are drawing breath among the bluebells . 'The population of Sussex spaniels has been struggling since the Second World War, for some reason - we're not sure why. 'They don't seem to be very popular and they are not easy dogs to breed. People tend to go for cocker spaniels or English springers instead. 'We are doing more and more to spread the word about them and it seems to be working. There were quite a few people waiting for puppies so the demand was there.' The Sussex spaniel is believed to have been founded by Augustus Elliott Fuller in the 1800s in Rosehill, Sussex. The breed was identified by the Kennel Club in 2004 as a vulnerable British breed. The Sussex Spaniel Association was formed in 1924 for the 'protection of the Sussex Spaniel'. The association has 220 members. The Sussex spaniel is a happy healthy dog. He makes a good gun dog, a show dog, or a pet and is very adaptable. It is a guarding breed and the dogs are quite possessive of their owners. They . are fine with people and children but they need plenty of . socialisation, puppy classes, obedience classes, time and patience. They live happily with other dogs, though they are usually top dog! He bred the dogs to work on his large estate until the 1850s, when he died. Other breeders took up Sussex spaniels and the population remained healthy but small until the Second World War, when many stopped their breeding programme due to rationing. Only seven Sussex spaniels are known to have survived the war, living with animal-lover Joy Freer, who devoted her life to keeping the breed going. The population has remained fragile ever since, with Sussex Spaniel Association members attempting to maintain the breed. Mrs Appleby, who is based in Emery Down, Hampshire, added: 'I don't know why they are not popular because they are lovely dogs. 'They are happy and healthy and are very adaptable. ""They're lovely dogs but can be a bit bossy. I often get that look which says ""This is my sofa"". 'I would certainly recommend them as a loyal and loving pet.' She said the rich golden-coloured dogs, which cost around £800 each, have a unique look, being smaller, lower and more compact than some other spaniels. 'They especially enjoy being around people.' A slightly different version of the breed is popular in America. New playmates: Martin and Sophie with a litter of Sussex puppies owned by Sheila Appleby . Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said: 'Everybody is talking about the post-Olympic baby boom but perhaps the celebration of our British heritage in 2012 has helped lead to a revival of some of our native breeds. As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of lowland areas in China . 'Fashion and profile have the most influential impact on dog choice and we are pleased to see there is still a place in people’s hearts and homes for our British vulnerable breeds. 'Many are still at risk but there has been significant improvement in some breeds. 'It is great to see responsible breeders rallying together to support the breed they love. Kennel Club registrations for the Sussex Spaniel have increased by 29 per cent since 2011 largely thanks to these dedicated breeders, who are helping the Kennel Club to raise awareness about the breed amongst people who might not previously have heard of its existence. 'We would thoroughly recommend anyone thinking about buying a pedigree dog to consider the Sussex Spaniel, a wonderfully charming breed, and would suggest visiting the Discover Dogs area of this year’s Crufts, in Birmingham from the 7th to the 10th of March, to meet the breed and to chat to current owners about the many fantastic qualities these dogs possess. 'People need to make sure that any dog that they choose is a good fit for their lifestyle but we hope that by highlighting these lesser known breeds people will do their research thoroughly before they buy to see if these dogs might be for them.' Other breeds that have significantly increased in popularity include the English toy terrier (black and tan) which has seen a 25 per cent increase to 126 puppy registrations and the Irish water spaniel which has gone up by 32 per cent to 148 registrations. Historic shot: From left, Mrs D. Bailey's Quintic Cloverleaf of Daelyb, Creswelshaw Oriel of Daelyb,Topjoys Bisto Brown and Topjoys the Brazen Raisin . The English setter has come off the Kennel Club’s list of native dog breeds that could be at risk of extinction after registrations increased by 25 per cent in 2012. However, the significant decline of the smooth fox terrier by 46 per cent to 94 registrations and of the Clumber spaniel by 56 per cent to 151 puppy registrations, means that the overall number of dogs within the 35 breeds on the Vulnerable and At Watch lists has increased by 1 per cent.

"Nasa has reveal new details of its plan to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and Mars in the 2030s. The space agency was recently given the go-ahead for a mission to redirect an asteroid into the moon’s orbit, land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to Mars. Development of key components of the deep-space rocket, capsule and infrastructure needed to reach Mars are already underway . Scroll down for video . Nasa's 'Path to Mars' graphic sets out the steps needed to send humans to an asteroid and Mars by the 2030s . There will be two versions of the SLS rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. Nasa’s top human exploration chief has revealed to a Senate panel plans for a manned mission Mars in the 2030s are on track. Development of key components of the deep-space rocket, capsule and infrastructure needed to reach Mars are already underway - and today Nasa was given the go-ahead for a mission to land on an asteroid as part of a 'stepping stone' to Mars. 'Our next step is deep space, where NASA will send a robotic mission to capture and redirect an asteroid to orbit the moon,' Nasa said today. 'Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will explore the asteroid in the 2020s, returning to Earth with samples. 'This experience in human spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit will help NASA test new systems and capabilities, such as Solar Electric Propulsion, which we’ll need to send cargo as part of human missions to Mars.' A House subcommittee recently approved an authorization bill that would allow Nasa to redirect an asteroid into the moon’s orbit, land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to Mars. 'Beginning in FY 2018, NASA’s powerful Space Launch System rocket will enable these “proving ground” missions to test new capabilities,' Nasa said. 'Human missions to Mars will rely on Orion and an evolved version of SLS that will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever flown.' How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . The agency will now have to spell out the cost and details of the mission as part of an exploration 'roadmap' to Mars that Nasa will have to submit to Congress. The approval came as associate Nasa  Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier told members of a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation subcommittee that the agency remains on target to launch an uncrewed mission in 2017 to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle that will carry astronauts to Mars. Avionics testing of solid rocket boosters was completed this week at Kennedy Space Center in preparation for a test of the SLS rocket later this year, and acoustic testing is also underway. 'There is real hardware in manufacture for the path to Mars,' Gerstenmaier told senators. 'Our architecture is designed for long-term human exploration of our solar system, including the goal of human missions to Mars.' The hearing, called 'From Here to Mars,' outlined intermediate space missions being planned as steps toward long-duration space travel. 'With the technologies and techniques we develop, we will enable expeditions to multiple destinations, ultimately allowing us to pioneer Mars and other destinations as we lay the  groundwork for permanent human settlements in the solar system,' Gerstenmaier  said. NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. One planned mission is to a near-Earth asteroid, Gerstenmaier said. 'NASA will employ SLS and Orion for an early human exploration mission to perform pioneering human operations further from the Earth than ever before, rendezvousing with and returning samples from an asteroid redirected to at stable orbit around the Moon by the robotic segment of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM),' he explained. 'We're going to grab a piece of the solar system, we're going to deflect it around the moon and insert it into a distant retrograde orbit around the moon where our crews can go visit,"" he said. 'To think we're moving a piece of the solar system for our use that will allow us to learn skills and techniques that we need to push the human presence into the solar system, that's a pretty awe-inspiring statement.' However, the ambitious Mars mission could be delayed or derailed if funding from a budget-conscious Congress continues to erode, or if other countries’ plans for a lunar mission force the U.S. to change course for security reasons.","Giant deep space SLS rocket already being built .

"A stray dog has been hailed a hero after it saved the life of a three-year-old girl who had gone missing on freezing marshland - by cuddling up to her throughout the night. Little Julia wandered out of her grandmother's home, in Pierzwin, Poland, with a local mongrel called Czarue as the sun set on Friday. But as darkness fell the friends got lost as they wandered deeper into a nearby forest. Scroll down for video . Hero hound: Czarue the mongrel has been hailed a hero after using his own body heat to keep three-year-old Julia alive in a dark forest . When her grandmother Danuta realised the little girl was missing she raised the alarm, triggering a major search operation as temperatures dropped to -5C. It was not until the next morning that the rescue team stumbled across Julia, wet from lying on moist ground, clinging on to Czarue and crying for her mother - four miles from her home. Fireman Grzegorz Szymonowski said: 'This . dog is the most important part of this story, he is a hero. It is . thanks to this dog that the girl survived the night. Born free: Czarue runs through the village of Pierzwin, in Poland, where he lives . Creature comfort: Little Julia wandered out of her grandmother's home, in Pierzwin, Poland, with Czarue as the sun set on Friday . Search: Julia's disappearance sparked a massive search operation with more than 200 rescue crews scouring the countryside throughout the night . 'We ran around 500 metres, and there was silence. We stood to listen further and we heard the dog and later the crying of a child. We went in the direction and saw the child lying in the shrubs, she was wet because there was water in the forest.' Her grandmother Danuta Balak said the dog had become the girls best friend, adding: 'She was with this dog all the time. She didn't go anywhere without it. 'When she was with me, when I was looking after her, she constantly said, ""Granny, the dog needs to come in the house"". And she told me to cut bread and she fed it all the time.'

Combing the forest: When her grandmother Danuta realised the little girl was missing she raised the alarm, triggering a major search operation as temperatures dropped to -5C . Julia is now is being treated for light symptoms of frostbite. Head of the paediatric ward in Zielona Gora hospital Kazimiera Barczyk said the girl is being treated for light symptoms of frostbite. 'The only unusual symptoms are swollen hands and feet, probably from the frost. A surgeon inspected this and prescribed ointments. The next few days will show if there is some deeper frostbite, or just surface changes,' Barczyk said. Home sweet home: Julia went missing from her home (pictured) on Friday evening . 'This dog, which was with her most probably kept her warm. It lay down next to her when she fell asleep. She was walking and walking, and fell asleep when she got tired. The child was brought just before eight o'clock, at the beginning she was scared of people, and she was in shock. At the moment her mother is going through a lot of stress,' she added. Police and fire-fighters said that damp soil and marshes in the surrounding forests made the search especially difficult for the use of search dogs and a police helicopter found no trace of the girl on the ground.","Julia walked out of her grandmother's home, in Pierzwin, Poland, on Friday .

"Ammi Midstokke, 36, was pinned down by a huge rock which shifted as she walked across it . A mother has spoken of her relief at being rescued after her leg got trapped when a two-ton boulder shifted during a mountain hike. Ammi Midstokke, 36, had to spend a night on Chimney Rock north of Coeur d'Alene at the weekend after she was pinned down by the huge rock which shifted as she walked across it. Her hiking partner tried to free her leg, but when it became clear he could not move the boulder search-and-rescue teams were called. Bonner County emergency officials received a distress call about 5:30 p.m. Friday. More than 20 rescuers from Priest Lake Search and Rescue and the Bonner County EMS Wilderness Response Team set out on foot after 8 p.m. with rope, medical gear and pry bars . It took until 12:49 a.m to reach the nutritional advisor because of the extremely steep, rocky terrain. 'This was the most technically difficult rescue we've done,' said Mike Nielsen, commander of Priest Lake Search and Rescue. 'Rescuers had to cross a crumbling rock ledge that was only 10 inches in some places with packs on, in the dark, with only headlamps. 'That's why it took so long to access her.' Midstokke wrote on her Facebook page: 'After a successful summit of Chimney Rock, a boulder came down on me while crossing the talus fields, pinning me in its path. 'Attempted self-rescue but it was both too heavy and too dangerous. Midstokke had to spend a night on Chimney Rock north of Coeur d'Alene at the weekend . It took rescuers about 40 minutes to free the woman's leg using pry bars, mechanical advantage and muscle . Eight hours after she was first trapped rescuers were able to hoist the boulder and extract her foot. Her injuries were then stabilized, but rescuers couldn't bring her out in the dark so they spent the night. 'I couldn't have hoped for a more competent adventuring partner or a better group of rescuers,' she wrote on her Facebook page . 'We called Search and Rescue and tried to stabilize me with heat and good stories. 'Eight hours later, well past midnight, they were able to hoist the boulder and extract a very deformed, very dead looking foot. 'There was much drama on my end as blood began to flow into the foot and the team transported me to safe ground. It was apparent that hiking out wasn't an option, so we hunkered down until the Air Force could lift me out after daylight. 'Initial X rays show tarsal breakage but a remarkably whole foot. We'll know more later this week. Midstokke was picked up at 8:45 a.m. Saturday by a helicopter from the Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment . She  posted photos of her swollen foot Facebook alongside an X-ray which she captioned: 'The foot stays!!!' Midstokke, a nutritional advisor,  is now recovering after her ordeal .

"On a remote island in the Indian Ocean, researchers have spotted fur seals sexually harassing and coercing king penguins. On at least four occasions, the large mammals have been recorded forcing the birds to the ground and attempting to mate with them. After three of the incidents, the seals let the penguins go - but following one attack, the seal killed the penguin and ate it. This article contains images and video that some readers may find disturbing . On four recent occasions, researchers spotted Antarctic fur seals sexually harassing king penguins (pictured). In three of the four incidents, the seal let the penguin go, but following one occurrence, the seal killed and ate the penguin . Scientists from the University of Pretoria regularly monitor wildlife on Marion Island for rare and unusual behaviour. Although the behaviour has been spotted once before, in 2006, this recent spate suggests the acts are becoming more widespread. Each of the four recorded sexual incidents showed the seal chasing, capturing and mounting the penguins. They then attempted to copulate for between two-and-a-half minutes and six minutes, before they are seen resting and trying again. The average copulation time was five minutes. Experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour, because the incidents have occurred with different fur seals. And the incidents may continue, but the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit this behaviour are not known. The researchers speculated that the seals may be sexually inexperienced, or frustrated, or it may be an act of aggression. They may also have difficulty recognising female seal partners. ‘Honestly I did not expect that follow up sightings of a similar nature to that 2006 one would ever be made again, and certainly not on multiple occasions,’ Nico de Bruyn, of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, South Africa told the BBC. Each of the four recorded sexual incidents showed the seal chasing, capturing and mounting the penguins. They then attempted to copulate for between two-and-a-half minutes and six minutes at a time, before they are seen resting and trying again. The average copulation time was five minutes. The seals were all male, but the gender of the penguins isn’t known. Experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour, because the incidents have occurred with different fur seals. And the incidents may continue - but the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit this behaviour are not known. 'Determining the drivers of the unusual behaviour is nearly impossible,' explained the researchers. 'However, we speculate as to what may have ultimately led to the sexual coercion of individuals from these very different species.' For example, Mr De Bruyn originally suggested the sexual coercion was a result of the seal's predatory behaviour towards the penguins being redirected into sexual arousal. Experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour, but, the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit it are not known. During a number of the attacks, the experts said the seals successfully penetrated the birds, and during the most recent, in December 2012, blood was seen between the bird’s legs (bottom left) But, in light of the 2011 attack - when the seal killed the penguin - he added that this seems less plausible. He therefore believes the behaviour may have been learned . The researchers have speculated that the seals may also be sexually inexperienced, or frustrated, or it may be an act of aggression. They may also have difficulty recognising female seal partners.

"Judge David Farrell agreed that he thought the girl looked like she was 14 . Two men have been jailed for just 40 months each for raping an 11-year-old girl after a judge agreed she was a 'willing participant', despite being five years below the age of consent. Roshane Channer and Ruben Monteiro admitted assaulting the child in a block of flats in Luton, Bedfordshire. Despite describing their crime as 'abhorrent', Judge David Farrell QC jailed the defendants, who are both 21, for less than three and a half years. He said this was because he accepted their claim that she was a willing participant and agreed that she looked like she was 14. The legal age for consent is 16. Jo Wood, Rape Crisis spokesman, said: 'It is horrendous that any Judge can . even begin to imagine that an 11 year old child is capable of consenting . to being simultaneously raped by two men while being filmed. 'This . youngster was not capable of consenting to the horrors of what was being . done to her. Guidelines in the Sexual Offences Act . 2003 suggest sentencing for rape of a child under 13 should be . between 10 and 13 years in prison. The Crown Prosecution Service is now considering an appeal against the 'unduly lenient' sentences. The rape took place in a block of flats in Luton in July last year . Channer and Monteiro had sex with the girl in July last year in a block of flats in Luton Bedfordshire. She . was there with a group of teenagers and Channer had sex with her on a . landing at the flats while Monteiro had oral sex with her. Judge . Farrell said: 'Despite her age it is accepted that she was a willing . participant, but the law is there to protect young girls from this type . of behaviour and to protect them from themselves. 'The girl had clearly been subjected to systematic sexual exploitation and you willingly used her for your own sexual gratification. 'It is aggravated by the fact that the event was being videoed.' He added that there was evidence the footage had been circulated as it was found on one of the defendant's phones. Both Channer and Monteiro pleaded guilty to a single charge of rape and will have to sign the sex offenders' register for life. Judge Farrell said there were exceptional features to the case which led him to reduce the sentences to 40 months. The . two men had maintained they believed the girl was at least 14, and, . after viewing evidence, the judge agreed she appeared that age. He . said the prosecution accepted that the girl had not objected to what . was happening, and the men had pleaded guilty at the earliest stage and . did not have previous convictions for sexual offences. Miss Wood continued: 'There are no excuses for these two young men who freely admit that they thought she was 14 years old. Fourteen is still below the age of consent and their actions would still have constituted rape, had she been 14. 'For a Judge to state that ""Despite her age it is accepted she was a willing participant"" is a damning reflection on how far the judiciary still has to go to even start to understand the whole issue of rape – consent and criminality. We are reliably advised that Judges have to obtain a ""Rape ticket"" to sit on rape cases but as yet we have no idea what constitutes such training – whatever it is – it isn’t working. 'This young girl has been raped by the two named perpetrators and has now been badly let down by the very system set up to protect her. What message does this send out to potential perpetrators when you can rape a child, plead guilty and get a sentence which is less than you might expect to get for a burglary or car crimes? 'Does this mean that destroying a child’s innocence has so little importance in today’s world – and does it mean that rape is such a trivial matter that it can so easily be brushed aside? 'The child will have received a life sentence for what has been done to her – and in less than two years her attackers will be free. 'Where is the deterrent and where is the incentive for anyone to report rape? We need to smarten up and Judges NEED to be accountable for their decisions.' Peter Bradley, Deputy Director at Kidscape, said: 'Even though there were ""exceptional features""  the sentencing of these two men is far too lenient and gives out the wrong message to potential other offenders. 'The girl may have looked 14 but even so this would also have been a serious crime. 'It is unlikely the two men will have to serve their full sentence - hopefully the time they spend in prison will allow them to follow a suitable programme ensuring they are safe for release in the next few years.'","Judge even agrees with defendants that girl 'looked 14'

"With the hashtag #HereWeGo, Monica Lewinsky joined the Twitter community Monday. The infamous former White House intern sent out her first tweet into the ether just after 9am Eastern time, drawing more than 1,400 followers in the first 40 minutes.

Inaugural tweet: Monica Lewinsky joined Twitter Monday, sending out the hashtag 'HereWeGo' as her first-ever message . She's back! Lewinsky was welcomed to Twitter by Vanity Fair, which hired her as a contributor this summer . Quirky: Lewinsky, 41, described herself as a social activist and a knitter of things without sleeves . Sequel: For her second tweet, Lewinsky shared her excitement about taking part in Forbes Magazine's Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia . Lewinsky described herself in her bio as a 'social activist. public speaker. contributor to vanity fair' and 'knitter of things without sleeves.' Speaking out: Lewinsky pictured Monday delivering a speech about cyber-bullying at the Forbes conference . Her account was quickly verified by Twitter, confirming that the user was indeed THAT Ms Lewinsky. After firing off the hashtag 'HereWeGo' as her first tweet, Lewinsky quickly got the ball rolling, writing less than an hour later: 'excited (and nervous) to speak to #Under30Summit.' Lewinsky was referring to a three-day conference hosted by Forbes Magazine, which opened  in Philadelphia Sunday. According to the description of the event on Forbes' website, the summit brings together more than 1,000 members of Forbes '30 Under 30' list of 'business leaders and mentors'. 'Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age,' Forbes explained in a statement. Besides Ms Lewisnky, who spoke this morning about the 'scourge of harassment in the digital age,' speakers at the summit will include this year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai, musician Questlove and model-turned-philanthropist Petra Nemcova. As of 17.00pm following her well-received speech in Philadelphia, Ms Lewinsky's Twitter account had 32,000 followers, and counting. Vanity Fair, which hired Lewinsky as a contributor this summer, sent out a welcome tweet to the fledgling magazine writer Monday morning. Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment. After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.' 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president  was leaked to the press in 1998 . 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black. She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence.","Lewinsky, 41, tweeted #HereWeGo from her brand-new Twitter account just after 9am Eastern time .

"Eden Hazard is having his best ever start to a season - but the Chelsea playmaker still doesn't even rank himself among the top five players in the world. The 23-year-old has starred in Chelsea's impressive opening to the new Premier League campaign, and was chosen as man of the match in their recent London derby against Arsenal. But Hazard is not completely happy - and says he needs to be decisive in every game to match the players he ranks as the top five in the world. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hazard leave Thibaut Courtois stranded with cheeky chip . Eden Hazard is enjoying his best ever start to a season with Chelsea - who are top of the Premier League .

'I'm not a top-five player yet,' said Hazard. 'Maybe I'm close to it, but I still have to work on some aspects. You can only be part of that group if you are decisive in the top games. I (have started) doing that, like I did against Manchester City and Arsenal. 'Who are better than me? The two extra-terrestrials, (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Lionel) Messi, (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic, (Franck) Ribery and (Arjen) Robben. They make the difference almost every game.' After powering Chelsea's title campaign for much of last season, Hazard ended up taking the brunt of criticism from manager Jose Mourinho for his supposed laziness in midfield, something that Mourinho blamed for the club's Champions League semi-final exit to Atletico Madrid. Hazard ranks Cristiano Ronaldo as one of two 'extra-terrestrials' - making him one of the world's best . And Lionel Messi was also put into that category by Hazard for his work with Barcelona and Argentina . But Hazard says all that is behind the pair with Chelsea's star man and manager both happy with a start that has put them five points clear at the top of the Premier League after just seven games. 'Maybe this has been the best start in my career so far, although it isn't reflected in the stats,' he added in an interview with The Telegraph. 'I have played only one bad game - against Aston Villa. I've taken a good rest during my holiday, I had a short, but good pre-season and I feel really well. 'Jose Mourinho and I get along well. I've lots of respect for him. He gives me a lot of confidence. After a bad game he dares to say, ""We have played with 10 today"", but that's it. At moments like that he leaves me alone.' On Saturday Hazard and Chelsea travel to Crystal Palace - a side that the Belgian failed to break down last season as the Blues lost 1-0 at Selhurst Park courtesy of a John Terry own goal. Hazard will hope to be 'decisive' at the other end of the pitch to keep the pack chasing at the top of the league.

"A father built a prosthetic hand for his 12-year-old son using a 3-D printer. Paul McCarthy, from Marblehead Massachusetts, made the inexpensive yet functional prosthetic hand for his son Leon, who was born without fingers on one of his hands. The family had been told when Leon was very young that he needed to get used to using his hand without prosthetics and try to acquire a full range of abilities and motion, but a doctor recently said they should start looking at prosthetic options. Innovative: A father built a prosthetic hand for his 12-year-old son using a 3-D printer . Mr McCarthy began searching for a way to help his son whose hand did not grow due to the restricted blood flow in the womb. He came across Robohand which had a video posted online with instructions on how to use a 3-D printer to make a prosthetic hand, reported CBS News. The design relies on wrist movement - the downward motion creates cable tension which closes the fingers while a move upwards closes them. Mr McCarthy borrowed a friend's 3-D printer, but it a month to figure out how to string, screw and bolt together what him and his son describe as the 'Frankenstein' version.

The youngster admitted at first he thought that the idea was 'crazy' but once it was assembled he said the hand was 'awesome.' Leon's new hand gives him the ability to carry out tasks such as picking up a water bottle and a pencil. 'This thing costs us $5-$10, it was nothing,' said Mr McCarthy.

The cost allows the pair to experiment with different designs and change the prosthetic as Leon grows. Matthew Garibaldi, director of orthotics and prosthetics in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, says that making sure a prosthetic device fits is essential for it to work well, reports NPR. He said because there are not many children with upper-extremity amputations there are limited options for pediatric prosthetics and that is why a device like Robohand is so appealing. 'Its primary function is to decrease manufacturing costs and increase productivity. The timeliness of this technology couldn't be better,' Mr Garibaldi said.","Paul McCarthy made the inexpensive prosthetic hand for his son Leon .

"An army dog which died of a broken heart hours after his handler was shot dead has been awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Theo, a springer spaniel cross, received the PDSA Dickin Medal for life-saving bravery in Afghanistan. The 22-month-old dog suffered a fatal seizure when his handler, Lance Corporal Liam Tasker, 26, was shot dead by the Taliban in March 2011. Scroll down for video . Heroes: Lance Corporal Liam Tasker and his springer spaniel Theo, who died just a few hours after his handler . The pair had uncovered 14 bombs and hoards of weapons in five months in Helmand Province – more than any other dog and handler in the conflict. L/Cpl Tasker’s family were at Wellington Barracks, in central London, yesterday for the ceremony.His mother Jane Duffy, 53, said her family were ‘ecstatic’. She said: ‘We are absolutely delighted and so very, very proud. It means so much because Liam put Theo forward for the medal when he was in Afghanistan because he was so good. ‘He said that Theo used to get excited when they got out the Vallon [bomb-detecting equipment] and switched it on because it meant he was going out. Liam got his Mention in Dispatches [the oldest recognition of gallantry in the Armed Forces], so it’s lovely that Theo is getting his Dickin Medal and being recognised for his bravery as well.’ Mrs Duffy, of Tayport, Fife, added: ‘I strongly believe that Theo died of a broken heart. I take comfort in that.’ Her son served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps’s 104 Military Working Dog Squadron. He was killed taking part in a mission in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand.

"Woolwich suspect Michael Adebowale became radicalised after trying to escape gangland ‘trouble’, it was claimed yesterday. London-born Adebowale was told to ‘disappear’ after he was caught up with a local gang known as the Woolwich Boys, and underwent a dramatic change of personality. Once a fun-loving schoolboy who was described as ‘always smiling’ and chatted to neighbours about Jamie Oliver recipes, he began dressing in traditional Islamic dress and preaching a radical message of hate. Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death . Shock: A friend of Adebowale, 22, who has known him from the age of 11, said today that he converted to Islam when he was aged around 19 . Adebowale gave up alcohol and began distributing radical leaflets near his mother’s home in Greenwich, south-east London. Neighbours said his Nigerian-born mother, Juliet Obasuyi, was a probation officer and a ‘hard-working’ Christian woman who raised Adebowale alone after separating from his father. Police raided her flat and a property linked to Adebowale’s father, Adeniyi Adebowale, in Holloway, North London. Plain-clothes officers were seen carrying six plastic bags full of video cassettes and audio tapes from the Holloway flat. The videos appeared to be labelled as football matches but one line of inquiry for police is likely to be whether Adebowale was interested in the type of jihadi videos watched by the July 2005 London bombers. The four bombers were linked to an extreme bookshop in Leeds which distributed videos of terrorist acts, exhorting followers to emulate them. Probe: Police leave the block of flats that Michael Adebowale is believed to have lived in holding envelopes with evidence . Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale was born to Nigerian parents in Denmark Hill, South London, in May 1991. His father was then a student at Rutherford College in Canterbury, Kent, and the couple were said to have separated soon after the birth. Adebowale attended Kidbrooke School in Greenwich, where former pupils said he was known as Toby or Tobi, an abbreviation of his second name Oluwatobi. Luqman Ciise said on Twitter: ‘I knew him personally, he was normal, smiling all the time. His name was Toby. Still can’t believe this . . . How did he get radicalised?’ Adebowale was said to have converted to Islam at 19, while studying at Greenwich University, where he met the other Woolwich suspect, Michael Adebolajo. Family friend Madeleine Edwards, 49, said Adebowale had been in ‘some serious gangland trouble’ in 2010 and that his mother had told her he ‘had to disappear for a while’. She said Adebowale’s father was a ‘typical African gentleman’ but his mother had struggled to control her wayward son. Detectives guard the fourth floor flat, which neighbours said they often heard Muslim songs from and confirm that they saw both the suspects there . Adebowale was said to have left the Greenwich area for a year and returned about eight months ago, wearing traditional Islamic garb and a white skull cap, typically worn by Muslim men who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Michael would always say hello and play with my children, but in the last year he stopped. He would just ignore us when we saw him at the lift. Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier . ‘He used to talk to me very enthusiastically about cooking and his recipes. He loved Jamie Oliver and had his books. ‘But more recently, he would just put . his head down when he saw me. Even if I tried to talk to him he was . very dismissive. I thought it was weird. ‘It was odd as his mother was a devout Christian. And it seemed like such a sudden change.’ In recent months Adebowale had begun . seeing a woman who had converted to Islam two years ago and wore a . headscarf to cover her hair. Armed police raided her flat, also in Greenwich, and led away two women and a 15-year-old boy, who witnesses said was handcuffed. Two toddlers and a baby were also said to have been taken from the property. Neighbours described hearing regular prayers and chanting from the flat. A friend who has known Adebowale since he was 11 spoke of his shock at seeing the video of the Woolwich atrocity. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That wasn’t the same person. ‘He wasn’t someone monstrous, that was not the same person. ‘He converted to Islam, preaching Islam, preaching peace. Not preaching anything bad or anything negative. Just literally the ways of Islam. ‘I would see him going to mosque and coming back from mosque. ‘He was completely normal . . . He was one of us at school. Nothing evil about him at all.’ Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the killing . Angels of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, and her mother Amanda (right) talk to Adebolajo while Ingrid Loyau-Kennett (left) talks to the Adebowale as Lee Rigby lies dead in the road . Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Lee Rigby in this car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers. The streak of blood in front of the car shows how they dragged his body into the street . A father of two yesterday claimed the Woolwich fanatics were ‘looking for their chance to kill’ in the weeks before the death of Drummer Lee Rigby. Paul Ramsamy, 46, said Michael Adebowale, 22, and Michael Adebolajo, 28, confronted him after mistaking him for a soldier because of his military-style clothing. He claimed the pair stared at his camouflage trousers and army boots and followed him into an estate in Greenwich, south-east London, where he and Adebowale both live. Mr Ramsamy, who has been married to his wife Francesse, 45, for 25 years, said: ‘I was coming home in the evening when I saw the two men come quickly towards me. ‘The men looked at my clothes and walked close behind me. They watched me. I could see their eyes on my shoes and they said something to each other that I didn’t understand. ‘I thought they were trying to come into the building but they didn’t walk in behind me. They looked very serious. I felt very scared.’ Mr Ramsamy, who has been a neighbour of Adebowale for four months, said he now feels lucky to be alive after seeing the two men in television reports as the attackers who butchered Drummer Rigby on Woolwich’s John Wilson Street on Wednesday. Horror: A large crowd of people father near the scene where the soldier was killed on Wednesday as police and ambulance services arrive . He said he was shocked to recognise them as the same men who had pursued him. ‘Now I realise that they were looking for their chance to kill before Wednesday,’ he said. ‘If  I was a soldier, I would have been dead. ‘It could have happened to me because they could have made a mistake and thought I was a soldier, but they realised I wasn’t. I’m very lucky.’ He added: ‘Now before I wear military clothes I have to think twice – there could be more extremist men like them.’ Mr Ramsamy, who moved from Mauritius to the UK in 2003, said his family – including daughters Anna, 19, and Curtis, 15 – consider themselves British and feel angry at the hatred and venom of Adebolajo and Adebowale. He said the two men should be imprisoned for life and their families should be deported. ‘I think they are very dangerous. People can’t kill people like Mr Rigby – especially people who work for society and dedicate their life to making this country a safer place. ‘Those kinds of people should go on trial and go to prison  for life. We have to send their families back to their  own countries.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Adebowale, 22, named as other suspect in murder of Lee Rigby .

"It is a debate that has raged since Titanic became one of the most successful films of all time: Did Rose leave Jack to die by not letting him up on the makeshift lifeboat as they floated in the ocean? And now a U.S. television show has carried out a . series of tests that show Leonardo DiCaprio's character could have survived the disaster . had he lifted himself onto the raft from which Rose, played by Kate Winslet, was plucked. The Discovery Channel's Mythbusters recreated the treacherous conditions after the Titanic sank in 1912 and, through hypothermia tests, discovered Jack would have survived the freezing conditions if he had climbed out. Scroll down for videos . Doomed: Jack, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, slips into the icy Atlantic waters as lover Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet, clings on to a makeshift raft in the climax to blockbuster Titanic film . Going down: The closing scene from Titanic has now been reconstructed by U.S. show Mythbusters to see if it really would have ended in tragedy for character Jack in the film . As fans of the 1997 blockbuster will remember, Jack remains in the freezing water while Rose lies on top of a floating piece of the wreckage as he does not want to topple it. In the dramatic climax to the Oscar-winning epic, Jack dies from hypothermia while Rose is rescued. Titanic director James Cameron told Mythbusters he believed the wooden life raft would not have supported both Jack and Rose. But the team found that if Rose had taken off her lifejacket and put it under the raft it would have given . them enough buoyancy to keep both of them afloat. Reconstruction: Mythbusters, left, replicate the events from the blockbuster film Titanic, right . Happier ending?: The Mythbusters set out to see if Jack, played by Leonardo Di Caprio need not have sacrificed himself to save Kate Winslet's character, Rose . Discovery: The Mythbusters found that both Winslet and Di Caprio's characters could have fitted on the makeshift raft and survived the sinking . Hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman then . carried out a hypothermia test to see what would happen if Di Caprio's . character had indeed climbed out of the water and onto the wooden door. A . dummy with gelatin flesh and a water-heated copper cardiovascular . system that was rigged to monitor body temperature was used to simulate . Di Caprio’s character. The dummy’s body temp was set at 98.6° and  dressed in wet clothes. It was then set hovering above the freezing water in 29° F air as if he were lying on the wooden raft. The show found that as long as he was rescued before his body temperature dropped below 82° F, he could be revived. After an hour on the raft they found the dummy’s core body temp was 82.5° F meaning Jack would have lived had he got out of the water. Conclusions: Mythbusters Jamie Hyneman, left, and Adam Savage, centre, reveal their findings to Titanic director James Cameron, right, . Romantic: Leonardo DiCaprio pictured as Jack Dawson, with Kate Winslet is Rose DeWitt Bukater, in a scene from the film written and directed by James Cameron . In the film Rose was one of the last . to be rescued. Historical documents show that Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, . who was depicted rescuing Rose,looked for survivors 45 minutes. In . a separate test the 'Mythbusters' team found that had Jack remained in . the water for over an hour he would have died from hypothermia.

"According to ancient texts, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon boasted elaborate terraces, magnificent water features and floating plants. The decadent grounds are reputed to have been built in the Babylon province of Iraq - yet for centuries no-one has been able to find any physical evidence they existed. However, according to one expert, closer analysis of these texts - along with clues on display at the British Museum - suggest that this may be because archaeologists have been searching in the wrong place. For centuries, historians believed the Hanging Gardens were built in Babylon, Iraq by Emperor Nebuchadnezzar. Closer analysis of these ancient texts have led researchers to believe it was actually built 350 miles away in the city of Nineveh, pictured, by Assyrian King Sennacherib . According to Dr Stephanie Dalley from Oxford University, the gardens are actually buried in the ancient city of Nineveh, near modern-day Mosul, 350 miles away in northern Iraq. Dr Dalley from the university’s Oriental Institute has spent the past 20 years researching the location of the gardens, referred to by some as a myth due to the lack of physical evidence. They were believed to have been built around 600 BC, although this date was taken from ancient texts written hundreds of years after they were said to have been created. One text specifically claimed the gardens were built by Babylonian Emperor Nebuchadnezzar in the Babylon province of Iraq for his wife Amyitis. Yet there was no mention of them in any text written by the Emperor or his wife. This led Dr Dalley to study these texts . more closely and during her research she discovered a prism at the British . Museum in London covered in cuneiform writing. For centuries, the Hanging Gardens of . Babylon were thought to have been built in the ancient Iraqi city of . Babylon, because of the name. This location led people to believe it was built by the Emperor Nebuchadnezzar who lived around 600 BC. Since this time, archaeologists and . historians have scoured the location of the ancient city but have been . unable to find any physical evidence they existed - leading some to . believe the gardens are a myth. It is one of the Seven Ancient Wonders . of the World and was called the Hanging Gardens because they were . supposedly built high above the ground on split-level stone terraces. Some texts referred to the plants in . the gardens as ‘floating’ but they were believed, instead, to have hung . from these different terraces, giving them the appearance of being . suspended in mid-air. A Greek historian named Diordorus Siculus described the gardens as being 400ft wide by 400ft long, with walls as high as 80ft. Due to this height, water was said to . have been transported from a lake at the bottom using a similar . principle as Archimedes’ screw – a pump that scoops up water in a spiral . tube and carries it to the top. It was said to have been invented by . Archimedes in the 3rd Century BC yet if a similar system was used in the . gardens, this would predate it by around 350 years. Given the size, historians have estimated the gardens would have used 8,200 gallons of water a day to water the plants. Some historians and archaeologists . believe that the gardens were destroyed by war and erosion, while others . believe an earthquake destroyed them. Cuneiform is an ancient language dating back to the Babylonian era, that was also used by the Assyrian empires. The prism contains details of a king called Sennacherib who was leader of the Assyrian empire and lived a century before Nebuchadnezzar. The writing included references to a palace built near the Assyrian capital of Nineveh as well as a garden he called ‘wonder for all people.’ Sennacherib’s grandson Assurbanipal was also said to have drawn an image of the garden on a panel in this palace. As one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the gardens (illustration pictured) were called 'hanging' because they were built high above the ground on split-level stone terraces. Ancient texts referred to the plants in the gardens as 'floating' but they were believed, instead, to have hung from these different terraces . The gardens were believed to have been built in Babylon because of its name. However, the Assyrian capital of Nineveh was known as New Babylon, and this may have been where the confusion arose. Ancient texts written by Assyrian leader Sennacherib made reference to a 'wonder' garden . During a Channel 4 documentary called Finding Babylon’s Hanging Garden, Dr Dalley was able to combine ancient maps with modern-day versions to locate what she believes to be the ruins of the palace. Nearby she found a large mound of dirt sloping to a stretch of greenery which she claims is the ‘best place’ for the ancient site. She believes her claims are substantiated by a bas-relief, taken from Nineveh, that detailed the location of the palace alongside a garden with trees hanging from terraces. Furthermore, Dr Dalley claimed in the documentary that Nineveh was also known as New Babylon and added this may be where the confusion came from. A Greek historian named Diordorus Siculus described the gardens as being 400ft wide by 400ft long, with walls as high as 80ft.

Some historians and archaeologists . believe the gardens were destroyed by war and erosion, while others . believe an earthquake destroyed them. Dr Dalley believes more research will need to be carried out before archaeologists can confirm the location fo the gardens. She said: 'More research is now required at the site, but sadly I don’t think that will be possible in my lifetime. 'My conviction that the gardens were in Ninevah remains unshaken.' The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is a list of 'must-see' sights compiled for ancient Greek travellers in the eastern Mediterranean. The list was compiled in the 3rd Century BC and was based on ancient texts and accounts of stunning structures across the region. The Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder from this list that still stands, while all of the others are thought to have been destroyed by earthquakes. Great . Pyramid of Giza: Built between 2584 and 2561 BC it is located in the Giza Necropolis, Egypt. Egyptologists claim the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu.

Temple of Artemis at Ephesus: Built c. 550 BC near Selçuk in the Izmir Province of Turkey, it was a Greek temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis. Statue . of Zeus at Olympia: The temple was said to have been built between 466 and 456 BC while the statue itself was believed to have been added in 435 BC.

"A giant 25ft snake was beaten to death by Mexican villagers - who feared the creature was so big it could have swallowed a child. Frightened residents also cut the head off the huge animal after it was spotted lying alongside a railway track. Rail passengers raised the alarm after they saw the snake from their train as it pulled into the village of Benito Juarez, in a remote part of the southeast Mexican state of Tabasco. The huge 25ft snake killed by Mexican villagers who feared the creature was so big it could have swallowed a child . Villagers, armed with sticks and one carrying a machete, ran back along the tracks where they found it attempting to slither away into the undergrowth. Conservationist have criticised the killing and say those responsible could face charges. But the villagers were unrepentant, saying they had a right to protect their livestock and themselves from the huge creature. Local Nicandro Aguilar said: ‘I have never seen a snake that big, and it was clear that it was a danger to people as well is wild stock. ‘It could just as easily have swallowed down a child as a lamb or a calf. It was massive.’ The snake was found in the village of Benito Juarez in the southeast of Mexico . Others blamed the snake, which had apparently been living in a cave nearby, for the disappearance of several young animals in the area. Initially it was thought eagles were to blame. The killing of the snake was only discovered by chance after villagers had laid it on the side of the bridge and were planning to remove the skin. A tourist spotted the dead reptile and decided to take a picture.","Villagers attacked the 25ft snake with sticks before cutting off its head .

"Southampton head coach Ronald Koeman has managed some of Europe's biggest clubs but never before has he had a group of players so dedicated that they asked him to train on their day off. The campaign may still be in its infancy but those predicting a season of woe at St Mary's could not be further off the mark judging by early displays. Saints enter this weekend's match with QPR second in the Barclays Premier League and looking for a sixth successive win in all competitions. Ronald Koeman admits he has never experienced players turning down the offer of a day off . Nathanial Clyne (R) scores a screamer to give Saints a 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the Capital One Cup . The latest victory saw them return from Arsenal on Tuesday as 2-1 victors in the Capital One Cup - a performance and result that saw Koeman give his players Wednesday off. There is nothing unusual about that, although the fact his squad instead asked to come to training is something he has not experienced in any of his previous managerial roles at clubs like Ajax, Benfica and Valencia. 'The players showed a great ambition because we planned last Wednesday as a day off after the Tuesday and Jose Fonte said to me: 'Boss, we would like to come to train tomorrow',' he said. 'I said 'But you have a day off - I've planned a lot of things with my wife!' But we changed it and we had a recovering session. 'I never had that - a team, a squad say 'no day off' and that means a lot for me, that means a lot about the ambition of the players. Defender Jose Fonte (C) asked his manager if players could train the day after the Arsenal game . 'We spoke to each other and said: 'Okay, if you win against Queens Park then you get that day off for next week', and we hope to win on Saturday.' Such attitude and togetherness has impressed Koeman, who himself was one of the world's best players in his day. The former defender was key to Barcelona's European Cup triumph in 1992 and knows reaching that competition with Saints is beyond them this term, despite their fine start. 'It isn't realistic' he said of a top-four finish. 'I remember one of the questions in the last week of starting the season and that question was totally different and that's football. 'But you can't say anything about that because we've played only five games in the Premier League and at the end of the season are 38. 'We know it's a long season, it's a tough season. Graziano Pelle celebrates after scoring against Newcastle during Saints' impressive start to the season . 'Okay, we know we have a very good start of the season, with all the changes we make from the beginning and, of course, after the win of last Tuesday the expectations of the fans, of the press is much higher than it was before the first game. 'But it will be more difficult and we have to realise that and to keep going with what we did until today.' Few expect Southampton to come off the rails against a QPR side whose away league matches this season have both ended in 4-0 defeats. A similar result would be particularly sweet for many Saints fans given the west Londoners are managed by Harry Redknapp. Harry Redknapp was in charge of Southampton when they were relegated in 2005 . Redknapp (R) will face his former club when Southampton meet QPR in their next Premier League match . In 2005, the 67-year-old was in charge as Saints dropped out of the top-flight for the first time in 27 years before rejoining bitter rivals Portsmouth just months later - something Koeman was completely unaware of. 'He is not [a popular figure]? Why? I didn't know that,' he said. 'What I see now in the Premier League, even in the away games, is a lot of respect of the crowd and that's much different than we have in Holland. 'I think Harry Redknapp is a name, it's a successful manager and a lot of experience, but I'm not the person to look to the history of the managers and the players. 'In my opinion, he's a manager who I respect and I think everybody has to respect.'","Ronald Koeman admits being impressed by Southampton stars' attitude .

"A huge blast near a busy Damascus market and Syria's highest court today wounded at least three people and sent clouds of black smoke into the sky. The explosion came as tensions threatened to spread across the region with neighbouring Turkey deploying anti-aircraft guns and other weapons alongside its border with Syria - nearly a week after Syrian forces shot a Turkish military plane out of the sky. Major world powers will meet on Saturday in Geneva for talks on Syria, but few observers expect a major breakthrough. Syria has the protection or Russia, a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, and has so far been impervious to international pressure. Bomb: A huge blast near a busy Damascus market and Syria's highest court today wounded at least three people and sent clouds of black smoke into the sky . Central: The blast happened at 1pm local time near the capital's famous Hamidiyeh Market, an area crowded with families stocking up on food and other supplies for the weekend, which begins on Friday in Syria .

He . said: 'We are not supporting and will not support any external . meddling. External players must not dictate... to Syrians, but, first of . all, must commit to influencing all the sides in Syria to stop the . violence.' It was not clear who was behind today's blast in Damascus. Much of the violence that has gripped Syria since the uprising began has been sanctioned by the government to crush dissent. But . rebel fighters are launching increasingly deadly attacks on regime . targets, and several massive suicide attacks this year suggest Al-Qaeda . or other extremists are joining the fray. Syria's state-run TV said the explosion was in the car park of the Palace of Justice, a compound that houses several courts.

Turkey says the jet had unintentionally strayed into Syria's air space and was inside international airspace when it was brought down over the Mediterranean by Syria. The search for two missing pilots continued in Syrian waters but hopes for their survival are slim, Turkish authorities said. Research teams have found some pieces of the plane as well as equipment belonging to the pilots. A small convoy of military trucks towing anti-aircraft guns entered a military outpost in the border village of Guvecci, which faces a Syrian military outpost, according to TRT television footage. Several anti-aircraft guns also have been deployed elsewhere alongside the border. Some trucks were seen carrying self-propelled multiple rocket launchers, the footage showed. Ties between Turkey and Syria have not been so low since the late 1990s, when the two countries almost went to war. Tensions ran high in the 1980s and 1990s as Turkey developed military ties with Israel and Syria sheltered Turkish Kurd guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan. Now, Turkey is hosting civilian opposition groups as well as hundreds of army defectors who are affiliated with the rebel Free Syrian Army. Turkish President Abdullah Gul was holding a National Security Council meeting on Thursday, TRT said. The meeting, attended by Cabinet members and the military's top brass, is expected to focus on tensions with Syria.","Blast near Syria's highest court wounds at least three and sends clouds of black smoke into the sky .

"A devoted dad who has snapped a picture of his son nearly every day since he was born has turned them into a touching film charting his life - from bouncing baby boy to blowing out the candles on his 21st birthday cake. Ian McLeod's video clip - which speeds through pictures of his son Cory asleep, laughing and pulling faces - has now become an internet sensation after the proud father posted his labour of love on YouTube. The six-and-a-half minute time-lapse film, which has been watched over 600,000 times online, is believed to be the first of its kind. Scroll down for video . Life's journey: Mr McLeod's photo record captures Cory as a newborn, left, on his 21st birthday, right, and almost every day in between . Mr McLeod, 56, said his epic project, entitled '21 Years', had started as a 'daft idea' he expected he would stick to for a year or two, but ended with him snapping an incredible 7,500 photographs that fill over 70 albums and chart almost every day of Cory's life so far. 'It was a daft idea really. One I came up with after a drink or two, maybe,' said Mr McLeod, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire. 'I was thinking I could do it for two years at most. 'But then you get to the point where you wonder if you'll regret it if you stop. You brush your teeth twice a day, what's hard about a click?' This boy's life: Ian McLeod's film shows his son Cory as a toddler on Halloween, left, and smiling for the camera in the garden, right . Growing boy: Dad Ian gave Cory instructions to take his own picture when he was away on school trips or holidays to make sure the record was as complete as possible . Mr McLeod duly stuck to his routine of taking his son's picture almost every day for more than two decades - although minor mishaps along the way mean there are a couple of gaps in his record of Cory growing up. A whole month's worth of pictures were lost at one point when the film in his camera wasn't winding, and on another occasion it was stolen while the family were on holiday in Chile. 'I used to find it awkward, I didn't realise the value of it' Cory McLeod . At other times, the clock slipped past midnight before Mr McLeod realised he hadn't taken a picture, but Cory said his dad never succumbed to the temptation of substituting a photo from another day. 'He's never cheated,' he said. 'Even at five minutes past, he wouldn't take it.' Mr McLeod, who said he panicked the first time a day was missed, has slotted sketches of his son into his time-lapse film to make up the gaps. Persistent Mr McLeod followed Cory to friends' houses and armed his son with a camera of his own for school trips and holidays to make sure the photo record was as complete as possible. When the 21-year-old spent three months travelling around South America with friends last year, his dad made sure he didn't miss a single day. 'My dad's had to drive to a friend's house before,' Cory said. 'I got a bit of stick for that. I used to find it awkward, I didn’t realise the value of it. 'It was only when I got to 16 or 17 that I started to appreciate it, and realise what it could be,' he said. School days: Cory says he isn't fazed by his father's epic project, which takes in pictures of him in school uniform, left, and pulling faces for the camera, right . Growing up: Cory, now 21, is seen with friends as a teenager, left, and as a student at Leeds Metropolitan University, right, where he is studying film and television production . The film starts with the first picture of Cory as a newborn at Harrogate General Hospital, and documents school days, childhood football matches, new jobs and trips to Leeds Festival and Macchu Piccu in Peru. But the majority of the pictures were taken at home, typical photos of a cherished son; eating an ice-cream, enjoying a family Christmas, or suffering with a hangover. 'There are lots I look back at now and think I wish I hadn’t pulled that face,' said the Liverpool FC fan. Mr McLeod said he had been left stunned by the overwhelming response to the results of his 'chaotic' project. 'We just didn’t know,' he said. 'It was like we were unleashing something unreal. I had been a bit wary, my hand hovered over the upload button. But we did it. It was like opening Pandora’s Box. 'When I started this, there was no YouTube,' added Mr McLeod, who works at a picture framers and also as a care assistant with disabled adults. 'All I had in mind was a video. That was as far as the idea went.' Labour of love: Ian McLeod, seen left with Cory, has now handed over the project to his son, who has left home to study film and television production at Leeds Metropolitan University . Ian spent three months scanning the pictures one at a time last year. In the end there were more than 7,500 images, in 71 albums. 'It’s never been straightforward. We weren’t organised, it’s always been chaotic,' he said. In the two weeks it has been online, the video has had more than 610,000 hits. Bizarrely, 300,000 of these were in Japan in just one day last week, and Cory has seen his Twitter followers increase dramatically after a particularly enthusiastic response from female viewers of the video. 'I'm not fazed by it, it's like I'm on The Truman Show,' he said. 'Someone commented that I should show my face more, but then someone else pointed out that it shows a story. You can’t say I’ve got a boring life.'The project is still ongoing, but is in Cory’s hands now as he is living with friends while studying film and television production at Leeds Metropolitan University. 'When do you stop?' he asked. 'I don’t think I can. We’ve come this far, we may as well carry on.'

"A rare white dingo pup is the proud new addition to Fraser Coast Wildlife Sanctuary's family as of Friday. Curator Ray Revill - also dubbed the animal whisperer in his town - says this is a 'pretty spectacular' occasion, considering it's the first time they've taken in a white dingo since the sanctuary was established nine years ago. 'We're possibly the only wildlife centre in Queensland with a white dingo,' he said. Fraser Coast Wildlife Sanctuary's curator Ray Revill said they may be the only Queensland wildlife centre with a white dingo. He is pictured with six-week-old Spirit . Spirit was handed over to Fraser Coast Wildlife Sanctuary in Maryborough - north of Brisbane - on Friday . This follows the tragic loss of one of the five dingoes at the sanctuary in Maryborough - north of Brisbane. Mr Revill is still grieving the death of 15-year-old Karla, who died of old age seven weeks ago. 'Karla and I were thick as thieves so I took it pretty hard when she passed,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I still have her ashes beside my bed and I have a little urn that I keep in my pocket so she's with me all the time. 'Call me passionate or crazy - I don't care.' Last year Mr Revill paid tribute to their friendship and had a portrait of Karla tattooed on his right leg. Mr Revill paid tribute to his friendship with 15-year-old Karla, who died recently of old age, and had a portrait of her tattooed on his right leg . 'When she died I got ""RIP. Spirit Run Free"" tattooed around her,' he said. Although no other animal could ever replace Karla, it appears the Mr Revill and six-week-old Spirit have already created a strong bond. 'She came straight over to me and crawled onto my lap when I first walked in the door,' he said. 'So she definitely chose me.' Despite his heartbreak over Karla, he can't help but feel 'over the moon' when he sees little Spirit. 'Yesterday she gave a little puppy howl which made me hysterical and brought a little tear to my eye,' he said. The 57-year-old, who's been caring for animals since the age of five, is keeping a close eye on playful Spirit at his home - the sanctuary. 'You couldn't ask for a better backyard,' he said. The breeder, Simon Stretton, said Spirit comes from a litter of four white pups. 'That's rare in itself,' he said. He said 80 per cent of dingoes are ginger, 18 per cent are black and tanned and the remaining 2 per cent are white. Spirit's grandmother Opal is also white but her mother Honey is ginger. The white pup was named after a dingo that died on Fraser Island on Queensland's south coast. Mr Revill hopes to continue raise dingoes and use them as an educational tool to end the stigma surrounding the canines. Spirit (left) is pictured with her sister Zarah (right), their mother Honey and dingo breeder Simon Stretton . Queensland's passionate dingo breeder Simon Stretton says there are some common misconceptions surrounding the Canis lupus. He offered the following facts on the dingo: .","Six-week-old Spirit was handed over to Fraser Coast Wildlife Sanctuary in Maryborough, north of Brisbane, on Friday .

"A mugshot of Carl Peterson, the 48-year-old level 3 sex offender who spoke on Thursday . Carl Peterson, a level 3 sex offender, stood up before a crowd of 100 people at Belmont High School on Thursday and stated, ‘ My name is Carl Peterson. I'm the level 3 sex offender all of you have been talking about’ The 48-year-old moved to Bernard Road in Belmont,Ma. In late July and resides with his wife and his 14-year-old daughter. Peterson was jailed 12 years ago for the rape against his 14-year-old niece. The Belmont Patch gave a detailed report of the meeting on Thursday. The meeting organized by the Belmont Police Department to inform the public about the sexual offenders registry and safety concerns, became a heated discussion between Peterson and the crowd of worried residents. ‘It seems as though the big reason why we are here tonight is me,’ said Peterson who previously resided in Lexington, Ma. ‘The problem is all you know, all you get to know about my problem is what you read ... which says I'm the most dangerous and the most likely to re-offend of all sex offenders. It also says my offense was the rape against a child,’ said Peterson who was surrounded by law enforcement. A woman cried, ‘I don’t want to hear this.' Another exclaimed,  ‘just go.’ One resident said,'You were charged with rape.' Despite the crowd’s concerns, one community member stated, ‘Whoever is uncomfortable, we respect that. But we are being told that we need to be knowledgeable to protect our children.’ She said it was important to listen to what Peterson had to say. 'One of the scariest things while spending time in prison was wondering ... that it will not happen again,"" said Peterson. 'At this point, I know that it will never happen again' Peterson has been in therapy for 8 years with Dr. Carol Ball a licensed psychologist in Arlington and a founder of New England Forensic Associates. Carl Peterson, registered level 3 sex offender speaking before a crowd at Belmont High School on Thursday . Peterson has also agreed to meet with Belmont High School Principal Dr. Dan Richards and his church's pastor (another long-time educator, former Watertown High Head Master Steve Watson) on 'the kind of things that scare people' about him. Peterson said he was open to answering any questions people may have about the incident that occurred, 'over a weekend 12 years ago.' ""My crime was not against pre-school children or somebody I didn't know or lots of lots of children. It was against my niece,"" said Peterson. Sex offender: Carl Peterson's sex offender registration card includes his picture and vital statistics . Peterson says that he and his wife fear for the safety of their own daughter and intend no harm. 'I'm a parent. I have a 14-year-old daughter. On the first day of school, a white SUV showed up and approached a child. I'm a level 3 sex offender; it scared me to death. We talked about this to our daughter. I talked to this about my wife. What happened is the kid did not get picked up. He knew exactly what to do. The kid said 'This is not OK' and went away and told the police. There's not much else [parents] can do except [talk to them],"" Peterson said. After Peterson shared his words, a community member went up to him, shook his hand and thanked him for being 'brave.'","His niece was 14 when he raped her, the same age as his daughter is now .

"Staff at Judson's Bar were left red-faced after they gave a customer a receipt with a description of him and his friend - as 'gay guys' so that colleagues knew where to deliver their food . A bar has been forced to apologise to two customers who were given a receipt describing them as 'gay guys on stools'. Al Butler and his friend, both aged 26, were left fuming when they were handed the bill at the end of their lunch. A waitress had written 'Gay guys...stools' on it to show fellow staff where the pair were sitting when they delivered their food. He complained after spotting the line on the receipt at Judson's Bar, in Pocklington, East Yorkshire which was used as a guide to indicate to staff where customers were sitting. Mr Butler has been left angered by the treatment he received calling it as 'unacceptable as racism.' He said: 'My friend spotted it first and said ""I think the manager's misconstrued our lunch"" 'I obviously thought it was inappropriate. It took a while for it sink in. It was not insulting, it was just a shock. 'I was surprised. I would not expect it anywhere else. It's as equally unacceptable as racism. 'It's not a bad thing to be called gay - although I'm not and neither is my friend - but I think it's prejudiced. It's jumping to a conclusion without the need to do so.' Mr Butler, who was visiting his home . town from Derby, where he works as an aerospace engineer, claimed when . he had complained in person at the bar he had not received an apology. Instead the barman simply told him: 'Sorry, there's nothing I can do.' He then sought out owner Mr. Ward and complained to him and Judson's Bar now says it has 'apologised unreservedly' and said the member of staff involved, who had been working at the bar for a few days, has been disciplined. Bar owner Peter Ward said: 'We have apologised unreservedly. While it was completely wrong, I don't feel it was prejudiced. 'It was completely unprofessional and it is not what our business is about. Unprofessional: Owner Peter Ward has apologised unreservedly and called the conduct of his staff 'unprofessional', he also says the waitress involved has been disciplined . 'We understand why the two gentlemen concerned were offended and we have apologised to them unreservedly. 'We have also disciplined the waitress concerned and put in place a procedure so it will not happen again. I would add that everyone is welcome at Judson's.' But equality campaigners have still criticised the behaviour as 'inappropriate.' James Lawrence, of the sexual equality charity Stonewall, said better staff training was needed in order to prevent behaviour like this in the first place. He said: 'Incidents like this highlight the importance of staff training. Identifying customers by their perceived sexual orientation is unnecessary and could cause offence. 'It's right that the bar should apologise to the customers for this inappropriate behaviour.' A spokesperson from the York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Forum said: 'Clearly this is an unacceptable and wrong stereotype made by a member of staff at the bar, but it is also a mistake which could cause great offence and upset to anyone involved, regardless of their sexuality. 'We would welcome any business to contact us should they feel their staff require training on issues of equality, where we would be more than happy to assist.'","Al Butler, 26, was shocked to be handed receipt for lunch with a friend describing them as 'gay'

"Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan who was sacked by Myer this week after it was discovered he lied on his CV had previously lied his way into a job at the Australia Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry . The man who was fired from Myer on Monday after it was revealed that he had lied about his credentials was reported to police in January for doing the same thing to another company. Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was hired by the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AACCI) in December after he provided references and credentials that turned out to be false. A spokesman for the chamber said he had used the name 'Jeffrey Flanagan' when he was hired. The name he used for the job at Myer was 'Andrew Flanagan' - but the spokesman confirmed to the MailOnline : 'It is the same guy'. 'The references he had at the time sounded like great references, but when people looked into it further, they realised that things didn't add up, his claims didn't match what was on his resume,' he said. The spokesperson said that Mr Flanagan provided the AACCI with different references to the ones he gave Myer and that they were 'more suited to our needs'. 'I'd say he's stupid and smart. He's playing the game, he tailored his resume, which everyone does, but he went way overboard with having the right references and obviously the references were bogus.' The spokesperson did not know how Mr Flanagan was recruited for the role, which was a national one and would have seen him fly across the country, but added that the job had been advertised on Seek. Mr Flanagan was hired in December 2013 but took a holiday immediately afterwards. He 'wasn't operational until early January, and was asked to resign in mid to late January.' The AACCI then reported the whole incident to the police, the spokesman said. Mr Flanagan also managed to dupe the Australia Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry, fooling them with a fake CV last December . Andrew Flanagan was fired from Myer on Monday on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development. He claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of Asia Pacific for Inditex, the Spanish company that owns popular fashion chain, Zara. However, Inditex contacted Myer on Monday, just hours after Mr Flanagan started work at the company, to inform Myer that Mr Flanagan had never worked for them. Mr Flanagan was interviewed by the recruitment company several times and transcripts of those interviews were sent to Myer. Quest also conducted reference checks, contacting local and overseas referees. It is unclear how Mr Flanagan fooled Myer, Quest and the other companies interested in employing him. The Australian Financial Review reported that Mr Flanagan appears to be from Searcy in Arkansas and now lives in Melbourne. Myer hired Mr Flanagan as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on Monday, but was fired before the end of the day . Myer CEO Bernie Brooks was not the only one to be fooled, several other companies considered Mr Flanagan for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume .","Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was fired on his first day at Myer on Monday .

"With green spaces being replaced by building sites and large-scale developments around the world, architects are constantly looking for ways to replace them. One such concept, devised by a team Dutch-based architects, uses towering structures built with layers of green space in which flora and fauna could live. Called the Sea Tree, the structures would have space for birds and animals to live above ground, and would be bedded under the sea for fish and coral to inhabit. The Sea Tree concept (illustrated) was created by Dutch-based architects from Waterstudio. It was designed to add high density, green spots to towns and cities and each floating structure would be built using offshore technology and resources. The Sea Tree would be made up of layers in which flora and fauna could live . ‘Urbanisation and climate change put a lot of pressure on available space for nature in city centres,’ explained Waterstudio. ‘New initiatives for adding extra park zones to a city are rare. 'Yet these kind of additional habitats for birds, bees, bats and other small animals could bring a lot of positive green effects to the environment of a city.’ Waterstudio’s concept is called the Sea Tree and it was designed to add high density, green spots to towns and cities. According to designs, it would be a floating structure built using layers where animals and birds can live. To hold it in place, Waterstudio claims Sea Trees would be moored to the sea bed using a cable system. Under the water, (concept illustrated) the Sea Tree would provide a habitat for small water creatures or, if the climate allowed for it, artificial coral reefs . The structures would not accessible by man, and would be built using offshore technology and resources, quite similar to how oil storage towers are built and powered out at sea. The idea is that large oil companies would donate a Sea Tree, and the trees could be built on rivers, seas, lakes and harbours (illustrated). The height and depth of the Sea Tree could also be adjusted depending on where it was placed .

The cost for the Sea Tree design is estimated at €1 million (£786,100), and this would depend on water depth, mooring facilities and transport from construction site to the chosen city. Further cost differences would depend on the preferred flora and fauna. Waterstudio said it is in the process of finalising the location of the trees, and discussing costs with oil companies. Once these are complete, they will start construction.

"Anti-drugs campaigners last night condemned an exhibition at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew where speakers will discuss the uses of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. The Intoxication Season is open  to visitors of any age and displays plants including cannabis, the hallucinogen peyote, and poppies, which are used to make opium. Professor David Nutt, who was sacked as a Government adviser  for his views downplaying the dangers of drugs, will give a keynote speech on the ‘chemical underworld of mind-altering plants’. 'Irresponsible': Anti-drugs campaigners last night condemned an exhibition at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew where speakers will discuss the uses of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms . Other lectures include Seeing Through The Smoke, about the ‘helpful properties’ of cannabis, while another event celebrates  the hallucinogen psilocybin as  the ‘powerful chemical which makes mushrooms magic’. The three-week exhibition is set to begin on September 20 at the 300-acre Kew Gardens, which receives about half its funding from the Government. It has been given £114.5 million of public money since 2010. Curators insist that the event, which will display ‘notorious mind-altering plants’ in the Princess of Wales Conservatory, will ‘in no way condone the use of illegal drugs’. But last night campaign groups said that Kew, whose patron is Prince Charles, was ‘failing to safeguard youngsters from the dangers of drugs’. Elizabeth Burton-Phillips, chief executive of the charity  DrugFAM, said: ‘The literature from Kew Gardens reads like an invitation for children to come and experiment with drugs. I am sure these people are all experts in their field but I deal with families who have lost children to drugs and my son died as a result of them. ‘The organisers are behaving extremely irresponsibly and not safeguarding youngsters. It’s awful a publicly funded organisation is using its money for such a festival.’ Platform: Professor David Nutt will give a keynote speech on the 'chemical underworld of mind-altering plants' Prof Nutt has recently called for users to be given ‘more informed choices about their use of legal and controlled drugs’. He said his lecture would discuss the ‘relative harms of drugs’ and possible new treatments using controlled substances such as psilocybin. ‘The regulations controlling psilocybin mushrooms are ten times more strict than those controlling heroin,’ he said. ‘It makes no sense. All it does is stop people like me doing research and helping develop treatments. I am not recommending the use of any drug. The law is designed to keep recreational users from harm. If it doesn’t do that, but massively impairs research, it is actually doing people a disservice.’ But Mary Brett, of campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Kew should not be giving him this platform. Drugs are too serious a subject to be treated in this manner. But they’ve done it because they know he’s controversial.’ David Raynes, of the National Drug Prevention Alliance and a former HM Customs Assistant Chief Investigation Officer, said: ‘Professor Nutt will go anywhere and do anything to bang his drum for the normalisation of drug use. ‘He writes about giving drug users accurate information but those most badly affected by drugs are often young people who haven’t developed a risk-judgment mechanism.’ A Royal Botanic Gardens spokeswoman said no illegal drugs would be exhibited at the festival, only  ‘the living plants from which illegal and legal drugs are derived’. These could be viewed only from behind a security barrier. ‘We are aiming to show how plants’ identities have been manipulated through time, sometimes portrayed as friend, sometimes as foe, when no plant is inherently a drug, a medicine, or a poison,’ she added.

"From diabetes smelling like nail polish remover to liver failure smelling of raw fish, doctors say diseases could eventually be diagnosed just using smell. They say that the breath of people with diabetes has been reported to smell of nail varnish remover, while that of those with liver disease can smell of raw fish. And even if the smell is too subtle to be detected by humans, it could soon be picked up by ‘electronic noses’. Having diabetes can make a person's breath smell of nail varnish remover, doctors have revealed . The researchers, who published their findings in the journal Sensors, also explain that a bladder infection can make the urine smell of ammonia and rubella can make the sweat smell of freshly plucked feathers. Schizophrenia can make the sweat smell of vinegar and typhoid makes the skin smell like freshly baked bread, the BBC reports. Finally, yellow fever can make the skin smell like a butcher's shop and scrofula - a lymph node infection - can make a patient smell of stale beer. Diabetes can make the breath smell of nail varnish remover. Liver failure can make the breath smell of raw fish. A bladder infection can cause the patient's urine to smell of ammonia. Rubella can make the sweat smell of freshly plucked feathers. Schizophrenia can make the sweat smell of vinegar. Typhoid makes the skin smell like freshly baked bread. Yellow fever can make the skin smell . like a butcher's shop. Scrofula - a lymph node infection - can make a . patient smell of stale beer. Within the last week researchers have also discovered that machines can ‘sniff out’ breast cancer and that they are just as effective as a mammogram. One patient even claims that she was is able to detect the smell of cancer herself. Joanie wrote on an online forum that when her husband was suffering from prostate cancer, and when she had lung cancer, she could smell decay. She says that the smell disappeared when the cancer was treated. Seemingly, she is not alone – Dr George Preti at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia says he has heard numerous reports of patients noticing an unpleasant smell when around someone with cancer. Dr Preti says he hopes this finding could lead to new ways to diagnose cancer earlier. He is particularly interested in ovarian cancer which is often not diagnosed until it is at an advanced stage. Dr Preti says that the body produces chemicals as a result of normal metabolism but that cancerous cells metabolise differently meaning they emit different chemicals and cause a different smell. This is usually too subtle for humans to detect but dogs have been trained to diagnose cancer as well as diabetes. As a result, Dr Preti is now collaborating with the Penn Vet Working Dog Center in a bid to teach dogs to sniff out ovarian cancer. The breath of people with liver failure sometimes smells of raw fish and having a bladder infection can cause the patient's urine to smell like ammonia . Dr Preti says the four dogs receiving the training are able to detect the disease 90 per cent of the time. He hopes the dogs will help him to identify a unique ‘odour signature’ for the cancer. This would then allow him to programme an ‘electronic nose’ to detect the disease. Dr Preti told the BBC: ‘You can have the power of a dog's nose on this small chip the size of your fingernail. It's this device, rather than the dogs, that might end up on hospital wards.’ Dogs, however, are not the only creatures that are able to detect cancer. Scientists believe that fruit flies also have this ability. Researchers at the University of Konstanz, in Germany, found the smell of cancer cells can cause a specific pattern of activity in the flies’ antennae. The researchers hope they will eventually be able to grow their own antennae which they could use to detect disease. Typhoid can makes the skin smell like freshly baked brown bread and schizophrenia can make a person's sweat smell of vinegar . Another device is closer to hitting the market. Tests on an ‘electronic nose’ called BreathLink revealed it can detect breast cancer in a patient’s breath. The device can give results within 10 minutes and could prevent patients from having to be exposed to X-rays. It could save millions of women from painful mammograms. It is being tested at the University of Maastricht Medical Centre in The Netherlands and could be available to doctors within just two years. At about the same time, another company, called Owlstone, is hoping to make available a device that can sniff out bowel cancer. Having yellow fever can make a person's skin smell like a butcher's shop and scrofula - a lymph node infection - can make a patient smell of stale beer . Just a few weeks ago, researchers at the Karolinska Institute, in Sweden, discovered that humans can smell if someone's immune system is highly active. They discovered that people can smell that the immune system has gone into overdrive within just a few hours of exposure to bacteria. The researchers injected a group of volunteers with a toxin that induced an immune response. They then asked them to wear tight t-shirts and discovered that when another group of people smelt these t-shirts, they thought the sweat had a more unpleasant smell than that from people whose immune systems were not in overdrive.","Liver failure can make a person's breath smell like raw fish .

Hossaini was handed the award at a ceremony at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in New York. He was joined by 24-year-old reporter Sara Ganim of The Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pa. She captured the award for local reporting for breaking the Penn State scandal that ultimately brought down Joe Paterno. Happy: Patriot-News reporter Sara Ganim, 24, left, calls her sister while hugging Patriot-News reporter Jan Murphy after winning the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting . Ganim, a police and courts reporter, . won for 'courageously revealing and adeptly covering the explosive Penn . State sex scandal,' the Pulitzer judges wrote. At 24, she is one of the . youngest journalists ever to win a Pulitzer; at least one prior winner, . Jackie Crosby of the Macon Telegraph and News of Georgia, was 23. Ganim . broke the news of the grand jury investigation into allegations against . former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. She was also . the first to report his indictment on charges of molesting several boys . involved in a charity he ran. Sandusky has denied the allegations. The . scandal ended Paterno's lustrous coaching career, prompted the ouster . of Penn State President Graham Spanier and led to a nationwide . discussion over the place of big-time sports on college campuses.

Walker who won the feature photography prize . Powerful: Ostrom cups his hand over his mouth as he tries to calm a panic attack at his apartment in Boulder. He told Walker that it has been hard to find meaning in his life since 2007 . 'Better than any award, the most . rewarding thing through this whole process has been people telling me . that this story and our coverage has changed their minds about local . reporting, and we all know that there are a lot of minds yet to change,' Ganim said. The . Associated Press also won a Pulitzer Prize - its 50th - for . investigative journalism Monday for revealing the New York Police . Department's widespread spying on Muslims. The . articles showed that police systematically listened in on sermons, hung . out at cafes and other public places, infiltrated colleges and . photographed people as part of a broad effort to prevent terrorist . attacks. Individuals and groups were monitored even when there was no . evidence they were linked to terrorism. Poetry: Tracy K.

But . while a host of journalist picked up awards for disciplines including . investigations, criticism, breaking news and feature writing, fiction . didn't fare quite so well. In . fact, judges decided to withhold the fiction prize for the first time in . 35 years... because none of the books were good enough. Pulitzer judges had narrowed the field . to three finalists, including David Foster Wallace's 'The Pale King,' a . novel assembled from notes he left behind at the time of his suicide in . 2008. Also cited were Karen Russell's 'Swamplandia' and Denis Johnson's . novella 'Train Dreams.' Surprise: Columnist Mary Schmich addresses a crowded Chicago Tribune newsroom after finding out she won the Pulitzer Prize in commentary writing . Hand shakes all round: Associated Press reporter Chris Hawley, second from left, shakes hands with Tom Curley, President and CEO of the news cooperative, after The AP won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting . 'The . main reason (for the fiction decision) is that no one of the three . entries received a majority, and thus after lengthy consideration, no . prize was awarded,' said Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer . Prizes. 'There were multiple factors involved in these decisions, and we . don't discuss in detail why a prize is given or not given.' Many greeted news about the fiction category as an unpleasant surprise. Drama: The Tuscaloosa News won a Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for their coverage of the April 27, 2011 tornado that destroyed much of Tuscaloosa . 'No . fiction prize!' Jane Smiley, a Pulitzer winner in 1992 for 'A Thousand . Acres,' wrote on her Facebook page. 'Not even to (Geraldine Brooks') 'Caleb's Crossing!' I did love that one.' In . an email to The Associated Press, Smiley added: 'I can't believe there . wasn't a worthy one. It's a shame. But sometimes a selection committee . really cannot agree, and giving no award is the outcome. Too bad.' The . Pulitzers have helped canonize such classics as John Updike's 'Rabbit . at Rest' and Marilynne Robinson's 'Gilead.' The awards also have the . rare power to transform an obscure literary novel, like the 2010 winner, . Paul Harding's 'Tinkers,' into an instant best seller.

"A Washington pig farmer has come up with a new twist on 'grass-fed' meat by feeding his animals left over leaf trim from a nearby marijuana farm. William von Scheneidau, owner of the BB Ranch in Seattle, came up with the idea after the owners of a weed dispensary told him they had extra stems, stalks and leaves to get rid of. Marijuana was legalised in Washington last year, leading to an explosion in production. But it is usually only the buds - the most psychoactive parts of the plant - which are consumed. The rest of the plants are usually thrown out, or made into compost. Scroll down for video . Pot pigs: William von Scheneidau, owner of the .

For more videos, please go to BB-Ranch MainsRaider . Sensing an opportunity to tap into the lucrative stoner market, Mr Von Scheneidau asked the weed farmers if he could take what they were planning to throw out to feed to his pigs. Mr Von Scheneidau's 'Pot Pigs', as he calls them, have already proved a hit with customers, with meat selling out before the batches are even processed, NBC News reports. 'I feed them marijuana for the last two months of their lives, and they've been happy, happy as hell,' he told the news network. Despite the relatively weak effects of the cannabis leaf trimmings, he says pigs just lie around, barely lifting their heads - much like human stoners. Happy as a pig in... Pigs which are being raised on the unusual diet, which makes them gain weight faster . It's party time! A farm labourer mixes up the special brew containing cannabis leaf trim, beer and vodka . That might be a reason for his remarkable finding that the animals that eat the dope gain weight 20 per cent faster than those fed on more conventional diets - even though they consume the same amount overall. The fast weight gain leads to a more marbled and fatty texture to the free-range pork, which usually goes on to be processed into products like bacon and prosciutto. Mr Von Scheneidau, who refrains from smoking the herb himself, told NBC that customers taking part in 'blind bacon tests' described the meat as 'more savoury'. 'The flavour of the fat is extraordinary, [customers] love the marbling of the fat,' he said. It is not the first time the enterprising pig farmer has experimented with unusual feeds for his animals. He also adds beer and even vodka to their troughs, bringing whole new meaning to the phrase 'party animals'.","William von Scheneidau feeds his pigs with leftover cannabis leaf trim .

"A new study shows a majority of Germans have had enough of the Holocaust and want to move on from greatest genocide in history. On the eve of tomorrow's  commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz, 81 percent of Germans say they want to put 'the history of the persecution of the Jews behind them' and for their leaders to turn to 'contemporary problems.' The study entiled 'Connecting past, separating present' was conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation to gauge current German-Israeli relations and its findings published in the Bild am Sonntag ahead of World Holocaust Day remembrances. Scroll down for video . A new study shows a majority of Germans want to move on from the Holocaust, the greatest genocide in history. Above, Auschwitz concentration camp . It also showed that almost half of modern day Germans - 48 percent - have a bad opinion about Israel, 36 percent a good one. Israelis quizzed in the same survey had a largely positive opinion of the country which exterminated six million Jews in wartime - some 68 percent approved of the country, more than ever before. In Israel the survey found that almost one in four people there wanted to draw a line underneath the Holocast, the cataclysmic event of the 20th century which more than any other led to the founding of the Jewish state in 1948. Pollsters said the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict greatly determines German perceptions of Israel. Stephan Vopel, director of the study and the Israel expert of the Bertelsmann Foundation, said: 'Israelis and Germans have drawn different conclusions from history. 'The maxim for the the Germans is never again war , for the Israelis, it is never again victims.' With views of younger generations, the study is a warning: 'We must create more opportunities for direct encounters between the young people of both countries.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to be at Auschwitz in Poland - where an estimated 1.2 million people were murdered in wartime - on Tuesday . Neo-Nazism continues to be a problem for Germany with far-right groups targetting the young in particular. Last year there was a huge scandal when a class of privileged grammar schoolchildren were exposed as Nazi worshippers with some of them putting on fake Hitler moustaches and posting their pictures on to social networking site. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to be at Auschwitz in Poland - where an estimated 1.2 million people were murdered in wartime - on Tuesday. Tomorrow marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz, above . The study said that of the 81 percent who wanted the Holocaust to receed in the natonal consciousness, 58 percent were determined that a line should 'totally' be drawn under it. Interestingly, younger Israelis proved more critical of Germany than older ones with just 53 percent of under 30's having a positive view of the country. This is despite a massive influx into Germany of young Jews, particularly into Berlin from where the Holocaust against their grandparents was directed. Eighty percent of elder Israelis - those over 50 - have a positive view of the country and 84 percent of Israelis hope for the continued political support of Germany for Israeli policies. The study said that of the 81 percent who wanted the Holocaust to receed in the natonal consciousness . But in Germany every second citizen is against this and 68 percent want their lawmakers to stop weapons exports to Tel Aviv. Last year a submarine costing half a billion pounds was delivered to the Israeli navy. There were also differences of opinion between Israelis and Germans about what actually caused the anti-Semitic polices and extermination programme of the Nazis. Sixty seven percent of Israelis blamed the German love of authority for the catastrophe while sixty one percent of Germans blamed the economic times and unemployment as the main reasons behind it.","Study was conducted to gauge current German-Israeli relations .

"A woman who has spent 13 years trying to find a couple whose wedding photo she discovered in the rubble of 9/11 got the thrill of a lifetime yesterday when she finally got to speak to someone from the picture, and learn that all are alive and well.

He is pictured in the background of the photo, taken at a friend's wedding. The photo came into Ms. Keefe's possession back in October of 2001, when a friend who uncovered it in some of the rubble near the sight passed it off to her, and asked that she do something meaningful with it. And after 27,000 retweets from the likes of Blake Shelton yesterday, that something meaningful finally happened she was able to speak to Mr. Mahe, who still lives in NYC with his wife, Keri.

'So, if it had a relationship to 9/11, I wanted to keep it safe until I could return it to its owner. There's so much beauty and happiness in the photo that I just felt committed to the task.' 'Every year I go dig it out,' Keefe told The Boston Globe. 'I’ve been posting it for years, and it’s literally never gone anywhere.' 'I’ve never dismissed the idea that it could just be a photo that was in a neighboring building that had its windows blown out,' Keefe also told the newspaper.

"A golden retriever is recovering after having emergency surgery to remove 16 rocks from his stomach. The seven-year-old dog found the river rocks in his garden and quickly gobbled them up - but then had to be rushed to a vets in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. His owners first noticed something was wrong on Tuesday night, when the husband asked his wife: 'Does Gordon's stomach look big to you?' Full up: An X-ray of Gordon's stomach revealed 16 rocks . The following morning, they realized he had a serious problem when he tried to pass the first rock. His worried owners, who have asked not to be identified, rushed Gordon to Blue Pearl Vets, where an X-ray revealed the pile of rubble in his belly. Gordon then had to have a two-hour operation to clear the rocks, which weighed 1.79lb, from his stomach. 'Dogs eat a lot of different things. Usually they would eat only one or two rocks,' James Judge, from Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, told Mail Online. 'I saw an X-ray of a dog that ate a fork once, that was pretty amazing,' he added. Gordon's owners did not see him eat the rocks, but they believe he found them in their garden. They told the vets they were surprised at what was seen on his X-ray because he always has food available. Recovery: Gordon is said to be doing well and wagging his tail after having a two-hour operation . Weighty issue: The stones removed from the dog's stomach weighed 1.79lb . Dr Jeff Yu, who performed the operation, . said: 'You don't see too many dogs that eat this many rocks usually. Most dogs will stop after one or two, but Gordon certainly had . quite the hankering for some rocks.' Mr Judge said that dogs will sometimes eat rocks, especially if they are under a barbecue, where food has dripped down. The cost of the operation has not been revealed but surgery can cost up to a couple of thousand pounds, Mr Judge said. Unusual: Dr Jeff Yu says most dogs would only eat one or two rocks but Gordon swallowed 16 . He added that Gordon's unexpected experience was a perfect example of why pet insurance can be so valuable. Despite his uncomfortable ordeal Gordon is making a good recovery and is expected to go home tomorrow. 'He is still at the hospital but he is wagging his tail and eager to see his owners,' Mr Judge said.","X-ray revealed pile of rubble in Gordon the retriever's stomach .

"Manchester United have just splashed out £60million on Angel Di Maria, but it is unlikely Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a move after the former manager's ‘difficult’ time managing Argentinians. Ferguson wrote of his troubles handling Juan Sebastian Veron in his autobiography, saying the midfield star didn't make an effort to learn English. Veron arrived at Old Trafford in 2001 for a then British record transfer fee of £28.1m but struggled to adapt to the English top flight and was moved on to Chelsea after just two years. Clash: Sir Alex Ferguson wrote in his autobiography of difficulties managing Argentine players such as Juan Sebastian Veron, who spent two seasons at Manchester United between 2001 and 2003 . Big money buy: Manchester United have splashed out £60m on Argentine Angel Di Maria as Louis van Gaal (right) seeks to strengthen his under-performing squad . High point: There were glimpses of Veron's class at United, such as this goal in the Champions League against Maccabi Haifa in 2002, but overall his time in Manchester was a disappointment . Ferguson wrote: 'I confess I found working with Argentinian footballers quite difficult. There was deep patriotism towards Argentina. ‘They always had the flag round them. I had no problem with that, but the ones I managed didn't try particularly hard to speak English. ‘With Veron it was just, “Mister”.' Now, United have broken the transfer record again to bring in Di Maria and Louis van Gaal is hoping he performs rather better and Ferguson's words of warning are misguided. No better: Veron was moved on to Chelsea for £15m but struggled to find form there too . Wizard: United will hope Di Maria can translate his best form for Real Madrid at Old Trafford . Tall order: Van Gaal has made Di Maria part of a comprehensive overhaul of his United squad . VIDEO Di Maria joins La Liga's England exodus . Di Maria is part of an expensive overhaul of the United squad as they aim to recover from a poor start to the season. He will be the 50th Argentine player to turn out in the Premier League and the fourth at United after Veron, Gabriel Heinze and Carlos Tevez. Left-back Heinze spent three seasons at United between 2004 and 2007, playing 83 matches and scoring five times. He grew frustrated with a lack of regular action and demanded a move to Liverpool. United rejected the bid and Heinze eventually joined Real Madrid. Argentine connection: Defender Gabriel Heinze spent three seasons at Manchester United . On target: Carlos Tevez scored 34 goals for United in his two seasons with the club . Tevez played for two seasons at Old Trafford, making a total of 99 appearances and scoring 34 goals. Signed on a two-year loan following a protracted transfer saga with West Ham and his management company, Tevez was never offered a permanent deal and moved to Manchester City in 2009. The first Argentines in the Premier League arrived around 1998, with Horacio Carbonari at Derby and Mauricio Taricco at Tottenham. Since then, some like Sergio Aguero at Manchester City and Javier Mascherano at West Ham and Liverpool have played in England with great success. It remains to be seen whether Di Maria can live up the expectations that come with his expensive price tag. Success story: Argentine Sergio Aguero has been a smash hit at Manchester City .

"Next time you settle down for a spot of Lego with your children, take a proper look at the faces on the figures. Because while you may remember life in Legoland as being perfectly content, these day things are a little more fraught. A study has revealed that the faces of Lego characters are getting angrier. In the past, they all had a standard enigmatic smile. But this has changed as more sets are designed to tie in with films, often featuring battles between good and evil. Lego characters are slowly getting angrier, say researchers who found that since the product launched in 1975, the proportion of angry faces has been rising. For the first 11 years after Lego was introduced, all characters were happy . 'Lego themes have been increasingly based on conflicts [such as Pirates or Harry Potter]. Often a good force is struggling with a bad one,' say the researchers . Christopher Bartneck, of New Zealand's . University of Canterbury, has published research showing that Lego . characters are becoming more conflict-oriented, and the human figures . featured in Lego sets are getting angrier. The study found that Lego figures most frequently feature happy or angry expressions, but since their introduction in 1975, the proportion of angry faces has been rising. The findings also raise questions about the role of the design of toys and its impact on children, say the researchers. Previous research has shown that facial expressions are universal across languages and cultures, with the six most widely used being disgust, happiness, sadness, fear, anger and surprise. There are fears that the move from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces impacts how children play . According to the study, 'analysis shows that toy design has become a more complex design space in which the imaginary world of play does not only consist of a simple division of good versus evil, but a world in which heroes are scared and villains can have superior smile.' However, it was the six most prominent facial expressions identified among Lego characters that are possible cause for concern: disdain, confidence, concern, fear, happiness, and anger. It was only in the 1990s that Lego began to introduce a wider variety of facial expressions to characters. For the first 11 years, only one smiley face was produced. Happiness and anger remain the most . widely used, but now occur in greater range of intensity: Two distinct . versions of both happiness and anger were found among the characters. 'Lego themes have been increasingly based on conflicts [such as Pirates or Harry Potter]. Often a good force is struggling with a bad one,' says Bartneck. 'The facial expressions are not directly matched to good and evil. Even the good characters suffer in their struggle and the villians can have a smug expression. In any case, the variety of faces has increased considerably.' 'We cannot help but wonder how the move . from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces . impacts how children play. The new faces of Lego: disdain, confidence, concern, fear, happiness and anger . 'Designers of agent faces should take great care to design the expressions and to test their effect since toys play an important role in the development of children.' 'Instead of focusing on highly realistic expressions, it may be worthwhile to increase the variability of expressions. A comic style expression is sufficient to convey a full spectrum of emotions and intensities.' Bartneck will present the paper on his findings at the First International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction in Sapporo, Japan, in August. The Danish company Lego is one of the . biggest toy manufacturers in the world, and produced more that 36 . billion bricks distributed to 130 countries in 2010 alone, equivalent to . 75 bricks each for everyone on Earth. To mark the 150th anniversary of London Underground, LEGO has built a series of Tube maps which show how the Tube system has changed over time. The maps are currently on display at King's Cross Station and other large stations across London. They are made out of nothing but LEGO and show how the Tube map looked in 1927 and how it has changed over the years. LEGO has created a series of London Underground maps which show how the network has changed over the years. Image shows how the map looked in 1968 . According to London24, the maps even show how the network will look in 2020. The Tube maps, which were made by Duncan Titmarsh, are each built from more than 1,000 LEGO bricks. Each one took Mr Titmarsh four days to put together. Once the maps have finished their tour of London stations, they will be put on show at the London Transport Museum.","For the first 11 years after Lego was introduced, all characters were happy .

Some thought it was a skunk, others a raccoon, but now it's finally been identified: the unusual-looking animal is a fisher, sometimes called a fisher-cat, and it could be the answer the New York City's rat problem. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: This creature was photographed around the Bronx for months before it was identifed . The Department of Environmental Conservation describes the fisher as a 'large, dark, long-haired member of the weasel family. Their stature is relatively low to the ground, with short legs, small ears and a well-furred tail.' 'One night, I was out putting out garbage and I saw it running across, and I was like, ""Wow what is that?""' Patrick Watson told CBS New York. The first sighting was in April when NYPD officer Derek Lenart managed to take a picture of the animal. After that, others documented its meanderings around the area, but no one knew what it was until now. Zoologist Roland Kays identified it as a fisher after being sent a picture of the creature. The fisher . is a member of the weasel family that once lived in the New York City . area in abundance until the fur trade pushed them north and into the . Adirondacks. Kays, of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, tells CBS that the creature may have come down the river. No natural predators: Fishers are hunters that prey on small rodents - but aren't a threat to humans . Rat catcher: Zoologists say it is a fisher, a rat-eating member of the weasel family that was driven from the New York area in the 1600s after it was over-hunted for its fur . Re-establishing: It's unclear if the fisher is making a comeback or if the Bronx creature is the only one of its kind . 'I'm guessing maybe he came down the river, kind of connecting up some of the natural areas, and then kind of took this side trip off into the Bronx. They're very good at sneaking around,' he told CBS. New Yorkers should be thrilled. Turns out the fisher preys on rats and squirrels. It's not a threat to humans but could be to cats and small dogs. They can climb trees and have even been known to prey on deer. Fisher trapping was banned in the 1930s. Kays says today the fisher population is booming in the Northeast and a trapping season has been reinstated. Kays said the last sighting of a fisher in the New York City area was probably in the 1600s. If the Bronx fisher is a sign of the species re-establishing itself in the city, it will face a host of challenges, such as avoiding being hit by cars. 'We’ve never seen them survive in anything as developed as the Bronx, so we don’t know,' Kays told DNA Info. 'Can they really set up a population?'","People in the Bronx first spotted the odd creature in April .

"Jack Cork is poised to become the eighth player to leave Southampton this summer as he closes on a move to Crystal Palace on Thursday. Southampton have raised more than £95million with the sales of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Rickie Lambert and Billy Sharp, who signed for Leeds United on a two year deal on Wednesday. VIDEO Scroll down for Saints scatter footballs all over Southampton in prize giveaway . On his way: Southampton have accepted a £3m offer from Crystal Palace for Jack Cork . Cork had one year left on contract and talks over a new deal had failed to produce an agreement. Fearing they would lose him for nothing next summer, Southampton have accepted a fee of around £3million from Palace. They rejected a similar offer from Swansea in January for Cork, while West Bromwich Albion and QPR had also shown interest in the 25-year-old midfielder, who joined from Chelsea for £800,000 in 2011. Interest: Southampton have agreed a £12.5m fee with Hull City for striker Shane Long . Southampton, however, have agreed a £12.5m fee with Hull City for striker Shane Long and are close to finalising the £6m transfer of Florin Gardos from Steaua Bucharest. Long's fee is set to hand his former club West Bromwich Albion around £600,000 as part of the deal that took him to Hull in January. Southampton sales may not have finished yet though as Tottenham remain keen on midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin and striker Jay Rodriguez, even though the latter won't be fit again until October following his cruciate injury.","Cork poised to become eighth player to leave Southampton this summer .

"They are known for being aggressive predators, willing to attack and kill humans. But as this picture shows, brown bears are also ever so slightly vain. This young bear was caught out gazing at its own reflection in a Finnish lake . Curious: This brown bear appears transfixed by its own reflection in a river in Kainuu, Finland .

These . pictures show the brown bear repeatedly stooping to stare at himself, . unaware that photographer Sylwia Domaradska is hiding just yards away. She captured the pictures in Kainuu, eastern Finland, where there is almost 24-hour daylight during the summer months. The 37-year-old from London said: 'It totally felt like a dream. It was almost difficult to see where the reflections were starting. 'The bear turned up at around midnight. He came very quietly along the water's edge looking for food. 'It was a fairly young bear, perhaps two or three years old. He was very cautious as at this age he'd need to be careful about females with cubs, and older males. Impressive: With the stillness of the water and the woods around the bear, this image could be a painting . Funny: The photographer said the bear appeared to keep looking at his reflection as he made his way around the water's edge . Youthful: It is thought the curious bear is only about two or three years old . 'He seemed to look at his own reflection - as he stayed in the same place for a while.' Miss Domaradska said when the bear began moving around the edge of the lake he continued looking in. 'It really was quite amusing to see - and then he was gone,' she said. 'The conditions were absolutely perfect for this kind of image. On guard: The bear stands to attention as he plays on the water's edge . Bright: Despite it looking like the middle of the daytime, these pictures were actually taken close to midnight . Going home: After admiring himself for a while, the bear decides enough is enough and heads away from the lake . 'The reflections were perfectly still and the line between the reflections and actual trees being reflected created very little blur.

"Senior aides to President Barack Obama will be urged to let traditional Scottish haggis back into America by ending a decades-old import ban. The consumption of sheep lung, a key ingredient of haggis alongside heart and liver, has been banned in the US since 1971 and all British lamb has been banned since 1989 following the BSE crisis. Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, will ask his US agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack to drop the ban during a meeting in the US today, and open up a market potentially worth millions to Scottish producers. Haggis is not allowed to be eaten in America but Environment Secretary Owen Patterson hopes a ban in place since 1971 can be lifted . The haggis market is already worth approximately £15m in the UK and could be worth far more in the US, given the popularity of Scottish heritage in the country, Mr Paterson said. Scottish producers asked Mr Paterson to take action when they met him at the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh last week. He said: ‘I share many haggis producers’ disappointment that American diners are currently unable to enjoy the taste of Scotland’s wonderful national dish in their own country. The haggis is addressed at a traditional Burns Night Supper . ‘I am meeting my US counterpart today to discuss how we can begin exporting it, particularly as so many Americans enjoy celebrating their Scottish heritage. ‘This Government has opened many markets for our home-grown food and drink businesses. ‘I will continue to do everything I can to boost exports of everything from whisky to haggis to support Scotland’s farmers and rural economy.’ Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish Secretary, said: ‘In my own constituency, we produce some of the finest lamb in the country, if not the world, so I know just how good Scottish meat can be. ‘It seems only right that the UK Government continues to use its considerable influence to open up as many opportunities as possible, to reintroduce our produce where markets have been closed and to create new ones wherever it can. ‘As for haggis, all I can say is, the Americans don’t know what they’re missing. Let’s try to put that right too.’ The men in whose hands the fate of the haggis rests: Environment Secretary Owen Patterson (left) and US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack . James Macsween, the director of haggis maker Macsween of Edinburgh, said: ‘The opportunities for exporting our haggis into the American market are very exciting and I am delighted to hear progress is being made in this respect. ‘With the huge popularity in the US of all things Scottish, hopefully these negotiations will allow American consumers the chance to finally taste authentic, high-quality Macsween haggis very soon.’ The Government hopes the ban on British lamb can be lifted as part of a European Union-US trade deal currently being negotiated, which is potentially worth more than £10bn to the British economy overall. It follows Mr Paterson’s successful lobbying to lift a ban on UK beef exports to the US earlier this year. During his visit, Mr Paterson will also promote British food and drink products at the Summer Fancy Food Show in New York, where brands like Walkers’ Shortbread have made inroads into the American specialist food market, which is worth an estimated $85bn (£49.9bn) a year.","America has banned sheep lung imports since 1971 and all British lamb since 1989 since BSE crisis .

"Many people under emotional stress are reluctant to head to bed because they don't know, like Shakespeare's Hamlet, 'what dreams may come?' Now scientists have found that dreaming - which is the Rapid Eye Movement phase of sleep - is actually essential to help us cope with inner turmoil. Participants found it far easier to cope with emotional images once they had some sleep . Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found our brains process emotional experiences during dreams and this takes the painful edge off difficult memories. Study author Els van der Helm, said: 'During REM sleep, memories are being . reactivated, put in perspective and connected and integrated, but in a . state where stress neurochemicals are beneficially suppressed.' The team studied 35 healthy young adults for their study, who were divided into two groups. All of them viewed 150 emotional images, twice and 12 hours apart, while an MRI scanner measured their brain activity. Half of the participants viewed the images in the morning and again in the evening, staying awake between the two viewings. The remaining half viewed the images in the evening and again the next morning after a full night of sleep. Those who slept in between image viewings reported a significant decrease in their emotional reaction to the images. MRI scans showed sleep caused a dramatic reduction in reactivity in the amygdala, a part of the brain that processes emotions. This allowed the brain's 'rational' prefrontal cortex to regain control of the participants' emotional reactions. In addition, overnight recordings of the participant's electrical brain activity showed levels of stress neurochemicals reduced during sleep. Co-author Professor Matthew Walker, . said: 'The dream stage of sleep, based on its unique neurochemical . composition, provides us with a form of overnight therapy, a soothing . balm that removes the sharp edges from the prior day's emotional . experiences.' Did Hamlet have PTSD? The Shakespeare character, portrayed here by Michael Sheen, famously fears sleep. Scientists believe dreams help people to deal with emotional troubles, but could malfunction in those with post-traumatic stress . The findings, could explain why . people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as war veterans, . suffer reoccurring nightmares. The researchers said the therapy element of sleep may malfunction in PTSD sufferers. Therefore when a flashback is triggered by, say, a car backfiring, they . relive the whole experience because the emotion has not been properly . stripped away from the memory during sleep. While we spend one-third of our lives sleeping, there is no . scientific consensus on the function of sleep. These latest results, published in the journal Current Biology, offers some of the first . insights into the emotional function of REM, . which typically takes up 20 per cent of a healthy human's sleeping hours. Professor Walker said dreaming was vital in softening the emotional strength of experiences. 'We feel better about them, we feel we can cope,' he said.",Stress chemicals shut down while the brain processes emotional experiences during REM sleep .
"Celebrated children's author Lewis Carroll has been branded a 'repressed paedophile' in a new BBC documentary which uncovered naked photographs of the real-life sister of Alice in Wonderland taken by the writer. Carroll, who died in January 1898, befriended Alice Liddell and her two sisters as they were children. It was Miss Liddell who was the inspiration for the famous book. However, researchers working on a documentary on the 150th anniversary of the publication of the much-loved children's book discovered some disturbing images. Scroll down for video . New photographs discovered in advance of the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice in Wonderland has led to claims that author Lewis Carroll, pictured, may have been 'a Victorian Jimmy Savile' Carroll took many photographs of sisters Edith, left, Lorina, centre, and Alice Liddell, right,  around 1859 . According to the show's presenter Martha Kearney, some of the pictures of Alice's elder sister Lorina, which featured her naked in a full-frontal pose, are images that 'no parent would ever have consented to'. Carroll, whose real name was Charles Dodgson, knew the girls' father Henry Liddell, dean of Christ Church, Oxford. The BBC programme investigates whether Carroll could be considered as a 'Victorian Jimmy Savile'. Carroll was a keen photographer who took many photographs of Alice and her sisters. English professor Hugh Haughton told the programme: 'It will certainly make it harder for those who believe that Carroll's interest in little girls was totally innocent; it will make it more complicated.' Author Will Self said: ' Dodgson [Carroll] himself, I think, was a heavily repressed paedophile, without a doubt.' Alice's great-grand daughter Vanessa Tait told the programme: 'He was a strange man but an admirable one, and I don't want to tar him with accusations of paedophilia which we're all so obsessed with now.' The Secret World of Lewis Carroll will be broadcast on Saturday January 31, at 9pm . Carroll dressed Alice Liddell up as a beggar maid for this photograph which was taken in 1859 .

"This is certainly one purchase where the buyer should beware. A couple of flatmates are hoping there will be a few brave souls left at the end as they auction a 'haunted' mirror which they claim has brought them nothing but misery. Student Joseph Birch, 20, and painter Sotiris Charalambous, 34, acquired the antique mirror when their landlord put it in a skip outside their  in Muswell Hill, London five months ago. But ever since then, the pair claim  they have been brought nothing but bad luck, misery, financial problems and illness. Mr Charalambous says it has caused him to wake up screaming with 'stabbing pains' in the night. Spooky: Only the bravest bargain hunter should bid for this 'haunted' mirror because the current owner claims it has caused him to wake up screaming with stabbing pains in the middle of the night . He said: 'The landlord said keep it, I don't want it.' Joseph, an art and design student, and his flatmate began seeing 'flickering shadows' and 'glimpses of black darkness' in the mirror and orbs of light in the room. Since the walnut mirror was painted . metallic silver by Sotiris two months ago, the flatmates began to suffer . intense nightmares and their problems escalated. Claims: Student Joseph Birch reported seeing 'flickering shadows' in the mirror and orbs of light in the room . Joseph . woke up covered in red scratchmarks in the middle of the night last . week and both have had sleepless nights which they blame on the antique. But if that's the bad news, the good news is the mirror only has a few scratches and is not broken. They . have placed the mirror on internet auction site eBay with a . price of £100 but say it is 'only right' that a potential buyer knows . about the problems it may bring. The flatmates have had a number of bids slightly below the reserve price so far. And one prospective buyer is even eyeing up the mirror as a gift for an ex. Sotiris said: 'I think someone could have been murdered in front of the mirror and that's why it has been haunting our house. 'I don't think it the mirror likes it since I painted it silver. I took it to an antique dealer who said it was worth £100 once and that's why we're asking for the price, but we would ideally like it to go to someone who has experience of the paranormal.' The item has attracted interest from allover the country, with 20,000 people having viewed the item so far. Joseph said: 'We've had a lot of queries from people interested in the paranormal and skeptics too. 'I just know we don't want it in the house anymore, but we didn't think it was fair to sell it without warning people.' The mirror is described as a 'beautiful grand victorian style mirror' which had enjoyed pride of place in the pair's North London studio apartment. Ghostly: Joseph Birch says since taking ownership of the 'haunted' mirror, he suffered bizarre scratches on the body and eerie nightmares . Joseph said: 'Since the mirror was put up, everything has gone wrong. 'A few days after we put the mirror up, both myself and my flat mate have woken in the early morning hours screaming in pain. 'We both experienced what I can only describe as intense sharp stabbing pains throughout our bodies. 'They would strike us both at the same time, then disappear as fast as they came. 'Originally . we thought somebody was performing some kind of voodoo or black magic . on us, but the mirror gives us the creeps and we started seeing strange . shadows in it.' Tough sell: Bidders probably can't say they weren't warned if they buy this 'haunted' mirror on ebay, which has brought the current owners misery . The pair say that the radiator below the mirror stopped working despite never having problems with central heating before and that their landline no longer works and the pipes have began rattling in the flat. Joseph said: 'We both feel drained of energy all the time, but if we leave the flat it makes us feel instantly better. 'Things are constantly going missing, keys, phones. 'I went into the bathroom one morning after hearing a loud bang. 'I . found objects strewn out across the floor, and a tub of shaving foam, . which had been on the other side of the room, down the toilet. 'With . my flatmate working most days, I spent a lot of time here alone in the . flat. I became paranoid and had the uneasy feeling that I was constantly . being watched. Orbs of light . 'My anxiety levels reached an all time high, and I was prescribed antidepressants by my doctor for the first time in my life. 'While I had calmed down enough to be able to tolerate being alone in the flat, I couldn't help but notice strange things happening around me. 'I would put things down and they would dissapear. 'When I pass the mirror, I see flickering shadows reflected in it. I would stand completely still and they continued, and I'd get quick glimpses of black darkness. He added: 'Last week I woke up at 3.30am with a pain in my lower back and bottom that felt like I'd been burned. 'I got up and looked in the bathroom mirror to find myself covered in deep red scratches going in all directions. 'I have short fingernails, and after checking the bed found nothing sharp or no loose springs that would explain such a thing. 'I have never been particularly superstitious, but just being around this mirror gives me the creeps and makes me feel sick to my stomach. 'I would ideally like it to go to somebody who has experience with the paranormal or supernatural and knows what they are getting themselves in for.","Painter Sotiris Charalambous says the mirror caused him to wake up screaming with 'stabbing pains' in the night .

"It’s been a while since we have seen this. Manchester United dominant and convincing, a result that never looked in doubt. Yes, Newcastle had their moments early on. Yes, they had early opportunities and should have been awarded a penalty with the game goalless. But did Louis van Gaal’s improving United ever look as though they would do anything but win here at Old Trafford? No, not for a moment. This was how it used to be under Sir Alex Ferguson. United were confident and sharp, assured in their passing and their execution of opportunities. They won with something in reserve, with modern day makeweights such as Darren Fletcher on the field as substitutes by the hour mark to spare the energy of the stellar names until their next appointment — at Tottenham — on Sunday afternoon. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: I can play Wayne Rooney in midfield or attack thanks to his lung capacity .

Rooney points the finger at Falcao, on loan from Monaco, after the Colombian's excellent assist in the Old Trafford encounter . That will be a tougher test. Tottenham cannot possibly defend as naively as Newcastle did here while United tend to be somewhat less convincing away from Manchester. Nevertheless, there is definite progress to be seen in Van Gaal’s team. While the David Moyes version of last season enjoyed a decent run at this time of year and then slipped rather inevitably into terminal decline, Van Gaal’s United look rather like their best days this season may yet be ahead of them. Certainly they were helped here by a Newcastle team that looked capable with the ball but inept without it. Unless Alan Pardew can improve his team defensively then the slump that followed the revival that followed the slump will continue indefinitely. To focus on that, however, would not only be rather depressing for the terrific Newcastle fans but also rather unfair on a United team guided imperiously round the field by Wayne Rooney and laced with wonderful cameos from Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao and another excellent performance from the seemingly reborn Ashley Young. If the mark of a manager — at least in part — is how well players improve and perform on his watch then Van Gaal is scoring highly at the moment. His team’s defensive security still needs work but with the ball they were terrific. Certainly Newcastle could and perhaps should have been in front early in the piece.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . For the first 15 minutes the lively Ayoze Perez was the game’s best player and he had already terrified United with one searing run from deep, and failed with a close-range volley, by the time the game’s first real talking point arrived in the 14th minute. Referee Mike Jones — who has his critics — was in a perfect position to see Mata clip the heels of Yoan Gouffran as the path of the two men crossed but either blinked at the wrong moment or deemed the clear contact unintentional. Whatever the case, he didn’t give a penalty and United were free to take full advantage by moving in to the lead shortly afterwards. Even early on, it seemed United would win. There was something about Newcastle’s defending that didn’t bode well from the start. Every cross — many of which came from the left foot of Young — seemed to cause a problem and Robin van Persie and Falcao could have scored early had they connected with balls that seemed to evade Newcastle defenders rather unerringly. Eventually, in the 24th minute, a goal arrived and it was terrific. Rooney — dictating play like a rugby scrum-half — fed Mata and when the Spaniard’s chipped pass reached Falcao, peeling off his marker at the back post, the first time cut-back was perfect for Rooney to score from six yards. In that instant, it was hard not to feel Newcastle were already done for. There was something about United that suggested they wouldn’t be denied and shortly after Falcao failed to nudge in another Young cross they added their second goal. This time it was a hospital pass from Gouffran to Perez that put Newcastle in trouble but it still took a determined tackle from Falcao to allow Mata to play Rooney clear in to the penalty area. The finish was applied first time. From then on, it was perhaps a case of ‘how many’ and surprisingly United only managed three.

This was not one of those afternoons that left De Gea as a spectator for long spells. United have some way to go before they take us that far back in time.

"London was today named the world’s most expensive city for super-prime housing with wealthy homeowners paying a staggering £6,000 per sq ft. The capital has always been a safe haven for the foreign elite looking to make a top-end housing purchase. And its popularity continues to rise, according to a report from property advisers CBRE. While house prices are falling in most regions, around 100 property millionares were created every day in the capital. Pictured is Rutland Gate, in Knightsbridge, London that was on the market for £300million . Hope the neighbours aren't noisy: The world's most expensive terraced house, 1 Cornwall Terrace, London, which is on the market for £100million .

CBRE says the super prime market is limited to a sphere of ‘golden postcodes’ predominantly around Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea. Trevor Abrahmsohn, who runs upmarket Glentree Estates, has sold some of London’s most expensive homes over the past 35 years with wealthy foreigners among his biggest clients. He puts this down to London being the 'best city in the world' thanks to a combination of its position, history and all-round facilities. Mr Abrahmsohn said: 'London ticks all the boxes for the family and is politically and economically stable. 'It is a free-spinning, 24-hour city.

"Taking the contraceptive Pill may increase a woman’s chance of developing multiple sclerosis, researchers warn. The risk of MS could be up to 50 per cent higher among women on the Pill, according to a new US study. The findings also show young obese women are at greater risk of the disease, probably because they produce higher levels of a hormone known to regulate appetite. Warning: A U.S. study of more than 3,300 women found more developed MS if they used the Pill . Previous research had suggested that oral contraception could cut MS risk, or delay its onset. MS is the most common disabling neurological condition, affecting almost 100,000 Britons – 50 young people are diagnosed each week. It involves damage to myelin, a protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres of the central nervous system, meaning the body’s immune system attacks itself. Symptoms range from mild, occasional illness involving numbness, muscle weakness and eye problems to rapid and severe deterioration, resulting in serious disability. Popular: The contraceptive pill is used by millions . US researchers identified 305 women who had been diagnosed with MS during a three-year period. Their use of the Pill – mainly a combination of two hormones – was compared with 3,050 women who did not have MS. In total, 29 per cent of the women . with MS and 24 per cent of those without MS had used hormonal . contraceptives for at least three months in the three years before . symptoms began. Women who had used the Pill were 35 per cent more likely to develop MS than those who did not use them. Those who had used the contraceptives but had stopped at least one month before symptoms started were 50 per cent more likely to develop MS. Lead researcher Dr Kerstin Hellwig said:  ‘These findings suggest that using hormonal contraceptives may be contributing at least in part to the rise in the rate of MS among women.’ Previously animal research led experts to believe female hormones might delay the onset of MS, and a British study suggested Pill users had a 40 per cent lower risk. The new research was presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting in Philadelphia. In a separate study at the same meeting, researchers looked at a possible link between obesity and MS, by checking the Body Mass Index (BMI) of study volunteers. BMI was calculated for 210 people with MS and 210 people of the same age and sex who did not have MS at ages 15 and 20 and at the time of the study. The study found that people who are obese at age 20 are twice as likely to later develop MS as people who are not obese. The study found that people with higher BMI levels also had higher levels of leptin, a hormone made by fat tissue that regulates weight, appetite and immune response. Study author Dr Jorge Correale, of the Raúl Carrera Institute for Neurological Research in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: ‘Leptin promotes inflammatory responses in the body, which could potentially explain the link between obesity and MS.’ Dr Hellwig said MS was a relatively rare disease, but most likely to strike women between the ages of 20 and 40 – when they would be taking the pill. She said: ‘We don’t say it causes MS, but adjusting for other factors more women use the pill who develop MS.' ‘There may be some environmental factor that we have not been able to allow for, we are not telling women to stop using the pill,’ she added.","Study examined 305 U.S. women diagnosed with MS and 3,050 without it .

"Mark Thomas allegedly stated that working mothers 'should not hold senior management positions'. John Smith, pictured, authorised a bonus of £120,000 for Mr Thomas despite the allegations, a tribunal heard . A ‘fat cat’ BBC chief declared working mothers cannot ‘focus’ on their jobs and have no place in top roles, the whistleblowing tribunal heard. Mark Thomas, a £200,000-a-year corporation executive, allegedly stated ‘women with child caring responsibilities should not hold senior management positions’. This was because they ‘are less focused on the job and not suited’, the Watford Employment Tribunal was told. The BBC is accused of covering up sexist behaviour. Another boss allegedly admitted that, . even if evidence of sexism was found, the corporation ‘would find it . difficult to admit any wrongdoing’, regardless of the ‘truth’, adding: . ‘The organisation would have to come first.’ Mr . Thomas’s alleged remarks came after one of his staff, Katy Child, a . mother of two young children, asked for a flexible working arrangement, . the tribunal heard. Mr . Thomas, who has since left the corporation, was the chief executive of . BBC Studios and Post Production and was ‘very unhappy’ about the . request. He is said to have told Byron Myers, the head of human . resources: ‘That b**** has had every guy in here wrapped around her . fingers.’ In a witness statement, Mr Myers told the tribunal: ‘Mr Thomas said it was a bombshell. He said we needed a plan to sort this out.’ Miss Child, the £42,000-a-year head of commercial development, had her first baby in 2007, and returned from her second maternity leave in September 2009. Mr Myers said Mr Thomas hit on the idea of offering her a job share with ‘conditions of acceptance so onerous Katy would have no choice but to refuse the offer’. Byron Myers told the tribunal that Mr Thomas planned to keep a mother who asked for flexible working hours on 'at risk status' for redundancy . The conditions would require her to work 12 weeks a year full time, and be ‘unworkable’ for a mother. Later, he claimed, Mr Thomas came up with a different approach. ‘He explained to me that Katy would be kept on an “at risk status” for redundancy’, meaning that after six months ‘her employment would be terminated irrespective of her performance’. Mr Myers decided he could not go along with this, and formally blew the whistle to his superiors. But he alleges he was informed that John Smith – the BBC’s highest paid executive – ‘would not like the idea of a formal investigation’. Mr Smith even authorised a bonus of £120,000 for Mr Thomas, despite the sexism claims, the tribunal heard. Mr Smith, who is due to give evidence later, is understood to reject Mr Myers’ accusations, and will say he demanded a full investigation into the matter. The storm blew up in the wake of Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly winning her tribunal against the BBC for discriminating against her as an older woman, in January 2011. Miss Child filed a formal complaint of harassment and sexism against Mr Thomas in August 2011. Mr Myers said that, as the BBC prepared its response to her complaint, he was pressured to sign a statement saying there had been no discrimination, when he did not agree. Miss Child has since come to an arrangement to work part-time at the corporation. She is not giving evidence at the tribunal, which is between Mr Myers and the BBC. He accuses the corporation of forcing him out after he turned whistleblower. Caspar Glyn QC, for the BBC, said it was untrue Mr Thomas had referred to Miss Child as a ‘b****’ who had the men in the office wrapped around her finger. He also dismissed the claim about Mr Thomas saying working mothers should not hold senior management positions. The tribunal continues.","Mark Thomas allegedly said women with childcare responsibilities 'should not hold senior management positions' and cannot 'focus' on their jobs .

"Unhappy puppy: Processed dog food could cause serious harm to the pets that eat it . Would you feed your family a meal made with condemned beef? Or spray the children’s tea with rancid fat collected from a deep-fat fryer? Or serve biscuits made with empty grain hulls swept from a factory floor? Because that’s what we do to our dogs. The unpalatable truth is that if you give your dog processed dog food - dried, tinned or in a pouch - you may be feeding them substances that cause them serious, possibly fatal, harm. In a Channel 5 documentary this week, I am one of a number of canine nutrition experts who accuse the big dog food manufacturers of knowingly shortening the lives of millions of dogs a year. The big businesses selling us processed dog food use ingredients unsuitable for human consumption - and unsuitable, in my view, for canine consumption. They make vast profits from something that would otherwise be thrown away. It is a consumer scandal waiting to happen. We all know there is a connection between our diet and health. The same applies to dogs, and every other species on the planet. But what is the best, most biologically appropriate diet for dogs? The diet your dog should be eating is that of a grey wolf in the wild. If you dissect a dog and a grey wolf you’ll find that their digestive systems are identical. The two animals are essentially the same species and so closely related that they can interbreed. Grey wolves live on prey such as deer, rabbits and mice, and eat everything including the bones, from which they get about a third of their nutrition. They also eat fruit and vegetables. In short, their diet consists of raw meat, raw bones and raw herbage. This, then, is the diet that allows dogs to achieve optimum health and longevity. Only recently have dog food manufacturers persuaded us otherwise. I believe nine out of ten visits to the vet are caused by dogs being fed the wrong diet. The quality of ingredients in most dog food is appallingly low, often including meat that has gone off. But the worst thing is that it has been cooked and it contains a great deal of grain. The cooking kills off important enzymes - chemicals responsible for thousands of vital metabolic processes - in the food, and alters its structure, making it hard for the dog to digest. Standards: The quality of ingredients in most dog food is appallingly low, often including meat that's gone off . Grain changes the pH (acidity) balance in the dog’s stomach, also causing health problems. When dogs eat grain almost all goes in one end and out the other. In short, processed dog food has the same effect on dogs as junk food has on humans. Manufacturers will tell you the canine digestive system has changed over time to be able to derive benefit from grain, but processed dog food came into existence 153 years ago and has been popular only since the end of World War II. Palaeontologists believe it takes, on average, 100,000 years for a species to adapt to a new diet. Dogs have five types of teeth, but none suitable for grinding food. Humans have digestive enzymes in our saliva and we need to chew our food before we swallow it to give those enzymes a chance to start breaking down the food. Dogs can’t chew this way because they are unable to move their jaws from side to side. All their digestive processes take place in their stomachs. 'Mulch': Dried dog food has to be coated in fat so that animals will eat it . You may think your dog gulps his or her food because they are greedy, but they are just trying to get it to where all the digestive action occurs as fast as possible. If you believe TV commercials, advertisements and labels, processed food is the only safe thing to feed a dog. It contains nothing but ‘natural goodness’, has been ‘scientifically formulated’ and is endorsed by experts. But a good way to understand the dog food industry is to study its history. Modern dog food was invented by James Spratt, who launched the first complete dog food - a biscuit made of wheat meal, vegetables and animal blood - in England in 1860. Mill owners saw its potential as a way of selling their unwanted by-products (basically floor sweepings) and low-cost meat off-cuts at a much higher price than they’d otherwise achieve. From day one, dog food producers made extravagant claims for their products and paid vets for endorsements. Little has changed in more than 150 years. There is considerable British and European legislation controlling the manufacture of dog food, but this quote, taken from the guidance given to pet food manufacturers, demonstrates how little the government cares about the dogs themselves: ‘For pets, the main part of the risk assessment when setting maximum permitted levels for undesirable substances will generally be the extent to which the animal can tolerate them.’ In other words, it is legal to use ‘undesirable substances’ in dog food if they don’t do the animal immediate harm. Another disturbing quote from the same guide refers to: ‘The material of animal origin used by the pet food industry comprises those parts of animals which are either deemed surplus to human consumption or are not normally consumed by people in the UK.’ This lets manufacturers make their food from by-products such as hooves, tails, testicles, ears and so on. Wolfish: Dogs' digestive systems are closely related to those of grey wolves, and they benefit most from a similar diet, including raw meat . Natural diet: Oily fish such as sardines, left, can help improve dogs' health, as can cheese, right . The manufacturing process itself is stomach-churning. Take kibble or dry dog food. The ingredients (mostly corn and ground meat) are heated to a very high temperature and turned into a sort of grey mulch. It tastes so foul it has to be sprayed with fat to make it palatable to dogs. Dogs eating a natural, raw food diet can be expected to live longer and suffer less illness and disease. Such a diet would include meaty bones, lean muscle meat and internal organs from chicken, lamb, beef, rabbit and pork; eggs; cheese, cottage cheese, yoghurt, milk and butter; and fatty fish such as herring, salmon and sardines. Also, plants and root vegetables such as spinach, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and parsnips. Fresh and dried fruits - but not grapes - are also excellent components of a raw diet. Raw food: Eating vegetables such as cauliflower and parsnips can also boost canine health . Feeding your dog this way will also help with behavioural issues. Processed food (dried, tinned or in a pouch) can make a dog hyperactive, lethargic and irritable. Dogs on a natural diet are calmer, more attentive, easier to train and generally better behaved. They suffer less disease, live longer, smell nicer and produce less waste matter. I gave my own dog, Honey, processed food until five years ago, when an enlightened vet told me I was shortening her life and explained what she should eat. After switching her to a natural diet I was so amazed by the difference in her health I started doing it for friends’ dogs. Now the company I named after her, Honey’s, feeds 3,000 dogs a month. Today, I would no more feed her processed food than I would let my children have junk food and fizzy drinks for breakfast, lunch and dinner.","Canine nutrition expert says big business sells food unfit for dogs to eat .

The North Korean workers were given soup and snacks to sustain them throughout the day - and received the Choco-Pies in their lunchboxes. The South Korean companies were also banned from paying their North Korean employees cash bonuses and instead rewarded them with food products, including the chocolate biscuits. It soon became obvious to factory owners that the workers were not all eating the treats at work, and many had taken them home to their families.

"They were two moments that clearly meant a great deal. After Eljero Elia fired Southampton into a 14th-minute lead at Newcastle United on Saturday night, be made a beeline for Ronald Koeman and gave his new boss a warm embrace. And after scoring the deflected goal that earned the Saints all three points at St James' Park, he leaped joyously into the air, spun and did that Cristiano Ronaldo thing of flexing his muscles. This was the measure of a man grateful for another opportunity to prove his talents, grateful for a change of scenery, a fresh challenge and a little bit of faith shown in his undoubted abilities.

Holland (27 appearances, 2 goals) Elia, a 27-year-old Dutch winger, certainly comes with a bit of a chequered past and a bad-boy reputation. Werder Bremen, the Bundesliga club who loaned him to Southampton this month, were glad to see the back of him. But his double at Newcastle, which returned Southampton to third place in the Premier League, suggests that all this trouble could be behind him. Elia was certainly very humble in his post-match interview: 'I want to thank first my team-mates and trainer and chairman. They have trusted me, they gave me the chance to play for Southampton. 'The feeling for the first goal was like a dream come true. The second was like i don't feel nothing in my body. I was so happy.' When asked why he ran straight for Koeman after his firm, low first-half strike found its way under the body of goalkeeper Tim Krul, he replied: 'I wanted to thank him that he gave me the chance to play for Southampton. 'He was the only one that believed in me. The players have helped me from the first moment. The captain (Jose Fonte) speaks a lot with me. I'm so happy.' Elia certainly looked chuffed and a new chapter in his life and career has been started. His story began at local side ADO Den Haag, whom he joined as a nine-year-old and made his professional debut for in 2004 at the age of 17. Elia playing for his first club, ADO Den Haag, as a teenager back in 2006 . Elia in action for Den Haag during an Eredivisie fixture with Sparta Rotterdam back in 2006 . Quickly establishing himself in the first team, Elia scored six times in 59 appearances for them before friction between himself and new coach Lex Schoenmaker pushed him to the exit door. There was talk Ajax wanted to sign him but the Amsterdam side wanted to loan him straight back to Den Haag, by then a second division side, and back into conflict with Schoenmaker. He joined Twente instead and found some of his best from under Steve McClaren, scoring 15 times in 73 outings for the club in his two seasons there. While at Twente, Elia was given his first taste of Champions League and Europa League football and became a fixture in the Holland Under 21 team. Named the Dutch Football Talent of the Year in 2009, there were again suggestions Ajax and PSV Eindhoven were interested in signing him but his next move would take him over the border to Germany. Again, it wasn't without controversy. Amid all the speculation of a move to one of Holland's big clubs, Elia signed a two-year contract extension at Twente. Two months later, he announced he wanted to leave at the end of the season.

It was alleged that the pair had insulted and acted agressivley towards the police officer. 2014 - Tweets 'Ready for War' ahead of Werder Bremen vs Hamburg clash before insulting a fan of his own team via Facebook. Hamburg paid Twente £6.5m for his services but very little went to plan. He suffered an ankle injury in late November of his first season and missed the rest of the campaign. In March, a poorly-applied tattoo went septic and the discomfort was so severe, Elia was unable to wear his playing and training kit. His second season at Hamburg saw Elia becoming increasingly allergic to the club - he moaned that the playing style didn't suit him, he was rotated in and out of the team and he claimed Hamburg didn't look after him while he was recuperating from surgery on his injured ankle. It came as little surprise, then, to see Elia sold off to Italian giants Juventus in a £7m deal in August 2011. Despite being a Holland international, he played infrequently and though he collected a Serie A winners' medal he contributed little towards it. One of Elia's few appearances for Juventus came in a commemorative friendly against Notts County . He spent just one season with the Italian giants, appearing in just five matches and failing to score . Elia playing for Holland during a 2010 World Cup warm-up match against Hungary . Being introduced to the media as Werder Bremen's new No 11 after signing from Juventus in 2012 . Inevitably, the restless Elia grew impatient and left Turin for Werder Bremen in an attempt to again revitalise his career. The Bundesliga side, great rivals of his former club Hamburg, paid £4.5m and offered a £2m salary. He was billed as the man to fire Bremen back into European competition. In reality, they spent two and a half years battling relegation while Elia kept putting his foot in it. In April 2013, Elia and team-mate Marko Arnautovic, now at Stoke, were caught speeding at 3am. It was later alleged that the two players had acted aggressively when stopped and insulted a police officer. Their punishment was to spend the rest of the season training in isolation but while Arnautovic moved to Stoke, Elia decided to stay. After failing to find the net during his first season in Bremen, there was an improvement last season, with four goals in 33 appearances. But Elia was still proving a nuisance off the field. Before the Nordderby against former club Hamburg, he tweeeted the words 'Ready for War', a sentiment that unsurprisingly doesn't go down too well in Germany. He later insulted a Bremen fan on Facebook, telling them to 'go f*** youself.' By that time, Bremen were sick of the sight of him and looking to farm him out on loan. Southampton were willing to take the gamble, with the option of signing him permanently at the end of the season. Right now, that is looking like a distinct possibility as Elia strives to put a turbulent past behind him.

"Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has strongly criticized President Obama's passion for the nation's military - contrasting his attitude strongly with that of his predecessor President George W. Bush. In his forthcoming memoir 'Duty', Gates claims that he never once saw Obama become emotional during a Medal Of Honor ceremony - claiming that his coldness was in stark contrast with Bush, who would regularly 'well up'. Declaring himself to be 'disturbed' by this 'absence of passion', Gates goes onto say that the only time he saw his commander-in-chief become animated during his time in the administration was during Obama's push to repeal 'don't ask, don't tell.' Cold: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that he found President Obama cold and passionless at Medal of Honor ceremony's Robert Gates claimed that he regularly saw President George W. Bush well up and become emotional at similar ceremonies . 'One quality I missed in Obama was passion, especially when it came to the two wars,' Gates wrote. 'In my presence, Bush -- very unlike his father -- was pretty unsentimental. But he was passionate about the war in Iraq; on occasion, at a Medal of Honor ceremony or the like, I would see his eyes well up. 'I worked for Obama longer than Bush, and I never saw his eyes well up.' In his opinion, Obama was most concerned with getting rid of the United States' military policy barring openly gay soldiers from serving - and with his Affordable Care Act. Gates wrote that 'the only military matter, apart from leaks, about which I ever sensed deep passion on his part was 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' 'For him, changing the law seemed to be the inevitable next step in the civil rights movement. He presumably was also passionate about health care reform, but I wasn't present for those discussions.'

U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates (R) at Gate's farewell ceremony at the Pentagon near Washington, June 30, 2011 . Responding to the criticism from Gates' book, former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs vigorously defended the president and said that, 'I think one of the things you take away, at least from the excerpts of this book, is that Bob Gates doesn't like any questions about Bob Gates,' Gibbs said on NBC's Meet the Press. John McCain called former Defense Secretary Robert Gates 'obviously very frustrated' and criticized the release of Gates' new book as part of a series of remarks on foreign policy on Sunday. He also suggested retired general David Petraeus return to Iraq to deal with growing violence there. McCain (R-AZ) made the remarks as part of an interview with Candy Crowley on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday. McCain said that if he were Gates, he would have waited to release the book, 'Duty: Memoirs of Secretary at War,' which is said to include sharp criticism of President Obama's handling of the war in Afghanistan. Sen. John McCain, seen in this file photo, said he thought former Defense Secretary was 'obviously very frustrated' and 'let loose' with the release of his new memoir . Gates, seen here on the cover of his new book 'Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary of War,' reportedly accuses President Barack Obama of showing too little enthusiasm for the U.S. war mission in Afghanistan in the work . 'I think, frankly, I might've -- if I had given him advice -- I would've waited,' McCain said. 'As far as waiting until it's over in Afghanistan, I wouldn't have done that. But maybe [in] retrospect, a little longer than now.' 'He's obviously very frustrated and felt -- which by the way surprised all of us who know him -- and he's decided to really kind of let loose.' McCain however, described Gates as 'one of the finest public servants I have known.' The senator also seemed to praise the skills of Petraeus and former ambassador Ryan Crocker. 'I would suggest perhaps sending David Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker back over [to Iraq],' McCain said to CNN anchor Candy Crowley. '(Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri) Al-Maliki trusts them.' Petraeus also served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his 2012 resignation, after news of his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell became public. Crocker served as the US ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, as well as ambassador to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012. He retired in 2012 due to unknown health reasons, NPR reported at the time. McCain also said he believed Iraq 'is not a lost cause' and that the United States may be able to offer logistical support. McCain also said he would 'suggest' retired general David Petraeus return to Iraq .","In his new memoir 'Duty' former Defense Secretary claims to have found President Obama's 'absence of passion' for military matters a cause for concern .

"Fresh air: The new device can dramatically reduce a sufferers symptoms during the day . A machine that cleans the air while asthma sufferers sleep can dramatically reduce their symptoms during the day, a study claims. Those who tested the device reported a huge improvement in their quality of life – equivalent to that normally achieved only through expensive drugs – and were less likely to be admitted to hospital. The machine filters out the  irritants and allergens that trigger inflammation in the lungs, including dust mites and pet hairs. Asthma specialists are now calling for the air purification device to be made available on the NHS. They say the annual cost – £4,000 – would pay for itself, as sufferers would spend less time in hospital. Professor . John Warner, a consultant paediatrician at St Mary’s  Hospital and . professor of paediatrics at Imperial College London, led the study. He . said: ‘This device makes a  significant difference to people’s lives, . with an effect as big as  very expensive treatments, and it helps . prevent the triggers of the disease.’ The year-long trial involved 282 people . with poorly controlled asthma aged from seven to 70 from six European . countries, including 54 British children. The Protexo machine is . placed next to the sufferer’s bed, and has a large arm which delivers a . flow of pure, filtered air around their head while they sleep. It clears allergens and dust particles with a new technology used in operating theatres to create sterile environments. Two-thirds of patients had the real machine and the remainder had a dummy machine. They switched it on when they went to sleep and turned it off when they woke. Findings from the trial, published in the journal Thorax, showed that the quality of life for those who used the real machine was 15 per cent better than those given the dummy, based on questionnaire scores. The patients who used the device, made by Swedish firm Airsonett, experienced a dramatic fall in levels of inflammation. It was particularly noticeable  for those with the most severe asthma.Professor Warner said there were fewer hospital admissions among the group using Protexo. The benefits began to show within three to four months. Annabelle Abrahams, 14, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, who has had asthma since she was four, took part in the trial. She said: ‘I slept badly because I couldn’t breathe, doing PE or running around with my friends was difficult and I had asthma attacks if I laughed too much. ‘My schoolwork suffered because I was tired and off sick a lot.’ With the help of the machine, Annabelle now sleeps through the night without coughing. ‘I’ve seen a dramatic change and real improvement in my asthma,’ she said. ‘I sleep better, have  fewer chest infections and enjoy PE and sport.’ The machine, which is not yet available for private purchase, costs around £2,000 for six months’ use.","Participants in a trial reported a huge improvement in their .

"Like any kitten, Ralphee is affectionate, playful and mischievous. But it doesn’t take long to spot that she is different from other cats and is unsteady on her feet because of an unusual neurological condition which is colloquially known as ‘wobbly cat syndrome’. The tabby can be seen waggling her head and sometimes jumping around uncontrollably, but is happy in the company of a protective cattle dog called Max. Scroll down for video . Feline unstable: Ralphee the pretty tabby cat (pictured) can be seen waggling her head and sometimes jumping around uncontrollably because a neurological disorder colloquially known as 'wobbly cat syndrome' but is happy in the company of a cattle dog called Max (pictured right) The disorder is caused when a pregnant cat contracts feline distemper – a highly contagious and potential fatal vial disease. It can result in cerebellum damage to unborn kittens as the virus passes from the mother cat to foetuses in her womb. The earlier the mother cat contracts the disease in her pregnancy, the less likely the kittens are to survive – or the more serious their Feline CH will be. Nature’s natural enemies immediately became friends when Ralphee was rescued from a barn at a horse stable and came to live with the dog in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The kitten has a neurological disorder called feline cerebellar hypoplasia (CH), which causes her to walk in an unusual way and wobble her head. Some kittens are born with CH when their cerebellum – the part of the brain that controls coordination and fine motor skills – is underdeveloped. The disorder develops inside the womb when a pregnant mother cat contracts feline distemper, which is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease. Symptoms of the feline CH include: falling over for no apparent reason, a prancing, or high stepping walk and a general lack of balance, which can make it difficult for them to climb stairs. Kitten's best friend: Ralphee has a neurological disorder called feline cerebellar hypoplasia (CH), which causes her to walk in an unusual way and wobble her head, but Max the dog watches over her . While Ralphee’s owner says she is happy, loves affection and causes trouble wherever she goes, Max the dog is protective over his feline friend. ‘Ever since Ralphee was brought home, Max is never far away. He appears to be forever curious and watches over Ralphee wherever she goes,’ according to the Wakaleo YouTube channel. ‘Ralphee is growing more mischievous by the day and loves to see what Max is doing as well. She will often get excited when he is nearby and leap in the air before playfully charging in his direction.’ Symptoms of the disorder include: falling over for no apparent reason, a prancing, or high stepping walk and a general lack of balance, which can make it difficult for cats like Ralphee (pictured) to climb stairs. Cats with the syndrome usually form close bonds with humans and animal companions like Max (also pictured) Ralphee's owner says she is happy, loves affection and causes trouble wherever she goes, Max the dog is protective over his feline friend . While some people might be worried that animals with the condition are in pain - because they can appear to be walking gingerly and jerk around – they are not and their life expectancy is the same as an average cat’s, according to the CH Cat Community. The cats also have normal levels of intelligence, although they are often more dependent on humans and other animals, like Max, with whom they build strong bonds. The condition is non-progressive and some owners of cats with CH have said it appears to improve as they get older, because the cats learn to deal with symptoms over time. The photographer who filmed Ralphee told MailOnline that she does everything a normal cat does with a few minor differences. 'She has a room that has blankets and anything pointy or hard softened with pillows so when she stumbles out of her bed she is surrounded by soft items to keep her safe. This is more a precaution than anything.' Kittens with 'wobbly cat syndrome' have normal levels of intelligence, although they are often more dependent on humans and other animals, like Max (pictured), with whom they build strong bonds . Mealtimes can be messy but the kitten manages better if her food is elevated. She is allowed to play outside if she is supervised by Max. 'There is a definite connection between Max and Ralphee. Max seems bothered when Ralphee wanders too far and will often remain at her side wherever she goes. 'I think he may be aware that Ralphee is different as he seems to look much like a concerned father observing his kids as they play in the pool. It's quite surreal. 'Ralphee, will sometimes chase Max and give him a playful swipe and play tough before giving him a nuzzle or rubbing along his legs. Max seems happy to entertain this behaviour,' he said. While the kitten loves to pounce on leaves and enjoys chasing nuts around, her favourite playmate is Max, who doesn't seem to tire of her antics. 'People often feel sorry for cats with disabilities but for Ralphee and many others they seem to get along without even realising they are any different,' he said.","Ralphee the kitten has a neurological disorder called feline cerebellar hypoplasia (CH), which causes her to walk in an unusual way .

Emma Watson attended the launch of the UN Women HeForShe campaign in New York on Saturday . At the United Nations headquarters, she revealed the sexism she has experienced throughout her life, saying it started at the age of eight when she was branded 'bossy' for wanting to direct school plays. She continued: 'At 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn't want to appear 'muscly'...at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings.' Miss Watson, who played the witch Hermione in the Harry Potter films, is the latest celebrity to take on a role with the UN, following stars such as George Clooney and Angelina Jolie.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will activate an online map to track the progress of countries in promoting equality of the sexes. 'Our main goal is to increase the involvement of men and boys in the struggle to achieve gender equality,' said head of UN Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka. 'It cannot be that women will do this alone,' she said. 'It remains an important women's issue that requires the whole of society, men and women, to be involved.' Mlambo Ngcuka, who announced the 'HeForShe' campaign in March, called on the world's fathers, sons, husbands and brothers to stand up and support equality for women in all areas of life. The Inter-Parliamentary Union says less that 22 percent of parliamentarians are women. There are also still 100 countries with laws that prevent women's meaningful involvement in the economy, Mlambo Ngcuka said. She said projections indicate that if things don't change it will take 95 years to achieve gender equality, and by 2020 and some 140,000 girls will be forced into child marriage. UN Women said supporters of the HeForShe campaign include actors Matt Damon, Patrick Stewart, Antonio Banderas and Kiefer Sutherland, and South African Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

"Teenage girls are risking their lives using counterfeit abortion pills bought online for as little as 78p each because they are too terrified to tell their parents they are pregnant, experts warn. The drugs, which have labelled 'modern-day back street abortions', are easily available from hundreds of pharmacy sites, but they can be fatal if taken in wrong doses. Most of the drugs come from India where legal loopholes mean domestic firms are allowed to produce generic versions of branded medicines. Desperation: Teenage girls are turning to  counterfeit abortion pills bought online, because they are too terrified to tell their parents they are pregnant . However some are now understood to be imported from China where they are produced by criminal gangs with no regulation or quality control, the Daily Mirror reports. Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: 'It is extremely troubling if any woman feels her only course of action is to buy this medication online to end her pregnancy. 'With the appalling exception of Northern Ireland, abortion in the UK is safe, free, and confidential for women, including teenagers, up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. 'The biggest risk when you buy online is that you don't know what you are getting, nor what doses are needed for it to work. While medical abortion is safe, this is not something women should have to go through without clinical advice and support in place. Side-effects of taking the tablets include excessive bleeding, infections of the womb and, in rare cases, blood poisoning. Women who have this type of abortion are twice as likely to need hospital treatment as those who have the procedure done surgically. Up to 1.5 per cent are admitted to hospital suffering from complications, compared with 0.6 per cent who have surgery. Around 1 per cent develop pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the womb which can cause infertility. And in some cases women have lost so much blood they have needed a transfusion. Most suffer pain or cramps in the abdomen. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are also common. There have been two known deaths caused by early medical abortion tablets since they were first offered in Britain in 1991 . 'Women should know that they can access free abortion services often without seeing their GP, and we would urge any woman considering this to contact us in total confidence for help. 'But there is a lesson for all of us here - it illustrates that any attempts to further restrict the already heavily regulated area of abortion will simply lead to women taking their health into their own hands. Online pills will be the backstreet abortions of the 21st Century.' The pills allow women to terminate their pregnancies quickly and quietly in their own home rather than having to make several trips to a clinic, which may involve taking time off work or school. They are far cheaper than having the treatment privately, which can cost up to £500. Women who have this type of abortion are twice as likely to need hospital treatment as those who have the procedure done surgically. Side-effects from taking the tablets include excessive bleeding, infections of the womb and, in rare cases, blood poisoning. A Mail investigation in 2011 was able to but pills online easily from aLondon-based online pharmacy for £15. But since then the price appears to have plummeted. Dr Kate Guthrie of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said: ‘There is still a social prejudice about abortions. ‘Women may turn to these websites because they are embarrassed or they are just so appalled by their pregnancy. 'They might be reluctant to see their GP in case they think badly of them. They are effectively backstreet abortions.’","Girls using online drugs because they are too terrified to tell parents .

"A potent painkiller made from the poison of jungle frogs is believed to have entered the food chain in contaminated horse meat, it has today been revealed. The drug - dermorphin - is used to drug racehorses, enabling them to run while they are badly injured. It is believed that the 'tree frog juice' has found its way on to the market via American horse meat, the Humane Society International has warned, despite a ban on the use of medicines in animals which will be sold for meat. A painkiller made from the poison of jungle frogs is believed to have entered the food chain in contaminated horse meat . The animal . welfare organisation has linked with its American partners and called for a ban on the sale of horse meat from across the North Atlantic, the Sunday Express reports. It . said there was 'no doubt that substantial numbers' of American . horses sold to Europe had been given veterinary drugs, despite the fact there is a lifetime ban on substances for food . animals under EU rules. Holly . Hazard, of The Humane Society Of The United States, told the paper there was 'virtually no horse' racing in America which had escaped a prescription for pain-masking drugs. She said: 'In . addition, there is no way to track illegal substances such as . dermorphin, routinely used by unscrupulous horse trainers to enhance . performance, because laboratories wouldn’t even know to test for these . drugs.

Sodexo said products were being recalled with 'immediate effect' but would not confirm which of its sites had been supplied with the frozen products.

They added the firm do supply the club with frozen products but they hold 'Red Tractor' assurance.Sodexo Prestige runs catering for the Blues including all the hospitality for match days but do not supply the training ground. The company said: 'Sodexo has had a pro-active programme in place to ensure that there is no horse meat in its supply chain. 'We demanded written assurances from across our supply chain that the products we purchase did not contain horse meat, and additionally implemented an internal sampling programme. 'Despite repeated guarantees from our suppliers, our sampling has identified frozen beef products which tested positive for equine DNA. This situation is totally unacceptable. Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh said 'thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of people' have eaten horse meat over at least several months .

Children brought up only by a single mother have a higher risk of developing ‘deviant behaviour’, including drug abuse, new research suggests. It is also feared that growing up in a fatherless household could have a greater impact on daughters than on sons. More than one million children in the UK currently have no contact with their father while they are growing up, a figure that is growing by 20,000 a year . More than 1million children in the UK currently have no contact with their father while they are growing up, a figure that is growing by 20,000 a year. Dr Gabriella Gobbi, who carried out the research with colleagues at the medical faculty at McGill University in Canada, said: ‘This is the first time research findings have shown that paternal deprivation during development affects the neurobiology of the offspring.’ The research, which was carried out on mice, compared the social behaviour and brain anatomy of youngsters with two parents to those growing up with mothers alone. The team said the findings had direct relevance to human society. They used California mice, which, like humans, are monogamous and raise their offspring together. Francis Bambico, of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, who also worked on the project, said: ‘Because we can control their environment, we can equalise factors that differ between them. Children brought up only by a single mother have a higher risk of developing 'deviant behaviour', including drug abuse (pictured) new research suggests. Previous studies have said girls in particular have been shown to be at risk for substance abuse . ‘Mice studies in the laboratory may therefore be clearer to interpret than human ones, where it is impossible to control all the influences during development.’ The brains of the fatherless mice developed differently, Dr Gobbi said, with the main impacts seen in the prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain which controls social and cognitive activity. The study, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, found that those mice raised without a father displayed signs of ‘abnormal social interactions’ and were far more aggressive than mice raised with both parents. The difference was far more pronounced in daughters than in sons and females raised without fathers also had a greater sensitivity to the stimulant drug amphetamine. Growing up without a father could permanently alter the structure of the brain and produce children who are more aggressive and angry, scientists said . Dr Gobbi said: ‘The behavioural deficits we observed are consistent with human studies of children raised without a father. ‘These children have been shown to have an increased risk for deviant behaviour and in particular, girls have been shown to be at risk for substance abuse. ‘This suggests that these mice are a good model for understanding how these effects arise in humans.’ The report said the behaviour of the mice was ‘consistent with studies in children raised without a father, highlighting an increased risk for deviant behaviour and criminal activity, substance abuse, impoverished educational performance and mental illness’. It added: ‘Our results emphasise the importance of the father during critical neurodevelopmental periods, and that father absence induces impairments in social behaviour that persist to adulthood.’ Dr Gobbi said the results suggested both parents are vital for children’s mental health development and hoped the findings would spur researchers to look more deeply into the role of fathers. A separate report by the Centre for Social Justice, published in June this year, found that more than 1million British children currently live without a father and have no adult male role model, a figure that is rising by 20,000 a year. Some of the poorest parts of the country are becoming ‘men deserts’, the report found, because there are so few visible male role models for children.In the Manor Castle ward of Sheffield 75 per cent of households are headed by a single parent, most commonly a woman.","Canadian scientists believe growing up in a fatherless household could have a greater impact on daughters than on sons .

"Four murderers and a drug dealer are in line for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment so that they can father a child from behind bars. The killers are demanding to be allowed to take part in IVF treatment despite serving life sentences.

Turning down the prisoners’ demands could lead to court action and compensation claims running into tens of thousands of pounds. Killers are demanding to be allowed to take part in IVF treatment despite serving life sentences . Ministers may be powerless to refuse because of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights concerning the right to a private and family life . The cases will provoke outrage at the rights afforded to individuals who have committed shocking crimes, and spur demands for action against the power of European human rights judges, who are also demanding an end to the ban on prisoners voting. Last year the Daily Mail revealed that a prisoner had been given access to artificial insemination treatment on the NHS at a cost of around £2,000. Since then, 13 applications have been made by inmates in England and Wales. Eight have been rejected but five remain in ministers’ in-trays. The names and details of the inmates are protected by privacy laws, but three were convicted of murder, one of murder and aggravated burglary and the fifth of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. Last year the Daily Mail revealed that a prisoner had been given access to artificial insemination treatment on the NHS at a cost of around £2,000 . Last night Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who has said he wants to ‘curtail’ the powers of the Strasbourg court, said: ‘There can be no clearer example of why we need changes to the human rights framework. ‘The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has extended its remit into areas which have little to do with real human rights issues and I intend to bring forward proposals about how we change that.’ Andrew Percy, Tory MP for Brigg and Goole, said: ‘When you commit a crime such as murder you should lose your rights and liberties.’ The doors were opened to a flood of new applications by a 2007 Strasbourg ruling in the case of a convicted killer, Kirk Dickson. Dickson and a friend kicked to death a 41-year-old man in 1995 and he was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years. He met his wife Lorraine through a prison pen pal scheme while she was serving 12 months for a £20,000 benefit fraud. They married in 2000 after her release but while he was still behind bars. In 2001 David Blunkett rejected the couple’s application to authorise her access to  sperm donation from him for IVF treatment. With at least £20,000 in legal aid, they took the case to the High Court and the Court of Appeal but were rejected at every turn. In 2007 the case went to Strasbourg, when Dickson was 35 and his wife 49. Ministers fought the case, arguing that losing the opportunity to have children was an inevitable result of being jailed. But the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Dicksons’ rights had been breached and handed them £18,000 in damages.","Ministers may be powerless to stop demands for treatment because of a ruling by European Court of Human Rights .

"Thousands of Iraqi women are being forced into sex slavery in brothels run by a 'police force' of British women jihadis, it has been reported.

The . think tank MEMRI (the Middle East Media Research Institution) released a . report saying that IS had taken many Yazidi women to be sold and used . as sex slaves. The . al-Khanssaa brigade is a female-only militia set up by the Islamic State . in Raqqa, Syria, with a key figure believed to be Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of . Glasgow, who fled to the country last year. Academics . at King's College London have identified three other British females as . members of the group - and say there are about 60 UK women who have . gone to Syria on jihad. Most . of these women - including privately-educated Mahmood - are aged . between 18 and 24, with al-Khanssaa said to be seeking out people . engaging in Western culture in Raqqa.

Smith, a research associate at King's College's International Centre . for the Study of Radicalisation, told journalists Robert Mendick and . Robert Verkaik of The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Al-Khanssaa is a sharia law police brigade. This is Isis’s female law enforcement.

"These stunning lunar wildlife shots are sure to eclipse all others. They show a range of creatures juxtaposed against a beautiful night sky and, remarkably, they were created without any editing software. Mario Cea Sanchez, 43, was over the moon with the results after spending several months waiting for the perfect conditions for each picture. Slime me to the moon: A snail peers up at Earth's natural satellite, or at least appears to do so in these cleverly shot montage pictures which used no photo-editing software and instead rely on a single long exposure . Moon worship: A conehead mantis appears to be gearing up to take on the moon in a fight. Mario Cea Sanchez cleverly used natural light to shoot the moon and artificial lighting to capture the image of the animal . To create the remarkable images Mr Sanchez, from Salamanca, Spain, used a special technique involving two lenses and one camera body. He set a long exposure while pointing . his camera at the moon before removing the first lens and replacing it . with a second to take a picture of the animal - all without stopping the . exposure. Mr Sanchez cleverly used natural lighting to shoot the moon and artificial lighting to capture the image of the animal. Nocturnal: A wood mouse sits in what appears to be a window frame. Mr Sanchez used nocturnal animals for the series and studied their habits . 'On the internet you can find many similar pictures but they are made by computer programs,' he told Caters News. 'My challenge was to get capture in one shoot the moon and the animal without using any type of software. 'I have always had a fascination with the moon and I wanted to include it in my images of wildlife. 'This type of photography is really very difficult because there are so many factors to consider. The most important thing is to make sure all the conditions are optimal. 'You need to consider the position of the animal, the phase of the moon, the weather conditions and the lighting. 'I had to wait until the moon was at the desired phase and I also had to wait for a clear night so I could get a sharp image.' Mr Sanchez used wild animals for the . shots after studying the creatures closely to get an idea of their . movements. But the musician admitted the project took a lot of patience. 'I chose these particular animals because they all have nocturnal habits and live under the moonlight,' he said. 'The animals pictured are completely wild. They live in different habitats including woods, lakes, mountains. 'After . watching them for many years you start to learn how they behave which . makes it easier to get images, although sessions are still often . unsuccessful. What shall we do tonight Brain? Two wood mice appear to plot world domination under the moonlight . What a hoot! A little owl peers back into the lens against a background of a fantastically golden moon . 'In general the patience is the best trait of a wildlife photographer. 'You have to spend a lot of time in the countryside waiting for the right conditions to get images like these.

"A Russian ice hockey star has been dropped from away games for the next three weeks after his Yorkshire terrier ate his travel documents. Anatoly Golyshev, who plays for Russian Premier league club Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg, had left the paperwork including his passport at home when he left the house. The 19-year-old had not taken his dog with him and it is believed the animal vented its frustration  by eating the documents. Ruff justice: Russian ice hockey player Anatoly Golyshev has been dropped by his club Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg for three weeks after his dog ate his passport . He said: 'When I got home, I saw that the dog was chewing on something. 'I couldn't believe it when I realised it was my passport that he was gnawing and he had already taken a big chunk out of it.' The club plays in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), an international professional ice hockey league founded in 2008 which has member clubs based in Belarus, Croatia, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Russia, and Slovakia. As a result, there are a lot of away games for the team. Until new paperwork can be organised, Golyshev has to stay at home in the Russian city of Sverdlovsk Oblast. What a terrier: Golyshev posted this picture of his mauled passport as the culprit looks on in the background . The press officer for the club, Alexey Galanov, confirmed they had done everything they could to get new documents, but that so far it was looking like it would take about three weeks to get the paperwork back. After that, he said, the player would be able to continue his career as usual. He is an important player for his team in the national league as he has scored 13 times in last 26 matches.

The defensive crisis meant left-back Nacho Monreal filled in alongside Per Mertesacker at centre-back, while rookie right-back Hector Bellerin made his first league start for the club. But when asked whether his side’s lack of defensive options cost his side, Wenger said: ‘Look at the two goals and tell me what you think? They had two shots in the game. ‘It was a disappointing afternoon. Their second goal was our fault, we came out after half-time without the defensive concentration.’ Hull manager Steve Bruce had his own problems. He was forced into a change prior to kick-off, Abel Hernandez replacing striker Nikica Jelavic, who picked up a knee injury during the warm-up. Despite their injury problems, Arsenal could have been three-up inside the opening 10 minutes, Jack Wilshere, Welbeck and Santi Cazorla all going close. The breakthrough came in the 13th minute and it was a touch of wizardry from Sanchez that unlocked the door, as his powerful shot beat Steve Harper after he had skipped beyond Curtis Davies. It should have been the signal for a Saturday afternoon stroll but Momo Diame then ripped though the heart of Arsenal’s rearguard as Hull grabbed an unlikely leveller just four minutes later. Picking up the ball in a similar spot to where Sanchez had started his run, Diame powered through before delicately chipping over goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Mathieu Flamini was fuming. He was adamant Diame had pulled him back in the build up. Looking at the replays, he was probably right, while Wenger and Bruce both said afterwards that Diame had fouled the midfielder.

Aaron Ramsey was a surprise substitute despite not taken part in full training after a hamstring problem . Former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas scored a fine goal for Chelsea against Crystal Palace . The goal took the wind out of Arsenal’s sails but the injury problems kept coming for Bruce, as third-choice keeper Eldin Jakupovic replaced Harper, who suffered a torn bicep in the 42nd minute. But those problems seemed a world away when Hernandez handed the visitors a shock lead quickly after the restart, as the Uruguayan rose above Mertesacker to head home Tom Huddlestone’s cross. Wenger’s desperation was illustrated with 27 minutes left, as he brought on Aaron Ramsey — the man who scored the winner against Hull at Wembley last season in the FA Cup final. Prior to kick-off, Wenger insisted Ramsey was not fit enough to be involved having only just recovered from a hamstring injury. But with his side needing a spark, Wenger played his trump card. However, as the Gunners welcomed one midfielder back, they lost another as Wilshere limped off with an ankle injury, though Wenger confirmed he would be fit for Wednesday’s Champions League clash against Anderlecht. The urgency in Arsenal’s game grew with Ramsey’s introduction. Cazorla was denied by some frantic last-ditch defending, before Michael Dawson stopped Sanchez with a heroic block in the 85th minute. It proved the former Tottenham defender’s final contribution as he limped off with an ankle problem to add to Hull’s injury woes. Jakupovic then came to his side’s rescue, tipping over Sanchez’s header from Monreal’s cross but, in the first of six minutes of injury time, Arsenal snatched an equaliser. Sanchez was again at the centre of it, showing brilliant skill to beat three Hull defenders before playing in Welbeck, who excellently finished past Jakupovic.

"Murderer: Marc Dutroux, seen being escorted by police officers at Brussels' Palace of Justice today, is seeking early release from prison . The notorious paedophile and serial killer Marc Dutroux could be freed from jail just nine years after being jailed for life for a series of child murders which shocked his native Belgium and the rest of the world.Dutroux, 57, kidnapped young girls and imprisoned them in tiny dungeons beneath his home before raping them and killing them in the 1990s. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2004.But today the reviled killer appeared before a court in Brussels seeking to be released early and placed under house arrest with an electronic tag. Shortly after his arrest in 1996 two teenage girls were found alive in one of the specially constructed cells which Dutroux had built.    His accomplice ex-wife Michelle Martin, 53, who left two other girls to starve to death whilst her husband was in custody, was jailed for 30 years for crimes including abduction in 2004.She was released last year despite angry protests in Belgium. She is now living with nuns in Malonne, where hundreds of furious villagers staged a mass demonstration upon her arrival at the convent to embark upon a period of ten years 'at prayer'. Now under Belgian law Dutroux could also be freed, as he will have served one third of his minimum sentence when his years spent in custody are taken into account. His legal request to be released was heard by a judge in a closed hearing at the Palace of Justice in Brussels today, where protestors gathered brandishing signs emblazoned with the slogan: 'Dutroux should stay in jail'. The courthouse was sealed off by police officers for the duration of the controversial hearing. A ruling on the request is not expected before February 18. The families of three of the young victims are due to lodge a formal complaint  against the request via the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Scroll down for video . Storm of controversy: Journalists are seen gathering at the court in Brussels where the notorious murderer was appearing to request that he be released and placed under house arrest with an electronic tag . They fear that if Dutroux is released he will commit further crimes or attempt to leave the country.

"Four years after his retirement, Brazil legend Ronaldo has revealed he will return to the pitch with American club Fort Lauderdale Strikers. The 38-year-old who enjoyed a storied career with some of the biggest clubs in world football, including Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, is a major shareholder in the North American Soccer League (NASL), which is widely viewed as the USA's second tier below the MLS; however, there is no promotion or relegation system over there. 'It's going to happen,' Ronaldo told Lance! magazine, 'I have already said so. But it's going to be a bit later, in the play-offs.' Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer has announced that he will return to football with Fort Lauderdale Strikers . During an exceptional career, Ronaldo turned out for some of the world's biggest clubs, including Real Madrid . The two-time World Cup winner has now begun a strict training programme and diet in order to get himself back to professional fitness. 'For now, we are organising it all, but I am going to have a weight goal,' he said. Ronaldo bought a major stake in Fort Lauderdale Strikers in December 2014 and vowed to 'be very involved with the management of the team,' insisting he had 'already started to make introductions that will certainly help us to turn the Strikers into a global powerhouse.' Formerly Miami FC, the club was relaunched as the Strikers in 2011.

"The cold waters of Earth's deep ocean have not warmed measurably since 2005, according to a new Nasa study. Researchers say that while the find does not throw suspicion on global warming, it is a mystery. They say it cold be related to the fact  global warming appears to have slowed in recent years. Although the temperature of the ocean's top half continues to rise, the bottom half has not warmed measurably in the last decade, researchers say - although they claims these findings do not throw suspicion on climate change itself. In the 21st century, greenhouse gases have continued to accumulate in the atmosphere, just as they did in the 20th century, but global average surface air temperatures have stopped rising in tandem with the gases. The temperature of the top half of the world's ocean -- above the 1.24-mile mark -- is still climbing, but not fast enough to account for the stalled air temperatures. Many processes on land, air and sea have been invoked to explain what is happening to the 'missing' heat. One of the most prominent ideas is that the bottom half of the ocean is taking up the slack, but supporting evidence is slim. This latest study is the first to test the idea using satellite observations, as well as direct temperature measurements of the upper ocean. Scientists have been taking the temperature of the top half of the ocean directly since 2005, using a network of 3,000 floating temperature probes called the Argo array. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, analyzed satellite and direct ocean temperature data from 2005 to 2013 and found the ocean abyss below 1.24 miles (1,995 meters) has not warmed measurably. Study coauthor Josh Willis of JPL said these findings do not throw suspicion on climate change itself. 'The sea level is still rising,' Willis noted. 'We're just trying to understand the nitty-gritty details.'

Scientists have been taking the temperature of the top half of the ocean directly since 2005, using a network of 3,000 floating temperature probes called the Argo array. 'The deep parts of the ocean are harder to measure,' said JPL's William Llovel, lead author of the study, published Sunday, Oct. 5 in the journal Nature Climate Change. 'The combination of satellite and direct temperature data gives us a glimpse of how much sea level rise is due to deep warming. 'The answer is - not much.' The study took advantage of the fact that water expands as it gets warmer. The sea level is rising because of this expansion and water added by glacier and ice sheet melt. To arrive at their conclusion, the JPL scientists did a straightforward subtraction calculation, using data for 2005 to 2013 from the Argo buoys, NASA's Jason-1 and Jason-2 satellites, and the agency's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. From the total amount of sea level rise, they subtracted the amount of rise from the expansion in the upper ocean, and the amount of rise that came from added meltwater. The remainder represented the amount of sea level rise caused by warming in the deep ocean. The remainder was essentially zero. NASA Study Finds Earth's Ocean Abyss Has Not Warmed . anemones. Although the temperature of the ocean's top half continues to rise . Deep sea creatures, like these anemones at a hydrothermal vent, are not yet feeling the heat from global climate change. Deep ocean warming contributed virtually nothing to sea level rise during this period. Coauthor Felix Landerer of JPL noted that during the same period, warming in the top half of the ocean continued unabated, an unequivocal sign that our planet is heating up. Some recent studies reporting deep-ocean warming were, in fact, referring to the warming in the upper half of the ocean but below the topmost layer, which ends about 0.4 mile (700 meters) down. Landerer also is a coauthor of another paper in the same Nature Climate Change journal issue on ocean warming in the Southern Hemisphere from 1970 to 2005. Before Argo floats were deployed, temperature measurements in the Southern Ocean were spotty, at best. Using satellite measurements and climate simulations of sea level changes around the world, the new study found the global ocean absorbed far more heat in those 35 years than previously thought - a whopping 24 to 58 percent more than early estimates.","The temperature of the top half of the world's ocean above the 1.24-mile mark is still climbing .

"It’s taken four years and cost £341m ($575.67m), but today the luxurious five-star Peninsula Paris hotel opens its doors, promising prince-like treatment to well-heeled visitors to the French capital. Located close to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees, the hotel boasts a penthouse suite, complete with its own lavish rooftop garden, that will set guests back £20,000 ($35m) a night. The hotel - located in a late 19th century classic Haussmanian building - has 200 rooms and 34 suites – with prices starting at £800 ($1,400) a night for the most basic. New opening: The Peninsula Paris hotel - aimed at attracting the super-rich - cost £341m ($575m) to refurbish . The space opened in 1908 as a hotel, and in 1937 became a government conference centre . Luxurious: The lobby of the hotel, which boasts 200 rooms, including 34 suites, which start at £800 a night . There is also a fleet of BMWs, Mini Coopers and two Rolls-Royces to take holidaymakers around the city. And there are 600 staff on hand, including masseuses and cigar connoisseurs, to cater to every whim of its guests. Each of the rooms allows guests to make free phone calls anywhere in the world and is fitted with a printer, coffee machine, a nail polish-dryer and a tablet centralising all functions from dimming lights to ordering breakfast. The hotel building, which dates to 1908, is steeped with history, having housed the Nazi military command when Paris was occupied in World War Two and hosted 1973 peace talks aimed at ending the Vietnam War. The Paris location will be the luxury Hong Kong hotel group's first property in Europe . Fancy a dip? The underground, inside pool has a 'zen' design and features a floor-to-ceiling waterfall design . It is housed inside the old Hotel Majestic, which in its day hosted dinner parties with renowned guests such as Marcel Proust, Pablo Picasso and James Joyce. In 1928, George Gershwin wrote, An American in Paris while staying at the hotel. Today, it reopens as a luxurious hotel, boasting a rooftop terrace with 360-degree views over Paris, and restaurant, as well as an underground spa and swimming pool. There’s also a Chinese restaurant – LiLi – serving Cantonese cuisine. In addition to this cafe, the hotel has 600 staff members to look after guests' every need . Asian influence: It may be in Paris but the hotel has a Chinese restaurant called LiLi . And relax ... Inside a a marble bathroom in a one of the rooms. A penthouse suite costs £20,000 a night . The new opening is seen as part of a battle to attract Asia's new class of wealthy travellers that not only pits the world's top hotel groups against each other but also cities such as Paris, New York and London. For the Peninsula team, it is a long-term investment, piggybacking on Paris's efforts to woo the Chinese in particular over the past decade. And the extensive refurbishment is seen as a bid to stand out against other newcomers such as the Mandarin Oriental, the Shangri-La and the Royal Monceau operated by the Singapore hotel group Raffles which opened their doors in recent years. Once the refurbished Ritz and Crillon hotels re-open next year, Paris will have increased by more than 50 per cent its number of five-star beds to more than 2,000 in little over a decade. The hotel has five suites with private roof terraces - but even a regular room comes with a massive closet .

"British fashion designer John Galliano has been stripped of France’s highest civilian award – because of his conviction for racism. The 51-year-old was made a Legion d'Honneur three years ago by the then conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy. But a year ago Galliano was found guilty of making ‘public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity’. The British fashion designer John Galliano, centre, pictured in Paris in February 2011, has kept a low profile since being accused of drunken antisemitic insults . The conviction resulted in a fine equivalent to just under £50,00 and related to a series of anti-Semitic rants in his local Paris bar. Now Francois Hollande, France’s new Socialist President, has taken the almost unprecedented step of revoking the award. The decision was published in a decree signed by the head of state and published in the country's official journal. Galliano lost his job as artistic director of the Dior fashion house over the comments, which he blamed on his addictions to drugs and alcohol. During his Paris trial, a criminal court heard how, in February 2010, Galliano spat poisonous words at museum curator Geraldine Bloch about being Jewish. The designer, picture in March 2005 has been stripped of his highest civilian award . He also subjected a friend of Ms Bloch, who was of South Asian origin, to racist abuse. In a third incident, the court saw an amateur video of Galliano declaring a love for Adolf Hitler and referring to Jews being gassed in concentration camps. Galliano has kept a low profile since his conviction, with some reports suggesting he is considering a full-time move to Los Angeles. The Legion d'Honneur is given to those who have served France, or the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity which it upholds. Galliano became creative director at Dior in 1996, and won British Fashion Designer of the Year four times.","Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy awarded the British designer the top honour three years ago .

"Record numbers of Britons are working part-time after those struggling to find full-time positions pushed the figure above the eight-million mark for the first time. Official figures show that 8.07 million people toil for fewer than 25 hours a week - the highest figure since records began in 1992. One in seven of them would like to work longer but can't find the job, while others only remain in part-time employment because they can't afford to retire. The grim figures came amid warnings that the so-called 'Olympic effect' - which has helped overall unemployment fall in recent months - will end after the summer. Union bosses said the booming numbers of part-time workers only reflected soaring levels 'despair and waste of human talent' and they called for George Osborne to be axed as Chancellor. Boost: Many people are taking part time jobs in supermarkets, shops and offices because they cannot get full time work . However, the Government has trumpetted the fact that overall unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for a year after a big jump in the number of people in work. The jobless total fell by 46,000 in the quarter to June to 2.56 million, an unemployment rate of 8 per cent, according to the office for national statistics. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance last month was 1.59 million, down by 5,900 on June. Most of the quarterly fall in unemployment was recorded in London, suggesting a big jobs boost from the Olympic Games that could go the other way after the summer ends. Experts are questioning how much the unemployment figures can 'defy gravity' at a time when the economy as a whole is contracting. 'While this is undoubtedly good news, the latest labour markets statistics do raise questions about why they seem so out of kilter with other recent economic data. 'It is therefore not clear whether these data herald better economic news to come and whether the Olympics can offer a lasting economic legacy.' London jobs boost: Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for a year, an improvement thought to be down to the Olympics . The number of people in work increased by 201,000 to almost 30 million, . the highest since last summer, with half of the rise coming in London. Average earnings increased by 1.6 per cent in the year to June, up by 0.1 per cent on the previous month. Youth unemployment  - for those between 16 and 25 - remains at just over one million despite figures showing a drop of 4,000. Union leaders warned that Britain faces an unemployment rise once the Olympic effect has worn off and urged the Government to reverse its cuts plans. Paul Kenny, leader of the GMB union, . said: 'These figures show the level of despair and waste of human talent . in an economy going through this double-dip recession five years on . from the credit crunch of 2007. 'David . Cameron and Nick Clegg should now conclude that George Osborne is . simply not up to the job of steering our economy and he should be moved . to make way for a change of direction as he has proved beyond doubt that . it is not possible to deflate your way to growth.' Dave Prentis, general secretary of . Unison, said: 'This small fall is welcome, but there will be no lasting . Olympics legacy in the jobs market. 'The end of thousands of temporary jobs will see unemployment climbing after the summer. 'Students waiting for A-level results . this week face a bleak jobs future. They are set to join the dole . queues in high numbers as the hike in tuition fees has priced many . thousands of young people out of their dream of going to university or . into further education. 'The Tories need to inspire a generation by rebuilding our economy and safeguarding the future. Jobless rate: Two year figures reveal a recent drop to 8 per cent unemployment . 'This must include targeted help for . young people, as a part of a wider programme of Government-led job . creation. The continued austerity agenda is condemning our economy to . the slow lane.' But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain . Duncan Smith suggested that the overall trend in the jobless figures was . positive and insisted that the Coalition's policies were helping to . deliver future growth. He said: 'These are positive and . encouraging figures demonstrating the strength of our private sector - . notwithstanding the difficult economic times it is still creating jobs, . the vast majority of which are full time. Unemployment is falling and . the claimant count is down.' Unemployment has fallen for five . consecutive quarters, while the so-called claimant count was down for . the first time since April. But there was an increase of 1,600 in . the number of women claiming jobseeker's allowance to 530,000, compared . with a 7,500 fall among men, to just over a million. The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a sick relative, on early retirement, or who have given up looking for work, fell by 117,000 to 9.1 million, just over 22 per cent of the working age population. Jobs trends: Unemployment and the claimant count over the past two years to the end of June . Around 150,000 people were made redundant in the three months to June, down by 21,000 from the quarter to March and 4,000 lower than a year ago. Sectors showing the biggest increase in jobs in recent months included wholesale, retail and motor vehicle repairs. There were 472,000 vacancies across the country in the quarter to July, up by 10,000 on the three months to April, and 16,000 more than a year ago. But not everyone criticised the Government. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The labour market continues to defy gravity and is performing remarkably well given the extended weakness of the economy. 'It is very hard to reconcile employment growth of 201,000 in the three months to June, with GDP contraction of 0.7% quarter on quarter in the second quarter, especially as this was a third successive quarter of decline. 'The implication is that either the economy is doing appreciably better than the national accounts data show, the labour market is doing significantly worse than the hard data show, or productivity has genuinely weakened sharply. The jury is currently very much out as to what the actual answer is but it could very well be a combination of all three.'","1.4 million part-time workers say they are doing it because they simply can't get full-time work .

"A college student was the victim of an alleged hate crime where he was beaten unconscious and had his mouth stapled while his attackers made anti-Semitic taunts. Zach Tennen, 19, was at a party close to  Michigan State University campus in the early hours of Sunday when he was set upon by two men who he said asked if he was Jewish. The attackers, who claimed to be Ku Klux Klan, then raised their arms in a Nazi salute, saying 'Heil Hitler' and began hitting the teenager. Vicious assault: Zach Tennen, 19, was recovering at home near Detroit, after he was beaten by two men in an apparent anti-Semitic attack . However East Lansing police said in a statement on Tuesday that the assault was 'not likely a hate crime'. Investigators said a potential suspect has been identified. Police did not return calls asking for more details on the attack. Zach told Local 4 that while he was passed out, the attackers managed to staple through his gums. He said: 'It was coming up in my two bottom teeth and it started in my gum, so, somehow they managed to staple it.' His mother told the Detroit Free Press that around 20 people at the party watched the attack but no one helped her son. He was then thrown out of the party. The teenager, of Franklin, Michigan, also has a broken jaw below his bottom teeth which will require being set with wire. His family contacted the Anti-Defamation League, an organization which fights anti-Semitism, on account of the assault. In a statement to MailOnline, ADL Detroit Regional Director Betsy Kellman said: 'We are horrified by this violent assault and allegations that the student may have been viciously attacked because he was Jewish. Violent: Zach indicates where he woke up to find he had a staple in his mouth after being attacked on Sunday . Place of learning: Zach was beaten up close to the East Lansing campus of Michigan State University, pictured . 'We are confident that the East Lansing . Police will thoroughly investigate this deeply troubling case and, given . the allegations, treat it as a possible hate crime. We hope the . perpetrators will be swiftly brought to justice.' Zach, who graduated from Birmingham Groves High School last year and studies journalism at MSU, said he had drank alcohol at the party but only a small amount. After his attackers fled, he called a cab to take him to Lansing Sparrow Hospital. The hospital did not call the police but said that it was standard policy to alert authorities if someone reported being a victim of assault. Zach later had surgery at a Detroit hospital to have his jaw wired shut. Brutal: Zach Tennen said the men who assaulted him asked if he was Jewish and then made Nazi signs .

"A jury decided Williams is eligible for the death penalty for the beating death of his 5-year-old daughter . A federal jury on Friday decided a former Hawaii soldier convicted of murder is eligible for the death penalty in the first capital case in the history of Hawaii's statehood. Jurors will next deliberate on whether Naeem Williams should be sentenced to death or life in prison with no possibility of release for killing his 5-year-old daughter. That phase of the trial begins Wednesday and will include a new round of opening statements and evidence. The same jury last month convicted Williams in his daughter Talia's 2005 beating death. The drawn-out case has gained attention in part because it involves a capital offense in a state that doesn't have the death penalty. Hawaii's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957, before Hawaii became a U.S. state in 1959. But Williams was tried in the federal system- which allows for the death penalty- because the crime occurred on military property. Lawyers for both the prosecution and defense declined comment Friday after the jury's eligibility decision was read. Williams' defense team argued he was not eligible for a death sentence because of his low IQ. Mental health experts testified about intellectual impairments and low test scores. The prosecution contended factors such as Talia's age and vulnerability made the killing so heinous that the death penalty was warranted. Torture: Witnesses testified that Talia Williams, 5, was beaten with belts almost daily when her father became frustrated . Jurors . decided Williams met all key conditions to be eligible for the death . penalty: He was an adult; his actions were intentional that resulted in . the girl's death; and the crime was especially heinous and the victim . was vulnerable because of her youth. One juror appeared to cry as jurors were polled. Williams . and Talia's stepmother, Delilah Williams, testified during the guilt . phase of the trial that they beat her almost daily with hands and belts . during the seven months she lived with them in Hawaii. Naeem . Williams blamed the beatings on the child's bowel- and bladder-control . issues, coupled with frustrations he faced in his marriage. His . wife, Delilah, testified against him as part of a deal with prosecutors . for a 20-year sentence. She provided graphic and disturbing details of . abuse that included withholding food from the girl for days at a time, . beatings while the child was duct-taped to a bed, pulling her so hard by . the hair that she was left with a bald spot, and stomping on her until . bone cracked. Coverup: The signs of abuse on the girl's body became so bad that her father pulled her out of kindergarten so nobody would see them . The couple eventually took the kindergartner out of school so that others wouldn't see the signs of abuse on Talia's body. Prosecutors . say she died on July 16, 2005, after her father dealt a blow so hard it . left knuckle imprints on her chest. Naeem Williams said he beat the . girl that day partly because of toothpaste she spit onto the bathroom . sink. The . resolution of the case also paves the way for Delilah Williams' sentence. Her public defender, Alexander Silvert, requested that she be . immediately sentenced and moved to a mainland prison after she . testified, satisfying terms of her plea deal. But . U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright ruled that Delilah Williams . must wait until jurors in Naeem Williams' trial have been dismissed . before she can be sentenced. Deliliah Williams, left, wife of Naeem Williams, right, has also been charged with Talia's murder. However, she testified for the prosecution as part of a plea deal .","Naeem Williams was found guilty of murdering five-year-old daughter Talia in April .

"Stamp duty is a ‘middle class postcode tax’ which forces children to squat in their parents’ homes like ‘overgrown cuckoos’, Tory MPs said. They demanded that George Osborne scrap the duty on homes worth less than £500,000, saying it ‘clobbers’ ordinary families and young first-time buyers. Anne Main, Conservative MP for St Albans, said stamp duty ‘discriminates’ against the South and is a ‘burdensome tax affecting that most British of ideals – home ownership’. Soaring house prices are pushing more and more people into paying higher rates of stamp duty . She claimed ministers’ failure to act has led her to question whether the current Tory leadership still shares Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a property-owning democracy. Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, described stamp duty as a ‘vindictive stealth tax on aspirational Britain’ and an ‘assault by the taxman on hard-working, middle-income savers’. But Treasury minister David Gauke rejected calls for reform, saying the duty raises almost £10billion a year and ‘we need the money’. Stamp duty is paid when people buy a home, and is charged at differing rates depending on the value of the property. It amounts to 1 per cent on homes worth between £125,001 and £250,000 and 3 per cent on properties up to £500,000. Homes worth £500,001 or more are taxed at 4 per cent, while 5 per cent is charged on those worth more than £1million and 7 per cent on £2million-plus properties. Treasury minister David Gauke said raising the stamp duty threshold to £500,000 would cost more than £4billion . Critics say the system is unfair because the thresholds between the bands have not changed for years, despite soaring house prices, meaning bands designed for the very well-off have now dragged in people on modest incomes. Opponents also say the system distorts the housing market, and deem it unfair that buyers pay tax on the full value of the property, not just on the amount above the threshold. Opening a Westminster Hall debate on stamp duty, Mrs Main said scrapping the levy on all homes worth less than £500,000 would fuel economic growth and increase home ownership. She claimed that any fall in Treasury receipts would be affordable, as long as the Government stops wasting money on projects such as the Lib Dems’ free school meals policy. ‘I’m concerned that by allowing so many people to be sucked into paying ever higher rates of tax, despite earnings either rising modestly – or indeed earnings that have been frozen, such as in the public sector – we are actually denying our families of the future the chance to own their own home,’ she said. ‘In 1980, we believed in encouraging families of all levels of income to own their own home and I hope we haven’t moved away from that ideal.’ She said that in her constituency, 87 per cent of homes are now subject to stamp duty. ‘Taxes that I believe were originally designed for the wealthy home buyer now bring in so much money to the Treasury that I think it’s being seen as an untouchable cash cow,’ she added. ‘Collection of stamp duty in its current forms is discriminatory, unfairly targeting certain areas of the country regardless of ability to pay and that cannot be fair. ‘It’s the ordinary families being clobbered the most by this tax.’ She gave the example of low-paid public sector workers, noting that ‘they have a mountain to climb’ in saving for their own property. Mrs Main said they faced either paying high rents – particularly in the South – or alternatively may be ‘squatting like overgrown cuckoos in their parents’ home’. ‘In some postcodes, hardly anyone pays any tax to the Chancellor, not even 1 per cent on a modest three-bedroom semi-detached house,’ she said. ‘In other areas, such as mine, the same house has a huge 3 per cent tax bill attached to it.’ Mr Raab said that in 2000, there were 391,000 homes exempt from stamp duty, but the number has halved due to house price inflation. ‘It is not just the uber-wealthy ... who are paying the burden, it is middle England, the middle classes,’ he said. Home ownership now stands at its lowest level since 1988. Only around 64 per cent of people own their own homes, down from 69 per cent in 2001. Treasury minister David Gauke said raising the stamp duty threshold to £500,000 could result in tax revenues falling by £4.2billion. ‘In 2013/14, [stamp duty] raised £9.3billion. That is a substantial sum ... and it is money that, frankly, we need,’ he said.","Tory MPs call on ministers to raise the 3% stamp duty threshold to £500,000 .
Stamp duty is levied at 3% on homes bought for more than £250,000 .
Houses bought for between £125,001 and £250,000 hit with 1% duty ."
"The mother of a student who was kicked out of high school after starring in gay porn to help pay his family's bills said she couldn't be prouder. Melyssa Lieb, from Cocoa, Florida, said she vehemently supports her son, 18-year-old Robert Marucci, who was suspended from his high school after classmates discovered his explicit career. 'I think he's the most awesome person in the world,' she told WKMG through tears. 'He stood up and he was the man of the house when I couldn't be.' Scroll down for video . Support: Melyssa Lieb says she is proud of her son for trying to earn cash for the family . Back to class: Robert Marucci has been allowed to return to Cocoa High School . Following outrage over his suspension, the school district has now ruled that the decision was wrong and Marucci is allowed back to school on Wednesday. 'No child would ever be suspended for a job that they have outside of the school environment,' said Michelle Irwin, a spokesperson for the district. Even after his suspension, Marucci remained unapologetic for the work he considers no different any other job. He pointed out that it is legal and doesn't believe a school can tell him where he can work. The debacle began two weeks ago when fellow students at Cocoa High School discovered his videos on an adult website and started showing each other the explicit images on their phones. Exposed: Robert's role in adult films came to light when other students spotted him in porn movies . Legal: But he insists that the job is no different from any other, saying it was legal and outside of school . The website shows Marucci, who goes by . the name of 'Noel', posing naked and having sex with other men, as well . as featuring in an introductory video about his love of surfing. Despite his pride in his work, when the photos emerged at school, he was targeted by bullies, WKMG reported. School administrators called him a 'major disruption', according to the referral slip. A friend posted on Reddit that Marucci was suspended for 10 days, which meant that he would not be unable to graduate because of an automatic 'failure from absences'. 'I feel like I have been treated unfairly and this is unjust,' Marucci said. 'This was completely legal. I didn't break any laws, and this took place out of the school.' Kicked out: On his referral note, school administrators called Marucci a 'major disruption' Decisions: Cocoa High School has reversed its suspension of Robert . Backing: A protest by fellow students was held after Robert was suspended from class . Administrators also wrote that he threatened to bring weapons to the school, but he denies this. But . his mother said these threats were not the real reason he was kicked . out, as Lieb claimed the principal, Dr. Stephanie Soliven, told her: 'He . was expelled due to his explicit lifestyle career.' His . mother added: 'I think that it is [her] morals and her personal beliefs . and I don't think that this is anybody's business except for my son. The children at the school found it [the porn] and she didn't do . anything to stop it.' But Marucci's mother wasn't the only one who supported him, as dozens staged a walkout at the school on Friday. A Facebook group was also set up to support him. See below for video .","Robert Marucci was suspended from Cocoa High School in Florida after schoolmates found his explicit videos and began sharing them at school .

"A British teenager fighting jihad in Syria shoulder-to-shoulder with his brother was allegedly a senior member of a notorious predominantly Muslim gang who carry knives and guns, it emerged today. Aseel Muthana, 17, who followed his older sibling Nasser to join Isis, has been described as a ringleader in the Docks Riverside Grangetown crew from Cardiff. The gang is made up of around 15 youths as young as ten who 'carry knives, knuckledusters and guns' and are also said to target white rivals, they call 'pastey boys'. Scroll down for video . Young recruit: 17-year-old Aseel Muthana was allegedly a member of a violent Cardiff gang before he fled to join his brother Nasser fighting for Isis in Syria . The DRG crew, as they are known locally, also produce their own rap videos filled with swearing and promoting violence. Last week his brother and another friend Reyaad Khan, also from Cardiff, appeared in a shocking recruitment video aimed at luring jihadists to Syria and Iraq. A school friend toldThe Sun: 'Aseel was a senior member. If you know of the group you would not go there at night — if they saw you they would probably start on you. They would often be in fights, sometimes caused by race. 'They would call some of the white kids ""pastey boys"".' One Cardiff boy, who was attacked by members of the gang, said in an online post: 'They've got ages from 10 - 16 and most of them carry knives.. knuckle dusters.. a few with guns. I was pinned down at 11 years of age in a lane and I was cut with a bottle up my arm and that was because they had beef with my cuzun (sic) and they couldn't get him'. In February Aseel fled Britain to fight in Syria after telling his parents he was staying at his friend's house ahead of a maths exam at his school. Cardiff link: Reyaad Khan and Aseel's brother Nasser Muthana appear in this Isis recruitment video encouraging others to fight jihad . School days: Third British jihadist Reyaad Khan having fun with friends in Cardiff before he fled to fight . But police then arrived at his home the following night after it emerged he had gained a second passport by lying about his age and was in Cyprus and about to sail to Syria. The father of two brothers fighting with Isis in Syria said today young Muslim men are being radicalised at 'pop-up' meetings in Cardiff - including at a suburban leisure centre. Distraught father Ahmed Muthana, 57, said extremists are leafleting Muslim communities in the Welsh capital encouraging young men to join the jihad in Syria and Iraq. He said the recruitment meetings are never held in the same venue twice to avoid being infiltrated by anti-terrorist police. But Mr Muthana told how one of the meetings was held in the Channel View Leisure Centre in the Grangetown area of Cardiff - after being rented out by the Labour-run council. Father-of-four Mr Muthana said: 'I believe my two sons went to one of these meetings and now they are with the Isis people in Syria. 'They never hold these meetings in the same place twice - they know what they are doing. 'I know they had a meeting at Channel View, there have been others in restaurants and in private homes. 'They just book a room at these places saying it is for a private function. It is like one of these pop-up restaurants. They are there for a few hours and then they move on.' Mr Muthana added: 'Some of the venues have been restaurants and businesses run by people sympathetic to the extremists.' His brother Nasser was a star medical student who secretly travelled to Syria from his family home in Cardiff  despite being offered the opportunity to study medicine by four universities. His family have not seen him since November 2013. Furious father Ahmed Muthana, 57, said if his sons ever return to the UK, he would like to see them jailed. He added that his sons have 'betrayed his family and betrayed Britain' - before insisting he had already binned family pictures of his boys because 'you don't keep the devil in your house.' Mr Muthana, who moved to the UK from Yemen in the seventies and earned a living repairing televisions, collapsed and was rushed to hospital when he heard his second son had also gone to fight. There are concerns about radicalisation problems in Cardiff after three young men from the area rushed to fight in Syria. Former Cardiff councillor Mohammed Sarul Islam told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning he did not believe young men in the city were being radicalised in mosques but instead some had been influenced by 'internet clerics.' Sheikh Zane Abdo, imam of the South Wales Islamic Centre, told BBC Breakfast that Nasser and Aseel had been 'normal teenagers' before they went through a 'very strange period' when they started expressing 'certain views'. 'The brothers were normal teenagers, very well-spoken, very sincere, liked watching movies, did a lot of school, normal teenagers,' he said. Pictured: Nasser's room in the family home in Cardiff where the brothers plotted how to take part in a holy war thousands of miles away in Syria . In shock: Nasser and Aseel's parents and youngest brother walk through their Cardiff estate. Their father has said they should be arrested and jailed if they return to the UK . 'However, they went through a very strange period when they said they were becoming quite serious in their faith and then began to start to expressing certain views that were quite political, particularly the older brother. Concerns: The Imam  of the local mosque said the boys were 'normal teenagers' but both, especially Nasser (pictured) began to start to expressing certain views that were quite political . 'Neither of them in the past year and a half to two years frequented this mosque or attended any of the sermons or any of my classes that I have been giving for the past three and a half years.' He said he regretted the publicity that the video had attracted. 'I guarantee that many young people who are very susceptible to this type of message will have watched that video and maybe have been encouraged to now go and follow in the footsteps of Nasser and his brother, which is a real problem, the fact that a platform has been given to this video, that really shouldn't have been given.' He added that Reyaad Khan's mother had approached him, 'crying her eyes out', after he had given a lecture on extremism. 'Reyaad Khan's mother approached me several months ago. I did a lecture on extremism, on Jihad, several months ago, in a particular mosque and she came up to me afterwards, she was crying her eyes out, she said 'What can I have done, what can I do? 'I tried to console her. This happened several months ago.' He said he had spoken out, warning young people not to do the same. 'I expressed how young people should not be going. We have done this already, we have done the work, we have spoken out several months ago, way before the media even got a whiff of what was going on,' he said. A former director of MI6 has warned intelligence services faced an 'impossible' task of tracking the hundreds of Britons who have returned to UK after fighting in Syria. Richard Barrett, a former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, estimated 'possibly up to 300 people have come back to the UK' already. His comments came after it emerged that around 500 Britons had travelled to Syria and Iraq - a higher estimate than the 400 claimed by Foreign Secretary William Hague. Richard Barrett, a former director of MI6, has warned intelligence services faced an 'impossible' task of tracking the hundreds of Britons who have returned to UK after fighting in Syria . Mr Barrett told the BBC: 'Clearly they'll have to prioritise and they'll have to choose those that they think are likely to pose the greatest risk. 'Beyond that I think they'll have to rely very much on members of the community and other people expressing their concern and worry about the behaviour of perhaps their returned friend or family member.' Mr Barrett said that while recruiting networks across Europe suggested of greater radicalisation than people just going on their own, it did not necessarily indicate that people would progress from fighting in Syria to being a terrorist at home. Police across the UK have made 65 Syria-related arrests over the last 18 months, including 40 in the first three months of this year alone. Sir Peter Fahy, who leads on the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said 'huge amounts of material' was being taken down from the internet every week as part of the effort to stop people being radicalised. But others say the figures are much higher. Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood told Sky News: 'I imagine 1,500 certainly would be the lower end. If you look across the whole of the country, there's been a number of people going across. 'Originally you had the British Syrians settled here who wanted to go back and play a part, then you had the Kurdish community, then almost two years ago you had the young British Muslim community going across - so if you add all that up you've got serious figures that we need to look at. 'Those will come back - certainly more than we are saying at the moment - and we do need to look at that. 'So we need to look at exactly how this is happening, what our border controls are like and we really need to bolster those border controls in order to ensure that we see the people coming through and deal with them.'","Aseel Muthana, 17, joined his brother Nasser, 20, fighting for Isis in Syria .

"David Cameron has piled pressure on Pakistan to catch the killers of a British family who were gunned down in cold blood following the breakdown of an arranged marriage. Tania Yousaf, 22, and her parents Mohammed, 51, and Parviaz, 49, from Nelson, Lancashire, died in a hail of bullets from three armed gunmen in Gujrat in 2010. They had been in Pakistan for the wedding of one son but died because . of a bitter dispute over the pending divorce of another, police say. However, nobody has ever been brought to justice since two of the suspected killers were arrested - with their mother - but went on the run when they were granted bail. Gunned down: Mohammed Yousaf and his daughterTania, who were killed in Gujrat in 2010 . As the trio were ambushed by the machine gun-wielding gang, mother-of-two Tania was shot in the legs, but managed to run for cover. The shooters tracked her down after killing Mr and Mrs Yousaf and then pulled out a mobile phone and ordered her to speak to her husband before blasting her up to 100 times. Killed: Mother Parviaz, 49, was also murdered in the attack believed to have been retribution for the breakdown of the 10-year arranged marriage of their son Kamar . Police believe the slayings were retribution for the breakdown of a 10-year . arranged marriage between one of Mr and Mrs Yousaf's three sons, Kamar, . and his cousin Nabeela. Days later, Nabeela's mother, Rahmat Bibi, and two brothers, Shiraz and Naveed Arif, were arrested in connection with the crime. But the brothers, believed to have been among the gunmen, fled as soon as they were granted bail. They have not been . seen since. The mystery deepened in April this year when Tania’s grandmother, Fukraz Begum, was beaten to death in Gujrat in what police believe was a connected attack. Now the Prime Minister has demanded answers from the Pakistani government after two years without any further developments. Writing to Andrew Stephenson, the family's local MP, Mr Cameron said: 'I cannot begin to imagine how difficult this must be for the families of those involved. 'I fully appreciate that the families will want to see . the people responsible for these crimes brought to justice. 'This is the least . that they deserve and I can understand their frustrations with the slow pace of . the investigations.' He said he dispatched delegates from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to step up pressure on the Pakistani authorities over the summer and promised to meet Mr Stephenson when Parliament reassembles in Autumn to update him on progress. 'As you are aware the Foreign and . Commonwealth Office Ministers have taken an active interest in both . cases, and in the wider issue of the safety of British nationals in . Pakistan,' he added. Aftermath: Pakistani relatives and residents carry a cot with the body of Mohamamd Yousaf near the town of Gujrat in eastern Pakistan . The murders took place in the Gujrat district of north east Pakistan where the Yousaf family had travelled for a wedding of another one of their sons, Asad, then 23, to his fiance, Roma. Furniture manufacturer Mr Yousaf and his wife and daughter, a former Pendle Council worker, had stayed in Pakistan after the wedding to visit friends and relatives while the rest of the family returned to the UK. They were in the village of Murirya, paying respects at a relative's grave site when the raiders struck. Tough talk: The Prime Minister has demanded answers from the Pakistani government after two years without any further developments in the hunt to catch the killers . Abdul Hussain, a cousin and family spokesman, said after attack: '[Shooting Tania in the legs] could have been on purpose or they could have just been spraying bullets and got her in the legs. 'She hid, so they dealt with the parents and then went after her. They knew she was somewhere in the graveyard. 'The conversation between Tania and her husband was very minimal. He heard her beg for her life and then heard gunfire.' Her brother Asad, 25, added: 'She begged for her children and said she needed her two little boys [...] and then they just shot her.' Relatives have claimed Mr Yousaf was warned . never to set foot in the village, which is home to the family of his son . Kamar’s estranged wife Nabeela. When Kamar and Nabeela, who lived in . Nelson and have two children, split up in 2009, it triggered the feud . which led to her brothers warning Mr Yousaf he faced 'grave . consequences' if he ever returned to their home village. But Mr Yousaf defied the warning . after returning to Pakistan with his wife and daughter for the wedding . of another of his sons in a village 15 miles away. Responding to the Prime Minister's call to action, Mr Stephenson said: 'The government cannot go higher than the Prime Minister personally intervening. 'Hopefully this will bring justice for the Yousafs and Fukraz Begum’s family closer and also ensure that other British citizens who suffer tragic losses in Pakistan do not have to go through the same prolonged ordeal.' Escaped: One of the two suspects captured in the killing stares out from behind bars in a Pakistani jail before being granted bail . Senseless: Covered with a blanket, the body of one of the victims is carried away . Mohammad and Parviaz Yousaf and their daughter Tania were killed in a village in the district of Gujrat in north-east Pakistan . Tania¿s grandmother, Fukraz Begum, was beaten to death in Gujrat (pictured) in what police believe was a connected attack . Pendle councillor Eileen Ansar, a relative of the Yousafs and friend of Fukraz Begum’s family, said: 'I think it is great that the Prime Minister has personally intervened in these cases and that they have gone to the very top of government. 'Hopefully this bring justice a step closer for the families and will ensure that British citizens who a victims of crime in Pakistan get simpler and speedier justice in the future.'","Tania Yousaf, 22, and her parents Mohammed, 51, and Parviaz, 59, from Nelson, Lancashire, were executed by an armed gang in Gujrat in 2010 .

"Lurking in the shadows in his body armour and balaclava, neighbourhood vigilante and self-styled ninja Tanis Baker considered himself the eyes and ears of the police. Until, that is, he was spotted loitering in a park by an officer who mistook the black-clad crimebuster’s trusty wooden sword for something more lethal. Within minutes the officer had called for back-up and – as Baker retreated towards a children’s playground – a police helicopter, armed officers and dog handlers were all scrambled. Superhero: How Baker might have looked when he was arrested while dressed as a vigilante ninja . Baker – nicknamed the Ringland Ninja by locals in the suburb of Newport, South Wales, where he lives – was eventually found crouching in the bushes. He then sheepishly led officers to a bag full of smoke bombs which he had stashed nearby, while another bag was found to contain other superhero costumes. Magistrates were told that when Baker, a barman, was later asked what he would have done if he had encountered a real crime, he admitted he had not thought that far ahead. Baker, who said he was a fan of comic book heroes including Batman and Superman, admitted having an offensive weapon in a public place after he was arrested over the incident in the town’s Beechwood Park in September. Comic book fan: Tanis Baker told police he was a vigilante in a ninja costume after police arrested him while armed with a homemade wooden Samurai sword . Cwmbran Magistrates’ Court heard that the defendant – who by day worked behind the bar at a local snooker club – told police he was a ‘vigilante in a costume’ and that he wanted to help people in trouble. He claimed to be the ‘eyes and ears’ of the police and wanted to strike fear into the hearts of criminals. The probation officer who assessed him said Baker was a fan of American comic book superheroes. His probation report said: ‘He seems to get confused between fantasy and reality and sometimes had trouble distinguishing between what was in comic books and what was real life.’ The court heard he had been crouched on top of the park gates in his costume keeping watch for criminals when he was spotted by the police officer who feared he was carrying a samurai sword. Baker then retreated further into the park and hid in bushes near the children’s play area. Louise Warren, defending, said: ‘Baker was bullied for many years and struggled growing up in his neighbourhood. He was attacked by a gang of youths while out with his sister a year ago, but police were unable to find the offenders. Since then Baker has wanted to help the police to protect society.’ She said that, while the offence was carried out in a public place, no one but the police officer involved saw him. Baker was given a 12-month supervision order and ordered to carry out 60 hours’ unpaid work. He declined to comment after the case. Paul Lavin, magistrates’ chairman, told him: ‘You may have thought you were helping but you caused a lot of trouble. Do not do this in future or else you’ll be in big trouble.’ Following the court case earlier this year, residents on the Hendre Farm estate said Baker had been dressing up as a ninja warrior ‘for months’ and had previously been spotted perched on the roofs of buildings. He is the latest in a spate of superhero vigilantes reported to have begun patrolling the streets and open spaces over recent years. Last year the Devon resort of Torquay was reported to be being protected by not one superhero but two – The Dark Spartan and his sidekick The Black Void. But after months patrolling on the look-out for crime, they failed to find any and police said they posed a greater danger to themselves than local criminals. Hi-ya!

"For any music fan, meeting their idol is likely  to be emotional. But for Ed Buckley, standing side by side with Coldplay singer Chris Martin at a glamorous awards ceremony  in London earlier this year was an extremely poignant moment in a long and remarkable journey. Just 17 months earlier, the Leeds University undergraduate, who was training to be a pilot, had been all but written off by doctors after being struck by a speeding taxi as he walked home from a party. His injuries were so profound that he was in a coma for six months,  at first suffering life-threatening seizures. His distraught parents were told on a number of occasions to prepare for the worst. Scroll down for video . Dream come true: Ed, who is now able to walk and talk and play the piano again, 17 months after his accident, got to meet his inspiration, Coldplay's Chris Martin, at the O2 Silver Clef Awards in June . Against the odds, Ed pulled through but when he woke, he was unable to speak, walk or carry out even the most basic tasks. The brain damage he suffered also left him with profound memory loss. So it is nothing short of astonishing that today he has recovered all of his faculties – and even manages  to crack wry jokes about how it is his parents, rather than him, who struggle to remember details of the past, and that the inside of his head is still ‘like mashed potato’. But more interestingly, Ed, 22, credits his return to health partly to a pioneering form of music therapy that is showing huge promise and is helping those like him recover their memories. Listening to Coldplay, one of his favourite bands, was key to the process. Ddespite being wheelchair-bound and in ‘a fog’ that meant he could barely recall his own name, when Ed sat at a piano, he could play the chords to Coldplay songs which he had learned during music lessons before the accident. He explains: ‘Before I could walk or talk, and while I was still in a wheelchair, I could be pushed up  to the piano and I would bang out Let It Be by The Beatles. I remembered the chords for that, but I had no other memory. Family ties: Ed is surrounded by his sisters Emily, far left, Amy, centre, and Alice after emerging from his coma, six months after the accident . ‘Then I started to remember the Coldplay stuff I used to play. Music makes me feel different because I spend most of the week concentrating on walking better and thinking better. When I put my fingers  on the keys, I just let it go and concentrate on other stuff. That’s what unlocked my brain.’ He laughs again, describing how Barry Manilow reminds him of his mother Caroline, Dire Straits of his father Matthew, and One Direction of his younger sister Amy. On hearing Ed’s story, Coldplay . frontman Martin and the band’s  lead guitarist Jonny Buckland offered to . personally present him with the handwritten signed lyrics to their . chart-topping 2011 single Paradise, at the O2 Silver Clef Awards in . June. The fundraising gala is hosted each year by charity Nordoff . Robbins, which provides music therapy to patients with a range of . illnesses and needs. Martin . was moved to tears by  Ed’s plight. ‘Hearing his story and meeting him . was amazing. It was so moving and so powerful,’ he says. The brain comprises billions of nerve cells called neurons. These transmit chemical signals to each other and control every aspect of our bodies. Few cells are added after birth, but existing neurons grow larger and connect with one another in response to external stimulus. This is how we learn. When the brain tissue is injured, cells die and these neural pathways can be broken. Physiotherapy, speech therapy, art therapy and even social interaction can help the pathways regrow. They work by either retraining muscles, stimulating mental processes or finding alternative ways of communicating or moving. Music can recruit new areas of the brain if one part of the network is damaged. Making music uses a huge range of mental functions: memory, sequencing, organising,  co-ordinating and movement. Even singing means that memory of speech is stimulated, hormone levels are increased, the heart rate can change and the immune system is boosted. ‘He’s just a good guy and hearing what he’s been through and is still going through, puts things into perspective. It makes everything we do feel worthwhile.’ On stage, Caroline, a 48-year-old nurse, told of the extraordinary power of music therapy, and the role that Nordoff Robbins therapist Jessica Atkinson played in her son’s rehabilitation. Experts believe that listening to and playing music, which involves a complex combination of mental processes including perception and memory, can effectively be used to retrain and re-educate the injured brain. Ed is a striking example of the rehabilitative effect. Three months after his accident, and still in coma, he was transferred from a hospital in Leeds to Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge, then on to Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex to be nearer his family home in Welwyn Garden City. Then, six months to the day after his accident, he began to wake up. Still in a minimally conscious state, he began an intensive course of rehabilitation, incorporating physiotherapy and speech, occupational and music therapies. Atkinson, a former professional violinist and music teacher, has worked as a Nordoff Robbins music therapist for 15 years in hospices, special needs schools, care homes and now at Northwick Park. She explains how, like many male brain-injury patients, Ed struggled to speak, at first saying the few words he could manage in either a high-pitched whine or flat monotone. ‘I used the piano and my own voice to make a range of noise combinations, which Ed would attempt to mimic,’ she explains. ‘We would begin a musical question-and-answer session where we would try to get him to reregister his voice, then guide him through many chords. You would make a harmony, taking him up and down, so he would regain the inflection in his voice, both for speaking and singing.’ Remarkably, and it is not yet fully understood why, many patients with brain injuries  retain the ability to sing even when their normal speech is  quite affected, so Atkinson tried to harness the melody of his unimpaired song and attach it to Ed’s speech. She began by freely improvising conversation in song, so that Ed wasn’t concentrating on the meaning of his words but the melodic framework of the delivery. ‘As soon as we went into a conversation about something  he had to give some thought to, and he focused on the meaning, he would drop out of melodic conversation and revert to monotone,’ she explains. Inspiration: Coldplay's music played a crucial part in Ed's rehabilitation after the accident . However, using Atkinson’s strategy, Ed was able to go away and practise melodic chat on his own, taking the initiative in his own rehabilitation. When he was ready to come out of his wheelchair, Atkinson – working alongside physio- and occupational therapists – used a drum to help Ed regain a natural walking rhythm that gave him balance and momentum. The simple effect of a marching beat gives the body a natural cadence to mirror. She also dovetailed with other members of the clinical team  to work on improving Ed’s finger control, using the piano keys as  a tool. As a child, Ed showed a talent for music, reaching grade four on the piano, before abandoning formal lessons to enjoy playing by ear. He was eager to experience this liberating sensation again and with Atkinson’s help, he would go home on weekend leave from the hospital and come back having learned to play a new piece of music. He even attempted to sing along, too. ‘Ed would challenge himself  by choosing the most difficult chords, but he had the most incredible determination and could sense the way the process of playing again was affecting his whole life,’ recalls Atkinson. Caroline says it also allowed  Ed to give something back to the people around him. ‘He has pushed himself constantly and responded to music in a truly incredible, inspirational way. ‘It normalises him – all youngsters have music as part of their life. They may play in bands or they bond with others because of their musical tastes.’ Ed continues to use music to put memories into context and to help him recall situations and people in his life. It is a recognised strategy that many therapists use to help patients reassemble the jigsaw puzzle of their life. Music has become a focal point of Ed’s ongoing recovery and, although he stopped working with Atkinson when he was discharged from hospital in April, he now has piano lessons and singing lessons at home. ‘If I am improving in walking, that doesn’t matter to me as much as improving my piano. I want to serenade the ladies like Jamie Cullum. He has it all – he is handsome and he  has talent,’ he laughs. When he first woke from his coma, Ed had two goals. One of them was fulfilled last month when he celebrated his 22nd birthday by playing beach cricket with his parents, sisters – Emily, 23, Amy, 19, and 18-year-old  Alice – and friends during a holiday on Alderney. His second goal is to fulfil a request from his mother – to play A Million Love Songs by Take That. It is something he is working towards every day. ‘It’s the lyrics,’ he says, whispering in my ear. ‘She gets really soppy when she hears the lyrics.’ www.nordoff-robbins.org.uk .","Ed Buckley, 22, was hit by a speeding taxi in 2012 and went into a coma .

"Russia and China have the blood of Syrian children on their hands, David Cameron suggested yesterday. The Prime Minister effectively blamed the countries for the torture and killing of children by Bashar al-Assad’s regime because they have refused to sanction any intervention by the United Nations  in the war-torn Middle East state. The failure to act had left a ‘terrible stain on the reputation of the UN’, he said at the UN General Assembly in New York. Scroll down to watch . Speech: David Cameron addresses the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York today . Citing a report by the charity Save . the Children, Mr Cameron told delegates: ‘If anyone was in any doubt . about the horrors that Assad has inflicted on his people, just look at . the evidence published this week; schools used as torture centres, . children as target practice. ‘A 16-year-old Syrian called Wael who . was detained in a police station in Dera’a said: “I have seen children . slaughtered.

And in . particular, a stain on those who have failed to stand up to these . atrocities and in some cases aided and abetted Assad’s reign of terror. Angry: In a thinly-veiled attack at the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Cameron effectively blamed the pair for the torture and killing of children by Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime . Unhappy: The Prime Minister cited a report by Save the Children this week which highlighted the appalling impact of the civil war on Syria's young people . Mr Cameron denounced the killing of US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens (right) earlier this month as a ‘despicable act of terrorism’. But . he added that he was inspired by the response of the Libyan public, who . were not prepared to allow extremists to ‘hijack their chance for . democracy’. He said: ‘The . right response is to finish the work Chris Stevens gave his life to. And . that's what the vast majority of Libyans want too.’ ‘If the United Nations Charter is to . have any value in the 21st Century we must now join together to support a . rapid political transition.’ Russia and China have repeatedly blocked UN action against Assad. Although he did not name the . countries, Mr Cameron’s aides confirmed his remarks were directed at . them. The angry tone of his speech risks sparking a diplomatic row. Before his address Mr Cameron held a 30-minute meeting with Egypt’s new president Mohamed Morsi. British sources said President Morsi had urged him to step up pressure on Russia and China to end their veto over UN action.

"You may be looking forward to tucking into your turkey or unwrapping those long-awaited Christmas gifts, but it seems that Britain's supermarkets are already looking to capitalise on the next major UK religious holiday. With Easter still a little under 100 days away, supermarket giant Tesco has come under fire - for having its chocolate eggs on sale already. Shocked shoppers spotted the eggs on sale last week and many took to Twitter to vent their disbelief. Jumping the gun: Supermarket giant Tesco has come under fire for selling Easter eggs already - with little less than 100 days to go until Easter Sunday . Emma Dockerty posted: 'According to Tesco, its officially Easter! Hello chocolate bunnies!' While another user, named only as Tres Bien said: 'Tesco are already starting to sell easter stuff?

And despite Tesco claiming that the early Easter displays in some stores were a mistake and that they had now been removed until the new year, it seems that some stores may have still be taking deliveries in preparation. Cashing in: Christmas turkeys may still be flying off the shelves today, but supermarket giant Tesco has already started selling Easter eggs much to the surprise of customers and the annoyance of the Church of England . Mark Brown tweeted: 'Local Tesco just got a delivery of Easter eggs this morning...He's not even born yet and they've him dead & buried already!' The decision to put the eggs on sale also incurred the wrath of the Church of England who were outraged at Easter goods being on sale in December. CoE spokesman Steve Jenkins told the Sun: 'Christmas celebrates Jesus’s birth — a different message from Easter, which marks the end of his life. 'Supermarkets should not be selling Easter eggs now.'

"An airport security worker has been suspended after she failed to spot a fake bomb designed to look like explosives as it passed through the X-ray machine. The guard did not detect the dummy explosive as it passed through Manchester Airport’s ‘air side’ meaning it could have been taken on board a flight by a passenger. It is believed that the woman missed the fake bomb because she was looking at her work rota at the time rather than watching the screen.

The DfT carries out covert tests of . security procedures at all UK airports with officials acting as ‘secret . shoppers’, posing as ordinary passengers or even cabin crew members to . inspect security. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ‘The safety of the travelling public is paramount, which is why the UK combines intelligence, technology and other measures to provide one of the strictest regimes for aviation security in the world. ‘We have a regular programme of inspections to ensure compliance with this regime, but do not comment on the specifics or outcomes for obvious reasons.’ The blunder comes after an 11-year-old who managed to sneak onto a plane without a ticket or passport and fly to Italy said it was 'easier than doing my homework.' Liam Corcoran slipped away from his mother in Wythenshawe, caught a bus to the airport three miles away and boarded a Jet2.com plane bound for Rome without anyone, including security staff, questioning what he was doing. He also did not have a passport, boarding pass or cash. It was not until Liam began boasting that he had run away from home as the plane cruised over France that other passengers alerted cabin crew. By then too late to turn around so the flight continued its journey to Rome. Liam stayed in the airport with police and airline staff for nearly two hours before being put on a flight home.

"Relatives of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan who were put under observation by CDC after they visited him on the day he was taken to hospital are still waiting for an answer about what they should do 24 hours after they begged them for help. Aaron Yah, 43, and wife Youngor Jallah, 35, yesterday told of their ordeal in isolation and revealed that they had not received direct orders to stay indoors. Today MailOnline returned to the family's small apartment to find a family without answers, without power following violent electrical storms that brought down lines and running low on food, water and diapers for their youngest child. Scroll down for video . Fears: Youngor and her husband Aaron Yah are trapped in their home and feel as if they've been left adrift by officials. They have no power, cannot go out for food and the waste - including soiled nappies, is piling up . Most troubling of all some family members are beginning to show cold-like symptoms. Ms Jallah repeatedly wiped her eyes - which appeared sticky - with a paper towel while a child sneezed and coughed in the background. While it is unlikely to be related to the Ebola virus, they did not look as healthy as they did when MailOnline visited on Thursday. Ms Jallah said: 'We asked the CDC last night if we have to stay indoors and they said they would come back to us overnight and tell us this morning.' The CDC had been in contact with them over the last few says, checking their temperatures and blood pressures. But it was close to midday when Youngor spoke and the family was still waiting for officials to visit and answer their questions from Thursday. The couple live in the home with their four children: three boys aged two, four and 11 and a daughter, aged six. She continued: 'Our phone is not working because of the storm. So we don't know.' MailOnline contacted CDC officials on behalf of the family after our visit to their home. An official said she would pass on the information. The family has also had no instruction about how to dispose of the waste already accumulating in their small second floor apartment. The waste, which may be contaminated, includes soiled diapers. Ebola is only contagious when the infected person is exhibiting symptoms. But it can then be transmitted by an exchange of body fluids including blood, saliva, semen and feces if contact is at a point of entry like a cut or graze, mouth, nose or eyes. The entire family had exposure to Mr Duncan during the time when he was exhibiting increasingly violent symptoms and now they feel as if they've been cast adrift. Ms Jallah, Mr Duncan’s stepdaughter, said that she last spoke with her quarantined mother, Louise Troh, yesterday before the storms cut them off entirely. She said: 'She was well. She said the CDC had come and taken their temperature and it was all normal.' Finally: Hazmat teams move into the apartment where Duncan was staying when he fell sick - five days after he was taken to hospital vomiting with the Ebola virus . Horror: Youngor was at the apartment on Sunday when Duncan took a serious turn for the worse. She brought him a cup of tea while he was lying in bed . On Friday afternoon Hazmat teams were moving into the apartment where Duncan had been staying to finally clean it. Troh had complained that his sweat-stained sheets were still on the bed and the towels he used in plastic bags. Ms Jallah last saw her mother when she visited the Ivy Apartments, now quarantined under armed guard on Sunday. She told the Washington Post that she found Duncan in bed, fully dressed and shivering. After going to buy him a blanket, she helped lift him by his back so the man she calls 'Daddy' could drink some hot tea she made him. It was then she noticed redness in his eyes, a well-recognized sign of Ebola. With his temperature at 102F, Ms Jallah who, like her husband Mr Yah is a nursing assistant, called 911. When the ambulance arrived Ms Jallah brought the blanket in which she had wrapped her stepfather to the hospital. Mr Yah yesterday told MailOnline his own brief conversation with his friend that day. He said: 'The last time I saw Thomas was Sunday, the day he went to hospital. I had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine, he had been just fine. 'But that day I passed by on Sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and I asked him how he was. He said, ""I'm not okay."" Family: Youngor calls Duncan Daddy. He is married to her mother Louise Troh, who is in quarantine . 'He said he had been having diarrhea all night.' Mr Duncan was diagnosed on Tuesday, and Mr Yah said that he was told the news the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the Meadows Nursing home where he works as a nursing assistant.","Youngor Jallah, 35, said CDC had not been keeping them informed .

"Natasha Simmonds:  Her family say doctors did not take the 16-year-old seriously and failed to spot her brain tumour, despite seeing her 24 times in the last years of her life . A teenage girl died after medics failed to spot that she had a brain tumour – despite seeing her 24 times in the last year of her life. Natasha Simmonds, 16, was treated by 13 doctors but none of them ordered a crucial MRI scan until it was  too late. Her mother, Sarah Simmonds, claims that three months before her daughter died, one A&E doctor accused her of ‘putting the symptoms on’ and refused to give her a scan because they were reserved for ‘life and death’ situations. Natasha, who was studying for a career in childcare, complained of headaches, numbness in her limbs, back pains, vomiting and problems with her eyesight. But the paediatrician in charge of her care dismissed the symptoms as migraines. Natasha died on January 24, eight days after the tumour was finally discovered. It had twisted around her brain and spine. Last night, Natasha’s grieving twin, Fiona, accused the health service of ignoring her sister’s complaints. ‘She was seen by so many people and none of them took her seriously,’ she said. An inquest heard that Natasha, from Radstock in Somerset, had been attending hospital since 2008 and her condition got much worse in 2010. She was referred to associate specialist paediatrician Colin Downie at Bath’s Royal United Hospital in February 2012, who said she had migraines. Because Natasha seemed to improve between each episode of ill-health, he said her symptoms were not serious enough for an MRI. In the 11 months that followed, Natasha saw four paediatric doctors, six GPs and three A&E doctors, all of whom failed to diagnose the cancer. Dr Downie finally ordered an MRI in November, nine months after he first saw the teenager, but the scan did not take place until January and the results were delivered only eight days before Natasha died. The scan showed a rare cancer – a disseminated oligodendroglioma-like leptomeningeal tumour. Grief: Natasha's mother Sarah, centre,said that one doctor accused her of 'putting the symptoms on', while twin sister Fiona, right, accused the health service of ignoring complaints made by the tragic 16-year-old, pictured left . Dr Downie told the inquest he regretted not asking for the scan to be carried out urgently. Natasha was admitted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol and  had two emergency operations on her brain and spine. She died on January 24, from lung damage caused by the cancer. At the inquest on September 19, Avon coroner Maria Voisin recorded a narrative verdict, concluding that Natasha had died from natural causes. She said there was no need to make a formal recommendation for changes at the hospital. But yesterday Mrs Simmonds, 47, told the Mail: ‘We’ll never know what would have happened if she’d been given an MRI scan when we first asked for one. ‘At the very least she wouldn’t have died so suddenly and so frightened. Patient: Natasha was referred to paediatrician Colin Downie at Bath's Royal United Hospital, pictured, who said she had migraines . Emergency: Natasha was admitted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, pictured, and had two emergency operations on her brain and spine. She died on January 24, from lung damage caused by the cancer . ‘We were so shocked. We’d been told for so long that it was migraines, we never thought it could have been cancer. She knew she was really sick and before her second operation she begged me to take her home so she could die. She spent the last few days of her life terrified.’ Mrs Simmonds, who works as a GP receptionist and is separated from Natasha’s father, Ken, added: ‘She was a beautiful person, unique and one of a kind. I just can’t believe she has gone. ‘I trusted in the medical profession and I feel so angry and let down. I’ve been told lessons have been learned but that doesn’t help when it’s your child that has died.’ A spokesman for the Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust said: ‘In the next few weeks many of the clinicians who looked after Natasha will be meeting to discuss this sad case and ensure that any opportunities for learning are not missed.’","Natasha Simmonds was seen by doctors 24 times before she died .

"She rose to fame in 2003 when her story emerged as one of only nineteen people to escape death above the point of impact in the South Tower in the 9/11 attacks. Tania Head's survival story was made all the more heartbreaking since she lost her fiance in the North Tower. America took Head into their hearts both as a victim and as the woman who publicly fought for the cause of the 9/11 survivors. But in 2007 she became infamous as the woman who made it all up. Web of Lies: Tania Head fooled the entire nation that she survived the 9/11 terror attacks . Knowing that her cover was about to be blown by an upcoming New York Times exposé, she revealed the shocking lies in 2007. Now, the extent of Tania's cruel deception is being revealed further in The Woman Who Wasn't There, a book by Robin Gaby Fisher and Angelo J. Guglielmo Jr, which is scheduled for release next month. As part of her web of lies, Head forced an actual survivor, Linda Gormley, to relive her trauma and mocked her when Ms Gormley found it difficult. The lies began in 2003 when Head emerged as a survivor of the attacks, spinning her story to a nation still deeply wounded by the attacks. Riding on the back of her lies, Head soon rose to become president of the World Trade Center Survivors’ Network. Politicians, media, fellow survivors, and the families of those who died in the attacks all drew inspiration from her fabricated tale of tragedy and triumph. Reliving the terror: Tania Head mocked and forced a genuine survivor to go through her ordeal of the attacks again . Inevitably, she also became friends with fellow survivors, including Ms Gormley. The fraudster convinced Ms Gormley that they should be leaning on one another to get through their trauma, and implored Ms Gormley to help her with her therapy. Ms Gormley was reluctant to talk in depth about the terror, but couldn't say no to her forceful friend who, she believed, had suffered more than she had in the attacks. Ms Gormley had witnessed people die, but Head had been badly burnt, nearly lost an arm and lost the love of her life, Dave, in the North Tower. Exposed: The book reveals the cruelty Tania Head caused with her deceit . Head told Gormley that she had was undergoing an intense form of treatment to help deal with her post traumatic stress called 'flooding.' The treatment involved Head reciting the terrible incidents of the attacks – and recording them. Head told Ms Gormley that, as part of the therapy, she had to then listen back to the tape until her fear receded and to enlist the help of a friend if she needed support. So Head asked her 'fellow' survivor to listen to the graphic recital with her. Ms Gormley wanted to avoid reliving the nightmare and tried in vain to postpone it. ‘You’re scared! Ha! Why should you be . scared? I’m the one who went through hell. All you have to do is listen . to a tape with me,’ Head taunted. And . trapped in Head's apartment Ms Gormley, who had herself seen people die in the . attacks, was forced to listen to the tape which brought back the terror . of her own ordeal. The . genuine survivor was made to listen to Tania talk about looking at the . lifeless body of her secretary who has been almost decapitated. ‘She has no head!’ she cries in the tape, ‘Oh my God! I can’t breathe! My skin is burning! They’re all dead, Everyone is dead!’ Ms Gormley is desperate to turn off the tape but doesn’t dare to stand up to Tania – whose forceful nature she was already aware of. Head’s . tape shines light on the intricate details she forged that tricked the entire nation into believing she was a survivor. The . tape starts with Head talking about and her future husband, Dave, . having breakfast. She dined on two sunny side up eggs, while he ate three over easy. Then they both commuted to work at the Twin Towers - she in the South Tower, and he in the North. Head, whose real name is Alicia Esteve Head, was in fact thousands of miles away at business school in Barcelona. The . Woman Who Wasn’t There reveals the intricacy of the web of lies which . allowed Head to become the face of the survivors, the woman who gave . Rudy Giulani and Michael Bloomberg a tour around Ground Zero and who . fooled the nation with her story. When her lies were exposed Head disappeared from New York although various sightings of her in the city have been reported in recent years.","Tania Head emerged in 2003 as a survivor of the 9/11 terror attack; claims she was in South Tower .

"A Lancashire supermarket chain has been forced to clear its shelves of monkey nuts - because the label doesn't state that the packet contains nuts. Booths Food, Wine and Grocery has withdrawn its Whole Hearted Roasted Monkey Nuts and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued an Allergy Alert. The company is concerned the label doesn't state the packet contains peanuts, putting those allergic to them at risk. Booths Food, Wine and Grocery has withdrawn its Whole Hearted Roasted Monkey Nuts, because the presence of peanuts is not declared on the label . The withdrawn product is Booths Whole Hearted Roasted Monkey Nuts, 350g, best before July 12, 2013. A spokesperson for the FSA said: . 'The reason for the withdrawal is that the packaging does not state the . product contains peanuts, which is a specific allergen that’s listed in . legislation. 'People who are allergic to peanuts . may not be allergic to other types of nuts. The product’s packaging is . transparent, but the nuts are still in the shells i.e. sold as monkey . nuts rather than specifically as peanuts. The FSA added: ‘EH Booths has withdrawn the product with the above date code from sale. ‘Customer notices will be displayed in stores, alerting customers to the reason for the withdrawal. ‘The company will also contact the relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members of the withdrawal. ‘Customers with an allergy to peanuts are advised not to eat this product but to return it to the nearest EH Booths store for a full refund. ‘No other EH Booths products are known to be affected.’ The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued an Allergy Alert - as the nuts pose a health risk to people allergic to peanuts . 'Without the correct information on the packaging, people with an allergy to peanuts - who might not know or make the connection between peanuts and monkey nuts, for example children - might eat the product and experience an adverse reaction.' Booths said it takes the accurate labelling very seriously. Technical manager, Waheed Hassan, alerted the FSA to this error immediately as well as posting notices in all Booths stores. ‘It is our responsibility as retailers to accurately record allergy advice, and in this instance, we felt a responsibility to recall the product and issue a notice to our customers who might suffer from a specific peanut allergy,’ he said. It is the second product the company has had to withdraw within weeks. Last month, the store withdrew some of its Edamame Bean Stir Fry because it contained soya. The news comes just two weeks after the Food Standards Agency announced that Thorntons had been forced to withdrawn three varieties of its jars containing chocolate Smiles after pieces of glass were found inside them. The confectioners said small pieces of glass had been found in the 135g and 350g milk chocolate jars and the 135g pink chocolate jar.","Booths  is concerned the label doesn't state the packet contains peanuts .

"The Mail On Sunday today exposes the massive international security risk posed by a gun that can be easily made with new 3D printers. We built the weapon, which is capable of firing a live round, from blueprints available on the internet – then smuggled it on to a packed Eurostar train. Two reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport-style security to carry the gun on to a London to Paris service in the weekend rush-hour, alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers. Reporter Simon Murphy carried the plastic gun on to a London to Paris service in the weekend rush-hour . Once on board the packed 5.31pm Eurostar train, the reporters were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm, and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers . The pistol, capable of firing a deadly 0.38-calibre bullet, was produced in under 36 hours using a revolutionary £1,700 machine to ‘print’ its components. And because all the parts are plastic, they did not trigger the metal detectors all Euro-star passengers must pass through. Last night, the train operator began an urgent investigation into the security breach as experts called for airports and public buildings to review their procedures in light of our revelations. The Mail on Sunday pieced together the 16-part pistol – called The Liberator by its creators – after downloading the designs. They were originally published by an American university student, who proved the design works by successfully firing a bullet on a shooting range. The blueprints have since been downloaded more than 100,000 times and are now widely available, despite attempts to remove them. Made entirely of plastic except for a small firing pin and ammunition, the gun presents a huge problem for security services around the world, as it can be broken down into parts that do not set off metal detectors and may not show up on conventional body and bag scanning devices. To test the procedures at St Pancras International Station, the gun produced by the MoS was split into three pieces and concealed in the clothing of two reporters who bought standard class tickets to Paris. We then walked through the usual security procedures, manned by UK Border officials. We placed our luggage and metal objects, including loose change and watches, in plastic trays which were then passed through airport scanners. But although we were carrying parts of a potentially deadly weapon, we were able to walk through a metal detector without triggering the alarm. While some passengers were patted down by security guards, we proceeded unchallenged to passport control, manned by French police. Once on board the packed 5.31pm Eurostar train on Friday, we were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm in just 30 seconds, and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers. We did not attempt to smuggle the firing pin or bullet for safety and legal reasons, but small metal items could be easily concealed. Last night, security experts and politicians said they were horrified at the implications of our investigation. Lord West, the former Labour security Minister, called for a review to see how the ‘extremely dangerous’ weapons could be better detected. But he said he was ‘not surprised’ that Eurostar checks had failed to spot the weapon because they were so hard to detect. He said: ‘What we need is a review of how we can look at these things and how we can discover them more easily. That will take work and it will cost money. ‘These weapons are extremely dangerous because they are very difficult to detect with the methods we normally use. This is going to be a real problem, no doubt about it. People are going to have to rethink whether we need more checks.’ A Eurostar spokeswoman said last night: ‘Eurostar has a high level of security, with a number of checks  as specified by the authorities in order to protect the integrity of the Channel Tunnel. We take any issue relating to security very seriously. We will be investigating immediately to fully understand the nature of this issue with our security partner which carries out checks on our behalf at St Pancras. We will also investigate the matter with the Department for Transport, who oversee our security operation, and specify the checks that need to be undertaken.’ The Transport Department said the UK had ‘one of the strictest transport security regimes in the world’ and added: ‘This is kept under constant review in response to  new or emerging threats, but we do not comment on specifics for obvious reasons.’ Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas spent the last year designing the weapon. A self-styled libertarian, he argues that everyone should have access to guns, and said last week: ‘I recognise the tool might be used to harm other people .  .  . it’s a gun. But I don’t think that’s a reason not to do it.’ The US State Department last week rushed to ban the plastic firearm, but security sources fear the worst after the document was uploaded to file-sharing websites. One user, DakotaSmith, wrote: ‘This is the first in what will be an avalanche of undetectable, untraceable, easy-to-manufacture weapons that will turn the tables on evil-doers the world over. Share and enjoy.’ Reporter Simon Murphy puts the 3D gun together in the Eurostar toilet . Firearms experts advised The Mail on Sunday not to test whether the weapon would fire due to safety  and legal concerns. But the lapse in security will shock travellers. Chris Yates, an aviation security analyst, said: ‘If Eurostar security can be breached in this way, then so can airport security processes. ‘Authorities should be extremely worried. The obvious danger is that if you have the ability to print out a gun on a 3D printer from a blueprint downloaded online, then the probability is that a terrorist has that capability as well .  .  . which could have devastating consequences.  They could potentially cause a problem at 38,000ft that would cause the aircraft to crash or be hijacked.’ Lord West added: ‘If you actually have to search people’s baggage and go through it all, travel becomes a misery and the terrorists, in a sense, have won. There has to be a balance.’ However, he said that more sophisticated scanners might be able to detect the 3D weapons. All of the major parts of the model were made using a program which reads files that tell the printer how to create each component from layer upon layer of plastic. The only other part of the gun is a 25mm metal piece, which acts as the firing pin, and can be purchased from any hardware store. The pistol can only be fired once using a .38 calibre round before the plastic barrel has to be replaced. The body of the gun was made in just a day with smaller parts taking only a matter of hours. In order to comply with gun manufacturing regulations in the US,  Mr Wilson purposely designed his weapon with a steel component in the handle to make it detectable. But it is not essential, and the gun can still be fired without it. The Home Office said: ‘The UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world. Anyone wanting to manufacture or own a firearm, including one produced through 3D printing, would need a licence. Anyone manufacturing guns without a licence is liable to prosecution.’ The MoS, which carried out its investigations in the public interest, has now dismantled the gun. The Liberator plastic gun is a simple single-shot weapon that fires a small .380-caliber bullet .","Weapon capable of firing a live round smuggled on to packed Eurostar .

"You can be forgiven for forgetting the name of that new acquaintance just minutes after you've been introduced, according to memory experts at University of Sussex. Scientists revealed that while memories can be recalled several hours after learning them, they are inaccessible to us for a period. Although it is not fully understood why . such lapses happen, it is believed to be because they are a necessary . part of the brain's process to avoid overloading with information. What's your name again? Try as you might, information like a person's name takes several hours to be consolidated in the brain . University of Sussex neuroscientists said that any disturbances during these memory lapses disrupt the process and stop memories being formed. One of the experts, Dr Ildiko Kemenes, said: 'Scientists have long wondered why the brain shows these memory lapses. 'Memory formation is an . energy-consuming process. 'The brain would need to decide if it was . worth expending energy for the consolidation of that particular memory. 'The brain has a restricted capacity to learn things and preventing some memory formation would be a way to avoid overload.' In his research, Dr Kemenes introduced an unknown substance to snails' diets to see if they would learn to recognise it as food. When they were fed again, scientists found the snails responded to the stimulus, with memory lapses after 30 minutes and two hours, before the memory became consolidated at about four hours. But if the snail received another different stimulus during the memory-lapse periods, the memory consolidation became disrupted, it was discovered.","Brains are overloaded with information, say University of Sussex scientists ."
"Christmas miracle: This one-year-old Lhasa apso dubbed Miracle was found alive inside a Dumpster on Long Island 18 hours after she was stuffed inside a plastic bag and thrown out . A Long Island shelter worker has been arraigned on animal cruelty and abuse charges after a puppy was found dirty and matted inside a Dumpster. Kennel attendant Michael Papini, 30, was ordered held on $250 cash bail or $500 bond. He did not enter a plea Saturday. Authorities say the female Lhasa apso  nicknamed ‘Miracle’ by her rescuers was found wearing a pink collar and leash in a commercial trash bin outside a gas station in West Islip early Christmas Eve. Papini was identified as the suspect after news outlets aired surveillance footage showing a driver dumping a black plastic bag at the gas station nearly 20 hours earlier. Authorities said Papini, who worked as a janitor at the shelter, was paid $250 by an acquaintance to take her two dogs off her hands because she could no longer take care of them. Instead of bringing the pooches to the kennel as promised, police say Papini let one dog, a poodle, out into the street, Newsday reported. The animal has not been seen since. He then allegedly stuffed the second pet, the grey and white Lhasa apso, into a cardboard animal carrier, placed the container inside a plastic bag and dumped it into a trash bin at a gas station in West Islip just before 8am Monday. Heartless: Islip Animal Shelter employee Michael Papini, 30, was arrested Friday and charged with animal abandonment and animal cruelty for dumping the adorable Lhasa apso and a poodle, which has not been found . Devious: SPCA officials say Papini was paid $250 by an acquittance to take her two dogs to the shelter, but instead he let one of them go into the street and dumped the grey and white pooch in the garbage . About 18 hours later, a homeless man rummaging through the garbage bin found the dog and called SPCA at 2.10am. Officials believe the pup was able to chew her way out of the plastic bag by the time she was rescued from the bin, her fur filthy and matted. She was taken to a veterinary clinic and was said to be in good health. Papini was arrested at his home in Lindenhurst Friday after police were tipped off about his whereabouts by someone who had recognized him from surveillance footage that aired on TV. Papini's attorney told CBS New York her client has no criminal record. The kennel worker has been suspended from his job without pay in the wake of the incident. Crime scene: The pooch was found inside a commercial garbage container at this USA gas station in West Islip Christmas Eve . Reprimanded: Papini has been suspended without pay from his work a the Islip Animal Shelter (pictured) He was charged with felony aggravated animal cruelty, two counts of abandonment of animals, two counts of animal abuse and one count of petty larceny. ‘For somebody to take a live animal, put it in a box and black plastic bag, for somebody to find it -- it's a million-to-one shot,’ said SPCA Chief Ropy Gross. ‘It's a miracle for that dog to survive.’ The Islip Animal Shelter has released a statement saying that the incident involving Papini does not reflect the treatment of animals from its dedicated staff and volunteers.","Islip Animal Shelter employee Michael Papini, 30, was arrested and charged with animal abandonment and animal cruelty .

"This in the cruel Taiwanese college student who stuffed her cat into a jar as a 'punishment for misbehaving'.

Following the backlash the student, who attends Taichung's Providence University, told The China Post that she has put her pet in the jar to experiment with different ways of transporting it. She claimed that she had only tried it once, but it didn't work because the trapped feline would not fit into a bag.

"One of Britain's best-loved buildings turns 50 this week. A point of reference for cab drivers and a memorable mark on the skyline for tourists, the BT Tower has stood strong for the past five decades despite changing name no less than three times. Construction was completed on July 15, 1964, and the £9 million building was named the Post Office Tower, and later, London Telecom Tower. The BT Tower, then known as the Post Office Tower, was the tallest building in Britain when it was completed on July 15, 1964. This year the country celebrates its 50th anniversary . It formed part of the British Telecom network and its primary purpose was to support the aerials then used to carry telecommunications traffic from London to the rest of the country. The tower provided 40 channels with black and white or colour television. Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who came to power in 1964, marked the opening a year later on October 8, 1965. At 189 metres, it was known as Britain’s highest building at the time. During the first year the Tower was open to the public it was visited by nearly one million visitors, 105,000 of whom dined in the revolving restaurant. The cost of visiting the Tower was four shillings (20p) and half price for children. Men at work: Construction of the iconic BT Tower began in 1961 and was completed four years later .

In 1964, the Beatles took on America, and won. Their single ‘I want to hold your hand’ claimed number one spot in the US charts in January. After a send-off from Heathrow involving thousands of screaming fans, the Beatles arrived in New York on February 7, 1964. They were welcoming by equal fervour in America. Five thousand fans crowded the airport’s arrivals building, waving placards and banners to welcome the group. While the Beatles took over America, the struggle for apartheid was about to suffer a serious blow. In 1964, its leader Nelson Mandela was jailed for life for plotting to destroy the South African state by sabotage. With his fist raised in the air, Mandela was transported to Robben Island, seven miles off Cape Town, sparking international protests. He would later tell the Larry King Live Show in 2000: ‘I was called a terrorist yesterday, but when I came out of jail, many people embraced me, including my enemies, and that is what I normally tell other people who say those who are struggling for liberation in their country are terrorists. I tell them that I was also a terrorist yesterday, but, today, I am admired by the very people who said I was one.’ Blast: The BT Tower sustained damage after a bomb was planted by the IRA. No-one was hurt but the restaurant at the top was closed off to the public. Here journalists examine the damage . Six years later and the BT Tower would be dealing with a terrorism problem of its own. Unfortunately the Tower’s prowess on London’s skyline proved an inevitable attraction to terrorists. In 1971, the country was in shock when a bomb placed by the IRA exploded on the 31st floor of the Tower. No-one was hurt by the device, which was believed to have been planted in a toilet on the lowest of the public viewing gallery. While the building sustained damage, it wasn’t irreparable and unknown to the public, the tower was secretly designed to withstand a nuclear attack on London, and to serve as part of a military microwave communication network. Years later the Tower withstood the 1987 hurricane which took the roof off the Old Bailey, and remained the tallest building in London until the NatWest Tower was built in 1981. The original purpose of the Tower, designed and built by the Ministry of Public Building and Works, was to transmit high frequency radio waves which would allow for the rapid expansion of the telephone network without the crippling expense of tunnelling under the capital to lay cables. The system could only work if the tower remained stable. To this day, the BT Tower remains as iconic as ever, relaying signals between broadcasters, production companies, advertisers, international satellite services.","Construction on the BT Tower, then known as the Post Office Tower, was competed on July 15, 1964 .

"Wealthy Londoners can now park their supercars in the city’s most exclusive area for just £2.30 a day - if they are willing to pay £85,000 for the spot. Three spaces in a car park on Park Lane in Mayfair, central London, have been put on the market on century-long leases for a combined £255,000. But despite the eye-watering price-tag, the parking spots in W1 work out considerably cheaper than if motorists wanted to pay per day. Pricey spot: Three spaces in this car park on Park Lane in Mayfair, central London, have been put on the market for a combined £255,000 . Good value: Despite the eye-watering price-tag, the parking spots in W1 work out considerably cheaper than if motorists wanted to pay per day . It would normally cost £9 per hour, £49 for 24 hours or £3,600 for a 12-month parking ticket at the car park. These spaces work out at around £2.30 per day for the duration of the leases, which vary between 105 and 110 years. The spots, which cost the same as a new Porsche 911 and have 24-hour security, will pay for themselves in less than 23 years. They have also been described as an excellent investment with Mayfair parking in demand as more properties are returned to residential use. Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates, said: ‘Finding a secure and safe location to park your car in Mayfair is a rare find due to lack of space. Extraordinary prices: It would normally cost £9 per hour, £49 for 24 hours or £3,600 for a 12-month parking ticket at the car park . ‘Each space has between 105 to 110 year . leases, meaning that if you owned it for the duration, parking would . equate to just £2.30 on average per day. ‘And with parking spaces becoming increasingly more desirable, these spaces are a good long term investment.’ Despite the high price, it is certainly not the most expensive place to park - after a new record was set in April for Britain’s most expensive garage. The sale was for a 568ft former coach . house in Camberwell, south London, which went for an extraordinary . £550,000 - triple the asking price. However, . if you wanted to invest a spare £85,000 in property rather than a car . parking space, you could buy a three-bedroom cottage in the South West.

The former mining town of 15,000 residents is famous for being the birthplace of actress Kristin Scott Thomas and musician Mick Fleetwood. It is four miles from the coast, sits in the middle of a Unesco World Heritage Site and has an average house value of £185,000. However, if you fancy commuting to London, the first train from Redruth to Paddington is the 5.25am service, which does not arrive until 10.02am. Earlier this month the Mail reported how the average cost of a London house has now topped £400,000 for the first time after a 26 per cent increase. But there is now a gap of more than £200,000 between a property in the capital and elsewhere - where the average price of a home is just £185,478.","Three spaces put on market for combined £255,000 for 100-year leases .

Built on an ancient pagan burial ground - and also believed to be the scene of child sacrifices and devil worship - the Cotswolds cottage is haunted by the likes of a murdered young girl called Rosie, a high priestess, and even a male sex demon, known as an incubus.

The Ancient Ram Inn, in the village of Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, is believed to be riddled with up to 20 spectres who torment the paying punters of the 12th century home. Above, owner Caroline Humphries . Is that a ghost on the staircase? The Ram Inn, built in 1145, has long been home to a variety of spooks . While renovating the property, Ms Humphries' father, John, discovered small bones and daggers under the earth - and believes that children had been sacrificed there to pagan gods years ago . The strange goings on include a blood-curdling child’s scream, ‘electrified’ wooden beams, and even the touch of an invisible force. Caroline Humphries, whose family has lived in the Ram Inn for nearly 50 years, said: 'My father won’t go anywhere without his Bible.' But despite its ghoulish reputation, Ms Humphries is inundated with visitors who are desperate to spend a night in Britain’s spookiest lodgings, which were built in 1145 and costs between £25 and £30 per night. Past guests have fled from the house in the middle of the night after claiming to have seen furniture flying around the bedrooms, visions of a little girl wandering the hallways, and have even been pushed down onto a bed by a randy incubus. Spooky: This unedited picture captures a ghostly figure moving in the Bishop's room in Britain's most haunted B&B . Apparition: A mysterious haze appears in one of the rooms in the Ancient Ram Inn, in Gloucester, in this unedited photograph . Sleep tight... The Bishop's room is said to be the most haunted place at the inn . The Ancient Ram Inn is haunted by the likes of a murdered young girl called Rosie, a high priestess - and even a male sex demon, known as an incubus . Ms Humphries said she used to hear the ghosts of murdered children crying in one of the bedrooms. Since filling it with toys, they seem to have calmed down . Some have leapt from first-floor windows . at the back of the property onto a grass slope from a height of a few . feet - but no one has been injured as a result. Now, it is packed out with ghost hunters and horror writers - who are queueing up to spend a night with the demons. One ghost investigator who visited the house was spooked when a presence pushed up against his back - and felt the wooden beams of the medieval house vibrate and tremble when he grabbed onto them in fear. A mysterious child’s scream was even captured on video - seconds after a man’s voice is heard to shout: 'Get out!' Ms Humphries, 51, said: 'When I was a . child, I was so scared of the house I used to sleep in a caravan . outside. 'It was normal for us to see people running out of the house, . screaming in terror. 'Once, I woke up and found a chest of drawers hovering over my bed - before it crashed down the staircase.

'People have told us they’ve seen a high priestess sitting in one of the bedrooms, objects move and spin, and we used to hear the ghosts of murdered children screaming and crying in one of the bedrooms. 'We put some children’s toys in the room for them to play with and they don’t cry as much any more. 'The whole house is absolutely terrifying.' Ms Humphries father, John, 85, was pulled from his bed by a spirit on the first night the family moved into the home - and after researching the history of the house, he was horrified to discover an ancient burial ground lay beneath.

Ms Humphries is seen conducting a seance. Her father never goes anywhere without a Bible . And years later, while renovating the home, he discovered small bones and daggers under the earth - and believes that children had been sacrificed there to pagan gods years ago. Ms Humphries added: 'Once we had disturbed one grave, we didn’t want to go digging any further, and we’ve left the house exactly as it stands. 'Paranormal experts love staying here, but we couldn’t carry on running the house as a normal bed and breakfast - it’s just too haunted. 'I don’t think we’ll ever be able to sell the house - no one in their right mind would buy it. 'But after nearly 50 years here, I’ve accepted that we have to live with some unwanted house guests.'

"It was a daring bid for freedom that could have come straight out of The Great Escape or The Colditz Story. But the intrepid five who attempted to tunnel under a spike-topped 12ft metal fence using nothing more than pilfered cutlery were not plucky PoWs fleeing the Nazis – but Nottingham schoolboys trying to break out of their city academy. If any of the youngsters tasted liberty, however, it was short- lived as the culprits were soon rounded up, and the already imposing security measures tightened up even further to thwart future escape efforts. Pupils dug a hole in an out-of-the-way spot within the grounds of Djanogly City Academy, Nottingham (above) Their hole – dug in an out-of-the-way spot in fields within the grounds of Djanogly City Academy – has now been filled in, and a metal bar inserted to strengthen the fence, which was designed to ensure under-16s do not leave school grounds. Acting headteacher Elaine Crookes said the pupils, thought to be all under 14, have been ‘spoken to’  and vowed: ‘Our staff are supervising that area to ensure our students stay in school.’ The school takes tough measures to combat truancy. As well the forbidding fence, its security also includes a ‘swipe-in’ system. Tracey Phillipson, whose daughter is a Year 9 pupil, said: ‘The fencing with security signs all over it does make it look a bit more like a prison than a school and I guess to some pupils that’s a challenge.' Assistant head Andy Roach wrote about the audacious breakout bid in an email to staff last week. He said: ‘Regarding students digging a hole under the fence to escape... I have some updates.’ He said groundsmen had ‘filled in the hole and put a metal bar across the bottom of the fence in that area. ‘However, can staff on duty on the back field please keep an eye on them digging any more holes for this purpose in other areas along the fence. Assistant head Andy Roach wrote about the audacious breakout bid in an email to staff last week . ‘Quite a lot of cutlery was found in the area, presumably stolen from the canteen  to aid their digging, so if staff on  the duty can keep an eye on students smuggling cutlery out of  the canteen...’ Housewife Jamila Khaliq, whose home backs onto the school playing fields, said of the escape bid: ‘I can’t believe they would even try such a thing. Since they put in the new fencing, we have all thought it was impossible for any pupil to get out. ‘It can be noisy in the back garden sometimes. I hear a lot of shouting and swearing – but never any digging.’ Former pupil Farzan Fazal, 20, described the school as ‘security mad’, adding: ‘They have even had  a marked car patrolling the area looking for truants. They give out fines if your child truants a lot.’ He added: ‘It would not be easy to dig a hole under that fence with a spade let alone a spoon. ‘When I was there in 2005, the fencing was smaller and we could slip out and go home for lunch. I guess that is what they were trying to do. Most secondary schools will let you go but Djanogoly has never allowed it. That’s why they built the bigger fencing.’ The school has now imposed tighter security measures after the bid for freedom - which could have come straight out of The Great Escape (above) The school, which is in the deprived . Hyson Green area of the city, is in ‘special measures’ after an . inspection by the watchdogs Ofsted last year ruled it was ‘inadequate’. It has suffered from high truancy rates, and pupils aged under 16 are not allowed out of the grounds without permission during the day. Ofsted also noted in its report: ‘Students’ conduct, particularly outside lessons, shows a lack of respect for belonging to the academy.’ Ms Crookes said: ‘We can confirm that five pupils tried to leave the school at lunchtime by getting below the fence on the fields at our Gregory Boulevard site. ‘We have spoken to the students concerned, and taken action to repair the hole. That part of the fence has also been reinforced. Our staff are supervising that area to ensure our students stay safe and in school.’","Pupils at Djanogly City Academy, Nottingham dug hole in school grounds .

"An 11-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan shot dead a rare albino deer with his crossbow while on a hunting trip with his father last Monday. While a child being able to hunt a deer may seem like a long shot, it's even more unlikely is that one could nab an elusive albino deer. Gavin Dingman shot the buck while being supervised by his father Mick Dingman on a hunting outing. Young hunter: Gavin Dingman shot the rare albino deer while being supervised by his father Mick Dingman . USA Today reports that just one in 20,000 deer are born albino. Some biologists claim that just one in 100,000 deer are albinos. 'He kind of feels like a rock star right now. Everyone is calling, all of the hunting shows and hunting magazines,' Mick Dingman told the Livingston Daily. This isn't the first time the Dingmans have spotted the albino deer either. They've seen the majestic white buck several times in the past couple of years and have taken photos of it. 'The whole neighborhood is familiar with it. Quite a few of the guys in the neighborhood were trying to get it,' Mick Dingman said. Gavin Dingman and his 13-year-old brother Graham take turns hunting with their father and on that one the Monday the deer was killed, it was Gavin's turn. Mick told reporters his son was 'nervous' at first when attempting to shoot the deer. 'My dad was just like, take a deep breath. Are you sure you can take the shot? If you're not 100 percent, we don't want to injure it,' “the boy told The Livingston Daily. Gavin was able to shoot the buck from 30 yards away. 'I double-lunged it,' he said. This isn't Gavin's first hunting victory. His prize: While 11-year-old Gavin being able to hunt a deer may seem like a long shot, it's even more unlikely is that one could nab an elusive albino deer . Last year he shot a deer 'straight through the heart.' While Mick is proud of his son, he's received some criticism from outsiders for letting his son take a shot at a deer. 'I've had people tell me, ""You should have taken the shot. You don't let an 11-year-old take a shot at a deer like that,” ‘he said. 'To me, in my opinion, it doesn't matter if it's a spike or a doe or a trophy deer. If you have confidence in them, it shouldn't matter what they are shooting at.' To memorialize Gavin's big moment, a taxidermist will stuff and create a full-body mount of the deer. 'It's too rare and too pretty not to spend the extra money and have the whole thing done,' Mick Dingman said. Gavin told The Livingston Daily that his friends and schoolmates are in awe of his accomplishment. 'They are like, wow, that is so cool,' he said. What is a trophy deer for Gavin would be a misdemeanor in other states, reports USA Today. Albino deer are illegal to kill in Illinois, Iowa, parts of Montana, Tennessee and Wisconsin. Michigan also prohibited killing them up until 2008. Other states don't have any restrictions based on the belief that albinos are inferior genetic stock. The albino deer have poor eyesight and are pale which make them more prone to being caught by other predators in the wild--and in civilization. Memorialized: A taxidermist will stuff and create a full-body mount of the deer to remember the big day .","Gavin Dingman of Michigan shot the buck while being supervised by his father Mick Dingman .

"It is the largest shark ever to have lived, weighing 50 tonnes and measuring 18 feet long. However, swimmers can breathe a sigh of relief - the megalodon really did become extinct 2.6 millions years ago. Recently it was claimed the shark could still exist - forcing researchers into pinpointing its exact date of demise . Megalodon, (Carcharodon megalodon) a 50 tonne extinct species of shark which lived between the Eocene and the Pliocene Period. The maximum size of the Megalodon has been of much debate - cartilage rarely fossilises and therefore no complete shark has ever been found. However, it is believed they may have reached 18 feet long. However, near-complete sets of dentitions have been found, which allows for accurate reconstruction. The Megalodon's colossal mouth would have produced a but force of 10.8 to 18.2 tons. Researchers from University of Florida and the University of Zurich hope the study appearing online today in the journal PLOS ONE showing the species became extinct 2.6 million years ago will clarify public confusion. The study may also one day help scientists better understand the potential widespread effects of losing the planet's top predators, said lead author Catalina Pimiento. 'I was drawn to the study of Carcharocles megalodon's extinction because it is fundamental to know when species became extinct to then begin to understand the causes and consequences of such an event,' said Pimiento, a doctoral candidate at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the UF campus. 'I also think people who are interested in this animal deserve to know what the scientific evidence shows, especially following Discovery Channel specials that implied megalodon may still be alive.' The study represents the first phase of Pimiento's ongoing reconstruction of megalodon's extinction. As modern top predators, especially large sharks, are significantly declining worldwide due to the current biodiversity crisis, Pimiento said this study serves as the basis to better understand the consequences of these changes. 'When you remove large sharks, then small sharks are very abundant and they consume more of the invertebrates that we humans eat,' Pimiento said. 'Recent estimations show that large-bodied, shallow-water species of sharks are at greatest risk among marine animals, and the overall risk of shark extinction is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates.' A tooth of the prehistoric shark megalodon compared to the tooth of a great white shark. The Megalodon's colossal mouth would have produced a but force of 10.8 to 18.2 tons. Pimiento plans to further investigate possible correlations between changes in megalodon's distribution and the evolutionary trends of marine mammals, such as whales and other sharks. 'When we calculated the time of megalodon's extinction, we noticed that the modern function and gigantic sizes of filter feeder whales became established around that time,' Pimiento said. 'Future research will investigate if megalodon's extinction played a part in the evolution of these new classes of whales.' The slowly unraveling details of megalodon's extinction and various aspects of its natural history have consumed Pimiento's research for the past six years, including ongoing analysis of megalodon's body size and a 2010 PLOS ONE study that proposed Panama served as a nursery habitat for the species. The maximum size of the Megalodon has been of much debate - cartilage rarely fossilises and therefore no complete shark has ever been found. For the new study, researchers used databases and scientific literature of the most recent megalodon records and calculated the extinction using a novel mathematical model proven reliable in recent experimental testing by study co-author Christopher F. Clements with the Institute of Evolutionary Biologyand Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich . Vertebrate paleontologist Jorge Velez-Juarbe with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County said the study will not only serve as a key reference for debunking the myth that megalodon still exists, but its novel methods will influence the future of scientific research of extinct animals and plants. 'The methodology that the authors used had only been previously employed to determine extinction dates in historical times, such as to estimate the extinction date of the dodo bird,' Velez-Juarbe said. 'In this work, scientists applied that same methodology to determine the extinction of an organism millions of years ago, instead of hundreds. 'It's a new tool that paleo biologists didn't have, or rather had not thought of using before.'","Follows Discovery channel shows claiming animal could still be alive .

"Most of us spend time every morning daubing our faces with eye creams, moisturisers, foundations and powders in effort to minimise the eye bags that scream 'I had five glasses of Malbec and fewer hours of sleep last night' to our colleagues. But women in Korea are doing everything they can to make their under-eye skin plumper - whether through make-up or by using little sticky strips of tape that make the skin beneath the eye 'pop' out. Some women are even having plastic surgery to achieve the look, while others are resorting to using commercial filler and fat grafts. The new trend - considered to make you more attractive and youthful-looking - is called 'aegyo sal', translated as 'eye smiles' or 'cute skin', and involves accentuating the fatty deposits beneath eyes rather than drawing attention to the dark circles caused by sleep deprivation. Eyes that really pop: Weibo provides an online picture tutorial demonstrating how to achieve aegyo sal, the Korean trend for increasing the amount of 'puff' beneath the eye through make-up, sticky tape or plastic surgery . Blogger Patricia Cahiga, who has written a post on blog.myfatpocket.com about how to achieve the look, explains: 'Aegyo sal are not eyebags. 'Eyebags are caused by lack of sleep or if you're unlucky, caused by your genes and makes you look like a sleep deprived zombie or an unadorable panda, but aegyo sal is loosely translated as ""cute/beautiful skin"". 'Aegyo Sal is the layer of skin under the eyelids that gives your eyes more life and basically makes it look bigger.' Chinese website Weibo demonstrates how to achieve the look using tiny strips of sticky plastic, and make-up bloggers have posted tutorial videos on YouTube showing how to use make-up alone to make eye puff more pronounced. Before and after: Blogger Patricia Cahigas demonstrates aegyo sal using make-up alone . Asian Eyelid Surgery is a website run by plastic surgeon Dr Kenneth Kim explaining procedures often carried out on eyes in the Far East. They write: 'Youthful lower eyelid fullness is commonly seen in younger Asian females. 'Essentially, it is a bulge of fat immediately under the lash line that creates puffiness under the lower eyelid. 'Different from eye bags, which can make one appear tired and aged, youthful lower eyelid fullness gives the appearance of youthful, friendlier eyes as it is associated with smiling. 'Anatomically, it is a result of increased hypertrophy of the orbicularis oculi (under eye muscle), which becomes more pronounced when one smiles. 'This is a highly desired feature in Korea and other Asian cultures. Koreans call youthful lower eyelid fullness aegyo-sal; aegyo meaning cute and charming.' Spot the difference: Korean blogs highlight the difference between eye bags and aegyo sal . Dr Kim continues: 'Youthful lower eyelid fullness procedure can be done in combination with lower eyelid surgery. 'Using the same incision site created for the lower blepharoplasty the surgeon can create youthful lower eyelid fullness by suspending the orbicularis oculi muscle back to its original position before muscle atrophy.' Another popular method is using Restylane commercial filler or fat grafting, which involves the transferring of one's own fat tissue (usually from the abdomen, thigh, or hip area) to the under-eye to create more volume.

"Russian authorities secretly recorded one of the Boston bombers discussing jihad with his mother in 2011 but failed to alert U.S. security agencies, a report claims today. U.S. officials were told for the first time this week that two calls of note were discovered when the Russian internal security service, the RSB, were bugging calls at the Tsarnaevs family home in Dagestan, according to reports. The recording picked up a 'vague conversation' about jihad between either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan Tsarnaev and their mother Zubeidat, the Associated Press reported. It also picked up a phone call between the bombers' mother and a man under FBI investigation living in Southern Russia. Calls: Reports emerged today that one of the brothers shared a phone call discussing jihad with their mother Zubeidat . Monitored: Two calls made by Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the two Boston bombing suspects, were monitored by Russian security forces . American security sources anonymously revealed the information to the news agency and said if the calls had been flagged to the FBI, the agency may have conducted a more detailed investigation into the two men. There was no evidence of a plot against America in the calls, according to the report. The news comes as the FBI attempts to defend itself against criticism that it failed to fully investigate Tamerlan Tsarnaev that year. In January, the agency investigated and interviewed the family after Russian authorities flagged the elder bomber as a possible security threat. It is not clear why the phone calls would not have been reported to American security officers as part of that briefing and the RSB were unavailable for comment. Following their probe, the FBI concluded Tamerlan did not present a threat and ceased monitoring him stating they saw no links to  ‘terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.’ Sen. Lindsay Graham (R.South Carolina) said the agency had 'dropped the ball' in that probe. Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the Russian government followed up their concerns over Tamerlan six months later - asking the CIA for whatever information it had on him. Boss: Zubeydat Tsarnaev, mother of the terrorist suspect brothers Dzokhar and Tamerlan, is also accused of letting a radical cleric preach to her boys in their family kitchen . American . dream: Father Anzor, left, and mother Zubeidat, center, with baby . Tamerlan and an uncle  sought a better life in the U.S. It is not clear what prompted the Russian request but the CIA review agreed with the FBI that Tamerlan posed no threat. As a precaution they placed him on a 70,000 name watch-list called the the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment. However, there were mistakes in both the spelling of his name and in his date of birth, so his six month departure from the country in 2012 wasn't properly identified, according to the Times. The first Russian request came in March 2011 through the FBI’s office in the United States Embassy in Moscow. In a one-page request they said Tsarnaev 'had changed drastically since 2010' and was preparing 'to join unspecified underground groups'. By June 2011 the FBI said they were satisfied he provided no threat and notified Russia. They also added him to another watch-list - the Treasury Enforcement Communications System. According to the Times, the FBI repeatedly went back to Russia to request more detail but they failed to provide any new information. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva has come under increasing scrutiny in recent days given her outspoken denial of her sons' actions and wild accusations of a cover-up. She has repeatedly said her sons were framed and even claimed blood on the streets, after the bombings, was paint. On Friday, it emerged agents now consider her 'a person of interest' in their investigation. '[She (Zubeidat) is a person of interest that we're looking at to see if she helped radicalize her son, or had contacts with other people or other terrorist groups,' Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat from Maryland, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said. Both sons appear to have had a close relationship with their mother. Just before his death Tamerlan made a final call to her saying 'Mama I love you'. She was intending to travel with her husband to the U.S. last week but both delayed those plans. She said any suggestion she has links to terrorist activity are 'lies and hypocrisy'.","U.S. security sources reveal Russians had wire-tapped the Tsarnaev family in 2011 .

War veteran . association member Osvaldo Hilliar said the crew had ignored strong . ‘local feeling’ about the Falklands. Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies. He was forced to apologise this year after it was claimed he mumbled the N-word while reciting a well-known children’s rhyme. In July, Ofcom ruled he deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a ‘slope’ during a Burma special. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot. Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ in 2009. And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

Hounded out: Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters have been forced to leave Argentina early after inciting outrage among local Falklands War veterans by driving a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL . He added: ‘We told them we couldn’t guarantee their security if they didn’t leave.’ Despite claims by Top Gear that the choice of number plate was a coincidence, Argentine officials say it was a deliberate provocation. Local mayor Gustavo Melella vowed to make an official protest to the British Embassy in Argentina. ‘We are peace-loving people but they’ve generated the initial violence by coming to our country in the way they have,’ he said. A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘We’re pleased the team is safe and would like to thank all of those who have helped.’ Clarkson's Porsche is pictured abandoned with the offending number plate removed. The team were forced to leave Argentina three days early . The presenters, as well as members of their film crew were pelted with stones. One of the team - a Argentinian technician - was reportedly injured after being hit in the face . Locals took to Twitter to gloat over the presenter's out-of-character surrender. One said: 'It looks like Jeremy Clarkson got a taste of his own medicine' The Mirror reported that Clarkson had been warned not to cause a diplomatic incident, so the presenter responded with this tweet .

"Experts have said shrapnel-covered damage on the front of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is consistent with a missile hit. Photographs show pieces of the Boeing 777 have tiny holes indicating small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally, it has been reported. Reed Foster, a defense analyst, told the New York Times that the two likely causes were an engine explosion or an exploding missile. Scroll down for video . Pieces of the Boeing 777 have tiny holes suggesting small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally . According to Mr Foster, the SA-11 missiles intercept targeted aircraft before exploding near it creating a cloud of shrapnel. An SA-11 missile carries about 46 pounds of explosives and detonates about 100 to 300 feet away from the target. After it has been detonated the warhead shatters creating a shrapnel cloud which hits the plane causing critical damage to the aircraft. The photographs show that the holes are about the same size which also supports the claim the plane was hit by shrapnel. According to analysts, the perforation holes visible on the debris are consistent with high-velocity shrapnel from fragmenting warheads . More evidence is now mounting up which backs Ukraine's claim that the aircraft carrying 298 people was shot down by mistake by pro-Russian separatists and Russian military personel with an SA-11 missile launched from a Buk-M1. Justin Bronk, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times: 'The size of the shrapnel holes in consistent with what one might expect to see from an SA-11 hit. 'However it is difficult to assess the total blast pattern with such a small fragment of fuselage. A piece of wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, in a field near Rozsypne in the eastern Ukraine . Douglas Barrie, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, also said the damage caused was consistent with the kind of damage you would expect from the detonation of a warhead. An Australian air force plane and refrigerated trucks have now arrived in Holland to wait for the MH17 victims but it is now feared only 200 bodies have been recovered. There were 298 people on board the doomed aircraft. Pro-Russian rebels, right, followed by members of the OSCE mission, walk by plane wreckage . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also says there are still human remains lying on the crash site. Jain Tuinder, a Dutch official leading the investigation, said just 200 bodies had arrived in Kharkiv today adding: 'We will not leave until every remain has left this country so we will have to go on and bargain again with the people over there.’ It has also emerged that the cockpit is believed to have been sawn in half while under the control of Russian-backed separatists.","Photographs show pieces of the Boeing 777 with tiny holes .

"Friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev arrested last week who cruised around in a car with the ‘Terrorista #1’ license plate have also been revealed to be two of the group of friends recently photographed with the Boston Marathon bomber in Times Square. The two 19-year-old men from Kazakhstan are Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev. They were classmates of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Authorities say they were detained for . immigration violations on April 20 after being questioned in connection . with the attack, which occurred a few days earlier. Best of friends: Azamat Tazhayakov, left, Dias Kadyrbayev, center, and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, are pictured in New York's Times Square . Wrong plate, wrong time: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends liked to cruise around in a car with the 'Terrorista #1' license plate . A lawyer for one of two jailed college friends of a Boston Marathon bombing suspect say they had nothing to do with the deadly attack and had seen no hints he harbored any violent or terrorist sympathies. Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl, says the students are shocked by the allegations against Tsarnaev and just want to go home. 'These kids are just as shocked and horrified about what happened as everyone else,' Stahl said. He said they are being held for . violating their student visas by not regularly attending classes and . want to return to Kazakhstan as soon as possible. Terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev would hang out at the their New Bedford, Mass. apartment frequently and may have stayed with them on the night of the bombing and the following night. The two students drive a black BMW 330XI . with the personalized plate and a sticker on the back which reads: ‘F*** . you, you f****** f****’. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev have been detained for immigration violations since April 20 . Complex: The apartment complex where the men live is about 10 minutes from the Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, had been a student . Los terroristas means ‘the terrorists’ in Spanish but it's also a slang reference to 'buddies and friends.' The pair were led out of their apartment last Friday in handcuffs before police carried out an extensive search of their home. Federal agents first took Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev into custody April 19 and released them hours later. But they were arrested the following day on administrative immigration charges because their academic visas to attend college had expired. They are now being held at Suffolk County House of Corrections in Boston. They have not been charged with a crime.

But officials had no clear idea of where the suspect was staying in the city or whether he met with anyone during the two trips. It was revealed earlier this week that the bombers had hatched a plot to blowup Times Square after they shot and killed MIT Officer Sean Collier three days after the marathon bombing. The brothers pair carjacked a Mercedes SUV and took its owner hostage with the intention to drive to New York. But the brothers noted the stolen vehicle was low on gas, and stopped to refuel — only for the car’s owner escape and call police.

"A landlord is asking for £780 a month for a 'studio flat' so tiny occupants need to stand on top of a fridge and climb a ladder to get into bed. And once they mount the platform to where - to quote so many MTV Cribs episodes - 'the magic happens' any bedroom gymnastics would have to involve a significant amount of contortionism. There is less than two feet of space between the top of the mattress and the ceiling. Scroll down for video . Pied-a-terre: The studio flat in Kentish Town, North London, on the market for £780 a month . In a sign of how desperate London's property market has become, there have already been dozens of enquiries about the room to let in Kentish Town, North London - despite its obvious limitations. Yet the appearance of this young professionals' rabbit hutch on the market - and others like it, or smaller - is raising questions about whether such properties are fit for human habitation. The Kentish Town studio, which includes an ensuite WC, is converted from a single room in a terraced house. Its main room measures a not-so-ample 9ft by 8ft, slightly larger than the average 6ft by 8ft prison cell. The Observer viewed the property, and its reporter, Donna Ferguson, says it boasts an inspiring view of a brick wall. Nevertheless, lettings agent Alex Marks told her it had received 50 to 60 enquiries from hopeful tenants. It is just one of thousands of studio flats advertised for rent in the capital, where an apparently runaway housing market is reaching fever pitch, apparently detached from the situation across the rest of Britain. Video provided courtesy of Howcast . The flat consists of a a bed jammed into a single room alongside a five square-foot kitchen . There is . now a gap of more than £200,000 between a property in the UK’s largest . city and elsewhere – where the average price of a home is just £185,478 - . after a record 25.8 per cent price increase in just a year. Rents, . which link more closely to wages, have not even increased half as much - . 10 per cent in a year, the Observer says. But the Kentish Town property . shows where things are going: less for more. Authorities . have stepped in to stem some of the worst abuses. Last month, This Is . Money reported how a tiny London flat advertised at more than . £730-a-month was taken off the market after Islington Council stepped . in. It . consisted of a a bed jammed into a single room alongside a five . square-foot kitchen. Announcing the ban, Cllr James Murray, the . Islington's executive member for housing, told BBC Newsbeat: 'This place . is a shoebox, not a flat.' Cramped: The floorplan shows how small the property is, at just 8ft by 8ft . Tenants desperate for a home in a central location had been undeterred. The flat in a former council property had been successfully let out for £737-a-month days before the ruling. Yet the law has virtually no provision to stop flats being let out because they are too small - the Islington flat was found to have breached planning laws. Nyree Applegarth, a property litigation partner at Higgs & Sons law firm, told the Observer : 'Under the Landlord and Tenants Act 1985, any property let by a landlord on an assured shorthold tenancy must be ""habitable"". 'That means it must be sanitary, clean and a fit place to live - but there's no requirement about space.' The street in Kentish Town. It is just one of thousands of studio flats advertised for rent in the capital, where an apparently runaway housing market is reaching fever pitch . Britain now has the smallest new flats in western Europe, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects. It launched a campaign last year calling for an end to 'rabbit hutch Britain' and saying the average new one-bedroom flat is now smaller than a Tube carriage. But as a carriage on the Jubilee line is a princely 495 square feet, most of those pictured in this article are likely to be far smaller than that. And that size is still 100 square feet larger than the minimum size of a one-bed flat recommended by the Greater London Authority. Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud fronted the campaign, saying: 'This isn't rocket science. We all instinctively respond to the opportunity for a view, a connection with the outdoors, fresh air, light and space. 'A return to minimum space standards is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the people who will be living in new build homes.' But Mr McCloud's comments, almost a year ago, came before yet another surge in London house prices. The Office for National Statistics said a typical home in the capital is worth £459,000, 24.8 per cent more than in January 2008. It is not only flats that are up for grabs. In April a ramshackle building next to an industrial estate in south London, whose most prominent use was to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold at auction for £550,000 after a bidding war - three times its estimate. Parking spaces have also boomed in price, with a single space offered in a car park under the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, west London, for £400,000. Speaking about the surge in expensive studio flats to let across the capital, Roger Harding, campaigns director for the homeless charity Shelter, told MailOnline last month: 'The huge cost of private rents in the capital and tough competition for homes means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place they can afford, whether they are in poor condition or far too small for them and their families. 'The Mayor needs to get serious about building the affordable homes we desperately need, or times will keep getting tougher for generation rent.'","Two-room dwelling near Kentish Town, London, includes an en-suite WC .

"An illicit affair between a physical education teacher and her student was unearthed when the two were found allegedly having sex in the school bathroom of the teacher’s office. The athletic director of Basalt High School outside of Aspen, Colorado, reportedly found 26-year-old Lauren Redfern and one of her male students engaged in a sexual act, an affidavit states. Redfern, who graduated from the high school in 2004 and was a star basketball player in her day, turned herself into the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office Thursday morning, and was charged with sexual assault on a child by a person in position of trust. Scroll down for video . Allegation: Lauren Redfern, 25, turned herself in to authorities after she was allegedly discovered in the bathroom having sex with one of her students . High school: Redfern graduated from Basalt High School in 2004 and was a star of the basketball team . Redfern had been the teen’s study hall teacher, according to CBS Denver. Though the student is of-age now, their affair had started when the boy was a minor, the sheriff’s office said. Eagle County Undersheriff Mike McWilliam said ‘the juvenile and teacher had sexual conduct at her house and at his house.’ The alleged affair is believed to have lasted for ‘three to four months, since last fall,’ Mr McWilliam told the Post Independent. The undersheriff was clear that no illicit sex happened at the high school when the two were discovered on February 9, as the student was 18 - and considered an adult - at the time. Per Colorado state law, a 17-year-old can have a sexual relationship with an adult of any age as long as it is consensual. However, the latter cannot be considered a person of trust. Mr McWilliam told MailOnline that a person of trust is 'anybody who would be responsible for care -  namely, we use it for teachers.' He said: ‘If she weren’t a teacher, it wouldn’t be a criminal act.' The Aspen Times reported the police were contacted on February 10 by Basalt High School, and Redfern, accompanied by her father Tom Redfern, went to the Eagle County police station Thursday morning. Hearing: Redfern appeared in court in February after handing herself into police over the alleged affair with a teenage student . Her hearing was at 12:30pm yesterday. Reports said that she appeared in court wearing orange prison slippers and shackles on her ankles, but was otherwise dressed in civilian clothing. Eagle County Court Judge Katherine Sullivan reduced the usual $15,000 bond in cases such as these to $5,000, telling the court that she didn’t think Redfern to be a flight risk. The Times reported that Redfern was able to leave the jail by 4pm yesterday afternoon. Redfern faces several provisions regarding her bond. For one, she is not allowed to have contact with the alleged victim, nor any person under the age of 18. She faces anywhere from four to 16 years in prison and the Class Three felony charge of two counts sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust. Redfern did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment. Her next hearing is on March 6, the Times noted. Redfern was placed on paid leave last week. However, it is Basalt’s policy to let go any teacher who has had sexual contact with students, the Times reported. She was a 2004 graduate of Basalt, and, while a student, was a star of the school’s women’s basketball team. The affidavit stated that Redfern was also coach of the girls’ basketball team, a health teacher, and a study hall monitor. Discovered: Redfern and the juvenile were found having sex in a school lavatory like this one, an affidavit says . In the affidavit, she said that the relationship with the student was ‘unintentional.’ The two began exchanging flattering texts last fall, the documents show. By Christmas, ‘they both felt attracted to one another,’ it read. Redfern told authorities that the relationship began when the student was over at her house in Eagle County watching a movie. During the film, the two kissed and touched each other, but nothing more happened, the affidavit said. Per Colorado state law, a 17-year-old . can have a sexual relationship with an adult of any age as long as it is . consensual. However, the latter cannot be considered a person of trust, such as a teacher. The student called Redford for assistance with a school paper two weeks later, the document stated. He then went over to her house for help, where the two allegedly had sexual intercourse. The couple had sex at least five times after that, Redfern told authorities – both when he was underage and after he turned 18. The student also met with authorities, telling them that he pursued his teacher romantically and that they shared similar interests, according to the affidavit. According to the Post Independent, cases involving a sexual relationship between an underage student and a person of trust – such as a teacher – have resulted in lengthy prison sentences. The website notes the case of Travis Masse, who worked as a wrestling coach and social studies teacher at Broomfield High School. He was convicted in 2011 of having sex three times with a 17-year-old female student, and was sentenced to ten years to life, as well as 20 years on parole. However, Mr McWilliam notes a 2007 case where a former Christian high school teacher was sentenced to only five months of jail. John James Allen, then 28, was also slapped with ten years of sex-offender probation.","Lauren Redfern allegedly discovered having sex with student, 18, at school .

"A Florida high school teacher who had sex with his 16-year-old student at least 'seven to ten times' and plied her with drugs and alcohol has avoided prison time. James Wolfe, 31, was sentenced in March to two years of house arrest and five years of probation -  despite being caught on tape admitting to the relationship and telling her, 'I  know it mess you up.' The girl was wearing a wire when she met with Wolfe following his August 2013 arrest. According to police, she asked him why he had sex with her when she was just a teenager. He responded: 'Because I thought I cared about you.' Wolfe was a popular English teacher and cross-country coach at Matanzas High School in Palm Coast, Florida. His victim was one of the students he coached. James R. Wolfe, 31, has lost his teaching career, but will stay out of prison after pleading guilty to having sex with a 16-year-old student . Authorities say the plea deal will allow the girl to avoid having to take the stand and confront the man who seduced her, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. She told police that she had sex with Wolfe 'at least seven to ten times' between August 2010 and May 2011 - when she was just 16. 'During each incident the victim stated that she felt compelled to engage in sexual acts with Wolfe because of his position of authority over her,' detectives wrote in the arrest report. The victim said the first time she and Wolfe had sex, he plied her with an unknown narcotic drug to calm her nerves and also gave her alcohol. Once, drove her to a nature preserve used by the school for field trips. He set up a tent in the woods and had sex with her inside it. Wolfe taught at Mantazas High School. He was a popular English teacher and cross-country coach . The relationship ended shortly after an April 2011 incident in which she and Wolfe had sex at his apartment and fell asleep. They were both awakened when Wolfe's girlfriend came home unexpectedly and found them in bed together. Even though the sexual relationship took place in 2010 and 2011, the girl didn't report it to police until August 2013 - when she was 18. He continued to teach students, coach cross country and draw a salary of $38,000 a year, according to FlaglerLive.com. After filing a report, officers took Wolfe in for questioning. He denied the relationship and asked for a lawyer. But, the victim contacted Wolfe in a phone call recorded by police and asked to meet him. She wore a wire when they met up in the parking lot of Red Lobster and was recorded admitting to the affair.","James Wolfe had sex with a student from August 2010 until May 2011 when she was just 16 .

"A former high school teacher accused a sexually abusing a 17-year-old female student has resolved her case. Gaile Kristine Supp, 25, entered an Alford plea last week on a count of third-degree sexual battery. The plea means that although the defendant asserts their innocence, he or she also admits that prosecuting evidence would likely to persuade a jury to a guilty verdict. Supp, from Utah, once taught at Clearfield High School. She was accused of inviting the student to her West Haven home in January 2013 to help with her homework. Ex-teacher Gaile Kristine Supp, 25, entered a plea on a count of third-degree sexual battery in Utah and will not face trial after allegedly trying to seduce a 17-year-old female high school student . She then allegedly showed the girl a movie with a sex scene in it before forcing herself on the teen - who told her no. Supp then allegedly continued to abuse the student, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Supp was originally charged with first-degree object rape and was held on $20,000 bond. The teacher was placed on administrative leave on January 14, 2013 after the student reported the incident. She was arrested in May 2013 after police searched her home. Supp had only been hired to teach agricultural classes for one year and her contract was due to run out at the end of term. A four-day trial had been set for Monday on the original rape charge. Supp will now be sentenced on October 29. Prosecutors have agreed to recommend probation over prison at sentencing. With a third-degree felony, she will not be required to register as a sex offender but as part of the plea had her teaching license revoked.

"Marigolds and oven gloves will soar in price under a European Union ruling that they need more rigorous testing to stop people being injured. Brussels will vote next week on proposals for washing up gloves to be certified that they can withstand standard kitchen detergents. And, under the plans, oven gloves would have to undergo tests to show that they can withstand heat of around 200C. Marigolds and oven gloves are set to go up in price because of Brussels regulations . Business minister Matt Hancock branded the move ‘bonkers’ and vowed to try and block it. If approved, the directive would raise the value of these items - which are extensively used by business as well as households - by up to 20pc, according to an official impact assessment. All of the products currently on the market would have to be pulled, and the shelves restocked with new ones which meet the new standards.

It would place a huge weight on businesses who are trying to serve their customers. ‘These over-zealous proposals underscore the need for EU reform and why we must fight Brussels over-regulation to get the best deal for Britain.’ The proposal is in the Personal Protective Equipment Directive. It states that ‘personal health and safety are fundamental rights and people expect and require a high level of protection at work, home and at leisure.’ A spokesman for the European Commission said: ‘Of course every jurisdiction anywhere in the developed world has product safety and quality standards covering pretty much all products to avoid people being injured. 'Sub-standard oven gloves could for example obviously lead to severe burns – and people conned out of money for products that don't work.’ He added that changes to EU rules are ‘always subject to extensive consultation with industry and impact assessment’ and must be approved by a majority of member states in the EU Parliament. Business Secretary Matthew Hancock slammed the 'bonkers' EU rules which he claimed will push up prices . Earlier this year the EU was under fire for banning high-powered vacuum cleaners as part of an energy efficiency directive to help tackle climate change. Any machine with a motor exceeding 1,600 watts was taken off the market. Sir James Dyson, creator of some of the most sought-after vacuum cleaners, launched a legal challenge. The EU is also consulting on changing the energy limits of other electrical goods including hairdryers, kettles and lawnmowers. A decision expected next year about whether to ban high-powered models.","EU  proposals for washing up gloves to be certified to handle detergents .

"A transgender man who gave birth after transitioning from being female--complete with breast tissue removal surgery--now breastfeeds his children using a special tube and donated milk. Trevor MacDonald of Winnipeg, Canada actually supplements what little milk his breasts can still produce with the donated stuff by feeding it through a tube that leads to the baby nursing at his breast. MacDonald and his partner Ian had their first baby in 2012 while McDonald took a break from testosterone therapy. That's when he learned he could still lactate some, but needed a little help from a device called a supplemental nursing system. Breastfeeding dad: Transgender father Trevor MacDonald has spoken out about how he nurses his children using his own milk and supplemental milk donated from mothers . MacDonald is an outspoken advocate for trans parents and has created a large following for his blog on trans pregnancy and trans nursing Milk Junkies. He showed off his latching skills to HuffPost Live . Technological solution: MacDonald uses an SNS, which feeds milk toward the nipple on which the baby feeds . He explained how and SNS works in Huffington Post blog from the time: . 'An SNS is a bottle with a tube going into it. You put one end of the tube next to your nipple and then latch the baby onto your nipple and the tube at the same time. 'This way, the baby gets both the milk that the parent can produce and supplement from the bottle at once.' It wasn't easy at first. MacDonald said it took three people to properly position their baby Jacob in the first weeks. 'We struggled through the exhaustion of sitting up through nursing sessions day and night,' he wrote. Now, he writes, 'I can nurse him to sleep when he is overtired, or latch him on to calm him when he's had an unfortunate adventure with the corner of a coffee table. Nursing has taken on dimensions that I never imagined would be possible for us.' Things improved so much, in fact, that MacDonald and his partner recently went through the process all over again--they had their second child just weeks ago. 'In the second pregnancy, I had virtually zero experiences socially and medically,' MacDonald told HuffPost. Since his first pregnancy, MacDonald has maintained a very successful blog devoted to educating trans parents and potential trans parents about birth and breastfeeding called Milk Junkies.","Winnipeg female-to-male transgender man Trevor MacDonald was afraid he couldn't breastfeed after breast reduction surgery .

"Roberto Martinez admits his team does have a defensive problem – but insists he is not concerned by the performances of Tim Howard despite the American’s poor showing in Everton’s back-to-back defeats.

"Speakers at the National Rifle Association's annual convention took pot shots at President Barack Obama, as the man who has become the face of America's largest gun-rights group announced that the NRA had grown to 5 million members. 'By the time we're finished, that must and will be 10 million,' said NRA executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre. But much of Saturday's activities at the group's annual convention were devoted to slamming Obama for what speakers called failed gun control legislation for which the White House has manufactured the illusion of popular support. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre slammed President Obama for ignoring the gun violence problem caused firearms in his native Chicago owned by criminals. He also announced that his organization had for the first time enrolled five million members . National Rifle Association President David Keene said Americans' support for a gun-control Senate bill soured once they learned what was in the proposed law. The legislation ultimately failed despite White House claims of overwhelming public support . Defiance is the order of the day at the NRA convention, with vendors advertising slogan-festooned signs, shirts, bumper stickers and hats . The White House has claimed that a massive majority of Americans supported the measure, which would have expanded the use of background checks before gun purchases. Obama endorsed the bill, but it failed in an April Senate vote. And many Republicans in Washington have declared the gun-control season closed. 'Support for the president's agenda began to weaken,' NRA president David Keene claimed Saturday, 'as ordinary citizens began to look deeper at what was proposed.' LaPierre was less diplomatic, calling the bill, co-sponsored n the Senate by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Pennsylvania Republican Patrick Toomey a 'convoluted scheme tantamount to national registration of every gun owner in America.' Claiming Obama harbors an 'agenda to destroy our Second Amendment,' he insisted that the president 'will stop at nothing. Then he boasted, 'That's what he has gotten: nothing. Absolutely nothing.' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One that as many as 23 'executive actions' were under consideration, which could allow Obama to act without Congress . Obama, in San Jose, Costa Rica, may not be hearing Americans clearly, according to Wayne LaPierre . Texas Gov. Rick Perry seemed to agree about Obama in a Washington Times interview published Saturday. 'His goal - well before he became president of the United States - was to try to disarm the American public,' Perry said. 'He just disregards the Constitution.' LaPierre also blamed the White House for misleading Americans about the content of the failed Senate bill. But 'the biggest whopper of all,' he insisted, 'is that 90 per cent of Americans support his background check bill. During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Friday, while en route from Mexico to Costa Rica, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Obama remains committed to 'pressing Congress to take action to reduce gun violence.' And that, Carney said, 'includes exploring every executive action he might be able to . take' without congressional approval. NRA lobbying chief Chris Cox said gun control groups have 'spent millions on bogus polls' - which the White House then leverages politically - to create an impression that Americans are clamoring for firearms restrictions . Obama's 'goal, well before he became president of the United States, was to try to disarm the American public,' said Texas Gov. Rick Perry . 'We are going to . press ahead,' Carney added. 'The President made clear that sometimes these efforts . don’t succeed initially, but especially when you have 85 to 90 per cent . of the American people supporting, in the case of background checks . being expanded, a legislative proposal, this is going to get done. That statistic comes from a Quinnipiac University poll conducted between March 27 and April 1. It found that mandatory background checks for most gun purchasers have 91 per cent of U.S. voters, including 96 per cent of Democrats, 88 per cent of Republicans and 88 per cent of Americans in gun-owning households. In the same poll, 53 per cent of gun owners - the constituency gathered in Houston - agreed that 'universal background checks could lead to confiscation of legal guns.' Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, the group's lobbying arm, questioned the White House's number - saying that gun control groups have 'spent millions on bogus polls.' Actor and former Marine Corps drill instructor Ronald Lee 'Gunny' Ermey, best known for his gunnery-sergeant role in Full Metal Jacket, told MailOnline at the NRA convention that President Obama 'doesn't know who he's fooling with' NRA members aren't a shy bunch, and many wore t-shirts expressing their love for firearms - or their disdain for gun control advocates like CNN host Piers Morgan . LaPierre said 'the only ""90"" the president won't talk about is Chicago - his own hometown, now run by his former chief of staff. The president won't talk about Chicago, but he should. Because in the entire United States, Chicago rates 90th out of 90 jurisdictions in federal firearms prosecution: dead last.' He added that there is 'a shooting every 6.3 hours' in the Windy City, 'the deadliest city in America, the president's own home town.' 'If the president had one clue about how to clean up violent crime,' LaPierre said to applause, 'don't you think he'd do it in his own hometown? If his policies brought us Chicago, why would we want to listen to him on anything else?'","NRA head honcho insists support for background-check legislation is far smaller than the president claims .

"Sitting in front of your smart television, you may think you are the only one watching. But if you have agreed to the appliance’s terms and conditions, the manufacturer may be spying on you, researchers claim. Brands could be monitoring the programmes you watch, and the websites you browse, according to a study by Which? Smart TV brands monitor the programmes you watch and the websites you browse to offer personalised recommendations for TV shows - but this information can be passed on to advertisers to target viewers more accurately . Which? thinks that manufacturers could do more to keep their customers happy. It has asked companies to keep TV tracking to a minimum and to encrypt all data transmitted. To disclose what they are tracking and why. To allow customers to opt out of tracking and still use the smart TV functions they have paid for. To give consumers a choice about whether they see adverts on their homescreen. Such monitoring could bring benefits such as more personalised recommendations for TV shows to watch. But it could also be used to let advertisers target people more accurately in their own home, which some may consider an invasion of their privacy. Last year, IT consultant Jason Huntley realised his LG smart TV was tracking his family’s viewing habits and even knew his children’s names because he had watched a family video on his set. Which? magazine’s more recent investigation explored how TVs from LG, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba track their owners. Experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart TVs, and changed channel, searched the web and played videos from a USB stick to see what information was collected. They discovered that all the brands track people’s viewing habits to some extent, although LG has stopped temporarily. Most of data collected was encrypted to hide it from hackers, but a Samsung TV disclosed the tester’s location and postcode for anyone to see. The firm told Which? that location is needed to operate the TV, but that a postcode isn’t required. Last year, IT consultant Jason Huntley realised his LG smart TV was tracking his family’s viewing habits and even knew his children’s names because he had watched a family video on his set. An LG set is pictured . A previous study by the publication revealed that brands have abandoned support for some of the TVs that are a few years old – rendering them less smart because some apps (illustrated) couldn't be accessed . A team of scientists at Columbia University claimed in June that hybrid smart TVs that blur the line between televisions and the internet are vulnerable to a simple hack. Coined the ‘red-button attack’ - named after the red button used on modern smart TV remotes to access additional content - the flaw can be exploited with a $250 (£150) transmitter. In just minutes, someone using a smart TV could find their various internet accounts sending spam, printing coupons and writing fake reviews without their knowledge. Hackers could, in theory, also use these accounts to harvest personal information. The attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in Hybrid Broadcast-Broadband Television (HbbTV). This ‘allows broadcast streams to include embedded HTML content which is rendered by the television,’ the researchers wrote in their paper. The hacker would then take over the channel a viewer was watching for a short amount of time. This would be done by using a simple amplifier, on a rooftop to hijack networks across an area of 0.5 square miles (1.4 square kilometres). In doing so, the hacker would have access to any websites the viewer was logged into on their smart TV. This could range from getting access to their Facebook accounts to writing fake reviews on websites for products. Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Toshiba all push adverts onto a TV’s homescreen, and while users can stop them being targeted, they cannot be blocked completely. People uncomfortable with data being collected about them may wish to decline their TV’s terms and conditions, but this could leave them without much of the device’s functionality. Panasonic blocks any functions that require internet access, while Toshiba and LG block internet access and apps - but the basic functions of the TV are available to use. Samsung reportedly stops all access to the TV set. Sony was the only brand studied that if a user rejects its terms, only blocks tracking so that a user loses content recommendations - without limiting other functions. A previous study by the publication revealed that brands have abandoned support for some of the TVS that are a few years old – rendering them less smart. Which? was contacted by Samsung and LG smart TV customers who bought their sets in 2010 and 2011 respectively. They were outraged after losing access to LoveFilm, now called Amazon Prime Instant Video. When a TV manufacturer updates its smart TV range, the whole operating system it runs on can potentially change to incorporate new features. This means the people who make the apps may have to redesign and recode their services to make them compatible. Manufacturers have to pay the developers for licenses to host the apps and show the content and, as a result, may choose to only cover app licenses for their newer products, and not their older ones. Keeping apps such as BBC iPlayer and Netflix available on smart TVs requires agreement between the manufacturers and the third-party app providers. If they can't agree, or either party changes their technology or software, consumers can lose services. This also goes the other way - if a TV was sold before an app becomes available, it’s unlikely the developers will ever make it backward compatible, meaning it will never work on models released before the app launched. If an older TV doesn’t meet these requirements, customers will get a poorer experience and Netflix could develop a reputation for providing a sub-standard service. According to the Which? investigation, ‘manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves. ‘Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out. Since the product itself hasn’t developed a physical fault, it’s a grey area for consumer rights.'","Which? experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart TVs from LG, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba .

"Anthony Martin Milsom, 62, had newspaper cuttings relating to high-profile child murder inquiries . A pervert with an 'uncontrollable obsession with child pornography and torture' has had his sentence slashed by the Court of Appeal. Anthony Martin Milsom, 62, had newspaper cuttings relating to high-profile child murder inquiries including Milly Dowler, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, Sophie Hook and missing Madeleine McCann. Police found an exercise book entitled 'how to kidnap young girls'. Milsom had been given an indeterminate sentence by Mold Crown Court in March this year after pleading guilty to a catalogue of sexual offences. An indeterminate sentence meant he could only be released when the parole board was satisfied he was no longer a danger to the public. But after an appeal by his solicitor Geraint Jones, Milsom's sentence has now been reduced to three and a half years, less 155 days spent on remand. Mr Justice Simon, sitting at the Court of Appeal with Lord Justice Moses and Judge Francis Gilbert, overturned the original sentence. Mr Jones said: 'We accept that they were sad and unpleasant offences. Justice demands fairness in sentence and I formed the view that the sentence was unfair in that it was excessive, that there was an element of knee jerk reaction on the part of the public and the court. 'I do not minimise the offences, they were unpleasant, but it's an issue of fairness.' He said Milsom, of Newtown, Powys, north Wales, was guilty of grave offences and it was right to describe many of the images he collected as 'sickening'. Judge Francis Gilbert, left, and Lord Justice Moses, right, sat with Mr Justice Simon at the Court of Appeal to overturn the original sentence . But he said it did not justify an open-ended sentence from which he might never be released. Substituting a total sentence of three and a half years, he said: 'This reflects the overall criminality in respect of which he pleaded guilty.' Milsom was originally convicted of 16 counts of possession of indecent photographs of a child dating back as far as 1991, 21 counts of making indecent photos of a child, five counts of indecent assault on a girl under 14, and five counts of possession of prohibited images of a child. Anthony Milsom had newspaper . cuttings relating to high-profile child murder inquiries including . Milly Dowler, left, and missing child Madeleine . McCann, right . Speaking during his initial sentencing Judge Niclas Parry said the 'facts of this case would chill the blood of the parent of any young child'. The court was told Milsom had a fascination with the murder, abduction and the rape of young female children, and that police had found a book written and illustrated by Milsom called 'How to kidnap young girls'. A bag was found at his property containing newspaper cuttings of high profile abduction cases including Milly Dowler, Holly and Jessica Wells, and Madeleine McCann. Scales of justice: Mr Justice Simon, sitting at the Court of Appeal with Lord Justice Moses and Judge Francis Gilbert, overturned the original sentence . A child mannequin was also found wearing children's underwear tied up with a skipping rope hanging from the ceiling of his home. Videos showed Milsom whipping and kicking it to the recorded sounds of a child screaming. Police found more than 5,100 indecent drawings, more than 200 photographs, 127,700 still images, together with 500 films and 188 home-made videos at his home. Camcorder and VHS recordings of children at play parks, beaches and from his address were also found.","Anthony Milsom had been given an indeterminate sentence .

"The director of the 'Kony 2012' viral video is being kept in a mental hospital for his own safety, as his wife blamed the unexpected popularity and criticism of the film for his public breakdown. Jason Russell, co-founder of the charity Invisible Children, taken away by police on Thursday for allegedly being drunk and masturbating in public yesterday morning following reports that he was seen vandalising cars and running through traffic wearing just his underwear. He is allegedly being held in a 5150 psychiatric ward in San Diego, where authorities are allowed to keep him for three days to confirm he is not a danger to himself or others. Breakdown: Jason Russell was hospitalized for exhaustion after behaving bizarrely in the streets while naked . Naked meltdown: Kony 2012 video director Jason Russell caught acting strangely on the Streets on San Diego . Arrested: Jason Russell, director of the 'Kony 2012' video, was allegedly seen wandering the streets drunk . Mr Russell’s wife has now spoken out to defend her husband’s 'irrational' behaviour - suggesting that it was brought on by the unexpected attention and criticism that his film about the African warlord Joseph Kony generated. Danica Russell  issued a statement saying her husband: 'did some irrational things brought on by extreme exhaustion and dehydration.' 'We thought a few thousand people would see the film, but in less than a week, millions of people around the world saw it,' she said. 'While that attention was great for raising awareness about Joseph Kony, it also brought a lot of attention to Jason and, because of how personal the film is, many of the attacks against it were also very personal, and Jason took them very hard.' Further criticism emerged today in a response from the Ugandan government who argue the video gives a 'false impression' and that Kony is no longer in the country. 'The Kony 2012 campaign fails to make one crucial point clear. Joseph Kony is not in Uganda,' Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi said in a 9-minute video posted on YouTube. The Prime Minister insisted that the Kony 2012 video did not represent the current situation in the east African nation. Mbabazi said Uganda was on Kony's trail but said they did not 'need a slick video on YouTube... to take notice.' Mr Russell, 33, was calm and . co-operative when apprehended by police, according to NBC San Diego, but . seemed to be under the influence of alcohol. Danica has denied that her husband has any substance abuse or drinking problems. Although . he was not charged with a crime, officials decided that he should be . committed to hospital for medical treatment following the incident. 'During the evaluation we learned that we probably needed to take care of him,' a police spokesman said. 'So officers detained him and transferred him to a local medical facility for further evaluation and treatment.' Target: Mr Russell's video is aimed at Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony . Campaigner: Mr Russell on a trip to Africa, where he was first inspired to set up the charity Invisible Children . Ben Keesey, chief executive of Invisible . Children, the charity set up in 2004 by Mr Russell and two friends, . issued a statement of support for his colleague. 'Jason Russell was unfortunately hospitalised yesterday suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and malnutrition,' he said. 'The past two weeks have taken a severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday. 'We will always love and support Jason, and we ask that you give his entire family privacy during this difficult time.' Activist: The campaigner giving an impassioned talk about his work . The charity, which aims to raise awareness of the atrocities committed by the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, sprang to worldwide fame last week after releasing an online video entitled 'Kony 2012'. The 30-minute film, directed by Mr Russell, documents the activities of LRA leader Joseph Kony, notorious for his reign of terror in central Africa and particularly his use of child soldiers. It has garnered 80million hits on YouTube, and attracted widespread support from celebrities and members of the public. The filmmaker seems to have been unprepared for the amount of publicity that his video would generate, which has been promoted on Twitter with tags that include #Kony2012 and endorsed by the likes of Justin Bieber, George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey. However, critics claim that the film over-simplifies a complex conflict and diverts attention from more pressing causes. Father-of-two Mr Russell is an evangelical Christian who is described by Invisible Children as 'our grand storyteller and dreamer'.","Jason Russell, co-founder of the charity Invisible Children, is being held in a psychiatric ward .

"Stalking their prey around some of the most famous tourist attractions in the world, they will stop at nothing to intimidate and steal. These disturbing pictures showing gangs from Romania and Bulgaria operating in Paris were published in the prestigious Paris Match magazine, which devoted eight pages to them under the headline The Flagrant Crimes Of Pickpockets. Brazenly targeting their victims in broad daylight at cashpoints, on crowded pavements and in parks and Metro stations, the increasingly aggressive gangs are causing chaos and misery in the French capital. Scroll down for video . Duped: A Roma woman asks this man to sign a petition while an accomplice picks his pocket (circled) Running from the law: Members of a Roma gang escape the police through the streets . Wrong side of the tracks: Roma children run amok on the train lines of the Metro . Police patrols have had to be dramatically increased around iconic monuments such as the Eiffel Tower and The Louvre museum, where earlier this year staff walked out because of the lack of protection against organised Roma groups stealing on an industrial scale from workers and tourists. Countless thefts are being carried out every day by members of the gangs, many of whom are barely teenagers. And, as Britain prepares to allow thousands of immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria to seek work in the UK as a result of changes to EU immigration rules on January  1 next year, there is every chance of similar Roma gangs coming to the United Kingdom. President Francois Hollande’s Socialist government came to power a year ago promising to rehouse the Roma and integrate them into society. But, having criticised the Centre-Right government of predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy for treating immigrants too harshly, Hollande is now facing up to political reality. Interior minister Manuel Valls has ordered police to dismantle the Roma gipsies’ camps and shanty towns without rehousing them, and he has expelled more Roma from France than Sarkozy did. Last year, nearly 13,000 Romanians and Bulgarians were deported from France, an increase of 18.4 per cent on the previous year. And many plan to take advantage of the relaxation in EU rule changes by moving to Britain. This week, a leaked report from Germany’s Interior Ministry — the equivalent of the Home Office — revealed that the country has also suffered a flood of Romanian immigrants because it has already relaxed its immigration rules. Look out: The woman using the ticket machine has not noticed the girl in the pink shirt who is memorising (circled) her PIN number and waits to steal her cash card . The document describes overcrowded slum conditions, threats to public health, a dramatic increase in crime and disruption on the streets as a result of the influx of immigrants from the two countries. In the past year alone, 176,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have entered Germany, and local government organisations warn the authorities are struggling to cope. The German newspaper that acquired the leaked report says the document explicitly warns of the ‘consequences for the social peace’. The Interior Ministry report refers to  ‘extreme occupancy of dilapidated, uninhabitable properties with illegal dormitories’, adding that up to 20 people are sleeping to a room. It mentions ‘dirty patios, overfilled rubbish bins’ and ‘noisy crowds into the small hours’. The report also warns that schools are under pressure because of the number of non-German speaking pupils, and says that crime — particularly prostitution — is on the increase in areas where the newcomers have settled. In Paris, a favourite trick of the child gangs is to approach tourists with a fake ‘petition’ to sign while they are withdrawing money from cash machines. Distracted by the approach, victims do not see the thieves noting their pin number and then pick-pocketing cash cards to withdraw money for themselves. ‘Do you speak English?’ is another opening gambit used on tourists, as the gang members help themselves to money and possessions, often without their victims even noticing. Otherwise, they just steal cash and valuables direct while people are sitting in parks or on the Metro. Some will have been among the 1,769 minors detained by French police for committing similar crimes in 2012, but even if caught they are released within a few hours. Having his collar felt: But this child gang member will be back on the streets within hours . Stop and search: A group of young Roma are lined up and frisked by French police . ‘There’s very little we can do with them,’ admitted a Paris police source. ‘As children, they effectively have absolute immunity from prosecution. Much of the money they make ends up with the adult gangmasters who run them. They are much harder to catch because they hide away in the shadows.’ The Louvre alone now has 20 permanent uniformed officers patrolling its galleries, with five of them placed at the entrance. Similar patrols have been placed around sacred monuments including Notre Dame Cathedral and the Sacre-Coeur, as well as the Eiffel Tower, the Pompidou Centre, and the Palace of Versailles, west of Paris. Plain-clothes officers are mingling with the thousands of people who visit Paris every day, and the number of surveillance cameras has also been increased. Two years ago, France’s then Interior Minister Claude Gueant said the vast majority of street robberies in Paris were being carried out by the children of Roma immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria. Paris is the most popular tourist destination in the world, and the British are the biggest visitor group — meaning thousands of people from the UK are becoming victims of the gangs. And now, with the imminent relaxation of the immigration rules in this country, the gangmasters who run these teenage criminals are setting their sights on Britain.","Disturbing pictures show Romanian and Bulgarian gangs operating in Paris .

"Two HIV-positive British bar workers stand accused of raping a 17-year-old boy after plying him with alcohol. The gay couple, named so far only as Andreu Paul W, 38, and Warren H, 34, are said to have made their victim drink 'large quantities of vodka' after taking him back to their flat in Calpe, eastern Spain. They are then accused of making him sniff an unknown substance and, when he had passed out, stripping him naked from the waist down and taking it in turns to rape him, El Mundo newspaper reports. Extradited back to Spain: Two HIV-positive British bar workers are accused of raping a 17-year-old boy after plying him with alcohol at their flat in Calpe, eastern Spain (pictured) The Director of Public Prosecutions says the incident is alleged to have happened on March 7, 2008, and they returned back to Britain but were extradited to Spain in May the following year. Spanish media reports that during the night, the couple met the teenager, also British, at the bar they were working at. After closing time, they went on to another pub, where they convinced him to come back to their flat. Not infected: While the boy was not infected by the HIV virus, pictured, he is reportedly suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from the crime . Once there, prosecutors say they made him drink large amounts of vodka with 'the only intention to deprive him of his senses' until he lost his balance and fell to the floor. They are then accused of carrying him to their bedroom, throwing him onto the bed and stripping him naked from the waist down - making him sniff an unknown substance. The couple then allegedly took it in turns to rape their victim. The following day, the victim regained consciousness and left the house by foot. He reported the alleged crime a month later, on April 2, when he visited a Guardia Civil station with his step-father and lawyer. Despite the couple being HIV-positive, the boy was not infected with the virus but he is still reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from the crime. The men will stand trial in Alicante on Tuesday, October 2.

The increase in names is believed to be due to security agencies using the system more . in the wake of the failed 2009 attack on a plane by ""underpants bomber"" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in Detroit. Intelligence and law enforcement officials later acknowledged in Congress they had missed clues to that attack . despite Abdulmutallab's name appearing in the central database. Known as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), the database provides information on people whom . U.S. authorities see as known, suspected or potential terrorists from . around the world. The list, which is maintained by the National . Counterterrorism Center in Virginia, is used by security agencies use to build up information about possible terrorists, like the 'no-fly' list which prevents . people who feature on it from boarding airplanes. People on the list include alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whose name was added in 2011 after the U.S. spy agency received a . request from Russian authorities to investigate him for suspected . radical Islamist activities. The CIA also entered the name of Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva's, into the TIDE database. The official familiar with the latest statistics said that even though the number of TIDE entries has grown substantially, the data is still manageable as intelligence agencies have improved their system of extract information from large amunts of data. However, Karen Greenberg, an expert in counter-terrorism policy at Fordham University, questioned whether the growth in the database's size made it easier for officials to spot threats before they materialize. She said: 'What you want is more focus, not less focus. It can't be just about quantity. It has to be about specificity.' The vast size of TIDE came into the spotlight in the wake of the bombing late last month of the Boston Marathon. U.S. officials now acknowledge that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's name was entered into TIDE by the CIA in the autumn of 2011, . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with authorities in the days following the Boston bombing and his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured by police.

"A Texas man who has come to be known as the 'vampire vet' after allegedly being caught keeping family pets alive that were meant to be euthanized was indicted on three criminal charges Wednesday. Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, has been charged with one count of theft, one count of misapplication of fiduciary property and one count of animal cruelty, a Tarrant County grand jury decided, according to NBC 5. He is facing up to five years in prison after surrendering himself in May. At the time, officials inspecting Tierce's popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic found that pets the veterinarian had accepted to be put down were actually being kept alive. Scroll down for video . Indicted: Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, has been charged with one count of theft, one count of misapplication of fiduciary property and one count of animal cruelty after allegedly keeping dogs alive that were meant to be euthanized . Mistreated: Sid was dropped off at Tierce's clinic last year to be put down, after his owners were told Sid suffered a spinal ailment that he would not recover from. However the dog was allegedly kept in a cage for six months and used for bloody transfusions . Scene: ierce's popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic in Fort Worth allegedly accepted animals to be put down that were actually being kept alive. One, it was alleged, had been kept in a cage for two or three years and used for blood transfusions. Aledo couple Jaime and Marian Harris said Tierce had agreed to euthanize their dog Sid after diagnosing him with a spinal disorder. 'Vampire vet': Tierce is now facing three criminal charges and up to five years in prison . They were told the five-year-old the dog would not recover and Tierce offered to bury him on his farm. However, several months later they received a call from a woman claiming to work at the clinic, telling them that Sid was alive and being used for blood transfusions. The pair went to the clinic and found Sid in a cage. A separate examination reveal he had no issues with his spine, but was now seriously injured after living for so long in a cage. He has now had to undergo physiotherapy to learn how to walk properly. A subsequent investigation revealed Tierce allegedly had three other dogs he was keeping. One of them was his own pet. The dog, a black and white border collie, was discovered twitching in pain inside a box left in an exam room. One of the animal’s legs was missing, another was dislocated, and the collie also had two dislocated shoulders. Veterinary technician Cynthia Welch told police earlier this year that Tierce's pet dog had been lying in the same position on the floor since at least June 2, 2013, when she came to work at the clinic. Tierce told investigators that two of the pooches had been brought to the clinic by their owners to be put to sleep, but according to state records, the 71-year-old doctor believed that the decision was his to make. Relieved: Marian Harris rescued Sid from the animal clinic after being tipped off that her dog was not put down six months earlier. Sid's rescue then lead to Tierce turning himself into police . The border collie was later put to sleep by another veterinarian, who examined her and concluded that the animal was emaciated, had severe mouth disease, cataracts, and degenerative neurological disorder, among other ailments. A lab technician also told investigators that several animals were kept in cages for nearly 24 hours a day so experiments could be performed on them. Tierce had received his veterinary license in 1966, and until this week, he had a spotless record. The Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners is expected to convene in Austin for an emergency meeting to discuss Tierce's fate in the medical profession. His license suspension order stated that Tierce repeatedly violated the Veterinary Licensing Act and is a ‘continuing threat and real danger’ to the health of his patients and to the public. At a hearing last week, the state board formally suspended Tierce's license for an additional five years. No court date has been set.","Dr Millard Lucien Tierce, 71, kept at least four dogs brought to his Fort Worth clinic to be put down because he believed it was his decision .

"Spending on foreign aid should be slashed, voters have warned Chancellor George Osborne. The hand-outs for overseas development would be the top target for cuts among the public, according to a poll by Ipsos MORI. More than half of all voters - 55 per cent - want to see a reduction in the overseas aid budget, in defiance of David Cameron’s refusal to shelve its protected status. More than half of those polled wanted the Chancellor George Osborne to cut the amount of foreign aid Britain gives . David Cameron refuses to shelve the aid budget's protected status, despite wide criticism of the 'arbitrary' amount . Their views emerged as Tory peer Lord Ashcroft urged Mr Cameron to stop ring-fending money for spending on aid. In an article for Conservative Home, he said that the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income is ‘arbitary and even bizarre’.  He argues that it would be both ‘popular’ and ‘help the Chancellor achieve his fiscal goals’. Lord Ashcroft believes that the Prime Minister should reassess the aid budget as it would be popular and would help the chancellor achieve his fiscal goals . He said: ‘People show compassion by giving of what they have, of their own accord. If people want to support charities that provide real help to those in need, I admire them. But governments cannot be compassionate with money they have confiscated from their citizens on pain of prison.’ Benefit payments is another area that the public want to see reduced. Some 44 per cent want a cut in welfare payments, while 28 per cent want to see a reduction in spending on defence at a time of austerity. A majority of Tory supporters, 65 per cent, want to see a reduction in benefits while even 43 per cent of Liberal Democrats want to see lower payments, just behind the 50 per cent of Ukip voters. However just over one in four Labour supporters - 26 per cent - want lower benefits. Some 84 per cent of Ukip supporters want to see spending on overseas aid slashed, followed by 61 per cent of Conservatives, 49 per cent of Labour voters and 47 per cent of Lib Dem supporters. The poll shows voters are strongly against cuts to frontline services, with just three per cent wanting a cut in state pensions, two per cent agreeing with a cut to schools and one per cent in a reduction on spending in care for the elderly. International Development Secretary Justine Greening has been more eager to overhaul aid spending than her predecessor Andrew Mitchell. Miss Greening, a chartered accountant, has promised to examine every penny that goes on foreign aid. She has cancelled handouts to India and earmarked part of the budget to support Ministry of Defence peacekeeping programmes.","Poll shows that 55 per cent of people want the aid budget cut .

"A rescue kitten will undergo a life-threatening recovery surgery today after it underwent a routine microchip surgery last week that left him paralyzed. Muffin, who was just six-weeks-old when Loren Slama rescued him, was taken to Downey Animal Shelter after being found wandering the streets of Los Angeles last week. After taking Muffin home from the shelter for routine medical microchip implantation, Slama made the horrifying realization that something went very wrong. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Suffering: Muffin is just six-weeks-old and left paralyzed after a botched routine surgery last week . Hope: Thanks to funding from generous donors, Muffin has enough money to undergo a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip that left her paralyzed and dragging her tiny body across the floor . The chip: The microchip, an implant used to help identify pets, was meant to go just below the surface of the skin but ended up being lodged in her spine . Microchips are  are radio-frequency identification (RFID) implants that provide permanent ID for a pet, reports Petfinder.com. They are meant to be implanted just below the surface of the skin and are not normally painful or invasive. They give each pet a personal identification number and even medical histry in the case that the pet is lost. Chip implantation is often a required surgery for rescue pets and usually have little to no complications. Slama said that as soon as she took Muffin home, his adorable little face started to dangle then crash towards the floor all together. She decided to get to the bottom of what was ailing her new pet after leaving the vet. An X-ray showed that a microchip that doctors implanted as part of the routine process had gotten lodged into the kitten's spine., reportsCBS. Now the six-week-old Muffin has to drag its entire left side when it moves. Loved: Loren Slama rescued six-week-old Muffin from the harsh streets of Los Angeles last week and wants her to be healthy and happy in her caring home . Immobilized: Muffin can barely move and when she does, she must drag the left side of her body on the floor . Horrified: Owner Loren Slama says that thanks to generous donors, Muffin might have a chance at recovery after a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip . X-ray: X-rays show that the chip went right through Muffin's spinal cord causing debilitating paralysis . 'I noticed after 30 minutes his head started to dangle and it started to kind of crash. On the X-ray it was clearly demonstrated that the microchip was inserted all the way into the spine. That’s why he was paralyzed,' Slama said. 'I was in a total state of shock,' Slama added. Muffin has a surgery scheduled for Today at the Angels Veterinary Specialty Center where a neurologist will attempt to remove the chip. The surgery is very risky and Muffin might die during  or shortly after but Slama has no choice if she wants Muffin to have a chance at surviving free of pain. Slama asked Downey Animal Control to pay for the surgery since it was their doctor who implanted a microchip but they declined. 'It’s a highly risky procedure. He might die during the surgery and even a few days after the surgery. However, we need to do the surgery because the longer the microchip stays into the spine the more damage it can cause,' Slama said. Catastrophe: Muffin was left paralyzed but if he survives today's surgery he may have a change at a normal life . The proof: Animal Control is investigating what may have went wrong during the surgery that left a poor kitten paralyzed with a microchip implanted in his spine . Hopeful: Today's surgery to remove the chip could help Muffin lead a more normal life after becoming paralyzed . The Los Angeles Department of Animal Control and Care released a statement about their reasoning for not funding the surgery. 'This was an anomaly. We acted in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines in terms of whether the kitten should be micro chipped for its age and size. 'We have never had an incident like this before. However, we are conducting an investigation and determining whether or not any corrections need to be made,' they said. Despite Los Angeles Animal Control's lack of funding, Slama was able to raise money through caring donors on Youcaring.com. They reached over their $5,000 goal. 'Dear Supporters and Animal Lovers, . WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL!!!!! We have left the fund raiser open, since once it is closed, we will be unable to update all of Muffin's friends. NO NEED TO DONATE MORE! We are overwhelmed by your generosity. Because of you, Muffin will get the finest care with the best surgical team. Please keep Muffin in your thoughts and prayers that he survives the surgery, and lives a long, healthy kitty life. THANK YOU from the bottom of every rescuer's heart,' says the site. Loren Slama promises to keep supporters updated on Muffin's recovery.","Six-week-old Muffin was rescued from the streets of Los Angeles by animal lover Loren Slama last week .

"Hats off to Ronald Koeman for the genius job he has done in rebuilding Southampton's depleted side. Pundits and fans feared for the club's Premier League future when they lost Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren - among others - in the summer. But their third place in the table, including that 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland at the weekend, has taken everyone by surprise. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Koeman jokingly thanks Mourinho for lifting curse . Southampton have made an excellent start to the domestic season, despite a summer of turmoil . Graziano Pelle (centre left) scored twice as Saints thrashed Sunderland 8-0 in the Premier League on Saturday . One of the shining lights left behind, James Ward-Prowse, even admitted on Saturday that the club were in 'turmoil' with so many high-profile departures. But Koeman came in, sorted through the rubble and patiently sought-out their replacements. Even then, two relative unknowns from Holland's Eredivisie – Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic – were not the star names supporters were hoping for and the loans of Ryan Bertrand and Toby Alderweireld did not, on first impression, appear adequate defensive acquisitions. However, on early-season form, Koeman has made by far the shrewdest signings of the window. Sportsmail takes a look at how the new recruits have stepped into the boots of their predecessors. Saints boss Ronald Koeman has done a terrific job at the club since taking over in the summer . Steven Davis on the ball for Southampton who are currently third in the Premier League with 16 points . Dusan Tadic (£10.9m from FC Twente) v Adam Lallana (sold to Liverpool £25m) Lallana was perhaps the hardest to replace after he moved. While  Lambert was scoring the goals, Lallana was providing the heartbeat of the side. So often he was involved in everything going forward and as well as being able to unlock defences with a pass from anywhere in the final third, he weighed in with his share of goals too. But Tadic has displayed wizardry to match the attacking midfielder; seven assists in eight games, 20 chances created, 278 passes, 88 crosses and one goal. Dusan Tadic (left) has excelled in filling the void left by former Southampton captain Adam Lallana . 'He is always moving and moving to spaces to play and give the assists which creative players can and that is difficult,' was Koeman's assessment. 'Players like Tadic have to score between seven, eight and nine goals every season and he knows now he has to work hard for that.' If there was any fear Southampton would flatline without Lallana, Tadic has been the defibrillator sparking them back to life. Ryan Bertrand (loan from Chelsea) v Luke Shaw (sold to Manchester United £31m) The loss of Shaw was another huge blow to the club. Shaw is one of the most exciting left backs in the country – nurtured into an England player at Southampton – and he had taken to the top-flight with ease. He often played more like a left winger than a left-back, but was rarely caught out defensively. There really is no replacement for a player of that ability, still only 19, but Koeman wanted a full back with a similar attacking threat and in  Bertrand he has found that. Saints signed Chelsea left back Ryan Bertrand (left) on a season-long loan to replace Luke Shaw this season . 'I can't compare him with Shaw because I don't know a lot about Shaw but we are happy to have that kind of player in our squad,' Koeman said. 'He brings quality, he brings personality, and he knows about the level and pressure of Chelsea and that's important for the rest of the team.' While Shaw has struggled for fitness and with injury at United this campaign, Bertrand has been flying on that flank for Southampton. Graziano Pelle (£8million from Feyenoord) v Rickie Lambert (sold to Liverpool £4m) Lambert will always be a hero on the south coast. His goals played a huge part in firing them from the third tier to the top flight in just two seasons; scoring 21 the year they went up from League One and 31 in the Championship. His strikes in the Premier League also earned him an England call-up, but there is no denying he was struggling for form in the latter stages of last season. This campaign he is yet to score for Liverpool, has missed good chances and has been limited to 125 minutes in the league. Star striker Pelle (left) has settled in well at the club scoring a double in their 8-0 win vs Sunderland . In comparison, Pelle is keeping pace with the league's top-scorers with six in eight games and is lighting up St Mary's with goals such as the overhead kick he scored against QPR. Even when he scored twice and ran Sunderland's back line ragged at the weekend, Pelle insisted he 'didn’t play so well.' Koeman witnessed first-hand his prolific goal-scoring while in charge at Feyenoord, where he netted 50 goals in 57 league games in the past two seasons. He has had no trouble in transferring that to English football. Toby Alderweireld (loaned from Atletico Madrid) v Dejan Lovren (sold to Liverpool £20m) Lovren was developing a reputation as one of the best centre backs in the league last season. He angered Southampton fans by publicly forcing through a move to Liverpool but the centre of their defence looked weak without him. Jose Fonte has established himself as a solid centre half but Maya Yoshida's name on a team-sheet must have had centre forwards rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the game ahead. Toby Alderweireld (left) has provided  steel in the Saints defence since Dejan Lovren's (right) departure . Alderweireld, fresh from being part of Atletico Madrid's side which won La Liga and were runners up in the Champions League, has been exactly what they needed. He is strong positionally, is good on the ball and at playing his way out from the back. 'He's an experienced player,' Koeman explained. 'He's played a the high level of the Champions League. We need that, it's a long season, it's another competitive player for the rest of the squad.'","Southampton thrashed Sunderland 8-0 in the Premier League on Saturday .

"In custody: Former prime minister of the Turks and Caicos islands Michael Misick has been arrested in Brazil after fleeing the country with an alleged fortune of $180million . The former jet-setting premier of the Turks and Caicos islands has been arrested in Brazil on an international warrant. Michael Misick fled the British overseas territory in 2009 after a report exposed widespread corruption. The former prime minister is alleged to have amassed a personal fortune of $180m and lived a lavish lifestyle. He was detained  by Brazil's federal police in Rio de Janeiro as he was about to board a plane for Sao Paulo yesterday and will now be extradited back to the Caribbean islands to stand trial. Britain was forced to step in and suspend the constitution and take over administration of the Turks and Caicos islands in 2007. Misick is suspected pf corruption, misusing public money and profiting from the sale of government land to developers. The island's tourism industry saw a boom in resort-building during his time in office. Misick, who was first elected in 2003, has always strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Brazil's federal police said in a statement that agents 'have been investigating his whereabouts for more than a year'. It is understood he had been living in Rio de Janeiro for a number of months and frequently some of the city's most exclusive neighbourhoods such as Ipanema and Leblon. He had papers to work in the country and had apparently tried to claim the right to asylum - but had his application rejected last month.

"A wealthy businessman who illegally claimed more than £35,000 in benefits despite owning a £2million property empire has been jailed. Mohsen Sabet, 48, had over £800,000 stashed in a string of bank accounts and ran two shops. But he still tried to get away with claiming thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money over seven years. Wood Green Crown Court heard Mohsen Sabet, 48, illegally claimed more than £35,000 in benefits despite owning a £2million property empire . Sabet even changed his name from Mohsen Aboudarda by deed poll in 2004 to avoid being caught out by the three local authorities he deceived, Wood Green Crown Court heard. He was eventually exposed by Barnet Council's fraud squad after suspicions were raised by the neighbouring authority in Enfield, London. Sabet, from Whetstone, London, was jailed for nine months on March 7 after pleading guilty to ten charges of benefit fraud. Sentencing, Judge James Patrick described the frauds as 'systematic, deliberate and dishonest, motivated by greed and a sense of personal injustice'. Barnet Council leader Richard Cornelius said: 'This was a truly brazen attempt by a man who owned a business and significant assets to cheat the system and claim benefits which are intended to help those in genuine need.' The court heard Sabet illegally claimed housing and council tax benefit from Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Councils, as well as receiving financial assistance from the Department for Work and Pensions. This included more than £6,500 from Barnet Council under his previous name of Mohsen Aboudarda. They found he owned and was running two luggage shops in Enfield and Tottenham and that he owned several homes in the name of Sabet. The benefits cheat also owned four properties, three of them outright, and had 17 different bank accounts at one time containing a total of £800,000. He later also admitted to having assets in Iran worth more than £1million. Confiscation proceedings have now been initiated to recover the money Sabet illegally claimed.","Mohsen Sabet had more than £800,000 stashed in bank accounts .

"Anyone not clear of the genesis of Bayern Munich moving for Xabi Alonso should probably be directed to the 31st minute of last season’s German Cup Final. Pep Guardiola’s team had just been mauled, torn to shreds, by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final — a performance that the Catalan calls the worst mistake of his entire career. Everyone around the club was shattered by the 5-0 aggregate humiliation but the rallying call had been sounded for the domestic final against Borussia Dortmund (The Bayern executives are driven by a ferocious strategic wish to subjugate the northerners). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xabi Alonso on his Bayern Munich debut and Pep Guardiola . Key role: Xabi Alonso has been at the heart of the very football which Bayern want to replicate . Not only is Dortmund’s eccentric, electric coach Jürgen Klopp fond of comparing the Bavarians to a James Bond super-villain, this tie was already the football equivalent of the umpteen Spanish Clásicos which helped define Guardiola’s reign at Barcelona as one of the all-time-great managerial innings. It was the ninth meeting between the Bundesliga’s two dominant forces in two seasons and the fourth in 10 months since the Catalan had taken over at Bayern. In the previous three games Guardiola’s side had won once, away, but lost the Supercup 4-2 and been thumped 3-0 at the Allianz Arena. Risk: Bayern have pledged to pay £16m over two years for a player about to turn 33 . Two defeats, seven goals conceded and now reeling from the five-goal thumping from Madrid. Crisis time. For this moment of huge significance Guardiola planned to flood the centre of the pitch but to ask huge amounts, tactically and physically, from Philipp Lahm as the central, organising midfielder next to Toni Kroos. After half an hour Lahm had to come off, injured and in danger of missing the World Cup if he continued. Guardiola looked around and found he needed to choose the out-of-form Franck Ribéry, who had been fighting injury himself, to go on as Lahm’s replacement and play out of position in organising central midfield. One of the club’s most quixotic and effective wingers ever, playing Guardiola’s almost ‘sacred’ pivote position for the first time in his life to take over from a converted full-back. At one of the most powerful and wealthy clubs in the world. Just after they had won the treble. Crazy. Match up: James Bond and super-villain Raoul Silva in Skyfall . It was a moment emblematic of the Catalan’s first season in charge. Over the year he had used up to seven players in that position: the one which he himself played for Johan Cruyff’s ‘Dream Team’ and which is, without question, the mega-powerful microprocessor through which all team commands, all intelligent positional play and all the passing movements to restart play from the back must flow. Javi Martínez, Thiago Silva, Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Kroos, Pierre Hojbjerg and Mario Götze had all been asked to interpret that cerebral role — with varying degrees of success. Partly that had been to do with Guardiola’s fanatical drive to keep re-touching his playing scheme, to keep re-inventing and outmanoeuvring his opponents. Mostly it had to do with the incessant injury crisis at the club — Guardiola didn’t have a fully-fit, injury-free squad until March and then that nirvana lasted about 10 days. The Final? Yes, Bayern won after extra-time and after still more tactical tinkering and Ribéry going off with the injury which cost him, not Lahm, World Cup participation. So, to Alonso. Already this season Guardiola has lost one fulcrum player in Javi Martínez, whose knee-ligament damage means he is out for several months. Thiago has played only 25 times in a year and is currently taking longer to recover from his third major injury at the club since joining. Rivalry: Bayern Munich takes on Borussia Dortmund in last season's German Cup final . The news that Schweinsteiger will also be out for weeks, added to the fact that Bayern’s directors and sporting director Matthias Sammer couldn’t find a way to incentivise Kroos — now at Madrid — to stay, means that Guardiola was bound to act. And decisively, too. Bayern was once the Euro-elite club with the strictest transfer market and wage policy. But they’ve just bought a man on the verge of turning 33 for what may well amount to £8million and to whom they’ll pay a minimum of £8m in wages over two seasons. It’s a risk. And couldn’t they have used that much money to persuade Kroos to stay? Or was there another reason for his exit? It’s a huge demonstration of faith in Guardiola, who specified that Alonso was what was needed, and a declaration of further ambition to dominate both Germany and Europe. Guardiola called Alonso ‘a great professional with a strong personality and, above all, an intelligent footballer’. The Basque midfielder has been at the heart of the very football — Spain’s world domination — which Bayern want to replicate. They value his brain, his precision, his dedication, his ruthlessness and his experience. Real deal: Bayern could not persuade Toni Kroos to reject move to Madrid . As for Alonso? He renewed his Madrid contract last December on being informed by them that a proposed freedom-of-contract move to Bayern wasn’t going to happen. His frankness, now, is admirable. ‘Having won La Decima (Madrid’s 10th European Cup) I had the instinct that my time here was coming to an end. ‘I need certain incentives and they probably take the form of a new challenge, different ambitions. I saw a new cycle starting around me at Madrid and to be at the highest level I thought I needed to test myself somewhere new. Nobody at the club wanted me out, this was my decision.’ Like Guardiola, he will handle the language and the fact he speaks English will help, while there’s a good smattering of Spanish at the club, too. While Guardiola’s teams are always athletic and one of his maxims is that . they must ‘run and run and run’, it’s Alonso’s positional intelligence and precision of passing which will matter more than the fact that his legs and lungs ended last season at a low ebb. In the Bundesliga he’ll find, compared to Spain, some of what he misses from English football: fuller, noisier stadia, 90-minute sporting aggression — lots of Davids tilting at Goliath. And he calculates that he’ll win his third Champions League with a third different club. Guardiola and Alonso — once fierce and unforgiving rivals across the Clásico divide. Now united. Watch out everyone else.","Bayern coach Pep Guardiola hailed Xabi Alonso 'an intelligent footballer'

"The Malaysian rifle shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi will be 34 weeks pregnant when she competes in the Olympic Games in London . In Olympic shooting competitions, every ounce of concentration is required at all times. But when Malaysian shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi takes aim with her rifle at the London Olympics, she’s unlikely to be bothered by whispers in the crowd, the screech of a bird or a mobile phone going off. A kick at a crucial moment from her first child, however, and it could be a different story. The 29-year-old from Perak - situated 125 miles north of Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur - is due to give birth to her first child on September 2, less than a month after the Games end. She will be about 34 weeks pregnant when she fires her rounds in the 10m rifle event. And with her huge baby bump, she will certainly be the most conspicuous of the 390 shooters taking part in the competition at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich. She will not be the first pregnant athlete to compete in the Olympics, but never before has a competitor been so close to the due date. Nur Suryani touched down in London yesterday with her husband Marhazli Mohtar, a policeman. While he has been supportive of her London 2012 aspirations, friends and her national Olympic committee weren’t so sure. ‘Most people said I was crazy and selfish because they think I am jeopardising my baby’s health,’ she said. ‘My husband said grab it as this is a rare chance which may not come again. Also, I am the mother. I know what I can do. I am a stubborn person. ‘They [the Malaysian National Olympic Committee] wanted to send me to London early because they are afraid, but what I hear from Malaysian airlines is that it is not recommended to travel for a pregnant woman from 35 weeks.’ Nur Suryani in action in a competition in Subang, Malaysia . Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi carries her equipment after a practice session at the Royal Artillery Barracks . Nur Suryani is currently ranked 47th in the world and is a former Commonwealth Games gold medallist . After the Olympics have finished, she won’t have to . wait too much longer to welcome her daughter, who will be named Dayana . Widyan, in to the world. And . it could be a double celebration if Nur Suryani gets on the Olympic . podium. She is currently ranked 47th in the world and is a former . Commonwealth Games gold medallist, partnering Nur Ayuni Farhana Halim in . the air rifle pairs at the 2010 Games in New Delhi. In . November last year, she won two gold medals in the Southeast Asian . Games in the 10 metre air rifle and 50m rifle three position. She . achieved the Olympic qualifying marks in both disciplines in January at . the Asian Champions event in Qatar, days after finding out she was to . become a mum, but her pregnancy will limit her to just the 10m event. Understandably, Nur Suryani has had to adjust her stance to take part in the event. Some rifle shooting disciplines involve lying on your stomach as one of three positions from which to shoot. 'Yeah, I cannot do a prone position with this big stomach,' she said. 'At first yes, I was disappointed not to compete in that one (three position) but when I think back, this is still a great opportunity. ‘I . will talk to the baby before I compete: ‘No kicking, stay calm for one . hour and 15 minutes only please. But if the baby kicks I have to breathe . easy and let her calm down before shooting.’ But she is unfazed by the challenge, having been comfortable in what many would perceive as a 'man's sport' since the age of 15. 'I like a rough job like that, not something girlie or feminine, I don't . like those types of sports so I tried and its been ok.'","Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi will be 34 weeks pregnant when she competes in 10m rifle shooting event in London .

"A benefits cheat, who sailed across the Atlantic in his private yacht while receiving incapacity payments and illegally pocketing nearly £30,000 in housing and council tax handouts, has been jailed for four months today. Graham Axford, 58, who was exposed in a BBC Panorama programme called 'Britain on the Fiddle' secretly owned a property in Wales and part-owned a French farmhouse in Normandy, which he restored. During the fraud Axford, of South Norwood, Croydon, south London, who has claimed incapacity benefit since 1995, sailed his £25,000 private 42-foot yacht from South Carolina to the Azores in the North Atlantic - a journey of 2,900 miles. Graham Axford said he 'resented' the accusations made against him, but was found guilty of benefit fraud . 'On any view you have a joint interest in or owned part of a home in France by 2003 and in 2007 you declared to the council that you were not paying a mortgage and that was a blatant lie,' Croydon Crown Court Judge Peter Gow QC told him. 'You were paying a mortgage on a property in Wales that you owned and later sold, although it was in negative equity. 'This was a fraud carried out over a significant period of time and you have been overpaid benefits as a result of your dishonest claims.' He tried to lie his way out of trouble during his trial, clashing with the prosecutor and swallowing medication in the witness box while claiming: 'I'm trying not to get angry here, you are trying to twist this. 'I’ve had this from the council for two bloody years and I have just had to take a pill to stop my heart racing.' Jailed: The keen cyclist sailed across the Atlantic in his yacht, the court heard . The benefits cheat failed to declare he owned a property in Wales that he bought in 1984 and had a mortgage for. He also did not reveal he part owned a farmhouse in Normandy . He was convicted of three charges of dishonestly making a false representation to the London Borough of Croydon on a housing benefit and council tax benefit application form by failing to declare property ownership in France and Wales, once in 2003 and twice in 2007, resulting in a loss of £29,456.55. During the fraud keen cyclist Axford, who stood as a Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2010 local elections, deliberately kept his Welsh property and French farmhouse a secret. He bought the Welsh property for cash in 1984 and claimed in court he had transferred complete ownership to his ex-wife Suzanne in 1997 and the Land Registry were wrong in recording him as the owner. 'Have I told a deliberate lie? No, and I resent the accusation,' said Axford before he broke down in the witness box. No charges were brought regarding Axford’s incapacity claim, which he made for a back injury following a motorcycle accident, but it did not stop him participating in a twenty-four hour time-trial championship two years ago as a member of Addiscombe Cycling Club. Not expecting a custodial sentence he cycled in for his sentencing today and his bike remains locked to the court’s railings. Axford failed to comply with a confiscation questionnaire and Judge Gow told him: 'Responsibility to comply with the court order is yours Mr Axford and the court has the ultimate sanction of imprisonment if you fail to comply.' Len Furlong, defending, said: 'He is a man with health problems, cardiac heart disease and a degenerative spine. 'He does work within the community, carries out duties in a soup kitchen, volunteers at a crisis centre, does cycle training for the disabled and on Friday’s works in a charity shop for the blind.'","Graham Axford jailed for four months for benefits fraud .

"The new Botox? Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, a well-known Harley Street doctors, claims his new treatment is 'as big and important as Botox was seven years ago' When it was first revealed that women . were paying to have a toxin injected into their faces in an attempt to hold back the march of time, there were howls of derision . from the public. That was . more than two decades ago, and even when in 2002 cosmetic Botox received . official approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, which . evaluates new medical procedures, critics continued to pour scorn on the . procedure. But in recent years, legions of . British women have taken up the habit - and celebrities such as Simon Cowell and Kim Kardashian have even tried it out - making it one of the most popular anti-ageing procedures of the decade. However, while A-listers have been banishing wrinkles with Botox, one of their favourite cosmetic doctors has been quietly championing the next big thing. Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh is an acclaimed Harley Street doctors who treats and has developed a range of topical creams with supermodel Cindy Crawford. He says his new treatment is 'as big and important as Botox was seven years ago.' Dr Sebagh, whose clinics in Paris . and London's Wimpole Street are packed with the beautiful and the very . rich (many fly in to see him the way most of us would pop to the shops), has been offering the treatment for 14 months. On his website, he describes the . £1,200 treatment as a 'technological innovation offering women what no . treatment has ever provided in such a simple way: a redefined face, . restored volume and reduced wrinkles by means of a 30-minute treatment . at their doctor’s, for a result lasting up to 18 months.' During the procedure, thread made of polylactic acid is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic. Dr Sebagh says that he uses the thread to give a tailor-made result, lifting specific parts of the face. This acid . is completely biodegradable and acts on the deeper layers of the skin . and naturally stimulates the body so that it produces its own collagen. He claims this . action, which continues over time, helps increase the volume . of saggy areas and restore shapeliness to the face gradually and naturally. Is this goodbye Botox? The £1,200 treatment claims to offer women a redefined face, restored volume and reduced wrinkles by means of a 30-minute treatment, which promises to last up up to 18 months . Speaking to ES magazine . about the procedure, he said: 'It's a thread that dissolves completely . after 18 months, and it has an immediate lift and lasting regenerative . effect, all along the thread. 'It . really looks chic,' he said of the 30-minute treatment. 'It restores . fat to the right place, with the right tension. It provides volume, but . not too much. Not like all these weird faces we see puffed up like . balloons.' 'I have used Silhouette Soft thread on ten women today, starting in the morning with a queen of one of the Middle Eastern countries,' he revealed. Don't fancy having your face threaded or going back for top-ups every six months? Another hot new anti-ageing treatment is being offered by Dr Yannis Alexandrides of 111 Harley St. How does it work? Dr Sebagh uses the thread to give a tailor-made result, lifting specific parts of the face. The thread, which is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic, is made of polylactic acid . He swears by the Thermafrax lift, which doesn’t penetrate skin. It’s a tighten, tone and resurface treatment that combines Thermage technology (Gwyneth Paltrow's favourite) and Fraxel resurfacing to provide what's described as the 'ultimate non-surgical face-lift'. 'It’s a one-off treatment that targets surface skin condition and also deeper layers of skin for a tight, youthful result,' says Dr Alexandrides. 'A surgical facelift requires two weeks minimum recovery time, and only combats sagging, aged skin. The ThermaFrax Lift targets both the sagging, and improves skin texture with results that last up to 10 years.'","Dr Sebagh launches Silhouette Soft .

"Think of a place that is known for the quality of its surfing, and a few destinations may spring to mind. Australia, certainly, with its long sandy shoreline and near-obsessive love for the sport that plays out on beaches from Brisbane to Perth. The glorious coastline of California. Even our own Cornwall, with its busy boarding scene. But Iran? This enormous Middle Eastern country does not, probably, feature in too many people’s perceptions of a perfect haven for surfers – despite its being able to lay claim to some 1520 miles of seafront along the edges of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Riding the waves: Easkey Britton has spent three years surfing and teaching in Iran . But try telling that to Easkey Britton. The 28-year-old Irish surfer has spent several weeks in the past three years riding the waves in a remote region of what is – to Western minds – a little-understood state. In doing so, she has helped to break down cultural boundaries, and introduced Iranian women to a sport that was always waiting on their doorstep. Now her achievements are the subject of a new film, Into The Sea, which will premiere tomorrow (9 October) at the London Surf/Film Festival. It is a fascinating spectacle which sees her travel to the south-east corner of Iran, very close to the Pakistan border, and don a head-covering hijab to ensure she observes local custom while surfing. Britton’s odyssey began when she decided to seek a fresh challenge. Born in County Donegal, she was introduced to the art of surfing by her father at the tender age of four – and had won the Irish National Surfing Championships four consecutive times by 2008. Helping hand: Easkey Britton (middle of shot, green hijab) has been teaching women to surf in south-east Iran . In 2011, she looked to new horizons, teaming up with French filmmaker Marion Poizeau. Together, the two women decided to head to Iran, to see if it had any sort of surf culture. ‘It started off as a wild idea, passed along through friends of friends who also love to explore off the beaten track,’ Britton explains. ‘When I first heard about Iran, I realised how little I knew about the place or the people – and that most of what I did [know] was shaped by preconceptions fed to me by what we hear in the media, which is overwhelmingly negative. We didn't know what to expect and I couldn’t resist that sense of adventure: to explore and possibly find waves with no-one.’ Her wanderlust carried her to Chabahar, Iran’s most southerly city – a distant outpost which sits a full 1,130 miles south-east of the capital Tehran, but just 70 miles from the frontier with Pakistan, in Baluchistan, Iran’s poorest (and arguably its most dangerous) region. She was led by the thrill of the unknown and the roar of the waves – Baluchistan is home to the only sections of Iran’s long coastline which are ideal for surfing. And she found both around the little seaside village of Ramin, which lies directly to the east of the city. Unlikely surf destination: Easkey heads to Iran to surf and to teach others how to ride the waves . Of course, when she and Poizeau reached the beach, there was nobody in sight. ‘There was no surf culture in Iran,’ Britton remembers. ‘No one was surfing there.’ No one, that is, until she took to the water. During one of her first forays into the waves of the Gulf of Oman, a police car pulled up by the beach. Britton confesses that, despite being properly attired, she was concerned. Had she inadvertently broken the rules? She need not have been worried. The police were intrigued by the novelty of her actions, but otherwise just wanted to check that the two women were OK. They also pointed out rocks on the beach, and in the shallows, which could prove hazardous. ‘I was quite naive on that first trip,’ she recalls. ‘But this left me open to the unexpected. Leaving behind expectations and being open to new experiences can be very surprising in a positive way.’ The trip resulted in a short film, made by Poizeau and released online in the summer of 2012. The four-minute clip showed Britton on her board, but also captured her travel across Iran to reach the deserted beach, as well as the reaction of the locals – quizzical young men and captivated children, fishermen waving from boats at an unusual sight. Easkey, pictured in the Iranian desert, will be featuring in a movie at the London Surf Film Festival . It ventured into Chabahar too, showing a city of welcoming people where Britton and Poizeau shopped in the bazaar, strolled on the waterfront and mingled with young women. The response when the footage hit the web astonished them both. ‘The impact came when Marion released her first short film online,’ Britton explains. ‘There was such disbelief. By sharing our story, with its counter-stereotypical images of how we perceive Iran – as well as images of women and surfing – we created a shockwave. 'That motivated us to want to explore some issues more deeply, in particular the role of gender in places such as Iran, and opportunities for women to try a new sport. ‘Especially surfing, which is so synonymous with freedom.’ It was the beginning of a love affair with Baluchistan that saw Britton to return to the region last year – not, this time, as a tourist, but as a surfing teacher and a gender role model. The online film clip also led to contact with Iranian female snowboarder Mona Seraji, and swimmer and diver Shahla Yasini – and an exciting project was conceived. Easkey says there was no surf culture in Iran before she starting teaching there . ‘The idea to go back [to Baluchistan in 2013] did not come from us, but from [these] other female, pioneering sportswomen from Iran who were excited at the possibility of learning to surf in their own country,’ Britton says. ‘That seemed like a story worth telling – the first surfers in Iran, who are women. A surf history that is being shaped by women.’ This return visit resulted in Into The Sea – footage again filmed by Poizeau. It shows the former Irish surfing champion teaching the basics of her sport to local women and children – with female surfers taking to the waves wearing hijabs and full ankle-length wetsuits. ‘The key rule we must follow as women if we want to surf there is to respect the hijab,’ Britton continues. ‘We have to keep our heads and bodies covered at all times.’ However, surfing has proved to bring a sense of togetherness to the beach. ‘For now, the beach and sea remains an open space for surfing, although we created flagged “surf zones” for men and women during the surfing workshop,’ she adds. Shared experience: Easkey says surfing is a way to bring people together in Iran . ‘That said, in the end, everyone ends up mixed together in the surf, helping each other out. And because some of the best surfers are female, it is often a case of women teaching men.’ She has been thrilled at the impact the classes have had on the local community. ‘It is great to see husbands and fathers asking me to take their wives and daughters surfing,’ she says. ‘On my visit, we actually ran out of surf hijabs – kindly donated by Capsters, a surf company who specialise in making sports hijabs for Muslim women. ‘We were asked by the village leaders and fathers if we could send more so that more women and girls could go surfing.’ The story does not stop with the tide, however. Inspired by their journey into the unknown, Britton and Poizeau have set up Waves of Freedom, a non-profit organisation that – to use its own words – ‘uses surfing as a medium for empowerment, transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society, especially women and girls.’ The body’s first project will be Surf Seeds, an attempt to establish surfing in Baluchistan, via the donation of equipment, formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards – with the end ambition of forging Iran’s first surf club. But in many ways, Easkey has already achieved a good deal. ‘It’s really about connection,’ she says. ‘About seeing people who might seem worlds apart come together in shared experience, connecting through a common bond of surfing. ‘It’s about boundaries dissolving in water.’ Into The Sea will have its first screening as part of the London Surf/Film Festival (www.londonsurffilmfestival.com), on Thursday 9 October.

"Ryanair has been told it must look after passengers when flights are grounded by natural catastrophes, strikes and technical faults. The European Court of Justice ruling yesterday means the airline must cover the cost of meals, hotels and transport. The case dates back to the disruption caused by the eruption of a volcano in Iceland in 2010. Angry: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said that the European Court of Justice's ruling may cause some airlines to go bust . Passengers were stranded across Europe. Ryanair alone cancelled 9,400 flights due to the ash cloud. The ruling is a blow to Ryanair boss . Michael O’Leary, who at first refused to abide by EU laws which state . airlines should support stranded passengers until they fly them home. After pressure from ministers, he was . forced into a U-turn, but Ryanair then became embroiled in a legal . battle to limit future refunds. The ECJ ruling follows on from a . British court’s decision earlier this week to allow passengers to claim . damages after long delays, as reported in the Daily Mail yesterday. The ruling was made after passenger Denise McDonagh was stranded in Faro, Portugal after volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupted. She claimed 1,130 Euros, or £970, to cover costs incurred while she was stuck. The volcanic eruption left millions of passengers unable to return home because it was deemed too dangerous to fly through the ash clouds. Today's ruling could leave airlines open to a raft of future claims. The court recognised compensation claims could have 'substantial negative economic consequences' for airlines, but said a high level of protection must be afforded to passengers. The court also said airlines should foresee any costs but pointed out that ticket prices could be hiked as a result. Mr O'Leary said the court's decision made the airlines 'insurers of last resort' and said whoever was responsible for cancellations should pay compensation. Price hike? Budget airline Ryanair said that it may have to put its prices up due to a ruling that airlines must cover the cost of stranded passengers expenses . He blamed the Government for closing British airspace in 2010, even though 'there was clearly no ash cloud over the UK.' He said: 'We now have a position that when the next time there's an ash cloud or the skies are closed by Europe's governments, the travel insurance companies will walk away and wash their hands and say it was an act of God and the airlines will become the insurers of last resort.' 'Somebody who has paid us fifty quid to travel to the Canaries, who may be stuck there for two weeks, two months, six months, will now sue the airlines and you will have airlines going out of business, and the ones who stay in business will be putting up the air fares to recover these crazy claims.' Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had paid out to everyone affected by the volcano eruption in 2010, including Ms McDonagh, but had still not covered costs despite introducing a compensation surcharge. Stranded: Hundreds of flights were cancelled in 2010 when a volcano erupted in Iceland . He added: 'It's a crazy decision, it's another crazy decision coming from the European court. 'You can't expect us to be providing compensation for the world and his mother when we are prevented from flying. 'Why does somebody have to pay? Why do we take responsibility for something that has been caused by others? 'This compensation culture is running riot in this country.' The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) today reiterated its advice to passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations and advised passengers who were not being treated properly to contact them. Passengers whose flights are delayed or cancelled are entitled to assistance from the airline such as food, drinks and accommodation where necessary, the CAA said. In addition, passengers whose flights have been cancelled at short notice or arrive three hours or more later than scheduled are also entitled to claim for compensation - unless the delay or cancellation was out of the airline's control. A CAA spokesman said: 'These regulations are in place to protect people when things go wrong with their flights. 'Anyone with concerns that they are not being treated correctly by their airline can contact the CAA for advice or to make a complaint.' Ryanair also issued an official statement this afternoon warning of hikes in fares after the ruling. It read: 'Ryanair regrets the decision of the European Court which now allows passengers to claim for flight delays which are clearly and unambiguously outside of an airline's control. Stuck: Passengers pictured stranded at Heathrow airport during the ash cloud crisis . 'Today's decision will materially increase the cost of flying across Europe and consumer airfares will increase as airlines will be obliged to recover the cost of these claims from their customers, because the defective European regulation does not allow us to recover such costs from the governments or unions who are responsible for over 95 per cent of flight delays in Europe.' Like other carriers, the airline said it had already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to passengers affected by the ash cloud. But it contested Ms McDonagh's case because it deemed the amount to be 'excessive'. The case centred around the EU 261 regulations, a European law which means carriers were obliged to refund the bills of thousands of passengers caught up in the crisis which put a ban on great swathes of airspace. It was seen as a test case as Ryanair was the only airline to take a challenge to the European courts. Last October the European Court decided that delays of more than three hours, where the airline was at fault - because of technical faults or lack of flight crew, for example - warranted compensation. With 200million passengers using UK airports annually, and around 2million of those delayed by more than three hours, that may result in 400,000 fliers eligible for refunds every year. British Airways, easyJet, Tui Travel and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) had all opposed that ruling. Compensation to British customers was put on hold until the final ruling in October.","The European Court of Justice ruled that airlines must cover stranded customers' costs .

"This is the moment Jaws lost a bit of its bite. A great white shark snapped off one of its fearsometeeth as it launched a surprise attack on a seal in the waters off Cape Town.

"Manchester United decided to cut their losses on two of Sir Alex Ferguson's worst flops on deadline day as Anderson and Wilfried Zaha were both pushed through the Old Trafford exit door. Anderson, who sealed a £25.7million move to Manchester United back in 2007, was allowed to leave Louis van Gaal's side on a free transfer in order to complete a move back to his native Brazil. Zaha was also allowed to return to familiar surroundings as he rejoined Crystal Palace for a fee around £6m. Manchester United midfielder Anderson has left Old Trafford after spending eight years at the club . Anderson, pictured with Robin van Persie, has joined Brazilian outfit Internacional . Wilfried Zaha completed a deadline-day switch back to Palace after failing to make the grade at Old Trafford . Zaha sealed a permanent switch back to SE25 by signing a five-and-a-half year deal to rejoin the Eagles . The 22-year-old will go down in history as Ferguson's last signing at the Red Devils but he did not have the chance of working under the Scotsman before the former  manager's retirement in 2013. Here, Sportsmail provides a countdown of Ferguson's worst 10 signings during his outstanding 26-year reign at Manchester United. 10 - Zoran Tosic (£7million) January 2009 - June 2010 . Appearances: 4 . Goals: 0 . Ferguson decided to fork out £7m on Serbian winger Tosic in January 2009 as he went in search of a long-term replacement for Ryan Giggs. The former Manchester United manager claimed he had been monitoring Tosic for a number of years but the player, now 27, failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford. Tosic was shipped out on loan to Cologne before eventually completing a move to CSKA Moscow for an undisclosed fee. Former Manchester United winger Zoran Tosic did not score a goal during his time at the club . 9 - David Bellion (£3m) July 2003 - May 2006 . Appearances: 40 . Goals: 8 . Bellion was billed as the 'next Thierry Henry' when he arrived at Old Trafford as a 20-year-old striker. Manchester United beat off fierce competition to sign the Frenchman from Sunderland back in July 2003 on a Bosman before eventually having to pay £3m in compensation. However, Bellion joined Bordeaux after struggling to cope with the demands of life at Old Trafford. David Bellion scored just eight goals in 40 appearances at Manchester United . 8 - Juan Sebastian Veron (£28.1m) July 2001 - August 2003 . Appearances: 82 . Goals: 11 . Veron failed to establish himself in English football after moving to Manchester United for just shy of £30m. Ferguson said Veron 'was a world-class footballer' who would bring 'a personality to the team', however, the big-money signing disrupted the balance of Manchester United's midfield. The former Lazio and Parma playmaker, who was sold to Chelsea in 2003, was unable to form a successful partnership with then Manchester United stars Roy Keane and Paul Scholes. Juan Sebastian Veron (centre) failed to form a successful midfield partnership with Roy Keane (right) 7 - Kleberson (£6.5m) August 2003 - August 2005 . Appearances: 30 . Goals: 2 . Brazilian World Cup winner Kleberson was unveiled as a Manchester United player on the same day as Cristiano Ronaldo. The central midfielder was seen as the big-name signing along alongside the relatively unknown Ronaldo - but we all know which player proved to be the better purchase. Kleberson was signed to replace Veron, but he proved to be just as bad. Kleberson joined Manchester United for £6.5m on the same day as a certain Cristiano Ronaldo . 6 - Wilfried Zaha (£15m) - January 2013 - February 2015 . Appearances: 4 . Goals: 0 . Zaha was afforded just 28 minutes of Premier League football to show he was worthy of rubbing shoulders with the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co. The England international failed to impress both David Moyes and Van Gaal during his brief stint at United. Ferguson's last signing will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong at former club Palace after sealing a permanent move back to Selhurst Park. Zaha has returned to Crystal Palace after failing to hold down a regular spot at Old Trafford . 5 - Ralph Milne (£170,000) - November 1988 - June 1991 . Appearances: 23 . Goals: 2 . Ferguson plucked Milne from Bristol City for a mere £170,000 but has openly stated that the Scottish midfielder was one of his worst buys. Speaking in November 2009, Ferguson said: 'I only paid £170,000 but still get condemned for it.' Milne was unable to find another professional club after leaving United on a permanent basis. Ferguson brought fellow countryman Ralph Milne to Old Trafford for £170,000 in November 1988 . 4 - Eric Djemba-Djemba (£3.5m) - July 2003 - January 2005 . Appearances: 39 . Goals: 2 . 'He's so good they named him twice,' was the phrase which was circling around United's messageboards when Ferguson signed the defensive midfielder from Nantes. Djemba-Djemba was seen as a potential long-term replacement for Keane but he spent the majority of his Old Trafford career on the bench. The fact that Djemba-Djemba is now playing for Persebaya Surabaya in Indonesia tells you all you need to know about his failure to establish himself in Europe. Eric Djemba-Djemba, pictured with Thierry Henry, is among Ferguson's worst purchases . 3 - Massimo Taibi (£4.5m) - August 1999 - July 2000 . Appearances: 4 . Ferguson's biggest failure in the transfer market was being unable to find a suitable replacement for Peter Schmeichel. Taibi was by far the worst he signed in an attempt to fill the gigantic void following the Great Dane's departure. He is remembered for his appalling error against Southampton in September 1999 and for conceding five goals against Chelsea in his final appearance for the Red Devils. Italian goalkeeper Massimo Taibi made several high-profile blunders during his brief stint at the Red Devils . 2 - Anderson (£26m) - July 2007 - February 2015 . Appearances: 179 . Goals: 9 . Ferguson launched a £26m move for Anderson after his brother Martin said he was 'better than Rooney'. The Brazilian's potential was clear to see with the midfielder putting in fine performances against the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool during the early stages of his United career. However Anderson, who was billed as the next Scholes, struggled with fitness during his time in Manchester and has now returned to Brazil after his contract was cancelled. Anderson (right) struggled for form and fitness during his eight-year spell at Manchester United . 1 - Bebe (£7m) - August 2010 - July 2014 . Appearances: 7 . Goals: 1 . Ferguson reportedly beat off competition from La Liga giants Real Madrid to sign Bebe - the first player he signed without watching extensive video footage of. A Manchester United scout was 'adamant' that Ferguson had to move quickly to conclude a deal for the Portuguese forward due to Real Madrid's interest. Bebe recently said 'I thought Manchester United were joking' when they made a move for him in August 2010, which shows just how bizarre his transfer to the Theatre of Dreams proved to be.

"Sales at Poundland have hit almost £1billion in the past year, thanks to a rise in middle-class shoppers moving away from big supermarkets towards smaller budget stores. The firm, which opened its first shop in Burton-on-Trent in 1990, now has 528 outlets across the country. Originally Poundland was shunned by affluent shoppers – but more than one in five of its customers now come from the wealthiest ‘AB’ group of families. Continued growth: Poundland opened its first shop in 1990 and now has 528 outlets across the country. Chief executive Jim McCarthy, pictured, said: 'Value is now a badge of honour for customers' The company published its annual results yesterday, showing a sales increase of 13.3 per cent to £997.8million for the year to the end of March. Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘Value is now a badge of honour for customers across the spectrum.’ And retail analyst David Alexander said: ‘The meteoric sales growth suggests Poundland is putting in foundations to drive single-price retail forward, even as austerity begins to fade.’ The growth came on the back of the opening of 60 new stores, taking the total to 528, while it plans to expand the empire further with a target of some 1,000 outlets. The chain has effectively replaced Woolworths as the budget general store in towns and cities across the country with the result it has spawned a host of copycat rivals. At one time, Poundland was shunned with the result protestors in well-heeled towns even got up petitions and campaigns to keep them out. Middle-class shoppers: One fifth of Poundland's shoppers now come from the wealthiest 'AB' group of families. It has made an effort to attract middle income shoppers with a mix of more upmarket products and brands . The boss of Morrisons have described the change as the biggest shift in shopping habits since the big box supermarkets arrived in the 1950s. Poundland has made a concerted effort to attract middle income shoppers with a mix of more upmarket products and brands, from grow your own veg ranges to gardening gloves and DIY items. It operates more than 30 shops under the Dealz brand in Ireland and earlier this week extended the format to Spain with a store opening in Torremolinos.","Sales at discount chain Poundland have hit almost £1billion in the past year .

"Nasa scientists are planning to capture a 500 ton asteroid , relocate it and turn it into a space station for astronauts on their way to Mars. The White House's Office of Science and technology will consider the £1.6bn plan in the coming weeks as it prepares to set its space exploration agenda for the next decade. If approved it would be the first time a celestial object has ever been moved by humans. Captured: Nasa is considering a plan to 'lasso' an asteroid and deflect it towards the Moon before turning it into a space station . A feasibility report prepared by Nasa and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) scientists outlined how they would go about capturing the asteroid. A, 'asteroid capture capsule' would be attached to an old Atlas V rocket and directed the asteroid between the earth and the moon. Once close, the asteroid capsule would release a 50ft diameter bag that wrap around the spinning rock using drawstrings. The craft would then turn on its thrusters, using an estimated 300kg of propellant, to stop the asteroid in its tracks and tow it into a gravitationally neutral spot. From here space explorers would have a stationary base from which to launch trips deeper into space. The report said: 'The idea of exploiting the . natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years, but only . now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality. 'The feasibility is enabled by three . key developments: the ability to discover and characterize an adequate . number of sufficiently small near-Earth asteroids for capture and . return; the ability to implement sufficiently powerful solar electric . propulsion systems to enable transportation of the captured asteroid; and the . proposed human presence in cislunar space in the 2020s enabling . exploration and exploitation of the returned asteroid. Capturing an asteroid would also open up the possibility of mining it for its mineral wealth. This picture shows Asteroid 87 Sylvia, with its two ""moonlets"" Romulus and Remus which was discovered in 1866 . Nasa declined to comment on the project . because it said it was in negotiations with the White House, but it is . believed that technology would make it possible within 10-12 years. The technology would also open up the possibility of mining other asteroids for their metals and minerals. Some are full of iron which could be used for in the making of new space stations, others are made up of water which could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen to make fuel. Earlier this year Planetary Resources, a company based in Seattle with billionaires including former US presidential candidate Ross Perot and Google's Eric Schmidt and Larry Page among its investors, said it plans to mine 'near Earth asteroids' within 10 years. The project would coincide the . Osiris-Rex project that in 2016 will see a spacecraft visit an asteroid . called 1999 RQ36 and take samples of it back to Earth. The captured asteroid could be transformed into a space station for astronauts to refuel at on their way to Mars (pictured) It is hoped that the project will . increase our understanding of asteroids, and even shed new light on the . origin of life on Earth. The 1999 RQ36 is the most accessible organic-rich . asteroid from the early solar system, its average diameter is . approximately 1,600 feet or about the size of four football fields. The . fact the asteroid is rich in . carbon, a key element in organic molecules necessary for life, means . it could explain more about the building blocks of life on our own . planet. US space agency NASA has invited students from around the world to come up with a better name for the 1999 RQ36 . A panel will review the proposed asteroid names and the International Astronomical Union Committee for Small-Body Nomenclature will approve the winning name. 'Our mission will be focused on this asteroid for more than a decade,"" said Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for the mission at the University of Arizona. 'We look forward to having a name that is easier to say than repeated manned missions and that the undertaking would help build up experience for future jaunts into space. Should any further space exploration take place, there's a good chance that the astronauts will wear the new  suit unveiled last week on the photo-sharing website Flickr. Its design has led to parallels being drawn with the suit worn by Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger action figure. A large hemispherical transparent . dome covering the wearer's head also looks remarkably similar to that . worn by Buzz - although the latest pictures do not make clear if Nasa's . version comes pre-programmed catchphrases. How Nasa's suit matches up to the Star Command model: The latest pictures do not make clear if Nasa's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases - but it otherwise looks remarkably similar . The . main advance in Nasa's rather more primitive effort is that it will . have an entry point at the rear to make it easier to don than previous . suits. Astronauts will be . able to climb into it as quickly as you see in films, and not take an . hour as they do now. The new suit will also effectively be its own . airlock, dispensing with the need to spend time getting the pressure . right.

"Royal Ascot scorer Born In Bombay has been sold out of the stable of Andrew Balding and will continue his racing career in Hong Kong. The royal trainer revealed the winner of the Britannia Stakes was heading for the Far East as he unveiled his team for Glorious Goodwood which is headed by Neptune Investment Management Gordon Stakes hope Scotland and Artemis Goodwood Cup entry Whiplash Willie. Born in Bombay, who raced in the colours of US owner George Strawbridge, was a half-length winner of the Britannia on only his fourth start. Low impact: Andrew Balding watches Whiplash Willie work out in the pool at Park House Stables . Good chance: Whiplash Willie is set to run in the Artemis Goodwood Cup, Balding revealed . Balding said: ‘He is in quarantine already and is off to Hong Kong. I don’t know which trainer here is going to but it was a very good offer.’ Balding has had six winners at Glorious Goodwood, which starts on July 29, with the first being supplied by international moneyspinner Phoenix Reach in the 2003 Gordon Stakes. Balding hopes that mile-and-a-half race, run on the second day of the fixture, will provide a springboard for a tilt at the St Leger for Scotland who third to King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes supplementary entry Eagle Top in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. The one-time Derby entry missed a date at Epsom after finishing third to Orchestra in the Chester Vase. Balding said: ‘The ground was as quick as Scotland wanted at Royal Ascot and I wouldn’t want to run twice on really quick ground. ‘But he is in really good form and ran a very good race in the King Edward VII Stakes. ‘He looks a Leger horse in the making and the intention is to use the Gordon Stakes as a trial. It was a good decision to miss the Derby. He probably a needed a couple of runs in the spring and took a bit of time to come to himself.’ Balding is also hoping that ground does . not get too fast for his fragile Goodwood Cup hope Whiplash Willie, who . has been forced to miss two outings because of quick going. The six-year-old, a son of Phoenix Reach, has raced only 11 times during his career. The disruption, caused by a tendon injury, has not caused Balding to lose faith in his stayer who looks like having to take on the Queen’s 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate and last year’s Goodwood Cup winner, Michael Owen-owned Brown Panther. Hong Kong-bound: Britannia Stakes winner Born in Bombay has been sold out of Balding's stable to the Far East . The trainer said: ‘He was due to run in the St Leger in his  three-year-old career and got a problem before the race and missed two years. ‘We thought plenty of him at the time and his owners have been very patient with him. I hope he would have place prospects at least.’ Balding’s team of handicappers for Goodwood include Van Percy, unplaced from a bad draw in the Northumberland Plate, in the Bet365 Summer Plate and Zanetto in the32Red Stewards’ Cup. Montaly, fifth to Hartnell in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, goes for the Glorious Goodwood Stakes.","Born in Bombay has been sold out of the stable of Andrew Balding .

"A 25ft monster 'shark' with chainsaw teeth that roamed the prehistoric seas 270 million years ago has been revealed by scientists. The bizarre fish Helicoprion, an early ancestor of sharks, had a conveyor belt of jagged teeth that spiralled out of its lower jaw and ripped prey to shreds. Using state of the art scanners to create 3-D virtual reconstructions of its jaws, researchers have now discovered what the ancient beast would have looked like as it homed in on marine animals. Helicoprion, an early ancestor of sharks, had a conveyor belt of jagged teeth that spiralled out of its lower jaw and ripped prey to shreds . Located at the back, the teeth were 'saw-like' with the jaw creating a rolling back and slicing mechanism. Professor Leif Tapanila, of Idaho State University, said: 'We were able to answer where the set of teeth fit in the animal. 'They fit in the back of the mouth, right next to the back joint of the jaw. 'We were able to refute it might have been located at the front of the jaw.' The creature, unlike any shark alive today, grew up to twenty-five feet in length and weighed almost half a ton (71 stone), making it the biggest fish in the sea. The large 'spiral' fossils of teeth are all that remain from the hundred specimens found around the world as its skeleton was made of cartilage, just like its modern descendants, which does not preserve well. Professor Leif Tapanila, of Idaho State University, used state of the art scanners to create 3-D virtual reconstructions of its jaws . Helicoprion's appearance has long mystified scientists because no one could work out how these teeth, which resemble a spiral saw blade, fit into it. Geoscientist Prof Tapanila said: 'New CT (computerised tomography) scans of a unique specimen from Idaho show the spiral of teeth within the jaws of the animal, giving new information on what the animal looked like, and how it ate.' The findings, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, are based on firm evidence fed into computers at his special virtualization laboratory. Another major breakthrough was the beast is more closely related to ratfish than sharks. Both species have cartilage, rather than bone, but are classified differently. The 3D models created by the team show how the 'spiral' teeth fitted in the head of the animal . It was always assumed the Helicoprion was a shark, but it is more closely related to ratfish, a Holocephala. The main thing it has in common with sharks is the structure of its teeth, everything else is Holocephalan. Based on the information, the Idaho Museum of Natural History is creating a life size reconstruction of a modest thirteen foot long Helicoprion for an exhibition this summer, which will also include artwork by world renowned scientific illustrator Ray Troll. Rocks in southeastern Idaho have preserved the largest, most abundant and pristine specimens of Helicoprion many of which include the lower jaw cartilage, teeth and rare impressions of skin. Other remains have been found in Utah and Wyoming when these regions were covered in sea more than 250 million years ago. The researchers created several artist's impressions of the fish to try and work out what it looked like, before a 3D reconstruction revealed the truth (bottom)","Helicoprion had a conveyor belt of jagged teeth that spiralled out of its lower jaw and ripped prey to shreds .

"Just over a month ago, Dieter Gruschwitz dialled Jurgen Klopp’s mobile number, not the first to be quite unsure whether he was about to be deafened with a sonic boom of anger — or to be treated to ‘Kloppo’s’ quick-witted and generous bonhomie. The programme director of German TV station ZDF needed to make the peace. Klopp had taken umbrage at the ‘stupid question’ of ZDF front-man Jochen Breyer in the aftermath of Real Madrid’s clinical 3-0 destruction of Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. ‘That’s the tie over?’ Breyer asked the notoriously volatile and edgy Dortmund manager. ‘How can I accept my salary this month if I stand here and say that’s us out?’ Klopp reasonably demanded. ‘It’d be just as stupid of me to say we are definitely going to hammer them. I can stand here and give stupid answers to stupid questions but I’m not going to any more,’ Klopp finished before calmly walking off. Complex character: Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp did not hold any grudges against the TV station . Gruschwitz discovered that Klopp bore no malice. That he’d ‘forgotten’ about the whole thing. Two things emerged from the incident. Dortmund roasted Real Madrid 2-0 in the return leg, not taking the tie to extra time for the simple reason that Iker Casillas played miraculously well. Secondly, that was the low point of a brutally testing season. The 3-0 defeat to a team which the previous season they’d beaten twice, eliminated from the Champions League semi-final and scored a grand total of eight goals against must have felt like the straw which crippled the camel. Instead it was a point of inflection. They have rallied — winning 3-0 at Bayern 10 days later and qualifying for the German Cup Final next Saturday in Berlin... against Bayern. Set against the backdrop of sudden disharmony in Munich (Pep Guardiola’s methods under question, an inability to properly value a Bundesliga title won in record time and a 4-0 home thrashing by Madrid in the semi-final second leg) Dortmund are already finishing their season with a more optimistic vibe than seemed possible at any time from September onwards, let alone after the 3-0 Madrid rout. Klopp admits: ‘It’s been a tremendously difficult season, since the beginning, full of extraordinary challenges and what is, in my experience, an unprecedented injury crisis. ‘But I’ve always said that it’s not necessary for us to be the “best” team in the world, just that we are capable of beating the “best” team in the world.’ His point is well made. Of the 10 most-used Dortmund players in the Bundesliga last term (Marco Reus, Robert Lewandowski, Roman Weidenfeller, Kevin Grosskreutz, Lukasz Piszczek, Marcel Schmelzer, Mario Gotze, Ilkay Gundogan, Mats Hummels and Jakub Blaszczykowski) only five feature in the top 10 this season. Bad night: Gareth Bale helped Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-0 . Of the others, Gotze is gone (to Bayern), Gundogan has effectively missed the season, Piszczek and Blaszczykowski have played fewer than 24 league games between them and mainstay central defender Neven Subotic, 41 matches last season, has played 16 times this. Add to the mix that, in January, Lewandowski confirmed he’d be moving to Bayern, too — and it’s tough to imagine more hostile working conditions. Saying his goodbyes: Robert Lewandowski will leave Dortmund this summer . This time last year Klopp was comparing Bayern to ‘a Bond villain’, in which case there were stages this season when Double-0-Kloppo, licensed to lose his temper, was strapped to the lab table and Auric Bayern-Finger’s laser was cutting up close to his nether regions. Shocking. So, ahead of the big showdown with Smersh next Saturday, how has he coped? Shaken, but not stirred it seems. Getting better: Dortmund have won more points than last season . Plenty to play for: Dortmund face Bayern in the German Cup final . Dortmund have more points than last season, have conceded fewer Bundesliga goals, came through the hardest Champions League group (Arsenal, Napoli, Marseille), earned around €25million by reaching the quarter-finals, won the German Supercup that they lost to Bayern last term and, if they regain the Cup (from which the super-villains also eliminated them with a back-post goal from Ernst Stavro Blofeld and a toe-poke from Rosa Klebb last season), there will be the double joy of pleasing the 80,000 yellow-and-black clad fanatics who are travelling to the German capital, ticket or no ticket, and ruining Bayern’s summer. Should his Dortmund side inflict its third win of the season over Guardiola’s Bayern and lift the Cup in Berlin then, who knows, Bond may be asked over to the ‘dark’ side in Munich this summer. Uncomfortable to think of him saying ‘yes’, isn’t it? But then, you only live twice.","Klopp aims to end Dortmund season on a high with Cup win over Bayern .

"The family of a man who died from cancer will not receive their insurance payout - because he didn’t declare he had pins and needles. Nic Hughes, 44, died in October after battling cancer of the gall bladder leaving his wife Susannah Hancock, 44, and twin eight-year-old son and daughter. But insurance company Friends Life have refused to honour Mr Hughes’ critical illness policy saying he did not give full disclosure of his health. Denied payout: Nic Hughes, 44, died in October after battling cancer of the gall bladder leaving his wife Susannah Hancock and two eight-year-old twins but insurers have refused to honour his policy because he did not reveal he suffered pins and needles . The insurers say Mr Hughes should have told them his GP suggested he cut down his alcohol intake - and that he experienced pins and needles. But medical records show he drank just 10 to 20 units of alcohol a week - below the NHS recommended weekly allowance of 21 units. Nic’s consultant oncologist Dr Rubin Soomal, from The Ipswich Hospital, said neither alcohol, nor pins and needles were linked to his death. The graphic designers’ devastated family and friends are convinced he was open about the state of his health and Friends Life carried out the necessary pre-policy checks. They have launched an online petition putting pressure on Friends Life to honour the policy. The campaign has already attracted the high profile backing of celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Russell Brand. Kester Brewin, a close friend of Mr Hughes, said he found Friends Life’s decision 'morally repugnant.' Social media campaign: Stephen Fry is one of the high profile supporters of a petition to try and persuade Friends Life to reverse their ruling . Comedian Miranda Hart also supports the campaign. Mr Hughes' friends have got 50,000 people to sign a petition . He said the chief executive had been invited to meet the family, who live in Manningtree, Essex, to talk over the issue and reach a resolution. Mr Brewin said: 'Rather than spending his last few month focusing on his family Nic was forced into a protracted and difficult battle with Friends Life. 'They have shown very little sensitivity to the family’s situation and have refused to pay out on a technicality which has nothing to do with the disease that tragically took his life. 'This is a shameful and miserly act by Friends Life and if they have any sort of conscience they will resolve this mess by the Christmas. 'We hope that they will do the right thing. We’ve invited the chief executive to meet the family to end this dispute without the need for legal process. 'It would be great for Friends Life to do the right thing, in the time of bonus season in the financial industry, and give justice to the family. 'This isn’t a sympathy case - they are being outrageous in their treatment. It’s morally repugnant.' Mr Hughes, who also worked as a . lecturer, took out a critical illness policy with Friends Life in . 2009. He died in October 2012. Tragedy: Nic Hughes, 44, died in October, leaving behind Susannah Hancock, 44, and a twin son and daughter. Now his insurance company say his policy is not valid . A petition demanding Friends Life make the full payout is close to reaching the 50,000 signatures it is seeking. Stephen . Fry, who has been retweeted more than 1,200 times, wrote: 'Man dies of . cancer, insurance won’t pay due to pins and needles. Please ask . @friendslifetalk to do the right thing.' Other celebrity supporters include former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, comedian Miranda Hart and pop star Boy George. A spokesman for Friends Life said: 'We are aware of the current social media activity and the case in question continues to be a priority for senior management. 'We are listening and fully understand the sentiment around these difficult circumstances. 'However, when we consider an application for critical illness cover, we need to have full disclosure of all conditions and their symptoms so that we can properly assess the case. Friends Life has received a raft of complaints via its Twitter feed . 'It is clear in this case that . medical symptoms were not disclosed in response to detailed questions on . the application form which, had we been aware of them, would have meant . we could not offer cover. 'The resolution of this case is a private matter for the family involved. 'As . such, we have continued to liaise with them directly during this . difficult time and whilst we look for a fast-track response to this case . from the Financial Ombudsman. 'We will abide by any decision that the Ombudsman makes.' 'In this season of goodwill, we urge you to honour the bond made with you in good faith by people like Nic and his family' eCard sent to Friends Life . Mr Hughes was diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis - a disease of the colon which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease - in 1991. He took out Critical Illness Insurance with Friends Life in 2009. The policy states it will pay out on confirmation of serious illness. Mr Hughes was diagnosed with metastatic cancer of the gallbladder with spread in the abdomen to lymph nodes in the peritoneum in December 2011 . He was treated with palliative chemotherapy at chemotherapy, but in April 2012 Mr Hughes was given six to nine months to live. The online petition at change.org to convince Friends Life to honour the £100,000 payout, which was started on December 3, today reached its 50,000 signatures target. On Tuesday thousands of digital Christmas ecards emailed by Nic’s supporters, who have also set up a website nicsfight.org, to Friends Life caused the insurance company’s indox to crash. The Christmas ecard sent by thousands of Nic's friends. Click enlarge to see in greater detail . The Christmas ecard reads: 'Nearly 200 years ago, a group of friends got together to look after each other in times of need. 'As you know, they called themselves Friends Provident and based the business on their Quaker beliefs in society, compassion and justice. 'You’ve changed your name since then, but you can still reconnect with where you’ve come from. 'In this season of goodwill, we urge you to honour the bond made with you in good faith by people like Nic and his family. Put people before profits again this Christmas. Please don’t let Nic’s family down.' Charity worker Susannah Hancock, 44, . had to go back full-time just a month after Nic Hughes’ death to provide . for their children. Oncology . consultant Dr Rubin Soomal, from the Ipswich Hospital, said neither . alcohol or pins and needles were linked to Nic’s death and said it was . “cruel and highly distasteful” for Friends Life not to pay out. In . a supporting letter written to the insurance company he said: 'I . understand that he has been refused his Critical Illness Policy in view . of previous vague symptoms of pins and needles and an alcohol intake, . which has been documented by his GP at between 10 and 20 units of . alcohol per week. 'I wish to state categorically that neither of these 2[sic] events are related to his current diagnosis. 'I . also wish to stress that 10 or 20 units of alcohol per week are within . the Department of Health’s recommendations of safe levels. 'Again, . I do not understand why these 2 pieces of information have somehow been . used to deny him a payment under his Critical Illness Policy. '[...] His prognosis could easily be measure in under 6 or 9 months from today and I think it cruel and higly distasteful that the above 2 irrelevant details from his medical history have been used as some sort of pretext to deny him a payment on his Critical Illness Policy.' Consultant Physician and Gastroenterologist Dr Simon Williams, from The Ipswich Hospital, who treated Nic for Ulcerative colitis, agreed with Dr Soomal. In a supporting letter he wrote: 'I would absolutely agree with my Oncological colleague, Dr Rubin Soomal, that his current diagnosis is in no way related to the symptoms that seem to form the basis for rejecting the claim.' Mr Hughes’ close friend of 15 years teacher Kester Brewin, 40, said Nic was “trying to be honest” when he told his GP his alcohol intake. A spokeswoman for Friends Life said: 'Friends Life follows the ABI code on non-disclosure and Treating Customers Fairly. 'It is also important to note that in 2011 alone we paid out £89.5m in CI claims and to 90 per cent of claimants. 'We must reiterate that it is essential that all customers correctly disclose all the information asked for when applying for any form of insurance cover, even if they are not sure that it is relevant, as failure to do so can result in the policy being invalid and cancelled.'","Nic Hughes died from cancer of the gall bladder leaving wife and young twins .

"Christine Kettyle wasn’t sure what to expect. She certainly wasn’t expecting to burst in to tears. But as she stands back and takes in this extraordinary monument to the human bonds which unite this fractious kingdom, she is overwhelmed. ‘I just feel that we’re about to see our family break up and so this has made me incredibly emotional,’ she says, before adding an impeccably British: ‘Sorry!’ We are standing slap bang on the Scottish-English border at Gretna. Before us, stands a pile of tens of thousands of rocks and stones, some painted with the Union flag, some with the Saltire, some with little messages. Most are just plain stones from all over Britain. All are a plea for unity on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Emotion: Supporters of the UK have gathered at a cairn on the Scottish border; this image shows members of the public spelling out an N next to the round structure . Unity: This rock was painted with the Scottish and English flags by a member of the public . A lady popped in earlier after driving from the Isle of Mull to drop off a large red rock. Today’s post brought a piece of the Berlin Wall wrapped in a Union flag. It was sent by a man in Glossop, accompanied by a rather touching letter saying that the collapse of that wall in 1989 had been ‘the triumph of unity over division’. In sending his bit of old Eastern Bloc masonry, he fervently hoped that these islands would not be going in the opposite direction. All the stones are piled high, around a dry stone central chamber, to form a cairn -an ancient marker in the landscape - celebrating the human dimension of Union. And since the first stone was laid in July, the ‘Union Cairn’ has grown in to a 350-ton symbol of togetherness. It is now 150 feet in circumference and nine feet tall. It was just 18 inches high at the start. The organisers reckon there are now 75,000 stones in the pile. Since the sudden surge in support for the nationalist cause, it’s all been gathering extra momentum. Many stones have been placed by Scots. Just as many – if not more – have been laid by Scots, English, Welsh, Irish and others who have no vote in this referendum campaign because they do not have a Scottish postcode. Organisation: Alice Bragg is one of those who is helping to construct the cairn . Star power: Joanna Lumley, pictured with Tory MP Rory Stewart, has visited the structure . They want to do something to show they care, beyond a vacuous tweet. So here is one positive, demonstrative way of showing how they feel. To those, like Christine, who fear that everything they hold dear is about to implode, it is both moving and reassuring. The English-born daughter of a Pole who fought with the British in the last war and became a Brit, Christine, 60, is married to a Scotsman, has two English/Scottish children and lives in Glasgow. In other words, she is a true Brit. And she had never really felt need to question her happy jumble of dynastic and geographical allegiances until this blasted referendum business came along. It’s the same for Frank Wilson, 70. Cumbrian-born, he is married to a Scot, lives in Scotland and has family on both sides of the border. ‘I just felt it was right to come here,’ he says. ‘But I don’t want to make a big fuss.’ Of course not. That would be very, well, unBritish. All day, a steady trickle of cars, buses, bikes and hikers appear in the field next to Gretna’s Old Toll Bar Café which prides itself on being both the ‘First’ and ‘Last’ house in Scotland. On Saturday night, a thousand supporters gathered at the cairn for a free music festival. Attraction: People have been coming from all over the UK to visit the cairn near Gretna . Structure: The cairn is growing ever bigger as supporters of the Union add stones to the pile . Location: The cairn is situated exactly on the border between England and Scotland, near the small town of Gretna . This is the ‘heart’ side of a debate which grows turgid and ugly whenever people get on to the ‘head’ side of things. ‘We don’t really talk much about currency here,’ says Chris Land, 28, one of the energetic young team running Hands Across The Border, the campaign behind the cairn. Edinburgh born and bred, he is a Cambridge graduate who chucked in a London consultancy job earlier in the summer to defend the Union. If it’s a ‘yes’ vote, he says he will probably emigrate. ‘It won’t be the Britain which I feel I belong to.’ Another member of the team is Alice Bragg who has taken time off from running a London charity to help. The daughter of Lord Bragg, broadcaster and champion of all things Cumbrian, she spent much of her youth near here in border country. ‘I just can’t begin to imagine waking up and finding a steel fence right there,’ she says, gesturing at the tiny River Sark. ‘It’s like tearing up a family for no reason whatsoever.’ Like many, she has found the political aspect of the No campaign – Westminster suits dishing out home truths to the Scots – badly lacking in both excitement and momentum. This sort of campaign, she hopes, will strike a different chord. It’s all run on a shoestring. HQ is a caravan and a table in the Old Toll Bar Café. But this is the passionate, grass roots side of the Unionist campaign. The team are encouraging people who cannot make it up the M6 – or down the A74 - to Gretna to send photos of themselves with stones to the Hands Across The Border website. Addition: A mother pushing a pram puts another stone on the ever-growing pile . International: As this map shows, the stones have come from all over Britain and the world . Oxford graduate Angus Aitken, a Londoner with Scottish roots, hopes to join the Army next year. He left a job on a Campbelltown fishing boat two months back to come here and do this. ‘If I am in the Army, I want it to be the British Army,’ he says quietly. Another carload turn up and quietly admire what is going on here. An English couple, who retired to their ‘dream home’ in Dumfries, tell me that they are so worried about impending separation that they have just put their house on the market. They have even talked to their bank manager about repatriating their life’s savings to England. They won’t give me their names. ‘There are some people who, let’s just say, have not been very pleasant,’ says Mrs Anonymous. Quite a few of today’s stone layers will not be named. It’s a depressing but familiar symptom of the malevolence of certain elements in this campaign. Only the other day, the cairn team arrived to find a huge ‘Yes’ spraypainted on the stonework. ‘We have approached pretty much every celebrity, comedian and actor you can think of asking them to lend their support,’ says Rory Stewart, Tory MP for Penrith and the Border and the man who dreamed up this cairn in the first place. ‘I’m sad to say that the common response is “I’m very sympathetic but it’s not really appropriate for me to get involved.” It’s sad.’ Among the handful of famous faces who have lent support is Joanna Lumley. After her famously combative 2009 campaign to get a better deal for Gurkha veterans, she was never likely to be deterred by the bile of a few nationalists. Putting a stone on a pile of rocks between Carlisle and Glasgow may not save the Union. But it is often the small rituals – a yellow ribbon or a bunch of garage flowers – which can suddenly accelerate in to a movement. And it is, surely, more dignified than pouring a bucket of iced water over a celebrity’s head.","Cairn is made up of 100,000 stones placed by members of the public at Gretna on the Scottish border .
Supporters have been travelling from all parts of the UK to add to the pile - with many overcome by emotion ."

Numerous documents make up the collection including 'shooting call' sheets issued to the cast and crew. One of the sheets is dated September 18, 1974, when three scenes were shot which were 'Alex Kintner's death', 'Brody and Hooper swim in' and 'Brucie's demise (the explosion)'. Brucie was the nickname given to the model shark and the remark refers to the penultimate scene in which Brody blows it up by shooting an oxygen canister in its mouth.

The film follows a police chief, a marine scientist and a grizzled fisherman as they set out to stop a great white shark terrorising the small island community of Amity. It became the highest-grossing film of all time and was the most successful motion picture of all time until Star Wars. Adjusted for inflation, it currently stands at seven on the all time top grossing list. Gone With The Wind is top. The film, often cited as one of the greatest of all time, has spawned a number of memorable quotes, including Broady's line 'You're going to need a bigger boat'. It also helped to establish a model followed by Hollywood for years after, which sees a blockbuster action film with a 'high-concept' premise released in the summer with heavy advertising. Other documents in the archive are . menus for restaurants in Menemsha, a fishing village on Martha's . Vineyard, New England, US, where the movie was shot. There . is also a rosta of all the cast and crew and the names of the hotels . and bed and breakfasts they were staying in during the filming which . took place between June and September 1974. Laura . Yntema, of Nate D Sanders, said: 'Jaws was one of Spielberg's first . movies that he directed and this archive is very important for that . reason but also because it was one of the major movies of the 1970s. 'You would think that for such an important movie there would be a lot more souveniers from it but this was before people started to collect movie memoribilia and a lot of things were just thrown out. 'We have never come across memoribilia like this from Jaws before. 'It was collected by a nautical technician who worked on the set and there are quite a few picture of him and his wife around the island.' The auction was due to take place tomorrow.

"The Centro de Treinamento Alfredo Gottardi is large, sprawling and, in places, a little down at heel. The football pitches are well tended and the hotel is in reasonable condition. But there is a sense of fading grandeur at Atlético Paranaense, partly enhanced by the dripping, dank atmosphere of the Curitiba winter. All around the vast training complex there is poverty, decay, people without work sitting on their doorsteps drinking from litre bottles of beer and the only things for sale are tractors, new tyres, fresh oil and a revamped exhaust if you want it. Shock: The world champions are out of the 2014 World Cup after two consecutive defeats . Won't need these again: Iker Casillas throws his gloves to fans after a poor display at the Maracana . Head bowed: Vicente Del Bosque got major decisions wrong throughout a dismal campaign for Spain . You can easily imagine that, when they were first opened, these grounds where Spain have been living and training must have been a shiny, glittering monument to football. These days, they’ve been overtaken by the kind of first-class facilities encountered at the majority of top European football clubs. All in all, Spain’s chosen home here in Brazil has been a decent metaphor for their World Cup  performance: Down at heel, lacking in warmth, no longer cutting edge. And there are other things, beyond the football, which separate Spain’s campaign in Brazil from the  victories in Switerland-Austria in 2008, South Africa in 2010 and Poland-Ukraine two years ago. There have been a myriad of small fissures which have combined to make a genuine San Andreas fault right down the middle of the world champions’ brand of play. First to the intangibles. This is the first major tournament since Spain started winning where the players’ daily life is not complemented with time off to spend with wives, girlfriends, kids, grandparents. Brazil is an odd place. The army is everywhere; patrolling the streets, guarding the training ground, swarming all over every stadium. Between crime and social protest, Spain’s players have been stripped of the natural outlet of wandering around their local area. This is also the first tournament since the breakthrough where Spain have done no double sessions. Treated as a way to hone fitness and match sharpness, plus a specific attack on the kind of boredom and loneliness which can suck the vitality out of any squad, I think it has been an error to decide that — because the players are brutally tired after six or seven years of constant top-level challenges and success — this was the time to drop the second sessions. Then there’s the climate. Winter in Curitiba is no worse than an inhospitable Scottish autumn, but the weather has been grey, damp and grisly cold. Horror: Casillas has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by Sergio Ramos against Chile . Awful: Brazilian-born Diego Costa has been a huge disappointment for Spain in the first two games . For Spaniards, it has been a bane. More so when the first game in Salvador was preceded by a hot, humid training day and the build-up weather in Rio was in the mid 80s. Neither match was difficult in terms of the heat or humidity but both environments were a huge change from the chill of the south. But back in 2008 the mud and the rain of Stubaital, where Spain trained, were a much more stark contrast with the sweltering heat of the three knockout matches in Vienna en route to the title. Temperatures at night in Potchefstroom often hit zero or less and Spain coped. What has changed? Appetite? Youth? Squad harmony? Something I can tell you as a first-hand witness is that what Vicente del Bosque said on Friday — that there has been no correlation between how the world champions train and how they play — is true.We’ve been permitted to watch all but two of the training sessions here and Spain have moved the ball with dazzling speed and confidence. The work was serious, the players motivated.You could hear the voices of Sergio Ramos, Pepe Reina and del Bosque urging more from those involved. Trouble: Fernando Torres looked more threatening than Costa despite struggling for form in recent years . Is that a captain's stance? Casillas looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half . Out on their feet: The Spanish team looked tired in the second half, and were outrun against Chile . What you all watched on television — stumbling, imprecise, languid, unrecognisable shadows — did not resemble the guys we had watched. Something which now seems completely clear is that this group has been knocked dizzy by three firm blows to the chin. Firstly, Spain have moved in the food chain from predators to prey. For years teams were petrified of them. Teams parked the bus because they knew that hitting Spain on the counter was probably the least risky way of doing them damage. Gradually, France in the qualifying group, Italy in the Confederations Cup semi-final and Brazil in the  subsequent final have shown that, if you go after Spain, then athleticism, height and power can leave the world champions vulnerable. Secondly — the fact that Xavi, at 34, is a declining force has been of cataclysmic importance. As for those who say it was wrong of del Bosque to bring him, there was little of that talk when he  produced the brilliant pass from which Diego Costa won the penalty in the opening match. It’s also worth pointing out that when Xavi was dropped for the Chile match, Spain’s midfield, if anything, deteriorated. Glum: Xavi (centre) could only watch on as his Spain side were utterly humiliated at the Maracana . They can't believe it! Spanish supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson . What has unarguably gone is Xavi’s ability to control the ebb and flow of an entire match with his elegant pass-move-pass-move. With decline, Spain’s confidence that they can dominate possession in an attacking, front-foot manner has gradually drained away. His play, his leadership has defined this era. I see team-mates no longer sure that they can shunt the ball to Xavi and something safe, intelligent and probably dangerous to the opponent will be done. For Spain to cope with the change in other teams’ attitude to them plus Xavi’s inevitable lessening of  influence has been too much. Thirdly, the lack of goals is a fatal flaw. Every team needs a pressure release and I’ll leave here bamboozled as to why del Bosque thought that he saw goals in Costa. The Brazilian got here fit — but out of form. That never changed in training or in the match. His role should have been that of impact sub. Missing: David Villa (right) failed to play against Holland or Chile despite being in better form than Costa . New blood: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke (right) will be a major part of the new-look Spain . David Villa, on the other hand, scored twice in the last friendly and regularly in training. But got no minutes in the first two games. Xabi Alonso pointed out that Spain made ‘too many errors’. He could have had his captain, Iker Casillas, in mind. This tournament asked him to stretch his resources just too far. By the end of the Champions League Final in Lisbon he was spent. But those who insist that this is the end for a philosophy of football are wrong. It is an undignified end for some all-time great players but, above all, Spain arrived here two weeks behind their opposition in terms of match sharpness. That will change. Pedro, Jordi Alba, Ramos, Gerard Pique, Koke, David de Gea, Sergio Busquets, David Silva and Andres Iniesta will stay. Thiago, Isco, Dani Carvajal, Jese, Alberto Moreno and Ander Herrera, all of whom have won European Under-21 titles, will join them. Renewal will take place and Spain winning Euro 2016 is a decent bet. Right now, that’s little consolation for a desolate World Cup. Faded grandeur.","Spain were eliminated from the World Cup after losing to Holland and Chile .

"Boris Johnson has admitted paying tradesmen in cash, after a government minister said it was 'morally wrong' to do so . David Gauke claimed that making small cash payments to cleaners and tradesmen was as bad as tax avoidance, which ministers have already called ‘morally repugnant’. The Exchequer Secretary spoke out as he gave a speech outlining plans to name and shame those who engage in aggressive tax avoidance schemes to avoid paying their fair share. Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has admitted paying cash-in-hand after Tory Minister David Gauke, right, claimed such behaviour was 'morally wrong' But asked today if he had ever paid in cash to keep costs down, London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'I've certainly paid a lot of cash in hand.' Under new rules, celebrities and millionaires who use tax avoidance schemes will see their details passed to HM Revenue and Customs. But Mr Gauke raised eyebrows by suggesting that pensioners and families who pay cash to a cleaner, plumber or gardener are just as bad. He said: ‘Getting a discount with your plumber by paying cash in hand is something that is a big cost to the Revenue and means others must pay more in tax.’ Asked explicitly if he disapproves of the practice, he said: ‘Yes, I think it’s morally wrong.’ He added: ‘It is illegal for the plumber but it is pretty implicit in these circumstances that there is a reason why there is a discount for cash. That is a large part of the hidden economy.’ The Treasury calculates that the tax gap in Britain - the difference between what is owed and what is collected - is about £35 billion each year. Hidden economy: A woman pays a workman, handing over cash (posed by models) Tax avoidance accounts for around £5 billion of the missing cash. A European Union study earlier this . year estimated the size of the black economy at £160 billion a year, . more than 10 per cent of the entire economy and larger than the size of . the deficit. David Gauke has branded those who avoid tax as ‘morally’ questionable – but he is open to charges of hypocrisy. In . 2006/7, Mr Gauke used his parliamentary expenses to ensure that . taxpayers bore the cost of his stamp duty payments when he moved house. He . claimed £10,248.32 in ‘mortgaged payments’ on his second home that . year. That broke down as ‘Inland Revenue Stamp Duty’ of £8,550. The rest was accumulated solicitors’ fees, land registry and property searches. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing and has not had to pay any of the money back. HMRC have . launched a series of tax campaigns over the past year, raising more than . £500m, by persuading people from different sectors of business to . encourage them to come forward and pay any tax they may not have . declared. These campaigns have included ones focusing on plumbers and electricians. A . campaign on trades more generally, including home repair, maintenance . and improvement, will follow at the end of this year or early next year. There . is no law against paying someone in cash or asking to be paid in cash . but traders can use cash payments to avoid declaring all their income or . by dodging VAT. But Treasury officials say customers should be ‘good citizens’ by not accepting cash work without a receipt. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the . Treasury Select Committee accused the Treasury of operating ‘double . standards’ by threatening ordinary people who pay for jobs in cash while . failing to get to grips with widespread corporate tax avoidance. ‘Everyone should be paying their fair share in taxes but this could end up being ridiculous. ‘It . would be ridiculous if a pensioner paying a fiver cash in hand to . someone to prune their roses was put through the tax system. ‘At . the same time there are huge numbers of rich people and major companies . who are not paying anything like the tax they should be doing. It’s . double standards.’ Mr Gauke published a consultation . document yesterday spelling out ways to crack down on cowboy accountants . who run rogue tax avoidance schemes. In future, they will have to give up their client lists and will remain liable even if they close the schemes or move companies. The . announcement came after comedian Jimmy Carr admitted to making a . “terrible error of judgment” when it emerged he used a complex scheme to . reduce his tax bill. The K2 tax-avoidance scheme Carr is said to have used enables members to pay income tax rates as low as 1 per cent. Retort: A Labour MP said it was 'ridiculous' to put small payments such as five pounds for cleaning and gardening through the tax system . Mr . Gauke said: ‘These schemes damage our ability to fund public services . and provide support to those who need it. They undermine the actions of . the vast majority of taxpayers, who pay more in tax as a consequence of . others enjoying a free ride. Union leaders said the Government would be better off closing the loopholes used by avoidance schemes. Brendan . Barber, TUC general secretary, said: ‘Successive governments have run . shy of reforms to ensure the very wealthiest pay their fair share of . tax. ‘But with countries around the world . under pressure to reduce deficits, fair tax is an economic necessity.’ The TaxPayers’ Alliance said ministers needed to concentrate on . reforming the complex tax system. Matthew Sinclair, director of the TPA, . said: ‘The Government is right to act to ensure that everyone pays . their fair share of tax, but new powers to uncover specific abuses are a . poor substitute for serious reform of the tax system so that there are . fewer loopholes. ‘Ministers . need to be more realistic about HMRC’s ability to clamp down when its . resources are so stretched simply administering our hideously . complicated taxes, let alone chasing those finding creative and legally . dubious ways around them. ‘With a better tax system, HMRC staff can focus their attention on tackling those who are abusing the system. Proper reforms can ensure that everyone pays no more, and no less, than their fair share.’","Tory minister David Gauke said he disapproves of the practice .

"As well as scoring Manchester City's crucial second goal against Stoke on Wednesday night, James Milner also managed to earn a new record. The energetic midfielder managed to cover more ground in a single game than any other player so far this season. According to EA Sports Player Performance Index data, Milner ran a hugely impressive 13.56km as his side put Stoke to the sword with a 4-1 Premier League victory at the Britannia. James Milner covered the most ground in a single game during Manchester City's 4-1 win against Stoke . Milner, who covered 13.56km on Wednesday night, heads City into the lead at the Britannia Stadium . James Milner – MAN CITY vs Stoke – 13.56km . George Boyd – BURNLEY vs Newcastle – 13.55km . Tom Carroll – SWANSEA vs Southampton – 13.47km . George Boyd – BURNLEY vs Stoke – 13.34km . George Boyd – BURNLEY vs Man Utd – 13.30km . George Boyd – BURNLEY vs Aston Villa – 13.24km . Gylfi Sigurdsson – SWANSEA vs Man Utd – 13.18km . Christian Eriksen – TOTTENHAM vs Swansea – 13.17km . Harry Kane – TOTTENHAM vs Swansea – 13.12km . Marouane Fellaini – MAN UTD vs Southampton – 13.12km . The 29-year-old proved that hard work pays off with his 55th minute header, adding to his impressive tally of four goals in his past six games. After a lung-busting performance on Wednesday night, Milner may now sit on top of distance stats tree, but a certain Burnley midfielder has managed to feature on four separate occasions in our top 10 list. Scotland international George Boyd dominates the top five thanks to marathon performances against Aston Villa (13.24km), Manchester United (13.30km), Stoke (13.34km) and Newcastle where the 29-year-old covered a massive 13.55km during Burnley's 3-3 draw at St James' Park.

Boyd dominates the top five thanks to marathon performances against Aston Villa (13.24km), Manchester United (13.30km), Stoke (13.34km) and Newcastle . Harry Kane scored Tottenham first goal and managed to cover 13.12km during Tottenham 2-1 win against Swansea in December . The Premier League clash also saw Boyd grab his second goal in as many games to help the visitors grab a last gasp point. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been hitting the headlines for his goal scoring exploits of late, but the 20-year-old striker is also managing to put in a huge shift for Mauricio Pochettino's side. Kane's biggest distance so far this season came in the away victory against Swansea in December and the striker goes some way in proving goals can give a player an extra stride after heading Spurs into the lead inside the first five minutes. In the same game, Christian Eriksen managed a distance of 13.17km as Garry Monk's Swansea side suffered a 2-1 defeat. Another big name to feature inside the top 10 include Marouane Fellaini for his impressive 13.12km covered during United's match against Southampton in December, 2014.

"An American Ebola survivor has donated blood to photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo as he fights for his life against the deadly virus. Dr Kent Brantly was on a road trip from Indiana to Texas when he was called by the Nebraska Medical Center asking him to donate plasma to help boost Mr Mukpo's immune system after their blood types were found to be a match. The doctor, who beat Ebola after being flown back from Liberia to the U.S. in July,  raced to the nearest clinic in Kansas City, Missouri to donate. His blood is due to arrive in Omaha later on Wednesday to be used on Mr Mukpo. Scroll down for video . Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly (pictured left) donated blood to photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo (right) who is fighting the deadly virus at the Nebraska Medical Center . Mr Mukpo is stretchered from the plane on Monday after arriving from Liberia  to be treated for Ebola at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . Dr Kent Brantly was flown back from Liberia to the U.S. in July after contracting Ebola during his missionary work for Samaritan's Purse. He survived after receiving a dose of the experimental serum Z-Mapp and round-the-clock care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. As Mr Mukpo's condition worsened at Nebraska Medical Center, doctors decided to try a previous technique of a giving the patient a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor. Those who have survived Ebola have antibodies in their blood which can help new sufferers beat the disease. Dr Brantly had earlier donated blood to a fellow doctor, Dr Rick Sacra, who also contracted Ebola during his work in West Africa and survived the disease. Mr Mukpo's father, Dr Mitchell Levy, told NBC that the family were deeply touched by Dr Brantly's selfless actions. Dr Levy told the network: 'This act of kindness and generosity makes me believe in the goodness of humanity.' Mr Mukpo's girlfriend, Helen Finlay, said on Tuesday that it was heart-wrenching to watch her boyfriend on four years battle the deadly virus and be unable to get close to him . Parents of Ashoka Mukpo, Lady Diana Mukpo and Dr Mitchell Levy, said on Monday that they were relieved to have their son back in the U.S. to be treated for Ebola . The girlfriend of Mr Mukpo described on Wednesday the torment of watching him battle the deadly virus - but be unable to get close to comfort him. British-born Helen Finlay described the experience as 'heart-wrenching', adding: 'I mean when you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them you're going to be okay and be close to them and obviously you can't do that. It is a little bit hard.' Mr Mukpo, who was working as a freelance cameraman for NBC when he contracted the disease, is receiving the experimental drug Brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the virus. His symptoms have deteriorated since he arrived in the U.S. but he is still in the early stages of the disease, doctors said on Wednesday. The drug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus. It has never before been used on Ebola patients. Dallas Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, a Liberian national, passed away from the disease on Wednesday morning. Mr Duncan, the first ever Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S., had also been receiving Brincidofovir. Thomas Duncan passed away on Wednesday morning after contracting Ebola last month.

"Bacteria from a family that includes potentially deadly infectious bugs may protect against food allergies, research has shown. Clostridia encompasses around 100 bacterial species, some of which live harmlessly in the gut. Others are responsible for gangrene, tetanus, botulism food poisoning and hospital infections caused by Clostridium difficile. Gut bacteria hold the key to beating food allergies, researchers say . Environmental effects on gut flora - including over-use of antibiotics, high fat diets, excessive hygiene and even infant formula feeding - may be contributing to food allergies by suppressing Clostridia, the researchers believe. Tests indicated that Clostridia caused immune cells to produce high levels of a signalling molecule known to decrease permeability of the intestinal lining. This in turn reduced the chances of allergens - molecules that trigger an allergic reaction - leaking into the bloodstream. The team is now working on turning the discovery into a probiotic food allergy treatment, and has filed a provisional patent. The new study suggests that 'friendly' Clostridia have a unique ability to block the harmful immune response behind food allergies. Tests on 'sterile' mice sensitised to peanuts showed that introducing a Clostridia cocktail into their bacteria-free guts reversed their allergy. Re-introduction of another major group of gut bacteria, Bacteroides, did not have the same effect. Tests indicated that Clostridia caused immune cells to produce high levels of a signalling molecule known to decrease permeability of the intestinal lining. This in turn reduced the chances of allergens - molecules that trigger an allergic reaction - leaking into the bloodstream. US lead scientist Professor Cathryn Nagler, from the University of Chicago, said: 'We've identified a bacterial population that protects against food allergen sensitisation. 'The first step in getting sensitised to a food allergen is for it to get into your blood and be presented to your immune system. T . 'he presence of these bacteria regulates that process.' Environmental effects on gut flora - including over-use of antibiotics, high fat diets, excessive hygiene and even infant formula feeding - may be contributing to food allergies by suppressing Clostridia, the researchers believe. Their findings appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mice used in the study were either raised from birth in sterile conditions or treated with antibiotics as newborns to wipe out most of their gut bacteria. Both groups were sensitised by exposing them to peanut allergens, triggering a strong immune response. They produced significantly higher levels of peanut-targeting antibodies than mice with normal populations of gut bacteria. When Clostridia was present, immune cells generated high levels of the protective signalling molecule, interleukin 22 (IL-22). But when IL-22 was neutralised, levels of allergen in the animals' bloodstreams significantly increased. The team has already been able to reverse peanut allergies in mice . The team is now working on turning the discovery into a probiotic food allergy treatment, and has filed a provisional patent. 'It's exciting because we know what the bacteria are; we have a way to intervene,' said Prof Nagler. 'There are of course no guarantees, but this is absolutely testable as a therapeutic against a disease for which there's nothing. 'As a mom, I can imagine how frightening it must be to worry every time your child takes a bite of food.' Between 6% and 8% of children in the UK are believed to have a diagnosed food allergy. Since 1990, the number of annual UK hospital admissions due to food allergy reactions has soared by 500%. Severe food allergy can cause anaphylaxis, an extreme immune reaction that may prove fatal. Common triggers for anaphylaxis include peanuts, tree nuts such as almonds, walnuts and cashews, sesame, fish, shellfish, dairy products and eggs.","'Friendly' Clostridia have a unique ability to block the harmful immune response behind food allergies .

"A family’s missing pet dog has been found 10 years after he disappeared - and in the nick of time, as he was a day from being put down. The Staffordshire Bull terrier called Chance belonged to then 11-year-old schoolboy Sion Cox who was heartbroken when his pet vanished. He and his mum Julie Coombes put posters on lamp posts hoping to find the loveable black and white terrier. After disappearing for so long, Chance is now reunited with Sion and lives with him at his student flat in Cardiff . How Chance had spent the last 10 years since vanishing from Julie and Sion¿s garden in Barry, South Wales will always be a mystery . But as time passed they gave up hope of ever seeing three-year-old Chance again and bought another dog for Sion to play with. But a decade later Chance was found weak and hungry in a city centre underpass and taken to a dog’s home. Because of his age and his condition he was going to be put down, but luckily a vet scanned him for a microchip and Julie’s name and address came up. Julie, 44, from Barry, South Wales, said: 'It was like something from a children’s Disney movie. 'I had a phone call to say my dog had been found - I thought they’d made a mistake because we have two dogs and they were both in the house. 'Then they said it was a black and white Staffordshire - my heart leapt, I knew it was Chance. Because of his age and his condition Chance was going to be put down - but a vet discovered his microchip . Julie said it was very emotional seeing him again after 10 years is certain he recognised his long-lost owners . 'We went to the dog’s home and recognised Chance straight away. 'And as soon as we said his name his ears pricked up as if he’d never forgotten us.' How Chance had spent the last 10 years since vanishing from Julie and Sion’s garden in Barry, South Wales, in May 2004 will always be a mystery. Julie said: 'We bought him for Sion when Chance was seven weeks old. We had him neutered, microchipped, the full works. 'Three years later Sion when to school and I let him out in the garden, I went back out to let him in and he wasn’t there. 'We knocked on doors, looked everywhere and advertised it on the internet and in local papers. 'We did hundreds of leaflets and we never heard a thing.' The dog was found 20 miles away from home . Chance was found in a shopping centre underpass 20 miles away in Newport and taken to the city’s Coronation Kennels. Julie said: 'It was very emotional seeing him again after 10 years - but I am certain he recognised us. 'The dog’s home told us he was in a bit of a sorry state and to prepare for the worst. 'He was due to be put down so it was a case of: 'Quick! Get him out of there!' 'There was no way we could let that happen so we took him back to where he belongs.' Sion, now a 21-year-old criminology student at the University of Glamorgan in Cardiff, said: 'It’s crazy - I never thought he would come back, at all. 'His back legs have gone, he’s got a few things wrong with him, he’s just been really neglected. 'But he’s eating well and he loves going out for a walk.' Chance has now moved in with Sion at his student flat in Cardiff. He said: 'Every time I leave he cries, I can’t leave him on his own. He’s more than happy here though, he’s pretty chilled out. 'I just want to keep him going as long as possible now. If that’s six months, ten months or two years I want to give him the best life possible.' A spokeswoman for the Coronation Kennels in Newport said: 'It’s always nice to reunite a lost dog with its owner. 'Usually they’ve been apart for a few days or maybe a week or two - 10 years is incredible.'","Chance the Staffordshire Bull Terrier disappeared from owner's back garden .

"A new injection has been invented, which its makers claim dissolves fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate. The new treatment, dubbed Aqualyx, claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction - and Sharon Donaldson, 39, from Liverpool, was one of the first women to try it. Sharon paid £1000 to have fat zapping treatment on her face and midriff, before getting married to Peter, 32, last year. Aqualyx, claims to be an effective . alternative to liposuction and Sharon Donaldson, 39, from Liverpool, . was one of the first women to try it - here she is pictured after the treatment, left, and before, right . During the treatment, a water solution was injected into . stubborn areas - in Sharon's case her tummy and chin. The . jab then it works by breaking down the fat. The injection contains plant polymers, which . bind with the cell walls of the fat tissue before rupturing and . releasing the fat to be dissolved. The formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated when you urinate over a three-week period. Sharon, a . receptionist, paid £900 for a series of three injections, each a month . apart, at the Dr James Kimilu clinic in Liverpool City Centre. Sharon Donaldson, pictured left after the treatment and right before, paid £1000 to have fat zapping treatment on her face and midriff . which broke down the fat cells which she then passed out in the loo .

She . had already lost two stone, taking her from 10st 2lbs to 8st 5lbs, and . dropped from a size 14 to a size 10 before her wedding to hubby Peter . but wanted to look her best in her dress. She said: 'I know people might think it was a quick fix but I really wanted to look good and I'd tried dieting and exercising and it wasn't giving me the results I needed. Sharon also had injections under her jaw to get rid of her double chin . 'Liposuction seemed too drastic and while the injections are a form of surgery, it seems much less invasive. After each session I was a bit sore and bruised but that soon passed and I haven't any scars. I've finally got the body I've always wanted.' Sharon shows off the results off the double chin fat jab . During the procedure, the fatty area, which in Sharon's case was the lower abdomen and chin, is marked with a pen and a canula - a needle with a tube in - is placed under the skin and the Aqualyx solution is injected. It takes around ten minutes for each area and the patient is left with swelling and soreness for a few days, but should see results after a week or so. Dr Kimilu, who carried out the treatment . on Sharon, explained: 'Aqualyx is a fat removal therapy used as an . alternative to liposuction. It is not intended for weight loss, but to . improve the contour of the body. 'It is used to reduce stubborn fat . deposits in areas such as the chin, stomach, saddle bags, outer and . inner thighs, back fat and thoracic folds and injected directly into the . subcutaneous fat tissue using very thin, sharp cannulas. 'The . treated fat cells are gradually dissolved and the metabolism in the . area is increased. It’s ideal for those patients with stubborn fat that . will not respond to diet and exercise.' Sharon said: 'Having a slim, toned . stomach has given me so much more confidence and I had spent years . working in the gym and trying every diet you can think of to achieve . what I have now.' But experts have warned that, if the jab works as its makers claim, then users risk increased cholesterol and blood sugar levels and run the risk of becoming diabetic. Dr . Arun Ghosh from Spire Hospital Liverpool said: 'I’ve seen a lot of . treatments that claim to reduce fat by breaking it down into an acid so . the body reabsorbs it then passes it out and it just doesn’t happen. Dr Kimilu, pictured right, who carried out the treatment . on Sharon, explained: 'Aqualyx is a fat removal therapy used as an . alternative to liposuction. It is not intended for weight loss, but to . improve the contour of the body . 'It’s so dangerous to reabsorb fatty acids into your blood stream as if it’s dissolved down into salt it would send your cholesterol levels sky high. 'If it’s broken down into sugars then you are sending your glucose levels sky high that can lead to diabetes. “I can’t see any independent evidence that backs up the claims of Aqualyx which makes me very skeptical of this. 'The only real way to get rid of stubborn areas of fat is to dissolve it and suck it out with liposuction.' Julia Buckley, nutrition and fitness expert and author of The Fat Burn Revolution, said she would urge people to use diet and exercise instead. She said: 'I'm very skeptical about the claims the manufacturer is making. But even if it does destroy fat cells, if people do not change their lifestyles, I expect that the body would produce new fat cells to replace them.' Aqualyx, like lipo, is not recommended for weight loss goals but rather to contour the body . 'Also, if it only destroys fat cells . in particular areas then excess calories will continue to be stored in . fat cells elsewhere on the body and I'd be worried about the health . implications of this - as well as whether people could end up with . strange-looking body shapes. 'It's . always going to be so much better to shed fat and get into shape . naturally with a good nutrition and exercise programme. That way you'll . get healthier, fitter and stronger, as well as leaner.' Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 . Harley Street, said: 'I don’t use fat removal injectables in my clinic . and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and . trials published. 'It’s . always important that prospective patients thoroughly research . treatments before they book, and these injectables are very new to the . market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced . by the manufacturer. 'While . the cost is certainly affordable and attractive, those thinking of . having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have . proven results and existing patient testimonials. 'Also, prospective patients must undergo a full consultation to determine the right procedure for their concern.'

"Nasa's Curiosity Rover is seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. Engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one-ton vehicle's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days. The images were taken by one of Curiosity's navigation cameras. Curiosity, a six-wheeled . vehicle the size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact . crater near Mars' equator on August 6 after an eight-month, . 354-million-mile voyage through space. Scroll down for video . Handling's out of this world: Nasa's Curiosity Rovers tests its steering during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars . Nasa's Curiosity rover has unfurled its robotic arm for the first time as scientists continue to tests its systems. The numbers around the edge are degrees of the compass and degrees below or above horizontal. The seven foot long robot arm contain a plethora of instruments, including: . A camera to capture images for analysis . A drill to get under the martian surface . A spectrometer to analyse samples . A scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered martian rock and soil . Earlier the Martian motor was shown . flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time. The 7-foot-long . (2.1-meter-long) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera, a . drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning . samples of powdered rock and soil. The view (above)is a mosaic of low-resolution thumbnail images returned to Earth a few hours after the activity on Mars, with higher resolution versions set to follow. Curiosity landed on Mars two weeks ago to begin a two-year mission using . 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside . Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for . microbial life. The Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and scientists declared their target practice a success. The robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles. Each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one-billionths of a second, vapourising a pinhead-sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark, which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument. The ionized glow, which can be . observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away, is then split into its . component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists . information about the chemical makeup of the target rock. Curiosity has begun its science mission on Mars by 'zapping' a rock with its laser analysis equipment . The combined system, called the Chemistry-and-Camera instrument, or ChemCam, is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout Curiosity's Mars mission. The purpose of Sunday's initial use of the laser, conducted at roughly 3 a.m. Pacific time (7.00 a.m. EDT), was as 'target practice' for the instrument. But scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock, which they dubbed 'Coronation,' NASA said. 'We got a great spectrum of Coronation - lots of signal,' said ChemCam principal investigator Roger Wiens of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument was developed. 'After eight years of building the instrument, it's payoff time.' Curiosity's two-year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like Earth could have hosted microbial life. The first laser test by the Chemistry and Camera, or ChemCam, instrument aboard NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test . The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of Gale Crater. But mission controllers are gradually checking out Curiosity's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the Martian landscape. The $2.5 billion Curiosity project marks NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes to Mars during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world. The technique employed by ChemCam has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments, such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor. Curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) mountain, called Mount Sharp . The technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection. But Sunday's exercise, conducted during Curiosity's 13th full day on Mars, was the first use in interplanetary exploration, NASA said. Before Curiosity embarks on its 4.3-mile (7-km) trek to the foot of Mount Sharp, a journey that could take six months, mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site.

"A new flagship 'free school' is planning to replace teachers with computers for some day-to-day lessons, it was claimed today. One of England’s biggest academy chains - Ark Schools - wants to set up a new 'blended learning' model – which will see children taught over the internet for large chunks of the day. The new 'e-school' will be known as the Ark Pioneer Academy and is due to open in London from September 2016 as part of the government’s free schools scheme, according to the teaching journal the Times Education Supplement. Under a new 'blended learning' model pioneered in the US children could be taught by computers for around a quarter of the school day . Charter schools in the US - which were an inspiration for the Education Secretary Michael Gove's free schools programme - have already tried and tested similar radical schemes with some success. One called Rocketship pioneered the model and now operates nine schools in Milwaukee and San Jose, teaching 5,000 pupils who spend a quarter of their school day online. Rocketship chief executive Preston Smith said that computers had allowed his organisation to 'really rethink the school day'. 'We have fewer teachers than a traditional school serving the same number of students.' By slashing the number of staff, the school can plough the savings into the remaining teachers' salaries - therefore better teachers. Education Secretary Michael Gove has introduced 'free schools' which give headteachers wide-ranging powers to change the way children are taught . Mr Smith said this allowed him to pay teachers up to 50 per cent more than nearby schools. He added that he wanted teachers earning more than $100,000 'as quickly as possible' Mr Smith said: 'If your kids are performing incredibly well, and you have eliminated the achievement gap in your classroom, and your kids are on a par with the most affluent kids in the country, we should be paying you incredibly well because you are doing amazing work. 'We want to help you realise six figures, if not more, as quickly as possible.' But Christine Blower, of the teaching union the NUT, said: 'The use of the word ""efficiencies"" is all very nice but what it really means is cuts. 'If we have got circumstances where we have got children ostensibly being taught, but actually sitting in front of computers for a significant amount of time and not having routine access to a teacher for every lesson, then that would be a completely wrong departure. 'We would be concerned about the loss of teaching jobs and about the loss of proper good quality education for all children and young people.' Ark has said it hopes that by using computers it will 'increase the reach of great teachers'. Documents given to the Times Education Supplement reveal how Ark believes the new model will allow teachers' roles to be 'revised'. Other schools using the system have introduced new roles that include 'master teachers' responsible for 'leading full-class or small group instruction' while the computers take on more of the routine tasks. Teachers in the new computer schools could also be responsible for 'leading small group instruction' or the 'supervision of online learning'. An ARK spokesman today said: 'Our plans are at a very early stage, but it is worth reflecting that our blended learning pilot at King Solomon Academy did not mean fewer teachers or bigger classes, but ensuring that pupils have access to the latest in educational technology and techniques. 'The school is rated outstanding by Ofsted and results have been improving every year, above national averages. High quality teaching is at the core of the ARK approach, and helps our schools to achieve excellent standards.'","New free school wants children to spend longer being taught over internet .

"'Pernicious effect': MP Maria Miller says youngsters will grow up with a warped idea of relationships thanks to porn . An impassioned attack on the ‘pernicious effect’ of online porn was delivered by the Culture Secretary yesterday. Maria Miller warned that young boys who see explicit images risk growing up with a warped idea of how to treat girls. She demanded that teachers, parents and internet giants do more to prevent children from accidentally viewing such images. And she denounced the culture that has led to an explosion of X-rated net pictures, saying: ‘Too often in the past we have been happy to say “anything goes”. Well – it doesn’t.’ The Culture Secretary’s intervention came as the Prime Minister’s adviser on the sexualisation of children, Claire Perry, said it was never too early to start educating youngsters about the online dangers. ‘People say primary school is too young. No: Babies can swipe iPads. You can’t, in some ways, start young enough,’ Mrs Perry told a fringe meeting at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester. And Mrs Miller, a mother of three, stressed that ‘responsible parents’ needed to speak to children earlier about the effect internet porn had on their understanding of relationships. Charities say children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet porn, giving them ‘unrealistic expectations’ of sex. They also say it is encouraging boys to grow up viewing girls merely as sex objects. Counsellors at ChildLine also report a surge in calls from youngsters traumatised after seeing adult images online. Teaching unions have called for pupils to be taught about porn from the age of ten so they can protect themselves from stumbling across adult images. Mrs Miller did not suggest an age, but said governors should think about whether it should be tackled in their schools. Danger: A third of people who sent 'sexts' said they went to people they had met only online, while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers (posed by model) She said: ‘There is guidance available to schools in terms of the way they can help young people navigate their responsibilities in this area. I am fearful of the result if we don’t take action particularly in terms of young boys’ attitudes to girls, their relationships, what’s seen as a normal relationship between two young people.’ It is the first time the Culture Secretary, who is in charge of internet policy, has spoken out over school lessons on porn. While groups such as the NSPCC are in favour of such a move, some believe it could have the opposite effect of introducing children to adult material for the first time. But Mrs Miller said many schools would naturally want to ‘ensure the children in their care understand the importance of not accessing material like that when they are underage, and also the pernicious effect of pornography in their lives long-term’. She also said imposing filters on internet porn would not be enough – children had to be taught to use the web responsibly. A spokesman for the NSPCC said: 'Online videos, some of them violent and degrading, are now just a few clicks away for many young people'. File picture . Special adviser Mrs Perry, Tory MP for Devizes, called on Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in new statutory guidance for secondary schools about how teach children about online porn. ‘Teenage boys send teenage girls naked selfies [self-taken photos] and teenage girls send them,’ she said. ‘There are so many things wrong with that, and part of the problem is that children don’t understand that giving away digital identities is something that can stay with you for ever.’ The Daily Mail has been campaigning for an automatic block on online porn, with over-18s able to access adult material only following a strict age verification check. In the summer David Cameron announced a compromise ‘default on’ solution, under which all families will be asked whether a filter should be applied. Last night a spokesman for the NSPCC said: ‘It’s absolutely essential that young people are educated about the dangers of pornography. Online videos, some of them violent and degrading, are now just a few clicks away for many young people. ‘And children as young as 11 or 12 tell us that they are using porn to learn about sex. We must speak to young people about what healthy, meaningful and respectful relationships are before their views are warped by the prism of online porn.’","Maria Miller said parents must talk to children about dangers of online porn .

"Nasa has revealed the incredible moments in a specially set up 'war room' inside its HQ as its Curiosity rover landed on the red planet. The unprecedented insight reveals the drama the 34 scientists allowed into the inner sanctum, which was separate from mission control, went through during Curiosity's descent to the surface of the red planet. It even reveals the carefully chosen words that signified a perfect landing - tango delta nominal. Curiosity's Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) 'war room' and its staff. On the night of Aug. 5, 2012 PDT (early morning Aug. 6 EDT), 34 engineers gathered in this room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, to support the landing . Twenty-five of Nasa's engineers are pictured above. From the left, back row, they are: Luis Dominguez, Armen Toorian, Allen Kummer, Dan Scharf, Jaime Catchen, Chuck Baker, Nadin Cox, Matt, Lenda, Steve Lee, Genevie Yang and Richard Kornfeld at the end. Starting from the top of the table and moving left are: Paul Brugarolas, Lynn McGrew, Aaron Stehura, Steve Sell, Devin Kipp, Jeremy Shidner, Corey Harmon and David Way. In the closest row, from the left, are: Matt Rozek, Ravi Prakash, Dick Powell, Jody Davis, Gavin Mendeck and Jordi Casoliva. The image above shows the team at work. ""If we said 'touchdown,' then people not intimately familiar with EDL . might infer that Curiosity was good to go,"" said  Steve Sell, a 42-year-old engineer from Gettysburg, said on Nasa's web site. He admits the touchdown was the first of three key message the team hoped to hear. 'Two more . major calls had to be made before I could begin to breathe again.' The key moment for the team occured at 10:32 p.m local time. Diaries from the crew reveal there had been a debate amongst Curiosity's entry, descent and landing team about what their first words to indicate that the rover had reached the surface should be. The team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory knew their microphones would be 'hot' and that NASA TV was beaming the landing event out live to anybody with the desire and wherewithal to watch. They also knew that landing safely on Mars meant more than simply landing on Mars - which any one of the 34 engineers present at JPL's Building 264 Room 230, also known as the 'EDL War Room,' will tell you at great length is not simple at all. Their rocket-propelled backpack and rover-lowering Sky Crane system were getting their first test 154 million miles (248 million kilometers) away from home. At 10:31:45 p.m. PDT, Jody Davis saw the event record, or EVR, she was looking for appear on her computer screen in the EDL War Room. She told Nasa's site she knew that the 'Touchdown' message would only be beamed down if the rover's descent stage had throttled down, a result which could only occur if the descent stage had offloaded half its weight. The only way the rover could offload half its weight in an instant is if it were being held up from below. Davis, a member of the EDL team and an engineer from NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia, gave the much reviewed, pre-scripted call - 'Tango Delta nominal.' Tango and Delta are phonetic identifiers for T and D, which the team used to represent touchdown. The next call the EDL team was looking for was 'RIMU Stable.' 'RIMU stands for Rover Inertial Measurement Unit,' said Sell. 'The RIMU gives us the rover's orientation as well as any movement it is making. 'If we landed on a crumbling crater wall or an unstable sand dune, or were being dragged by a still-connected descent stage across the surface, then the RIMU would show that in its data set.' Researchers in Nasa's main mission control celebrating the landing. However, Nasa has now revealed its key researchers were in a special 'war room' for the landing . The War Room's David Way, an engineer from JPL, was monitoring that unit's performance. Eight long seconds after Jody's call, he found the EVR he was looking for. 'RIMU Stable,"" said Way. The final confirmation actually came from a different building, Nasa said. There, in the Mission Support Area of JPL's Building 230, Adam Steltzner, the mission's EDL phase lead, was staring across the room at Brian Schwartz, who was not making eye contact with anyone. Schwartz, the EDL communications engineer, was staring at his screen. Final destination: Curisity recently sent back this high resolution picture of its landing site and its destination, called Mount Sharp, in the distance. His task was not to check for a good-news EVR from the rover. Instead, he was waiting to see if the UHF signal became intermittent, faded away or just cut out altogether - all potential indications that the rover and descent stage had not gone their separate ways. Eight seconds after the RIMU call - Schwartz looked up. 'UHF strong,' said Schwartz. With that, Steltzner had all the data he needed. Seated directly in front of the pacing EDL Phase Lead, Allen Chen felt a jab in the shoulder. Chen, the mission's (capsule communicator), knew it could only mean one thing. 'Touchdown confirmed,' said Chen.","Mission Scientists speak of their feelings during the landing .
