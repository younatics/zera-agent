"Lancashire must thrash Middlesex in the final round of County Championship matches if they are to avoid a second relegation in three years and an unwanted piece of Roses history. Never before have Yorkshire won the title and Lancashire been demoted in the same season, but that scenario awaits the Red Rose unless they can get a result at Old Trafford to send Middlesex down instead. Lancashire, without Jimmy Anderson and overseas player Usman Khawaja, must win by 19 points, leaving Middlesex favourites to avoid the drop. Lancashire will not have Jimmy Anderson and must beat Middlesex to avoid a second relegation in three years . Lancashire, without overseas player Usman Khawaja, must win by 19 points to avoid another relegation . Middlesex looked in big trouble against Somerset last week, but Chris Rogers made a double century to earn a draw. Lancashire’s batting has let them down this year but they will probably need 400 against Middlesex to claim maximum batting bonus points and give themselves a chance. Lancashire’s Simon Kerrigan admitted he felt defeat by Sussex this month condemned his side to relegation. ‘We felt pretty down after the Sussex defeat but we’ve been given this bonus opportunity. If we have a good game you never know,’ he said. Lancashire’s Simon Kerrigan admitted he felt defeat by Sussex this month condemned his side to relegation .

"The two most important men in Lewis Hamilton’s life left Singapore, one with a permanent smile, the other with a frown and a suitcase full of trouble. The first was Anthony Hamilton, Lewis’s father and backbone through his karting life. The second was Paddy Lowe, the Mercedes boffin trying to stop millions of pounds’ worth of technology from breaking. Whether a car that can last a race or a mind in top working order is more crucial to Hamilton is unclear. Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates with his team including Nico Rosberg of Germany, his father Anthony Hamilton and his step-mother Linda Hamilton . Anthony Hamilton wishes luck to his son Lewis ahead of last weekend's Singapore Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton celebrates after taking the lead in the drivers' championship with victory in Singapore . Hamilton's Mercedes leads the field en route to an important victory that changes the balance in the title race . Either way, Hamilton Snr’s presence at the last two Grands Prix has coincided with his son winning both. Tellingly, Lewis has never won a championship without his father as his other, equally significant half. Hamilton moved in 2010 from his father’s management to XIX Entertainment. But his dad remains a part of Lewis’s racing soul. The nature of their relationship has changed, however. ‘Now it’s that time I told you about years ago after my dad was manager — I said I can’t wait for the day when he’s here just as my dad,’ said Hamilton. ‘And that’s what you’re seeing. That’s one of the greatest feelings, having him here.’ Hamilton sprays second placed Sebastian Vettel after securing victory at the Marina Bay Circuit . Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg could only watch after being forced to retire from the race . Yes, Hamilton’s father could rub Lewis up the wrong way but he provided competitive traction, the absence of which is arguably a major factor in Lewis’s fluctuating form and mood in the years since they parted full-time company. After beating Nico Rosberg, who gave up his 22-point championship lead, Hamilton welcomed the idea of other family members joining him for the final five races. Mother Carmen and girlfriend Nicole could join Anthony and stepmother Linda in the travelling support. He added: ‘I have quite a big family. I’ve got my mum and my step-dad. And then I’ve got my missus, who’s wanted to come all year. All my family are a real positive beam of light for me at the weekend. You know the difficulties I’ve had: my family being there the whole way and then a period when they’re not there.’ In Singapore it was Rosberg who suffered the technical bug. Which of the pair has more luck between now and the end of the season could well decide the title.

"Lewis Hamilton’s victory was his seventh of the season, three more than Nico Rosberg and two more than the Briton secured during his championship year of 2008. He has now led 63 grands prix during his 143-race career, surpassing David Coulthard’s British record. Michael Schumacher’s all-time record is 142. Lewis Hamilton poses on the podium with his trophy and champagne after winning the Singapore Grand Prix . Singapore is one of the toughest tests on the calendar given the searing heat, humidity and the race’s length — yesterday’s reached the two-hour limit before the scheduled number of laps was completed — and it appeared to take its toll on the rookies. Daniil Kyvat, 19, asked to park his Toro Rosso after his drinks bottle failed before the race started, while McLaren’s Kevin Magnussen, 21, required medical attention for burns following an unexplained build-up of heat in his cockpit. He, too, was unable to take on liquids during the race and was seen with his arm raised in a bid to direct cool air down his back. ‘It was the hardest point I’ve ever earned,’ the Dane said after finishing 10th. Kevin Magnussen suffered burns on his back after his cockpit overheated at the Singapore Grand Prix . In the wake of Rosberg’s arm-waving retirement (right) on lap 13, and the conspiracy theories which followed the Italian Grand Prix, Lotus rather mischievously tweeted: ‘@nico_rosberg now wondering if anyone will notice if he joins the @MercedesAMGF1 crew for the next @LewisHamilton pit stop…’ Unsurprisingly, the Hamilton fans, adamant Mercedes have been conspiring against their man all season, were rather quiet on the social-media front yesterday. Nico Rosberg signals to the Mercedes crew as he retires from the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday . With Hamilton now leading the table, it’s worth recalling his four wins on the spin in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain. On the 21 occasions a driver has won four straight races, they’ve gone on to take the title. Rosberg’s day got off to a bad start when the car chosen to show him off to the crowd — a 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300SL — stalled with him on the back. Rosberg can't hide his frustration as he has to watch on from pit lane as Hamilton takes the title lead . The Singapore Grand Prix kept its unique record of seeing a safety car deployed at every race since its inception in 2008 after Sergio Perez’s front wing shattered across the track.

"Moeen Ali, booed in two recent England internationals in his home city of Birmingham, has been voted the professional sportsman of the year in the city's sports awards in recognition of his performances for his club and country in 2014. Moeen could perhaps have been forgiven for doubting his popularity when he was heckled during 50-over and 20-over matches for England against India at Edgbaston this month. The hostile reception at Edgbaston, especially loud and persistent during England's NatWest Twenty20 victory over the tourists, came from a partisan majority of India supporters in the crowd. Moeen Ali has had a superb summer with England and Worcestershire and has been rewarded in Birmingham . The 27-year-old Birmingham-born all-rounder acknowledged himself that the boos were probably because of his Pakistani heritage, playing against a team followed by British Asians of Indian descent. His father Munir made the reaction of the Ali family clear, describing the booing of his son as 'disgraceful'. Moeen is nonetheless ending his summer on a high, winning the sportsman of the year award ahead of basketball player Michael Gayle and athlete Danny Talbot - and as part of the Worcestershire team promoted to Division One of the LV County Championship. Ali's 'part-time' spin improved dramatically over the season and he took 22 test wickets playing for England . He also made his Test debut this season, and went on to play in all seven matches against Sri Lanka and India. Moeen scored a maiden century against Sri Lanka at Headingley and took 19 wickets with his fast-improving off-spin in the five-match series win over India.

"Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last night claimed that Lewis Hamilton’s victory in the Singapore Grand Prix was payback from a ‘racing god’ for his race-ending accident in Spa last month. It was there that Hamilton retired after a collision that the team blamed on Nico Rosberg, who went on to win the race. Although Mercedes have already fined Rosberg and made him apologise for the crash, the loose-tongued Wolff returned to the topic after an electrical failure ended the German’s race yesterday and allowed Hamilton to leapfrog him into a three-point lead in the drivers’ championship.

Hamilton (left) and Mercedes team-mate Rosberg collided on lap two of the Belgian Grand Prix last month . Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) has a tough task keeping Hamilton and Rosberg both happy at the team . ‘Lewis caught up a lot of points, ones he lost in Spa,’ said Wolff. ‘If there is a racing god maybe he was there today.’ Of more concern to Mercedes than spiritual matters are the nuts and bolts of providing a dependable car. They have suffered five retirements this season and further problems in qualifying and practice. Wolff admitted: ‘We have a missile of a car but are having reliability issues. Today Nico’s steering column broke. I said: “Sorry for letting you down”. At moments like that there is really nothing you can say.’ Nico Rosberg signals to the Mercedes crew as he retires from the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday . Rosberg was still stony-faced as he was commiserated by Niki Lauda, Mercedes’ non-executive chairman, more than an hour after his race ended. Asked if reliability would be a factor in deciding the title, Rosberg said: ‘Of course, but I’m still very optimistic. It is clear reliability is the point we need to focus on the most. ‘At the moment I’m just disappointed with today, and I want to dig in with the team to try to understand what went wrong. The team are working crazy hours. They just need to review their approach and try to improve in that area. It’s not a demand. Everyone in the team wants the same thing.’ Rosberg is less than impressed with the reliability of his Mercedes car as he was forced to retire in Singapore .","Lewis Hamilton won the Singapore Grand Prix to lead the championship .

"Marussia sporting director Graeme Lowdon is adamant the team has the funds to see out the season and are doing all they can to ensure they will be on the grid in 2015. Speculation emerged over the course of the Singapore Grand Prix that due to financial difficulties the Banbury-based marque almost failed to make it onto the grid at the previous race in Italy. That is a rumour Lowdon vehemently denies, and whilst conceding times are hard, they are nowhere near as black a picture as being painted by some. Speaking to Press Association Sport, Lowdon said: 'We have an obligation to trade correctly, and if you don't reasonably believe you can do that, you have to stop. As simple as that. 'Is it plain sailing, navigating a company through an industry that has the cost structure of Formula One? No. Marussia sporting director Graeme Lowdon says his team is going nowhere amid rumours of financial strife . 'But if we didn't think we could be here, then we wouldn't be here. 'You don't want to give the wrong impression by glibly saying ""yes, we're fine"" because it's always a challenge operating businesses in this environment. 'I can say that, yes, we have the funds for this season. If we didn't, we shouldn't be here.' Marussia have been linked to Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian fashion industry billionaire who is understood to have spoken with Sauber with regard to investment, only for talks to falter. Lowdon declined to comment on Stroll, although at present it is understood no discussions have yet taken place with the team's majority shareholder Andrey Cheglakov. As for 2015, and with gossip rife F1 could be reduced to eight teams fielding three cars as three teams face going to the wall over the winter, Lowdon maintains Marussia are working tooth and nail to be on the grid for the opening race in Melbourne in March. Marussia driver Max Chilton, of Great Britain, in action before failing to complete the Singapore Grand Prix . 'Nobody can state unequivocally they will be racing next season. Not a single person in this pit lane can do that,' said Lowdon. 'Look at Honda, Toyota and BMW who all pulled out at the drop of a hat. They were companies who had finances to be in this sport, but chose not to. 'If it makes sense then people will be there, as simple as that. 'The people involved in Formula One are not crazy. We see long-term value in what we are trying to do, what we are trying to build. 'Obviously there are plenty of easier things in the world to do, and there are certainly easier ways to make money, that's absolutely for sure. 'But we believe in the long-term value of Formula One. We've said this a number of times, the biggest asset Formula One has to be its fanbase. Britain's Chilton, with girlfriend Chloe Roberts, faces an uncertain future with a cloud of Marussia . 'It's enormous, unique, and is incredibly valuable, so that itself is sufficient for a team like us to build for the long term. 'But that also means there can be difficult times along the way.' Lowdon can at least confirm Marussia are currently in the process of building their car for 2015, claiming it is 'moving along at speed'. Lowdon added: 'We're quite happy with the progress we're seeing. 'We're doing what any team could, would, should be doing at this stage. We're no different. 'The bottom line is: times are tough, but we're still here, still on the grid, still fighting, and at this stage we're doing everything to be on the grid in 2015.'","Marussia sporting director Graeme Lowdon says team will finish season .

"Brian Smith is convinced his rookie London Irish wing, Alex Lewington, can scorch into England’s World Cup plans after his hat-trick against Saracens last week. The 23-year-old showcased blistering pace and finishing class with his brilliant Aviva Premiership treble at the Madejski Stadium, despite the best efforts of the visitors’ fabled ‘wolf pack’ defence to stop him. Although the Exiles suffered an agonising 36-32 loss on Saturday, Lewington made a strong impression at a time when England are on the hunt for prolific wide-men. Now, as he prepares for a return to Leicester, where he came through the ranks, Lewington has been identified by his director of rugby as a potential Test candidate, with Stuart Lancaster announcing his autumn squad on October 22. Alex Lewington (R) scores a hat-trick against for London Irish in their 36-32 defeat by Saracens . London Irish coach Brian Smith insists that Lewington can make the step up for England . Smith said: ‘There are a number of young fliers, like Lewi. Last year it was Marland (Yarde). Right now people are going “who’s hot?” If you’re a back three player your currency is speed and try-scoring. It’s early doors, but players like Lewington will emerge and put pressure on.’ Asked if a late run into contention for next year’s World Cup was still feasible, the former England attack coach added: ‘Yeah, definitely. If someone scores a dozen tries in the league, they’re going to be asking questions. London Irish players look dejected after losing such a close contest at the Madejski Stadium . ‘I’d say England are trying to work out what they want to do on the wing. Go back a year or two and they were playing an extra full-back, now I think they’re looking at out-and-out scorers.’ Lewington believes it is ‘too soon’ for any realistic hope of a call-up but he represented his country in the same Under 16, 18 and 19 teams as Owen Farrell and George Ford. Lancaster certainly has several wing options to consider. In addition to Yarde, Chris Ashton and Jack Nowell, he will be keen to assess Christian Wade at Test level, if the turbo-charged Wasp can stay fit, while Jonny May was on the scoresheet for Gloucester last weekend. Another prime contender is Anthony Watson of Bath, but he is currently recovering from a foot injury.","Alex Lewington can make England's World Cup squad, says Brian Smith .

"Wales hooker Ken Owens has undergone a scan to gauge the extent of a neck injury suffered during training. Owens missed the Scarlets' Guinness PRO12 victory over Treviso four days ago. The Scarlets have now announced he has been assessed by their own medical team, while consultation has also taken place with specialists. Scarlets and Wales hooker Ken Owens is to see a neck specialist following an injury . 'We have undergone a thorough process of consultation with specialists over the last few days in regards to Ken's injury, and will decide on the best course of action in the coming days.'

Owens, 27, has started Wales' last three Tests, including both summer tour games against South Africa, and is an integral part of national coach Warren Gatland's plans. He made his international debut during the 2011 World Cup and has gone on to win 26 caps, vying for the number two shirt with Richard Hibbard. Wales kick off their autumn Test schedule against Australia on November 8, before tackling Fiji, New Zealand and the Springboks.","Owens has undergone a scan to gauge the extent of the neck injury .

"Tony Bellew wants to end Nathan Cleverly's career when the pair square off in their grudge re-match, the details of which are expected to be announced later this week. Bellew dropped a majority points decision to his British rival in their bout for the WBO light-heavyweight title in October 2011 and the Liverpudlian has been itching to set the record straight ever since. With both fighters moving up to the cruiserweight division and promoted by Eddie Hearn's Matchroom team, a return bout is close to being finalised. Tony Bellew is out to end Nathan Cleverly's career when the pair clash again . Tony Bellew lost a majority points decision against Nathan Cleverly last time out . Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew (right) are kept apart at the pre-fight press conference in 2011 . And Bellew, never one to mince words, will relish the chance to step in the ring with his biggest foe once again. 'I don't just want to beat him, I want to finish him,' said the 31-year-old (22-2-1, 14KOs). 'He won't want to get in the ring ever again after our fight. Putting the record straight means more to me than a world title. Welshman Nathan Cleverly dropped his world title to Sergey Kovalev last year . 'I'm going to put myself through hell in camp and picture his face during every moment. I cannot wait.' The duo were being touted as chief support to IBF welterweight titlist Kell Brook's homecoming at Sheffield on December 6 but with the world champion out of action until next year after being stabbed while on holiday earlier this month, Hearn has had to look elsewhere. 'We are almost there,' said Hearn. 'Having been originally set for December 6, we are now finalising a new date and venue and I hope to have the deal tied up this week.' Cleverly, who dropped his world title to the hard-hitting Sergey Kovalev last year but has bounced back with two wins in the cruiserweight division, is looking to use the bout to re-establish his world title credentials at the 200lb limit. 'I've always said I will fight him any time, anywhere, the result will be the same as before, a Nathan Cleverly victory,' he said. 'The only slight change this time is I doubt he will hear the final bell. I'm excited for the fight, it will capture the public's imagination and become a huge event. I'm looking forward to making it 2-0 and moving on to a shot at the title.'","Bellew dropped majority points decision in their title fight in October 2011 .

"Jenson Button's future at McLaren appears assured as the team draw ever closer to announcing their driver line-up for next season. Despite retiring from Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix and failing to be classified at the end of a race for the first time in two years, the 34-year-old showed no qualms when asked about his fate for 2015. Speaking to Press Association Sport, Button said: 'I'm not worried in any way about that. 'I'm pretty happy I'll be here next year, and I feel I'm doing a good job right now. Jenson Button's future has been a hot topic recently but the Brit is confident he'll be at McLaren in 2015 . Button had to retire from the Singapore Grand Prix, as he failed to finish a race for the first time in two seasons . 'I just have to sort Saturdays (in qualifying) a bit more. I've been a bit unlucky and not got the best out of it every weekend, which annoys me more than anything else, but I'll get there.' Racing director Eric Boullier has revealed talks between himself and McLaren Group chairman and CEO Ron Dennis are moving on apace. Earlier this month Dennis promised a definitive decision would be announced by the end of the season in Abu Dhabi in eight weeks' time. 'We make progress every day, although there is absolutely no plan to announce anybody yet,' said Boullier. McLaren Racing Director Eric Boullier has revealed he is in talks with McLaren chairman and CEO Ron Dennis . 'It's down to Ron and I, but Ron has the last call as the owner and chairman of the company, although when it comes to protocol it is the board that has the last call. 'But Ron and I generally agree.

Button will hope he's done enough to convince McLaren chairman and CEO Ron Dennis (right) of a 2015 drive . With Honda coming on board as power-unit supplier next year, with the Japanese manufacturing giant replacing Mercedes, Button is already looking ahead as to the difficulties likely to be faced. 'I know Honda will be giving everything to be competitive from the word go,' said Button. 'But Formula One is so competitive now, and Mercedes have done a great job. 'It's always going to be tricky to challenge someone like that who already have the experience of the engine.

"Champions Northampton left Tyneside on Sunday with the bonus-point victory they needed to reignite their title defence, but also with fitness concerns over two England forwards. Jim Mallinder’s side had this Aviva Premiership non-contest wrapped up within the first half- hour with three tries. Yet they had to wait until two minutes from time to secure the bonus, when George North crossed in the left corner following Newcastle defiance. For the Saints, this was a fitting response to the setback of losing at Wasps — at least in terms of the scoreline, as the performance was patchy. It also leaves them set fair for a momentous showdown with Bath at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday. George North breaks forward to secure a bonus point win for reigning champions Northampton Saints . Defending champions Northampton Saints returned to winning ways with 35-10 victory over Newcastle . There are a few scattered clouds in the brighter skies over Northampton, however, caused by medical concerns. England flanker Tom Wood was withdrawn from the match with a bad back, while Test team-mate Courtney Lawes retired soon after half-time clutching his left shoulder. In addition, Stephen Myler is sidelined with a persistent calf injury. As ever, the official line suggested no reason to panic, but only time will tell. Mallinder said: ‘Tom Wood has got a sore back. He actually got it against Gloucester, so he played last week with it. It’s been bothering him all week so we thought we wouldn’t risk it. I’m pretty comfortable that he and Courtney will be fine for next week. ‘Courtney just got a stinger in that last two minutes of defence in the first half. He put in a big tackle and just took a blow to the shoulder.’ Salesi Ma'afu (L) of Northampton Saints makes a break during the Aviva Premiership match . For Newcastle, this was a 19th successive league defeat, stretching back to October last year. The manner of their second-half resurgence was reason for measured optimism, but what Dean Richards’ team desperately need is a positive result, whatever the nature of the performance. In the first 30 minutes their defending was dreadful. Saints’ first try came when three tacklers fell away as Will Hooley ran to the line unchecked, while Josh Furno allowed Samu Manoa to breeze past him and set up a try for Ken Pisi. The Falcons rallied with sufficient conviction after half-time to secure long spells of attacking possession, which led to a try by Noah Cato from a quick tap penalty on the right. But by then the damage was done. James Wilson of Northampton powers through the Newcastle defence of Adam Powell and Gonzalo Tiesi . Richards lamented the slow start, saying: ‘The way we turned up in the first 30 minutes wasn’t great. We fronted up in the second half but I wish we had done that in the first half. ‘Our exits weren’t great, we didn’t do what we said we were going to do and our work-rate was woeful. Once we showed some belief we were a match for them in the final 50 minutes.’ Northampton did enough to take what they wanted from this game without ever really hitting their peak, although there was slick play between Samu Manoa and Kahn Fotuali’i in the build-up to Alex Waller’s try. Ben Foden ran with menace from full back and Hooley showed some assured touches as the playmaker deputising for Myler. Simon Hammersley (L) of Newcastle Falcons is tackled Courtney Lawes of Northampton Saints . However, the Saints will have to be far more precise and ruthless against Bath, as they are well aware. ‘Bath are running hot at the moment,’ said Luther Burrell — no pun intended. ‘They are a team in form. We all watched their game against Leicester (which Bath won 45-0) and we know it’s going to be tough next weekend.’ Mallinder added: ‘We’ve respected Bath over the last few years. We had three really close games with them last season — we drew down there and just beat them in the Amlin Challenge Cup final. ‘They are a developing team and to beat any side by 40-odd points, particularly Leicester, means you have to respect them. ‘They’ve got threats all over the field, but we’ve got a few threats of our own.’","Northampton defeated Newcastle 35-10 in Aviva Premiership game .

"They  could have charged admission fees to watch the street rugby in the Samoan village of Fatausi-Fogapoa during the summer. The Tuilagi clan were all back home together — playing for fun. For Alesana Tuilagi, it was the only way of keeping his skills sharp during the best part of six months in limbo. Having hoped to join Newcastle in March, after finishing a two-year stint in Japan, the 33-year-old wing was hampered by a visa problem which delayed his arrival on Tyneside. Facing a lack of competitive action, he settled for a resumption of sibling rivalry with his brothers including Manu, who had recently been in England colours taking on the All Blacks, before returning to the island of Savai’i to catch up with his family. Alesana Tuilagi tells of how the family play rugby in the street when they are all in Samoa together . ‘Back home, they’re always playing rugby,’ said Alesana, ahead of his first start for Newcastle against champions Northampton at Kingston Park. ‘We were playing touch rugby in the street, not contact. ‘I was just having fun with the family. Manu was there because he came home after England’s tour of New Zealand. All of the brothers were there together — we’re not all together very often like that. It was very nice. We had a few weeks together in Samoa then all went off to start the new season.’ While Alesana and three of his brothers, Freddie, Henry and Andy (Anitelea) — who has also joined Newcastle — have represented the land of their birth, Manu chose to play for England, where he honed his game as a teenager. The rest of the Tuilagi family are proud of what he has achieved but Alesana was not about to show too much respect when they played in their village, just as he doesn’t when they collide professionally. Newcastle Falcons Alesana Tuilagi runs at the London Irish defence during the Aviva Premiership . The tuilagi clan are proud of what Manu has achieved playing for England . ‘Manu’s just the same,’ he said. ‘He stays with some old friends and they go outside playing touch rugby together. We were playing touch rugby together in our village at home. The other people there don’t watch us, it’s just full of kids playing. It’s good fun. ‘He doesn’t scare me! If we’re playing a game, we have to be physical with each other. We don’t back down or we will get injured. We just play the game normally when we play each other.’ From 2004 to 2012, Alesana was a stalwart at Leicester, the club where Manu remains as the last link to the Tuilagi dynasty. Two years ago, he left for a new challenge in Japan with NTT Shining Arcs and he embraced the chance to immerse himself in a different culture. Alesana Tuilagi was a stalwart for Leicester Tigers between 2004 and 2012 . Manu Tuilagi, embracing former teammate Thomas Waldron, has taken over his brother's mantle at Leicester . ‘I was surprised when I went there,’ he said. ‘I lived 15 minutes from Tokyo and it’s a crazy place. There’s no diet there, the Japanese eat rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The rugby is different, the way they train is different; it was a different experience. They don’t have home or away games, they select stadiums around the country and you play everywhere. You play one game down south, another up north, but most are in Tokyo. ‘The standard there is good; they play a fast game and there are good players going there so the rugby is developing but it is a different environment. The rugby is going very well but the rules are different; they only allow two foreigners on the pitch and two on the bench, so I was playing for 40 minutes, then coming off. I have to get used to playing 80 minutes again.’ Having belatedly resolved his visa issues in order to return to the Aviva Premiership with the Falcons, Alesana has been playing catch-up with his fitness work after missing much of pre-season. In a quirk of the fixture list, his first competitive outing took him back to Welford Road, where the Tigers supporters accorded him the rousing reception he deserved, given his exploits for Leicester over so many seasons. Samoa's Tuilagi breaks the Scotland defense while on his way to scoring a try in 2013 . Tuilagi is set to come up against George North when Newcastle face Northampton . There was a time when that East Midlands city was home from home for a large contingent of the Tuilagis, who lived in two houses five minutes apart. But now the focus has shifted to the North East, with Alesana and Andy hunting for a house that can provide enough space for them and their families. ‘The family is getting bigger and bigger,’ said Alesana. ‘Of course they will grow up loving rugby and representing us as another Tuilagi generation in the game.

"Tom Arscott scored a hat-trick as Sale secured their first Aviva Premiership win of the season with a 46-8 thumping of London Welsh. Tries from Arscott and Vadim Cobilas, along with five points from the boot of Danny Cipriani, gave the Sharks a 15-3 advantage at the interval, with Welsh’s only response in the first 40 minutes coming through an Olly Barkley penalty. Cipriani kicked his second three-pointer of the afternoon to extend the hosts’ lead after the break. Sale Sharks' Tom Arscott scored a hat-trick as the hosts strolled to victory over London Welsh . Nic Reynolds’ touchdown gave the visitors hope, but Arscott went over for the second time to seal the win and Tom Brady scored late on to garner a vital bonus point. Arscott then completed his hat-trick before Luke McLean touched down in the last minute. Both sides went into the game with a record of two defeats from two games, although the visitors at least had the excuse of having to integrate 25 new signings. Although Bath and Gloucester are expected to challenge for the top six, narrow losses to the West Country teams represented a frustrating opening to the campaign for Steve Diamond’s Sharks. Two weeks ago against Mike Ford’s men, Sale lacked intensity in the initial exchanges and found themselves 7-0 down almost from the kick-off. This time they were on the front foot from the off, touching down within three minutes when Cipriani, McLean, Johnny Leota and Will Addison combined to send Arscott over against his former club. The victory was Sale Sharks' first of the Aviva Premiership season . It was the perfect start for the hosts, but a poor one for a visiting side who had shipped over 100 points so far in the Premiership. To their credit, the Exiles fought back and went through the phases in the opposition half before an offside infringement allowed Barkley to reduce the arrears with a penalty. Welsh then had a second three-point opportunity as Sale’s poor ball-handling skills and indiscipline let them down, but the visiting stand-off was awry from the tee. That was to prove costly for the away team as Diamond’s men once again exerted pressure on the Oxford-based outfit’s line and Cobilas eventually bundled his way over. Cipriani was on target with the extras as Sharks opened up a 12-3 lead. It was a disappointing performance from the visitors who have shipped over 100 points so far this season . The Manchester team continued to dominate possession and territory and extended their lead at the break via a three-pointer from their fly-half, following a yellow card to Dean Schofield. Down to 14 men, the Exiles were on the back foot at the start of the second period when a powerful Sale scrum resulted in a penalty which the hosts’ pivot duly converted. Justin Burnell’s team showed some fight, though, and had chances in the Sale 22 before they finally - and deservedly - broke through after 57 minutes when Reynolds went over. But the Sharks lifted the intensity and effectively sealed the victory when Arscott crossed for his second score, converted by Cipriani. Brady touched down to clinch the bonus point before Arscott completed his hat-trick a minute later when Michael Paterson collected the re-start. McLean then went over in the final minute to seal a comfortable win.","Sale Sharks beat London Welsh 46-8 in Aviva Premiership .

"All Blacks fly-half Aaron Cruden has expressed his 'shame' at being dropped from the New Zealand lineup after he missed the team's flight to Argentina on Sunday following a drunken night out. Cruden missed the assembly time for the departure and was dropped by coach Steve Hansen for the team's Rugby Championship tour matches against the Pumas and South Africa. He was also reprimanded by Hansen, who will likely pick Beauden Barrett to replace the 25-year-old for Saturday's clash against Argentina in La Plata and the following week's match against the Springboks. New Zealand fly half Aaron Cruden is tackled by Australia full back Israel Folau . 'I am deeply embarrassed by this lack of judgement and have never been more disappointed in myself,' Cruden said in a statement released by the New Zealand Rugby Union on Monday. 'I carry the burden of shame and disappointment and I am deeply apologetic to my team, to my family, and also the New Zealand public. 'I have no excuses. I accept full responsibility for my actions and the penalty of missing the next two games, and I will work with New Zealand Rugby to undertake any other disciplinary action to work through this situation.' Though the team initially said Cruden had been left behind because of the late-night excursion, Hansen said in Argentina that he had missed the flight. 'We didn't have a curfew. He was out drinking and he didn't get there in time,' Hansen earlier told New Zealand media in Argentina. 'It's obviously disappointing and out of character for (Aaron). He's extremely disappointed in himself. He understands there has to be a consequence for his actions.' Kieran Read, Aaron Smith and Aaron Cruden of the All Blacks perform the haka . 'Once we get this out of the way then he will be coming back into the group when we go to Brisbane. 'It's not what we, or he, stands for. We all make mistakes. 'The team is well aware that when we don't get it right there is a consequence and he's paid the price for that.' Hansen said a replacement would be called into the squad, though it would not be Daniel Carter, who has been recovering from a broken leg sustained during the Super Rugby final. Local media reported later that three-test All Black Tom Taylor had been called in to replace Cruden. Cruden had started in six out of seven of the All Blacks' tests this season, with Barrett beginning against the Pumas in Napier earlier this month. Colin Slade is likely to come off the bench if Barrett starts at La Plata.

"George Ford orchestrated a record annihilation of former club Leicester at The Rec yesterday to enhance his England prospects. It felt like a changing of the guard as the Tigers were buried under the West Country side’s dazzlingly ambitious attacking play, which yielded five touchdowns — one a cast-iron certainty for any ‘try of the season’ shortlist. It was the biggest Bath win against these opponents and the first time Leicester have failed to score in the Premiership. They lost Manu Tuilagi and Anthony Allen before kick-off due to injuries —groin and knee respectively — they lost the game by a country mile and by the end they had lost their heads under pressure. Bath's George Ford stole the show at the Recreation Ground against Leicester by leading his side to victory . Ford kicked 20 points from three penalties, a drop- goal and four conversions for his side . To compound the visitors’ misery, they wound up with more red cards than points, when scrum half David Mele was sent off in the closing stages for stamping. Ford kicked 20 points and wielded the conductor’s baton with aplomb — comfortably eclipsing his fellow England No 10 candidate Freddie Burns. He was given an armchair ride due to the epic efforts of the Bath pack. David Wilson inspired a demolition of the Leicester scrum and lock Dave Attwood delivered a colossal performance in front of watching England forwards coach Graham Rowntree; tackling himself to a standstill. Bath’s dominance up front allowed them to surge into a 23-0 half-time lead, with tries by Semesa Rokoduguni and Jonathan Joseph. But the score that brought the house down came in the 57th minute. Leicester were rumbling towards the Bath line but the ball popped out of their maul and Ford sent it left to Joseph. He scorched past Burns and passed on to Stuart Hooper. After quick-step bursts by Kyle Eastmond and Ford, Attwood drove towards the line, then Eastmond stepped inside to stretch over. It was a classic, length-of-the-field counter-attack. There was no let-up from the hosts as Olly Woodburn finished off another long-range strike for the bonus point and Peter Stringer touched down six minutes from time. England internationals Manu Tuilagi missed his side's encounter against Leicester due to a groin injury . The result will send shockwaves through the Premiership. ‘We were pretty relentless,’ said Ford. ‘Our players were on the edge. ‘We’ve got Northampton next, which is a sobering thought, but hopefully other teams will fear us after this. When we get it right; that’s what we can do.’ Leicester, who saw England forwards Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling come off injured, were chastened. Director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘We couldn’t cope with their physicality and we were outplayed across the field. We got what we deserved and I’m bitterly disappointed.’","George Ford kicked 20 points from three penalties, a drop-goal and four conversions .

"A last-minute try by Billy Vunipola from a driving maul saved Saracens’ unbeaten record just as a rejuvenated London Irish had seemed set to pull off a remarkable Aviva Premiership victory. Sarries - eventual 36-32 winners - had appeared in total control after 30 minutes, leading 20-7, before they were stunned by the enterprise of the home side, who outscored them by four to three on the try count. Irish’s flying wing Alex Lewington was their hero, scoring a hat-trick of tries. Blair Cowan was the other man to touch down, with the impressive Shane Geraghty kicking two penalties and three conversions. Billy Vunipola scored a last-minute try to turn the game on its head and hand Saracens victory . Richard Wigglesworth, Tim Streather and Vunipola were the Saracens try-scorers, with Owen Farrell kicking three penalties and two conversions. Alex Goode kicked two second-half penalties, but missed with two late attempts which had the visitors’ nerves jangling. Charlie Hodgson wrapped up the scoring by converting Vunipola’s match-winning try. Irish made only two changes to their starting line-up after last week’s win at Newcastle. Jebb Sinclair and Luke Narraway were included in the pack, replacing Dan Leo and Tom Guest, who both dropped down to the bench. Saracens made wholesale changes from last week’s thrashing of Harlequins, with Jim Hamilton given a first Premiership start for the club and Ernst Joubert returning after injury. The visitors were ahead after only 50 seconds. Vunipola charged forward to set up the platform for Wigglesworth and Goode to carve the home defence apart, creating a try for Streather. Saracens' Alex Goode is tackled by London Irish pair Scott Steele and Blair Cowan . Farrell converted and minutes later kicked a penalty as a long afternoon for Irish seemed on the horizon. Despite this, Irish responded with an excellent try, courtesy of two pieces of magic from Geraghty. First he cleverly chipped over the defence for Fergus Mulchrone to collect and feed Scott Steele. He was hauled down just short of the line, but the ball was swiftly recycled for Geraghty to send Cowan over with a superbly timed pass. Geraghty converted the try, but Farrell extended the visitors’ lead with his second penalty to leave Saracens 13-7 in front at the end of the first quarter. Three minutes later, the visitors scored their second try when, following a ruck on the home 22, Wigglesworth spotted a gap to run 25 metres for the score, which Farrell converted. Irish would not lie down, though. They contributed fully to a pulsating first half-hour and were rewarded with another skilfully created try. This time a well-judged cross-field kick from Chris Noakes was gathered by Lewington, who skipped past two defenders for the score, which Geraghty converted. London Irish's George Skivington takes a lineout ball ahead of Saracens' Hayden Smith . Irish suffered a blow when flanker Ofisa Treviranus left the field with an injury to be replaced by Kieran Low, but it did not stop their momentum as Lewington raced on to a chip ahead from Steele to score his second try to momentarily stun Saracens. Geraghty missed the conversion before Farrell kicked another penalty to give Saracens a 23-19 half-time advantage. Geraghty soon reduced that lead to one point with his first penalty before Irish went ahead for the first time as Lewington completed his hat-trick. Once again, Steele kicked ahead with Lewington reacting quicker than any of the three Saracens defenders to race away for the try which Geraghty converted. Goode kicked two penalties for the visitors to tie up the scores at 29-29 at the end of the third quarter before Geraghty restored his side’s lead with a further penalty. Goode missed an easy penalty chance for Saracens, as did Geraghty with two attempts from the halfway line, before late on Goode again missed with another simple opportunity before Vunipola’s late effort, converted by Hodgson, broke Irish hearts.","Saracens beat London Irish 36-32 .

"England are considering an early Test call-up for Saracens’ new, uncapped Australian prop, Kieran Longbottom - who is eligible and has revealed his desire to push for selection. The 28-year-old known as ‘K-bomb’ joined the north London club from Perth-based Western Force during the summer, despite being told by Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie that he was in contention for international honours. He has impressed in his first two Aviva Premiership appearances for Saracens and amid a dearth of established English tightheads, it is understood that he is being viewed as a candidate for Stuart Lancaster’s national squad, to be named on October 22. Kieran Longbottom (pictured) of Saracens could be fast-tracked into the England squad this November . Longbottom (left) is interviewed by Sportsmail's Chris Foy and reveals it'd be an 'honour' to play for England . With Leicester’s Dan Cole due to miss the autumn internationals at Twickenham as he recovers from neck surgery, David Wilson of Bath is destined to continue as first-choice at No 3. But behind him, stocks are low. Henry Thomas, is spending long periods on Bath’s bench while developing his scrummaging, and Kyle Sinckler of Harlequins is another rookie with considerable raw potential who is still honing his craft. On Monday, England forwards coach Graham Rowntree was in Newcastle to watch Kieran Brookes play for the Falcons’ reserves. Despite being capped against New Zealand in June, the 24-year-old is struggling at his club and has been demoted from the match-day 23. Against this backdrop, Longbottom - whose maternal grandmother was born in Yorkshire - has been identified as an immediate solution in a problem position. He is ready to answer the call, after belatedly discovering that he qualifies for England. ‘The fact that I ended up finding out I am eligible to play for England is a bonus,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It is something I had never really thought of. My initial intention was to come over here, learn to be a better scrummager then after a few years go back and hopefully be one of the best tightheads in Australia. Then I could have another crack at it (playing for Australia). But whatever happens, happens. Other opportunities present themselves. Australian-born tighthead prop Longbottom would be likely to back-up for Bath's David Wilson for England . Dan Cole is England's first-choice tighthead prop but he is sidelined for months following neck surgery . David Wilson (centre) of Bath is likely to continue to deputise at No 3 in Dan Cole's absence for England . ‘I hold an Australian passport, but my nana on my mum’s side was born in Halifax. I sort of knew it but I didn’t know what that meant in terms of eligibility. It’s just one of those things - that was a good break for me I suppose.’ Quite how much of a good break is only now dawning on Longbottom. If he was a loosehead, he would be low down a long, high-class queue of England contenders, but at tighthead he is instantly in the mix. If Lancaster or Rowntree make contact, he won’t hesitate to make himself available. ‘It would be a massive honour to play for England,’ he said. ‘There is a massive, proud history behind the team, so to be able to play for them would be something I would be very proud of. It would be another opportunity for me and I would want to take it. ‘It was good to play at Twickenham the other day. It is bloody impressive. It would be an honour to play there for England. When I was planning to come over here, I didn’t even know that I would be eligible, but afterwards it was spelled out to me. At the time I thought, Right, whatever, that’s not going to happen”. But coming here now, maybe it is going to happen and that is pretty exciting.’ England would be pinching him from under the noses of the Wallabies - Pool A rivals at next year’s World Cup. Longbottom was in the mix to represent his country, but encouraging noises didn’t lead to caps, so he decided to try his luck elsewhere. Kieran Brookes (centre) of Newcastle Falcons impressed in New Zealand but has struggled for his club . Longbottom, pictured here tackling England captain Chris Robshaw, moved to Saracens this summer . ‘Ewen McKenzie came and spoke to me at training in pre-season,’ he said. ‘Then during the season I thought I was going well, but I didn’t hear anything else from them (Australia). When this opportunity came along I just thought, “I could snap my leg in the next game, so I have to take this”. ‘When I spoke to Foles (Force coach Michael Foley) and told him I was planning on doing it, he said, “But you are on their (Australia’s) radar”. Maybe I was on their radar, but there was a beaming light shining me in the face, coming from here. It was a massive opportunity and I couldn’t just ignore that, hoping for something else to happen.’ In his early games for Saracens, Longbottom has made a positive set-piece impact, despite finding the scrums markedly different to what he was used to Down Under. ‘Guys aren’t afraid to attack on their own ball and on the opposition’s ball,’ he said. ‘I have only played four games here so far but already I’ve had to deal with looseheads who love standing up and coming in. ‘In Australia we like to keep the scrum steady and straight, to have a good attacking platform off it, whereas here it is a real contest to go forward, see how much damage you can do, try to fracture them and get a penalty. It’s a good contest. That’s why I play the game - to have a battle with the other bloke and shake his hand at the end.’ A love of proper, combative scrummaging will go down well with Rowntree. So far, Longbottom is doing and saying all the right things to advance his England prospects. England head coach Stuart Lancaster could fast-track Longbottom due to a crisis at tighthead prop .

"As first days go, it was not what Greig Laidlaw had expected. As he walked through the doors of Gloucester Rugby Club, the man who had signed him, Nigel Davies, had long since headed in the opposite direction. Indeed, the Scotland international needed to seek out his new boss to make his introductions. On top of that, the versatile half-back was also having to deal with some significant changes in his family life, as he made the move from Galashiels to Cheltenham with wife Rachel and month-old baby son Ruary. Greig Laidlaw has adapted quickly to live at Kingsholm after his move south from Edinburgh . ‘Add into that a few sleepless nights and it was maybe not the easiest starts to my time at Kingsholm as there was a lot going on,’ admitted a smiling Laidlaw, who has hardly had time to catch his breath since his move south from Edinburgh Rugby over the summer. ‘It was busy times, moving clubs, houses and dealing with a new-born while it was hard on Rachel as she was away from her family with a baby. ‘Players will tell you it is never easy moving clubs and, in my case, there were maybe a few other things to take into account.’ Some may have struggled under such pressure, especially as Laidlaw was trying to impress a coach he hadn’t even met before he turned up for that first day of training. The Scottish scrum half in action against Northampton where he got off to a rocky start for this club . But, to his credit, Laidlaw, who joined Gloucester after seven years at Edinburgh, has displayed remarkable strength of character to take everything in his stride. On Friday night, he will start his third match in a row as his new side take on Exeter Chiefs and is growing in stature with every passing game. The Scotland star had signed a pre-contract agreement with Gloucester back in March when Davies was in charge. However, the Welshman was sacked as director of rugby three months later after the West Country club finished a lowly ninth in the Aviva Premiership. Suddenly, Laidlaw’s position had changed dramatically, with there being no guarantee he would fit into the new man’s plans. Gloucester's new signing at scrum half hopes he can add to his 31 Scotland caps but has to play well . Former Ulster head coach David Humphreys took over but as he moved to Kingsholm when Laidlaw was on Scotland duty in the USA and Canada back in June, their paths didn’t cross. Then Australian Laurie Fisher, who Laidlaw had never met, was appointed below Humphries as head coach, which made pre-season training more of a ‘getting to know you’ experience than he ever expected. ‘You always have to prove yourself match by match but the changes meant maybe I had to do it again for the new coaching team,’ said Laidlaw. ‘Although I hadn’t met Laurie before I arrived at the club, he has been fantastic — as has David — and things are going really well.’ Davies had viewed Laidlaw as a stand-off rather than a scrum-half — but it’s at No 9 where the Borderer feels more comfortable and has earned most of his 31 caps. Greig Laidlaw tackles Sale Sharks' Jonathan Mills as he adapts to life in England, and life with a child . ‘Nigel did mention I would move to stand-off when I first signed but I always told him I was a nine who could cover at 10 — that situation hadn’t been resolved by the time he left,’ said Laidlaw. ‘It would have been interesting to see where I would have been playing if Nigel was still here but I’ve had chats with David Humphreys and Laurie Fisher and they want me as a scrum-half. ‘If that hadn’t been the case, it would have been a bit of a worry for me when it came to Scotland but fortunately I am starting at nine for Gloucester.’ Part of the reason for Laidlaw being used at scrum-half is because the new coaching regime has brought in the 67-times capped Welshman James Hook to play 10. Their half-back partnership got off to a rocky start in their first league match as Gloucester lost 53-6 away to Northampton Saints, with Hook and Laidlaw putting over a penalty each. The pressure was, therefore, on them in their first home game last weekend against Sale Sharks but both players stepped up to the mark. The Welsh international ran the show, with Laidlaw kicking 19 points as Gloucester won 34-27 in a thrilling match played in front of more than 13,000 fans. Scotland will play Japan at Kingsholm in the first match of the 2015 World Cup and Laidlaw wants to be there . ‘Knowing that James had signed for Gloucester after me came as a nice surprise as it helped me see where I fitted into the picture at the club,’ said 28-year-old Scot. ‘I feel our partnership is developing well and Hooky is an easy player to play alongside. He is incredibly skilful and has the boot on him to put us in the right areas, which is vital in this league.’ Laidlaw feels it is too early for him to compare the standard of play in the Premiership to the PRO12 but the one big difference is the atmosphere at matches. ‘I am not against the PRO12 but the way the Premiership is supported means there are no small games,’ he said. ‘For instance, at our first game against Northampton at Franklin’s Gardens there was 14,000 people. We lost that match but still there were around 13,000 at Kingsholm for our match against Sale Sharks and our game against Exeter Chiefs is nearing a sell-out. The Scottish scrum half has won 31 caps for his country, occasionally playing in the number 10 role . ‘I always thought of Gloucester as a big club and it’s lived up to expectations. The crowds are fantastic and what the club means to the people is similar to what the traditional clubs in the Borders mean to the locals back home. ‘The atmosphere week in, week out gets me excited and hopefully that, along with the competition for places at Gloucester, will drive my game forward.’ As Laidlaw is just beginning a new life in England, he doesn’t want to get too far ahead of himself in terms of the 2015 Rugby World Cup — but, at the back of his mind, he has that ambition. ‘Scotland’s first match in the World Cup against Japan will be at Kingsholm and it would be great for me to be involved in that,’ he said. ‘That would be an amazing experience but I am trying not to think that far ahead. Play well for Gloucester this season and maybe I can make that happen next September.’ Dove Men+Care is proud to be Official Partner of Scotland Rugby, offering shower gels, face care and deodorants which deliver high performance and superior skin care.

"Hull KR are looking for two new half-backs as well as a hooker after releasing homesick Australian Kris Keating just 12 months into a three-year contract. The Robins have sold both their co-captains over the last six weeks, with hooker Josh Hodgson moving to the NRL with Canberra Raiders and stand-off Travis Burns joining St Helens, and have now reached an agreement with Keating to enable him to return home. The 25-year-old Keating joined the club from Canterbury Bulldogs as a replacement for outgoing skipper Michael Dobson at the start of the season, but the club say he struggled to settle in East Yorkshire for family reasons and the player was dropped by coach Chris Chester for the last two matches. Hull KR have released Kris Keating after the Australian suffered from homesickness in East Yorkshire . Hull KR chief executive Mike Smith said: 'Kris was unsettled and wanted to return home at the end of the season. 'He didn't figure in head coach Chris Chester's long-term plans and an agreement has therefore been reached to allow him to go back to Australia.

"Former Great Britain prop Garreth Carvell has been named in John Kear's first Wales squad, 14 years after he last played for the country. The 33-year-old former Hull and Warrington front rower, who is on a short-term deal with Castleford, is included in Kear's 22-man squad for the 2014 European Championships, which get under way when Wales meet Scotland in Workington on Friday, October 17.

"St Helens have signed Hull KR's Australian stand-off Travis Burns on a three-year contract from 2015. The Super League table-toppers say they have paid Rovers a transfer fee of £60,000 for the 30-year-old Burns, who is set to link up with his old Penrith Panthers team-mate Luke Walsh at Langtree Park. St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus said: 'Travis is a key signing for us and will bring both quality and depth to our half-back options and combinations. Travis Burns will join St Helens from Hull KR in a three-year deal from next year . 'He is a proven and experienced stand-off and will also bring directness and toughness as well as a strong kicking game.' Burns began his career at Manly and also played for North Queensland Cowboys and the Panthers before moving to Super League with Hull KR in 2013. He was forced to sit out the first month of last season due to a suspension carried over from the NRL for a high tackle, but went on to make 49 appearances in his two seasons at the KC Lightstream Stadium, scoring eight tries, 84 goals and two drop goals, and also played for the Exiles against England in the summer of 2013. Burns said: 'I want to thank the club, particularly Neil Hudgell and Mike Smith, for the opportunity to come to Hull KR. 'I was staring down the barrel of a long suspension in the NRL and they gave me the chance to come to a great club and made me and my family feel so welcome whilst we've been here. 'Leaving the club will be sad but it's a decision I had to make in the best interests of my family. We only get a small space of time in rugby league to do the best we can and the opportunity at Saints was in the best interests of both parties. 'I am really excited to be joining Saints. It will be great linking with my friend and former team-mate Luke Walsh and what is an exciting and strong squad.' Hull KR will now step up the search for a replacement for Burns, as well as Canberra-bound hooker Josh Hodgson, with chief executive Mike Smith currently in Australia on a scouting mission. Chairman Neil Hudgell said: 'Travis leaves with our best wishes. We sat down with him to discuss his plans for next season and beyond but whilst we were willing to open negotiations about a contract extension around Easter time next year, we weren't prepared to commit to a new deal before then. 'We understood his desire for stability with a second child on the way and we gave him permission to speak to other clubs. Saints made us an offer that was too good to turn down and we decided to accept it. 'We are now on the hunt for a new half-back and the fees received for both Travis and Josh Hodgson will be reinvested into the squad and will allow us to spend to the full salary cap next season.'","St Helens capture Travis Burns from Hull KR on three-year-deal .

"Sam Williams  scored a last-minute try to guide Catalan Dragons to a shock 24-20 win at Leeds and into the last six of the Super League play-offs. It was the French side’s first win at Headingley in 10 attempts and Laurent Frayssinous described it as the finest moment of his coaching career. ‘We made history by becoming the first Catalan team to win at Leeds,’ said Frayssinous. ‘To win that type of game, it is pretty special.’ Sam Williams scores a last minute try to send Catalan Dragons into last six of Super League play-offs . The Dragons’ reward is a trip to Huddersfield in Friday’s preliminary semi-final, with the Giants hoping to bounce back from a 57-4 hammering at Wigan. ‘We will stay humble,’ Frayssinous said. ‘We have never performed at Huddersfield so it will be a tough one again. But we know what we can do now.’ Warrington’s 22-19 play-off win over Widnes was marred by a terrible injury to Matty Russell. The full-back was carried off on a stretcher in the second half after a sickening collision with Macgraff Leuluai and was taken straight to hospital. The injury looked appalling — Russell was unconscious and had blood pouring from his nose and mouth — yet the player last night said he would be fine. He tweeted: ‘Been quite lucky scans are all good neck and head. Teeth knocked out n bad lip. Part and parcel of playing.’ Warrington, 18 points down at one stage, were inspired by a hat-trick of tries from Joel Monaghan.","Catalan Dragons defeated Leeds Rhinos 24-20 in Super League play-offs .

"A hat-trick of tries from winger Joel Monaghan helped Warrington complete a stunning comeback against local rivals Widnes in a thrilling Super League play-off clash at the Halliwell Jones stadium. The Wolves, aiming for a third successive Grand Final appearance at Old Trafford, looked to be in danger of falling at the first hurdle as they trailed the Kevin Brown inspired Vikings 18-0 after half an hour. But Monaghan, Super League’s top try-scorer, was on hand to rescue his side with his three-try haul and Rhys Evans also touched down with Stefan Ratchford landing three excellent touchline conversions to settle an epic contest 22-19. Joel Monaghan scored hat-trick to complete Warrington Wolves comeback against Widnes Vikings . The one downside for Tony Smith’s team was what looked a serious injury to full back Matty Russell who was stretchered from the field following a second-half collision with Macgraff Leuluai. Brown, who earned selection in the Super League Dream Team for the first time this week, created all three Widnes tries in a dominant first half first for the Vikings but they just ran out of steam in the second half. Paddy Flynn claimed two tries for the visitors and Rhys Hanbury also touched down with Danny Tickle landing three goals and Brown a drop-goal as they led 19-6 at half time but failed to add to their score in the second period. The Wolves now face the rest of the play-off games on the road and will travel to Challenge Cup finalists Castleford in the next round. Warrington were without injured skipper Ben Westwood and Simon Grix as well as the suspended Paul Wood but welcomed back centre Ryan Atkins after missing the previous week’s defeat at Wigan. The Vikings were still without centre Stefan Marsh but captain Jon Clarke, Brown, Hanbury, Eamon O’Carroll and Tickle all returned after being rested for the final regular-season game at Salford. Widnes, making their first appearance in the play-offs after finishing eighth in the Super League table, made the perfect start as they stunned the Wolves with two almost identical tries in the opening nine minutes. The Vikings took full advantage when Warrington were penalised for obstruction in the opening stages and that allowed the visitors to set up the position from which Brown put in an inch perfect kick and Flynn just managed to touch down. And Widnes repeated the dose four minutes later when it was Brown again whose perfectly placed kick over the Wolves line allowed Flynn to just beat Evans to the touch. Tickle kicked two excellent touchline conversions to give Widnes a 12-0 lead. It got even better for the Vikings after half an hour when the impressive Brown sent Hanbury racing clear and he evaded the attemped tackle of Russell to score. Tickle again converted to make it 18-0. On one of their rare forays into Widnes territory the Wolves posted their first points four minutes before half time when some crisp passing from Richie Myler and Chris Bridge allowed Monaghan to touch down in the corner. Ratchford landed his conversion attempt from the touchline to cut the Widnes lead to 18-6. But two minutes before half time the influential Brown cooly added a drop goal to give his side a 19-6 lead at half time. Warrington claimed their second try of the game three minutes after the restart when a superb pass out of the tackle by Bridge allowed Monaghan to claim his second try of the game and Ratchford again landed an excellent touchline conversion to make it 19-12. And five minutes later Warrington scored again when Evans crossed in the corner and cut the deficit to three points at 19-16. The Wolves hit the front on 56 minutes when a break down the right by Bridge released Monaghan to claim his hat-trick and Ratchford was once again on target with the conversion to make it 22-19.","Warrington Wolves beat Widnes Vikings 22-19 .

"Wigan are 80 minutes away from another Grand Final after justifying their tag of firm title favourites in a hopelessly one-sided play-off tie against Huddersfield. The reigning Super League champions were utterly dominant against a Giants side sorely missing their inspirational captain Danny Brough as they ran in 10 tries in a 57-4 victory, their biggest ever play-off win. England winger Josh Charnley scored two of the tries and second rower Joel Tomkins scored his first for the club since returning from rugby union, much to the delight of younger brother Sam - back at the end of the NRL season - watching from the corporate boxes. Joe Burgess (centre) is congratulated on his try by Josh Charnley and Dan Sarginson . Joe Burgess celebrates his try . Joe Tomkins dives over for Wigan's fifth try of a devastating display . The Warriors' reward is a week off and a home tie in the semi-finals while Huddersfield must quickly regroup ahead of their sudden-death tie next week after suffering a 10th defeat in 13 play-off ties. The Giants had won on seven of their 10 previous visits to the DW Stadium and ended the regular season with a seven-match unbeaten run but they were simply outclassed by a Wigan side marshalled superbly by half-backs Blake Green and Matty Smith, who finished with 21 points from a try, eight goals and a drop goal. The warning bells were ringing for the visitors as early as the third minute when teenager winger Joe Burgess, who revelled in his partnership with Dan Sarginson, collected Green's high kick only for his centre to lose the ball attempting to ground it over the line. The Warriors' decision to open the scoring with a Smith penalty suggested a tight contest and it was the visitors who went closest to scoring the first try on their first foray into their opponents' 20-metre area, with centre Joe Wardle halted by a thunderous tackle by full-back Matt Bowen and acting captain Brett Ferres losing the ball over the line. Sean O'Loughlin (second right) is delighted with his try . Joel Tomkins roars with delight after crossing the line . Two-try hero Josh Charnley was all smiles after Wigan's crushing win . Forced to defend throughout the opening quarter, Huddersfield were hanging on grimly until full-back Scott Grix conceded a scrum 10 metres out and that helped Wigan lay their victory platform with four tries in a devastating 13-minute spell. Bowen's brilliant cut-out pass got Charnley over for his 22nd try in 19 appearances in 2014 and then Smith took centre stage. First the former St Helens and Salford scrum-half burst through the attempted tackle of Shaun Lunt and sidestepped Grix for a solo score and then put substitute forward Tony Clubb through a gap for a try. Wigan were simply irresistible at that stage and they topped an impressive first half with a long-range try, fashioned by the left-wing pairing of Sarginson and Burgess and finished by second rower Liam Farrell. Joe Burgess dives over the whitewash . Matty Smith, who scored 21 points, gets ready to overload as he's pursued by the Giants' Jake Connor . With Smith converting three of the tries, the defending champions were out of sight by half-time, when they led 24-0, but the Giants gave themselves brief hope by scoring the first try of the second half. Lunt's darting run opened up the Wigan defence and Leroy Cudjoe's kick was palmed back into his grateful arms by Craig Kopczak for the England centre to touch down for what proved to be mere consolation as the visitors were hit by four more tries in a 12-minute spell. Smith's half-break enabled Tomkins to power his way over for his landmark score before Sarginson took a return pass from Burgess to score his side's sixth try. Sean O'Loughlin runs in to score Wigan's final try . Warriors' players can hardly contain their delight as they jump on try scorer Josh Charnley . The Giants could not lay their hands on the ball and they were reeling further when Wigan hit them with a 70-metre try from Bowen, fashioned by Green and Eddy Pettybourne, before Charnley ran over the unfortunate Grix to register his second try. Skipper Sean O'Loughlin juggled with Green's pass to touch down and Burgess went the full length of the pitch after collecting a wayward kick from Luke Robinson to score for his ninth successive match. Smith took his goal tally to eight from 11 attempts and then rounded off the scoring with a drop goal.","Half-back Matty Smith bags 21 points as Wigan move a step away from the Grand Final .

"James Roby made Castleford pay for his Super League Dream Team omission with a superb man-of-the-match performance that keeps St Helens on course for a place in the Grand Final. Castleford's rising star Daryl Clark got the nod for the hooking role in the Dream Team ahead of the England regular, who demonstrated all his old skill with two early tries and an all-round industrious display to which Castleford had no answer. It was routine for Saints, who were presented with the League Leaders' Shield before kick-off, as they moved effortlessly to within 80 minutes of a return to Old Trafford with a clinical 41-0 victory at Langtree Park. James Roby scores the second try for St Helens in the Super League play-off against Castleford . St Helens' seven-try triumph - in which Dream Team winger Tom Makinson scored on his 100th appearance - earned them next week off and they will also get the chance to select their home semi-final opponents via the controversial ClubCall system. Castleford, who missed the chance to pip Saints to top spot by losing to Catalan Dragons in their final league game, will have another chance to reach the last four in next week's elimination semi-finals but - like Huddersfield after the first qualifying play-off - will need to find a vastly improvement if they are get back on course for a maiden Grand Final appearance. Tigers coach Daryl Powell responded to their mini-slump by dropping stand-off Marc Sneyd, one of the stars of the season, in favour of Jamie Ellis while Australian winger Justin Carney made an unexpected return in place of the injured James Clare. Saints coach Nathan Brown also sprung a surprise by switching second rower Mark Flanagan to scrum-half. He acquitted himself well but it was Roby who the star of the show. Clark began the match on the bench - with Adam Milner preferred as the Tigers' starting hooker - and entered the action midway through the first half moments after Roby had broken the deadlock by forcing his way over for the game's first try. Five minutes later Roby repeated the feat, this time from 10 metres out, and Mark Percival kicked his second conversion to make it 12-0. Saints let slip a 10-0 lead in their last match but they soaked up Castleford pressure to keep their line intact up to the break and increased their advantage of the stroke of half-time with a drop goal from Jordan Turner. Any hope of a Castleford fightback was snuffed out within five minutes of the restart when Roby worked a run-around with Sia Soliola to free Turner, who sprinted 50 metres for Saints' third try. Roby then became trysaver when he managed to get his leg in the way to prevent Castleford centre Michael Channing touching down after a rare breach of the Saints defence. Trailing 19-0, the visitors were forced to chance their arm and it cost them another try when St Helens winger Adam Swift, a replacement for the injured Matty Dawson, picked up a loose ball and went 70 metres for a solo score. The home side were denied a penalty try when skipper Paul Wellens was pulled back while chasing Roby's grubber kick to the line but Castleford captain Michael Shenton was sin-binned for the offence and Saints took advantage of the extra man to increase their lead. Makinson took Percival's pass to cross at the corner and, as the Tigers began to tire, front-row forwards Kyle Amor and Mose Masoe both demonstrated brute strength to force their way over for close-range tries. Percival took his goal tally to six from seven attempts to wrap up a convincing victory.","Man-of-the-match performance from James Roby helps Saints to victory .

"Ryan Hall is a master of timing, whether he is waiting to charge all 16st 7lb of his enormous frame down the wing or teaching himself to play a piano sonata. In a profession where brawn is often prized over brains, Hall is proud he can play the saxophone, piano and guitar and complete the Rubik’s cube in less than a minute. ‘I’ve always been good at maths and music and if anyone ever asks, I’ll tell them,’ he said, ‘I’m not shy about that. I sometimes get a bit of stick from the lads but if we’re out for a meal I can add up the bill quite quickly, so it has its upsides.’ Ryan Hall is a rugby player with a difference, and can complete a Rubik's cube in less than a minute . Ryan Hall (left) holds off Wigan Warriors' Darrell Goulding (right) at the Etihad Stadium . Playoff Week One Fixtures . Hall now has to work out a formula to help his Leeds Rhinos team start winning again. Despite lifting the Challenge Cup last month, mainly thanks to a man-of-the-match performance and two steamroller tries from Hall, Leeds have lost their last five Super League games. They plummeted to sixth in the league and head into Saturday’s play-off match against Catalan Dragons needing to win or facing elimination. ‘We’ve not taken the end of the season too much to heart,’ said Hall, ‘We know we could have finished top of the table potentially but all the talk now is the playoffs, we’re treating it as a separate competition. ‘We have the opportunity to do the double which would be something remarkable given how close the table is. Wigan did it last year and showed it’s possible to do it in the modern era.’ Hall, who is known as WBW – or world’s best winger – by his teammates has proven he is a big occasion player. ‘I’ve been faced with these do-or-die games a couple of times and come out on top so hopefully I’m a bit of an inspiration to the younger players around me,’ he said. The 26-year-old, who is also part way through an accountancy degree, credits his love of music with keeping him focused on rugby. ‘You have a lot of spare time as a professional sportsperson and I spend mine wisely, music a good release and a way to relax,’ he said, ‘My mum always wanted me to do music at school to get another string to my bow and I loved it even though none of my circle of friends did it. Hall in action during the Tetley's Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington Wolves . ‘I’ve now got a two-year-old, Harry, and I’m encouraging him to be musical. He absolutely loves rugby already, the crowds and the music and everything. I think if I was to push him into anything it would be golf because their careers last longer and they don’t have as many injuries.’ Hall and his fiancée Vicky, who fostered a child before having Harry, also have their own special day coming up. The pair will marry on New Years Eve, but Hall may be taking a break from preparations. ‘I’m hoping to get picked for the England squad for the tour in Australia for six weeks so she’ll be 100% in charge,’ he said, ‘We’ve had a couple of arguments already about that one. ‘People have told me in the past that getting married is stressful but I just shrugged my shoulders. But it really is. I’ve got a realistic head on my shoulders when it comes to money whereas Vicky thinks about money last. But with the Challenge Cup, hopefully the Grand Final and a wedding it will certainly be a good year to look back on if it all goes to plan.’ Hall celebrates scoring a try during the Tetley's Challenge Cup final on August 23rd at Wembley .","Ryan Hall's Leeds Rhinos team-mates call him 'World's Best Winger'

"Huddersfield will be without their inspirational captain Danny Brough for Thursday's qualifying Super League play-off at Wigan. The reigning Man of Steel was forced to sit out the Giants' final match of the regular season against St Helens last Friday after taking a blow to his testicles in the previous game against Hull. Brough, who was forced to spend a night in hospital, has made progress in his recovery but will not be risked against the defending champions. Huddersfield will be without their captain Danny Brough for Thursday's Super League play-off at Wigan . 'Broughy is a tough old bloke and it takes something pretty bad to sideline him or put him down but he has improved and we will put him back in when the time is right,' said Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson. 'We have proved that we can win without Danny Brough, as good a player as he is. And, as much as we miss him, it's somebody else's opportunity.' Teenager Jake Connor stepped into Brough's stand-off role and scored a try and kicked two goals in the Giants' 17-16 win over Saints that guranteed them a top-four finish. Anderson's options are increased with the return of full-back Scott Grix, who has missed the last two games with a groin injury, while prop Eorl Crabtree also returns after sitting out last Friday's match with a minor knee injury. Wigan's only absentee is centre Iain Thornley and coach Shaun Wane is set to stick with the team that beat Warrington 24-20 in their final league game. 'It's good at this stage of the season to have a very strong squad to choose from,' Wane said.

"England international Zak Hardaker will not be charged over allegations that he made a homophobic comment in a recent Super League match. The 22-year-old Leeds full-back served a five-match ban in the summer after being found guilty of homophobic abuse of referee James Child and was investigated over claims that he made similar comments aimed towards St Helens forward Mark Flanagan last month. However, in a statement, the Rugby Football League said: 'The RFL can confirm that no further action will be taken following an investigation into an incident in the First Utility Super League fixture, Leeds Rhinos v St Helens played on Friday August 29. Leeds Rhinos full-back Zak Hardaker escapes punishment from the RFL for an alleged homophobic remark . 'Details of the investigation were presented to the RFL Match Review Panel which concluded that there was insufficient evidence for charges to be brought.' The announcement came just 24 hours after Hardaker accused the RFL of dragging its heels on the matter and claimed the uncertainty was starting to adversely affect his family. Speaking about the episode for the first time after being unveiled in the 2014 Super League Dream Team, Hardaker said: 'I would rather they just come out and say 'come to Red Hall, we've got this, this and this', and try and charge me or say they haven't got enough evidence because it's hanging over me, it's hanging over the club and, most importantly, it's hanging over my family which p***** me off more than anything.' Hardaker (left) allegedly make a homophobic comment to St Helens forward Mark Flanagan (right) Had Hardaker been charged and found guilty of the offence for a second time, he could have been given as much as an eight-match ban, which would not only have ruled him out of Leeds' bid to reach the Grand Final but scuppered his chances of playing for England in the end-of-season Four Nations campaign. Now he is clear to line up for the Rhinos in Saturday's elimination play-off tie against Catalan Dragons at Headingley and secure his place in England's final squad for the trip to Australia and New Zealand. Hardaker was thrown out of England's World Cup squad during the tournament last November for a breach of discipline and subsequently fined £2,500 by his club and warned over his future conduct. He earned widespread praise for the way he responded to the setback, producing a series of impressive displays for his club to earn a place in England coach Steve McNamara's 34-strong training squad in June. Leeds supported their player when he was banned in June and once more stood firmly behind him this time, accusing the Rugby Football League of a 'witchhunt' in their pursuit of the case.

"Omari Caro signed off his Hull KR career with a hat-trick of tries as the Robins ended the season on a high with a 42-18 rout of Wakefield. The 23-year-old former London Broncos winger, who discovered he was being released at the club’s recent end-of-season dinner, scored all his tries before half-time when the visitors held an unassailable 30-0 lead. Full-back Greg Eden marked his farewell appearance with two tries while 18-year-old winger Macauley Hallett also touched down twice to make it three tries in just two Super League appearances and makeshift scrum-half Craig Hall kicked five goals against the team he will be playing for in 2015. Omari Caro (left) scores one of his hat-trick of tries during Hull KR's 42-18 win at Wakefield in Super League . Rovers took great delight in giving co-captain Josh Hodgson a fitting send-off as he prepares to embark on a new career in Australia with Canberra Raiders and climbing two places in the final table to finish above arch rivals Hull FC. Wakefield, on the other hand, were unable to provide veteran forward Andy Raleigh with a winning send-off, although he did manage to score a rare try during a second-half revival before hanging up his boots at the final whistle. It took Caro just two minutes to open his account, taking Eden’s pass to cross at the corner but it was an even-looking contest until the Wildcats came up with the first of a series of clangers that gift-wrapped three tries to their opponents. Full-back Paul Sykes successfully gathered Travis Burns’ high kick but his wild pass intended for winger Richie Owen missed its target and Hallett struck for his first try on 17 minutes. Five minutes later, loose forward Neville Costigan put Eden through a gap on halfway and he showed a clean pair of heels to the despairing cover and Hall, who took over the goalkicking duties following Burns’ opening miss, kicked his first conversion to make it 10-0. Caro then went 90 metres after intercepting Ali Lauitiiti’s pass and completed his hat-trick a minute before half-time after collecting Eden’s perfectly-judged grubber kick. With Hallett pouncing on another Wakefield handling error to add his second, the game was over as a contest by the break. Replacement hooker Keal Carlile increased Rovers’ lead four minutes into the second half when he burrowed his way over from dummy half but Wakefield eventually stemmed the tide. Raleigh was held up over the line before centre Dean Collis opened the Wildcats’ account, collecting Tim Smith’s pinpoint grubber kick and Sykes added the goal. Eden took a short pass from Burns to register his second try on 57 minutes to make it 42-6 but Wakefield, who finish 12th in the table, restored some pride with two tries in the last 15 minutes. Winger Chris Riley took Pita Godinet’s long pass to cross at the corner, while Raleigh proved unstoppable on a rampaging solo run from 20 metres out and Sykes kicked his third conversion. Hull KR lost both Eden and his replacement at full-back Kris Welham through injury but it could not take the gloss off an impressive finish to the season.","Omari Caro scores hat-trick in last appearance for Hull KR in 42-18 win .

"Luke Gale scored four tries as Bradford Bulls bowed out of Super League in style by seeing off the London Broncos 46-36 in a thrilling contest in the capital. The battle between the two relegated sides provided a 14-try affair, with former London star Gale crossing twice in each half. The Broncos came up with six tries of their own, but were undone by two Bulls scores in the final three minutes from Gale and Manase Manuokafoa. Bradford Bulls' Luke Gale ran over four tries against London Broncos . London made two changes for the clash which included handing a debut to 18-year-old Alex Walker at full-back, while the Bulls made five changes to their line-up, including their own debutant in the shape of Emmerson Whittel. With both sides already busy preparing for life in the Championship next season, a strange air hung over The Hive ahead of kick-off. But there was nothing strange about the opening score, as Gale stepped through a handful of tackles to crash over inside four minutes. Two minutes later it was 12-0, Adam Henry breaking clear and offloading for Gale to romp home for his second score. The Broncos defence was non-existent, Joe Arundel the next to profit when he took a pass from a scrum and cantered in at the corner after 12 minutes. London sparked into some sort of life after that, getting on the board when Scott Moore’s short pass allowed skipper Matt Cook to race home midway through the half. And the hosts moved even closer after 22 minutes as Gale’s long pass was intercepted by Ben Farrar, who in turn offloaded for Joe Keyes to cross at the posts to make it 16-12. Three minutes later the Londoners were ahead, Josh Drinkwater converting his own try after good work from Keyes and Cook. By now the hosts really had their tails up, moving 24-16 ahead after 36 minutes when Erjon Dollapi showed great strength to march through three tackles to touch down. Things could have got even better for the Broncos, only for an apparent try from Oscar Thomas on the hooter to be chalked off for a knock-on. London were close again minutes into the second half as Drinkwater engineered an overlap, only for Thomas to spill as he raced clear. The respite proved brief for the Bulls though, Nick Slyney crossing for London’s fifth try from close range on 52 minutes. Bradford were struggling for answers, but threw themselves a lifeline when Foster’s kick through was seized by Brett Kearney, who grounded with inches to spare to cut the deficit to 30-22. Suddenly the jitters hit the hosts, the Bulls moving within two points when Jay Pitts surged over on 62 minutes following waves of Bradford pressure. And the visitors eased back into the lead four minutes later when Gale added his third try, rounding off a break from Foster. The tries kept coming, London rebounding to sneak into a 36-34 lead with 10 minutes to play when Drinkwater surged over for his second score after Thomas had been dragged down short of the line. Enter Gale for the decisive score, romping home at the sticks after a break from Kearney. London threw everything into a last-minute assault, only for Bradford to break away, Manuokafoa adding an eighth try for the visitors.","Gale scores four tries as Bulls beat Broncos in thrilling contest .

"Youngster Jack Logan was the hero with two late tries as Hull FC produced a stunning fightback to beat Leeds Rhinos 24-19 and finish their First Utility Super League season in style. Leeds looked on course to end a run of four straight league defeats after taking a 19-4 lead just before the hour mark but the Airlie Birds came roaring back to ensure the Rhinos head into next weekend's play-off meeting with Catalan Dragons smarting from another loss. Carl Ablett was the star of the first half - denying Richard Horne on his 387th and final appearance for the Black and Whites before going over himself to cancel out Tom Lineham's 16th-minute opener. Ryan Hall (centre) celebrates after scoring Leeds Rhinos' third try against Hull FC . Leeds lifted their game after the restart as Danny McGuire, returning from injury alongside Rob Burrow, scored a trademark try and Ryan Hall displayed his strength to score his 200th career touchdown. Ex-Leeds forward Gareth Ellis reduced the areas and then laid on a try for Fetuli Talanoa as the Airlie Birds' comeback gathered momentum. Logan ensured a nervy final 10 minutes for the Rhinos and the pressure proved too much as the 19-year-old centre won it for Hull. Moments of quality were few and far between during a dire first half. Hall tried his best to inject some life into proceedings when he collected Kevin Sinfield's kick and quickly fed Ablett, only for the back-rower's return pass to fall into Hull hands. Zak Hardaker lost the ball in contact in his own 10 metres soon after and he was duly punished as Logan picked up and gave Lineham a simple score in the corner. The Rhinos would have hit back immediately but for a brilliant tackle by Talanoa after Sinfield had found a gap from a scrum move and sent Kallum Watkins racing away. Then came a moment which the Hull faithful had been waiting for, Horne with open field in front of him and with the line at his mercy. Ablett did not read the script and chased the half-back from deep inside his own half before executing a perfectly-timed ankle tap close to his own line. The England man made a vital contribution at the other end three minutes from the break, taking a pass from Burrow 10 metres out and powering his way over. Sinfield landed the conversion and slotted over a drop goal on the hooter to give Leeds a three-point cushion at the break. McGuire is regarded as one of the best support players in rugby league and he was on hand to finish off after Watkins had pounced on a loose ball and raced downfield just after half-time. Sinfield added the extras but was off target soon after when he chose to go for goal from a penalty given for a high shot on Burrow. The miss did not prove costly as Leeds crossed a couple of sets later after quick hands from McGuire and Liam Sutcliffe created the space for Hall to finish in the corner. Hull needed to score quickly and they did through Ellis, who hacked on a Kirk Yeaman grubber kick with his knee before pouncing on the loose ball. Ellis then turned provider with an offload to Talanoa close to the Leeds line and the Hull fans raised the volume inside the KC Stadium sensing a memorable fightback, which was well and truly on when Logan took Lineham's pass to score. Rankin sent over his first conversion at the fourth attempt to make it a one-point game. Hull kept pushing roared on by their vociferous supporters and they got a moment to savour as Logan slid over in the corner.","Hull FC defeat Leeds Rhinos 24-19 to finish their First Utility Super League season in style .

"Relaxed, composed, striking just the right balance between laughs and the serious business of his lifelong ambition, Stephen Gallacher has taken to the whole Ryder Cup experience with an ease bordering on aplomb. Long may it continue, right? From sit-downs with Sir Alex to voicemails from Martin O’Neill, massive crowds for practice days to the enjoyable oddness of individual rivals sharing a team room and a common cause, there is plenty about this week that could overwhelm the average rookie. As Gallacher points out, though, he’s not exactly wet behind those trademark lugs. Ryder Cup rookie Stephen Gallacher says he's raring to go . At the age of 39, he has seen almost everything that golf has to offer. And, if this can never be described as just another tournament, the fact he comes from a real Ryder Cup family means he is as ready as any debutant could ever be. ‘I am better prepared for this now than I would have been 10 years ago,’ he said. ‘I think I am a better golfer and I feel ready for playing now, yeah. ‘You know, you try to get in the Ryder Cup, you know there’s going to be things attached to it, more media and more spotlight. If you don’t fancy that, well, there’s no point in trying to get in it. It’s just part and parcel. ‘You’re going to get people on the tee and you’re going to get expectations. The key is to just embrace that and stick to what you’ve been doing that got you here. ‘It was my lifetime ambition. It was my goal to get here. I’m proud I’m sitting here. I am very excited and it is a bit surreal still, because I live so close. Stephen Gallacher says playing on home soil will help his Ryder Cup chances . ‘I’m 39 years old. I’m not a rookie to golf. I’m maybe a rookie to the Ryder Cup, but I think having it in my home country is making it a bit easier to adapt as a rookie. ‘There was a point where I definitely thought it had passed me by. But I made a conscious effort a couple years ago to get in this one. Especially for my generation, it’s never going to be here again. ‘I think every Scot would want to be here. What’s better than to play at Gleneagles for your first one? If I could have picked it myself, I would have picked it here.’ He certainly couldn’t have chosen a more passionate gallery, with the crowds following him around his practice round on Wednesday — still 48 hours before the main event starts — bigger than anything he’ll have experienced at this venue. The fact that almost everyone outside the ropes, watching on TV or following his exploits in newspapers will be urging him on has to help, of course. Stephen Gallacher took some time out to sign autographs for fans at Gleneagles . He certainly looks far from fazed by the level of support he’s receiving from all quarters. A keen football fan, more specifically a Celtic supporter, Gallacher enjoyed Tuesday night’s pep talk from Sir Alex Ferguson as much as anyone. And almost as much as he liked getting a good-luck message from former Celtic manager O’Neill. ‘It was nice to hear Sir Alex Ferguson talk last night,’ he said. ‘I thought he was brilliant. ‘He spoke for half an hour and then we asked him some questions, and he was very candid and open. ‘Yeah, there’s bits that I definitely would take away from it, not just as a team aspect, but for progression going forward. Sir Alex Ferguson spoke with Europe's Ryder Cup team for two hours on Tuesday evening . ‘You can see why the Manchester United players respected him so much and how he won 13 titles in 21 goes. You can see his passion for the game and how much he loves football, and how much he loves the strategy and the game. ‘He misses it a bit, he said, but he’s an absolute legend in my eyes. ‘I’ve had a lot of good-luck messages, pretty much just from all my friends, and I had one from Martin O’Neill, which was nice. ‘I spoke to him a couple of times, because he’s Paul McGinley’s friend and he spoke to me at the Masters and then he sent me a voicemail. He just said: “Well done for getting in. You’ll love the team environment. Probably one of the best weeks of your life”. And he’s right, it will be.’ Gallacher obviously sought out his uncle Bernard for advice ahead of this week, revealing: ‘I spent the week with him when my gran was ill in the hospital. Stephen Gallacher sought the advice of his uncle Bernard while his gran was in hospital . ‘He was sort of chatting away, basically giving us good advice, nothing new that I’ve had from the five backroom staff or the guys on the team. Certainly he’s experienced enough, he’s played in eight, been captain three times and been vice-captain, too.’ The one thing everyone will have been talking to the new boys about is that unique experience on the first tee. Here at Gleneagles, the underpass leading to it has been painted with images of European and American legends, captain McGinley admitting he wants his players to feel ‘like gladiators entering the arena’ when they emerge into the light and noise. ‘I’m hoping I’m going to really enjoy it,’ said Gallacher, sounding just like the boy who grew up dreaming of Ryder Cup glory above any individual prize as he revealed: ‘You come under the tunnel and the last person you see is Seve. Stephen Gallacher says he's relishing the first tee at Gleneagles later this week . ‘You come up the tunnel, go up the hill and walk around — and it’s like walking into a football stadium. ‘It was full yesterday, they were 10 deep. And I hit a good drive! So, hopefully on Friday, I can just try to imagine it’s Tuesday. ‘The good thing for me is I’ve never experienced it. Your nerves are what you make them, really. ‘The first tee at the Masters was pretty good and the first tee playing at St Andrews is nice. ‘I know this is going to be tougher, but I’m hopefully going to enjoy it.’","Scotsman is relishing the first tee at Gleneagles later this week .

"Darren Clarke admits he would love to be Europe's Ryder Cup captain. The 46-year-old was in contention to be named captain for this year's contest at Gleneagles before ruling himself out of the running, with Paul McGinley appointed in January 2013. The 2016 Ryder Cup will be held at Hazeltine in Minnesota and Clarke can imagine himself leading the European team out in front of a receptive American crowd. Darren Clarke celebrates victory against the US in the 2006 Ryder Cup at the K Club . It was an emotional tournament for Clarke, coming just weeks after the death of his wife Heather . Quoted in the Daily Express, he said: 'I would love to be Ryder Cup captain. I've played in five and been involved two others and it would be a huge honour if I was to be asked at some stage. 'If they were to offer me the job I would certainly not be picky as to when it would be. 'I've always been fortunate throughout my career in that I seem to have been quite popular with the American fans. They have always been very, very good to me over there.

The unbeaten son of Starspangledbanner, winner of the Prix Morny at Deauville last time out, came through his latest canter in top shape as he builds up for a first run at seven furlongs in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp. ‘He’s in rude health at the moment, I couldn’t be happier with him,’ said Quinn (below). ‘We are just keeping him ticking over and I think you saw in his last race that another furlong is what he wants now.’ The Wow Signal (15) being ridden by Frankie Dettori breaks away to win the Coventry Stakes at Ascot .

"Trainer Ralph Beckett will not employ a new stable jockey after deciding his policy of using the best rider available will continue into next season. Beckett has booked his former No 1 Jim Crowley to ride Dutch Law at Kempton (3.10) on Monday afternoon, the first time the jockey has ridden for Beckett since abruptly ending his five-year stint in August.

"Trainer Olly Stevens has hatched an ambitious plan which could see two-year-old filly Peace And War running at the Breeders’ Cup in California next month. The daughter of sire War Front won on her Lingfield debut before finishing sixth to subsequent Group One winner Cursory Glance in the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot. She landed in Keeneland yesterday.

"Owner Frank Gillespie’s magnificent 2014 Flat season has got even better after Louis The Pious carried his green silks to yet another big win with a two-and-three-quarter-length victory from Minalisa in the Ayr Gold Cup. Irishman Gillespie has only six horses, split between north Yorkshire trainers Kevin Ryan and David O’Meara. His Ryan-trained The Grey Gatsby has won two Group One races – the French Derby and Irish Champion Stakes – while O’Meara-trained That Is The Spirit landed a Listed race at the Epsom Derby meeting. James Doyle celebrates riding Louis The Pious to victory in the The William Hill Ayr Gold Cup . Now Louis The Pious, successful in the Buckingham Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, has added to that haul with Scotland’s biggest Flat race. Success for the 10-1 shot also capped a fine day for jockey James Doyle, who had earlier landed the Ayr Silver Cup on Roger Charlton-trained Huntsmans Close and the QTS Nursery on Richard Hannon’s Power Play. Louis The Pious had finished second in the Ayr Gold Cup 12 months ago. His win also continued the run of success at the meeting for horses drawn in high stands’ side starting stalls. O’Meara, who two weeks earlier had landed his first Group One race with G Force in the Haydock Sprint Cup, said: ‘Sometimes he can run an indifferent kind of race but on his day he's very good, as we saw at Royal Ascot. These big-field handicaps bring the best out of him.’ Owner Frank Gillespie’s magnificent 2014 Flat season has got even better after the win . Gillespie’s golden season might not be over yet. The Grey Gatsby may face a re-match with Aidan O’Brien’s dual Derby Australia in the Champion Stakes at Ascot on October 18, providing Ryan does not feel the ground is too soft. The score between the pair stands as 1-1 with The Grey Gatsby’s Irish Champion win avenging his defeat in the International Stakes at York. A bad day for the bookmakers was compounded when Ralph Beckett-trained well-backed Air Pilot ran out a heavily-eased three and three-quarter length winner of the Dubai Duty Free Handicap at Newbury.

"Bookmakers believe a low draw will not be a disadvantage to favourite Watchable in the Ayr Gold Cup as trainer David O'Meara runs the gelding six days after he landed a valuable sprint at the Curragh. High stands' side stalls were most popular at the draw but Watchable, brother to John Gosden's 2008 1,000 Guineas fourth Infallible, landed stall five.

"Jump jockey Richie McGrath is facing a ban of up to 10 years after being hit with corruption charges by the BHA. The 38-year-old, whose most prestigious win came in the 2003 Scottish Grand National on Ryalux, faces allegations that he passed on privileged inside information used for betting purposes and, most seriously, that this information came with the knowledge that McGrath would not ride his mounts on their merits to ensure either they did not win or were placed. The BHA investigation covers 57 races from October 2009 until March 2012. Jockey Richie McGrath has been investigated over allegations of corruption and could face a ban . McGrath hasn’t ridden since suffering a back fracture in a fall at Hexham on March 13. The BHA has also served corruption charges on former trainer Kate Walton, McGrath’s mother-in-law, and five other licenced owners accused placing Lay Bets on Walton-trained Rumble of Thunder who figures in six of the races under scrutiny. Central to this group is Mark Aspey, described in one report as a ‘professional gambler who makes his living betting in-running on Betfair.’ The highest profile horse he has owned is Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Ascot and Cheltenham winner Ackertac. A statement issued on behalf of McGrath by his legal team said: ‘Richie is shocked and bitterly disappointed to be facing charges, but vigorously maintains his innocence and intends to fight to clear his name, however financially straining that may be.‘ . However, this case yet again highlights the vast imbalance in resources between the prosecuting authority and those who have to defend themselves, often with their livelihood at stake. ‘A fair hearing demands a level playing field, but these cases are rarely played out on such a surface.’ McGrath has stood down from his position as a Board member of the Professional Jockeys Association.

"Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti has said he would consider rehiring disgraced football star Ray Rice. In a press conference on Monday he said that 'five years down the line' he could see him bringing Rice back, believing he could redeem himself. He also said of Ray and his wife Janay, 'I think they're going to be two very successful members of our community in the years to come.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti (above) is saying he would possibly rehire Ray Rice 'five years down the line' Praise: Bisciotti also said he believes Rice and his wife Jany (above) will become 'two very successful members of our community in the years to come' Rice was terminated by the Ravens earlier this month when video emerged of him punching his wife in an Atlantic City casino elevator. This comes on the same day the Ravens denied claims made in a report that  they knew about Rice's violent domestic assault hours after the incident occurred, and then pleaded with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to go easy on the wife-beater. Bisciotti and members of the team refuted 15 of the claims made in a recent ESPN report in an eight-page statement, which is addressed to fans of the team. Gone: Rice (above with Bisciotti) was terminated from the Ravens in early September, after only receiving an initial suspension of two games following reports he hit his then-fiancée in an Atlantic City elevator . Bisciotti also stated that those who spoke with ESPN's Outside the Lines were 'sources [who] work for Ray,' and that much of the information they gave was 'manufactured.' He believes Rice is using his friends to talk to the media in hopes of building up a case for reinstatement. ESPN reported last week that the Ravens head of security Darren Sanders was told about the incident, and video, involving Rice and his then-fiancée Janay Palmer by a local police officer just hours after it happened, and then immediately described the event in detail to team executives. They also said these claims had been corroborated by team officials, current and former league officials, NFL Players' Association representatives and associates, and advisers and friends of Rice. In their statement released on Monday, the Ravens disputed all of these facts. Sanders said that he did not see the tape, and actually had to ask the Atlantic City Police Department for a copy days after the incident. After they refused to send him a tape, one officer did describe to him the events happening in the elevator, but not as they were later seen when the tape was released to the public earlier this month. 'As he described it, Janay appeared to initiate the altercation, but they both spit at and struck each other, resulting in Janay falling and hitting her head against the wall railing,' said Sanders. 'The officer could not tell from the video whether Ray slapped or punched her, but Ray told me very clearly that he did not punch her.' Denied: Bisciotti (second from left) also shot down claims he asked NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (second from right, presenting Bisciotti with the Lombardi Trophy in 2013) to go easy on Rice following the incident . They next took on claims that Goodell went easy on Rice as a favor to his close friend Bisciotti. 'I did not ask Roger Goodell to give Ray Rice no more than a two-game suspension,' said Bisciotti. 'I did not make any request for a ""favor"" or any particular outcome.' He then stated of his relationship with Goodell, 'The two of us have spent very little time together - as I recall, one round of golf and one dinner several years ago.' He did however admit that team executives did fail when they did not push harder to get a copy of the tape. Later in the day, during a news conference, Bisciotti said, ""The majority of the sources [from the report] are people that work for Ray. Almost everything in there is anonymous, but it's clear from the subject matter that it's Ray's attorney, it's Ray's agent, it's Ray's friends.' According to ESPN, he then said that a significant amount of the information in the story was 'manufactured' by members of Rice's camp. Josh Krulewitz, ESPN's vice president of communications, went on Twitter on Monday afternoon following the Ravens statement and Bisciotti's news conference to say, 'We stand by our reporting.'","Ray Rice got a little good news on Monday when Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said he would possibly rehire the football star 'down the line'

Sunderland . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet faces a series of difficult decisions ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Burnley. The Uruguayan has no significant injury doubts as he looks for a first league win of the campaign and, as a result, needs to decide whether or not to change the side which started last Saturday's 2-2 draw with Tottenham. Jordi Gomez (left) is pushing for starting place in Sunderland's XI against Burnley on Saturday . Defender Billy Jones and midfielders Will Buckley and Jordi Gomez are among those men pushing for starting berths, although Poyet has indicated striker Connor Wickham, who was effective as a lone striker last weekend, will retain the role.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Burnley have won just one of the last 12 matches in all competitions against Sunderland (W1 D5 L6). Steven Fletcher represented Burnley on the last occasion these sides met (2009/10); he remains Burnley’s leading Premier League scorer (eight goals). No team has scored fewer goals than Burnley so far (1) in the Premier League this season. The Clarets have drawn their last two games 0-0. The last team to draw three games 0-0 in a row were their rivals Blackburn in December 2009. Three of Sunderland’s four Premier League games this season have been 1-1 at half-time. Sunderland striker Connor Wickham has failed to score in his last seven Premier League games . After his flurry of five goals in three games to help Sunderland stay up last season, Connor Wickham has now gone seven Premier League games without one. Sunderland are yet to win (three points from four games) in 2014-15 - last season they took only one point from their opening eight PL games. Sunderland are one of three teams yet to keep a clean sheet this season (along with Arsenal and West Ham). Jack Rodwell is the only Premier League player to have been subbed off in all four games this season. Sunderland have lost only one of their last five Premier League away games (W2 D2 L1).","Burnley host Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Crystal Palace have never won a game at home in the Premier League in September, losing five and drawing four. Sean Dyche admitted Burnley need to improve in the final third if they are to start winning in the Premier League. They squandered a gilt-edged opportunity to get a first victory since returning to the top tier when Scott Arfield’s tame 84th-minute penalty was palmed away by Julian Speroni. Scott Arfield has his penalty saved as Burnley again failed to find the back of the net in the Premier League . Julian Speroni's save meant that Burnley have still only scored once in their five games this season . Arfield, the scorer of his team’s only goal in five league and cup games this season, was given full backing by Dyche, who conceded there was a lack of ‘clarity and quality’ from his strike force. ‘It’s just small details,’ said Dyche. ‘That’s why the people at the front of the pitch usually drive the big cars and leave for about £50m, because they find ways of breaking teams down.’ Burnley manager Sean Dyche knows his side need a bit more quality in the forward areas .","Burnley have scored just one goal in their first four league games .

"Burnley are set to be without their two top strikers, Danny Ings and Sam Vokes, for at least a month. Last season’s 26-goal top scorer Ings is expected to be sidelined for four weeks after suffering a hamstring injury at Crystal Palace last weekend. And manager Sean Dyche dismissed reports suggesting that Vokes, who weighed in with another 21 goals as Burnley won promotion, is close to returning from the knee ligament injury he suffered in March. ‘It’s factually wrong,’ said the Burnley boss. ‘Sam’s just on his way back. There’s certainly no rush on him. He’s out on the grass and moving nicely, but he’ll be under no pressure from us. Danny Ings is out for at least a month with a hamstring injury as Burnley operate with their top strikers . Ings has a 'straightforward hamstring injury', says Burnley boss Sea Dyche . ‘I’m not thinking that he’s thinking he’s going to be ready in the next month, because he’s not. Sam Vokes is not close to a return from a knee ligament injury, says Dyche . ‘With Danny, it’s a straightforward hamstring injury. It will heal naturally but we won’t put a timescale on it. We thought it was that but I’m just pleased that scans showed something straightforward.’ The Clarets are still waiting for their first win of the season after drawing at Crystal Palace last weekend when Scott Arfield had a late penalty saved. With Ings and Vokes sidelined, Dyche said that it will be up to the players who takes the next one. ‘Normally the players (decide) amongst themselves,’ he added. ‘Last year with Ings and Vokes, it was deemed that if one got tumbled over he took the penalty. But they both practised them. Scott Arfield practises them. ‘You could tell from his whole body language last week that he was desperate to take it. He struck it well but the keeper made a great save. ‘You’ve got to look at the people who want to take them. I’m not going to demand someone takes them. I took one once and I didn’t want to take it, so I don’t put anyone under pressure.’ Despite the winless start, Dyche insists that spirits remain high at Turf Moor as they prepare to face Sunderland at home on Saturday. ‘It’s never a question of morale here, that’s always good,’ he said. ‘We’re close to getting our first win. We’ve arguably deserved one and haven’t got one. The performance levels are good but I’m not naive, we’ve got to win games. Crystal Palace keeper Julian Speroni brilliantly saves a penalty from Burnley's Scott Arfield . ‘I’m only human. Of course you want to lay your head down on Saturday with your first win and three points are in the bag. ‘But it’s the reality, the Premier League, a step up, a hard task. We delivered a very good performance and missed a penalty, that’s the obvious one. But it’s nip and tuck and some games are like that. It was a good point away from home – we can’t be too greedy. ‘I put enough pressure on myself so outside opinion is not something I find too taxing. We don’t want to be here for fluff – “oh good old Burnley” – we want to achieve things. Last year was promotion, this year is different. We’re all learning and developing.’","Danny Ings has a 'straightforward hamstring injury,' says Sean Dyche .

"Neil Warnock is still aiming to add to his Crystal Palace backroom staff despite bringing in Ronnie Jepson and Kevin Blackwell. The new Eagles boss is targeting one more addition to complete his Selhurst Park coaching line-up. Blackwell has arrived to fulfil a watching brief, similar to the role Gerry Francis played under Tony Pulis. Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock hopes to add to his coaching staff following move back to Selhurst Park . Warnock, speaking to first team coach Ronnie Jepson before Palace's game against Everton, has made a good start to life back at the south London outfit . The Crystal Palace has brought in coaches Kevin Blackwell (left) and Ronnie Jepson (right) Palace host Newcastle in Capital One Cup action on Wednesday, with Warnock warning his side to expect the visitors to be fired up by continued Tyneside unrest. United boss Alan Pardew has clung onto his job despite widespread protests from supporters calling for his head during Saturday's 2-2 home Premier League draw with Hull. Warnock now expects Newcastle to put in a strong showing in south London as his friend Pardew fights for his future. 'It will mean a lot to Alan, they are fighting on all fronts up there,' Warnock told talkSPORT. Keen to hand fringe players the opportunity to impress against Newcastle, Warnock will resist wholesale changes after Sunday's 3-2 league victory at Everton. The former Sheffield United boss is hoping for summer recruit Brede Hangeland to take his chance to shine as he continues to settle following his Fulham switch. Brede Hangeland is expected to feature against Newcastle after losing his place to Damien Delaney . Former Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen remains a part of Warnock's coaching set up . The former Norway captain questioned sacked Fulham boss Felix Magath's methods this week, but Warnock hailed Hangeland as the model professional. 'I've got to see some players play, so we've got to give people chances,' said Warnock. 'Brede's such a gentleman: when he arrived at the club he said to me ""gaffer you won't have any problems from me, I'll work hard and I'm here for you"". 'He's such a gentleman like I say and he's a real pro. 'So I'm looking forward to seeing him play on Wednesday.' New backroom additions Jepson and Blackwell both played under Warnock at Huddersfield, with the new Eagles manager turning to trusted lieutenants in his second south London stint. Despite Warnock's coaching reorganisation Keith Millen is still expected to remain at the club.

"Mohamed Diame has credited the blistering start to his Hull career with a return to his favoured position. Diame was a deadline day signing from West Ham, costing the Tigers £3.5million, and has already set about repaying manager Steve Bruce's faith. The Senegalese scored a fine solo effort against his former club on debut and followed up with a fierce long-range strike in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Newcastle, success the 27-year-old puts down to a familiar central position. Hull midfielder Mohamed Diame, scoring a fine goal at Newcastle on Saturday, has impressed in the centre . 'I am in a different position to West Ham,' he told the Hull Daily Mail. 'I was a winger there. I am now back in midfield where I have played all my life. West Ham is a great club and the fans were always behind me. But I am not a winger. 'I have goal targets, too, and playing as a winger meant I couldn't meet that target. I like Hull as a club. I can see myself doing well here.' Diame celebrates with the Hull squad after his fierce long-range strike at St James' Park during the 2-2 draw . The Senegalese midfielder is relieved to be playing back in the centre for Hull having played wide for West Ham . Diame also paid personal tribute to Bruce's man-management, adding: 'The manager is good for me. He gives me confidence and I want to pay that back. I like playing for people who believe in you. 'I have been happy with my performance. I have the confidence of the gaffer and am trying to give him everything back. 'Football is all about confidence and when you have people who believe in you then you play well.'

"After Leicester got some help from Buddhist monks ahead of their incredible 5-3 comeback against Manchester United, which other teams have gone to extreme lengths for an extra boost? SOUTHAMPTON’S WITCH HUNT . Southampton didn’t win a game at St. Mary’s for three months until Cerridwen Dragonoak Connelly, a Pagan witch, performed a cleansing ceremony. Manager Gordon Strachan said: ‘If she’s that good she can take training for the next two weeks and I can get on with my golf while she gets rid of the ghosts.’ Leicester players were blessed by Thai monks ahead of their shock 5-3 victory over Manchester United . Jamie Vardy celebrates after scoring against the former Premier League champions at the KP Stadium . DERBY’S CUP CONUNDRUM . When Derby moved to the Baseball Ground, the evicted Romani gypsies said the team would never win the FA Cup. They lost three finals in six years but in 1946, club captain Jack Nicholas paid for it to be lifted. At 1-1 in the final against Charlton the ball burst, the moment the curse was seen to end, and Derby won 4-1. Derby captain Jack Nicholas (top) paid for a gypsy curse to be lifted before he raised the FA Cup . BIRMINGHAM’S WEE PROBLEM . More gypsy trouble, this time for Birmingham. When they moved to St Andrews in 1906 they were cursed by the displaced gypsies, with some radical solutions taken trying to remove it. In the 1980s, Ron Saunders put crucifixes on the floodlights and painted the soles of the players’ boots red. Barry Fry took a different approach in the 1990s. He said: ‘We went three months without winning... We were desperate, so I p****d in all four corners, holding it in while I waddled round the pitch. Did it work? Well, we started to win and I thought it had, then they f*****g sacked me, so probably not.’ Barry Fry used unconventional means to get Birmingham's season up and running before getting the sack . DEAD HERRINGS . After a referee was criticised in a Norwegian division two derby, he cursed one team to relegation. They started to lose matches they dominated and despite the coach sacrificing some herrings on a special stone, they were duly relegated. CURSE OF THE BAMBINO . When Babe Ruth - the Bambino - moved from the Boston Red Sox to the New York Yankees in 1919, they failed to win the World Series for 86 years. Attempts to break the curse included putting a Red Sox cap on Mount Everest and hiring professional exorcists to purify their ground, Fenway Park. The Boston Red Sox tried exorcists to return to winning ways after losing legendary Babe Ruth . SUFFERING SOCCEROOS . In 1969, some Australian footballers asked a witch-doctor to help them win their game against Rhodesia in Mozambique. After he planted some bones near the posts and Australia won 3-1, he demanded $1,000 for his services. When they couldn’t pay up he cursed them. Though Australia qualified for the 1974 World Cup, they didn’t again until 2006 and only then after an Australian comic reversed the curse in Africa by having sacrificial chicken blood spattered over him on the same pitch. CURSE OF THE BILLY GOAT . In 1945, the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern in Chicago was refused entry to a Cubs baseball game because his pet goat, who he bought a ticket for, stank. Cameroon assistant coach is arrested after making bad juju at the African Cup of Nations . He was so outraged he cursed the club and they have not won a National League pennant or World Series since. Attempts to break it have included sacrificing goats and giving goats to families in developing countries. DUBIOUS JUJU . Juju, or witchcraft, has featured at the African Cup of Nations several times and in 2002 Cameroon’s head coach and goalkeeping coach were arrested by riot police for putting a magic charm on the pitch before the semi-final.","Leicester players were blessed by Buddhist monks ahead of their incredible 5-3 comeback win Manchester United .

"Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is confident there is much more to come from his new boys as he attempts to convince dissenting supporters this new season can yet be one of promise. It was one of Pardew's longer-serving players who came to the rescue in his hour of need on Saturday when Papiss Cisse climbed from the bench for the first time since April and dragged the manager back from the point of no return in the eyes of his critics to snatch a 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw with Hull. Remy Cabella, a £7million summer signing from Montpellier, has yet to score for Newcastle United . On Wednesday night, the 53-year-old and his players will turn their attention to the Capital One Cup and a third round trip to Crystal Palace in a game which will give them some respite from the battle to lift the club from the foot of the league table. Just what team Pardew selects remains to be seen with the men above him having made it clear that it is the Premier League, and not the domestic cup competitions, which is the priority, but if £7million summer signing Remy Cabella is involved, his manager will hope he builds upon his most encouraging display yet against Hull. Pardew said: 'I was really pleased with Cabella. He's such an important player for us with Siem [de Jong] out, and I don't think up until now he has really produced a performance which warrants his tag, the money we have spent. Emmanuel Riviere has also found the transition to the Premier League difficult . 'But I really felt he showed the character, he showed the quality that really buoyed me, if I am honest, that has buoyed me a little bit going into the next game.' Former Montpellier midfielder Cabella, 24, was one of nine men to join the Magpies during the close season with Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles immediately being loaned back to Nottingham Forest. He, like Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere, has been thrown straight in at the deep end and the pair have found the transition to Premier League challenging to say the least. Newcastle United protest group 'SackPardew.com' have parodied owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct logo . Newcastle's lack of senior frontmen has seen Riviere start all six games to date and with little support, he is still awaiting his first competitive goal for the club. However, Pardew is hopeful that Cisse's return from injury will help to take the weight off the 24-year-old Frenchman. He said: 'I feel some sympathy for Manu because he has had to carry the shirt and he's not ready to carry that shirt yet full-time. 'It's a shirt that is heavy and I think he has seen an example from Papiss to take that chance to make that little movement in the box. Newcastle travel to Crystal Palace in the third round of the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night . 'Manu will learn from that, and it gives me the opportunity with Papiss coming back to fitness to rest Manu and for him to understand what it is to play at a big club like this. 'He's only 24, Riviere, and really and truly, we have had too much responsibility on him.' Pardew has the advantage of his side not playing again in the league until they head for Stoke next Monday evening, although he is likely to make several changes for the game at Selhurst Park and having admitted Cisse should not really have played at the weekend, he has a decision to make over whether or not to use him this time around. It will be the second time the sides have met already this season with substitute Wilfried Zaha's injury-time strike at St James' Park on August 30 securing a point for Neil Warnock's men from a game in which they had twice led before going 3-2 down with normal time almost up.","Both Emmanuel Riviere and Remy Cabella have found it hard adjusting to life in the Premier League .

"David Nugent thinks Leicester have signed one of the bargains of the season in Leonardo Ulloa. Eyebrows were raised when Leicester broke their transfer record to sign Ulloa from Brighton in the summer. The Foxes paid an initial £8million fee, which could rise to £10million, for the striker even though he had just one season of experience in English football before moving to the King Power Stadium. Leonardo Ulloa of Leicester City scores his team's fifth goal from the penalty spot against Man United . David De Gea (left) can only watch as Ulloa (right) scores Leicester's first goal of five on Sunday afternoon . The 28-year-old has had no problems adapting to the top flight, though. On Sunday he took his tally to five goals in five matches with a well-taken brace in the shock win over Manchester United. Given that Diego Costa, who cost Chelsea four times as much, is the only man to have scored more goals than Ulloa this season, Nugent thinks the acquisition of his Leicester team-mate is proving to be a shrewd bit of business by the east midlands club. 'Leo has been a revelation so far,' said Nugent, who scored a penalty in the hugely impressive 5-3 win. 'He has come in from Brighton and he has scored lots of goals. At £8million he has turned out to be a bargain.' Bookmakers have cut the odds on Ulloa topping the scoring charts at the end of the season from 80-1 to 33-1.

Nigel Pearson's side, who won the Championship last year, have taken eight points from five matches. Given that they have already played Arsenal, Chelsea and 20-time champions United, the Foxes are taking delight in silencing their doubters. 'When the fixtures came out, with the start we were given, no one expected us to get any points, so we are proving everyone wrong,' said Nugent, who has played in the top flight before with Portsmouth. 'They can write us off all they want, but we know in this squad we have the spirit, the energy, and the players to cause teams problems as we showed against Manchester United.' The Foxes lost two and won 17 of their 23 matches at home last season. Now Leicester are looking to make teams fear coming to the King Power Stadium this season.

"Swansea boss Garry Monk has often said that his former manager Roberto Martinez is always at the other end of a telephone if he ever wants a catch-up or chat about the pitfalls of management. But rookie manager Monk admits there has been no time to talk this week ahead of Everton's visit to the Liberty Stadium in the third round of the Capital One cup on Tuesday night. Everton's busy schedule of domestic and European commitments, Monk says, has put paid to the usual conversations between two men who shared the same remarkable journey as Swansea rose through the divisions of English football. Garry Monk often looks to Roberto Martinez for advice, but the Spaniard has been too busy of late . 'I've not had any contact with Roberto this week as he has been very busy with lots of games,' Monk said ahead of their third reunion since the 35-year-old took over at Swansea last February. 'It's always great to see him. I know him very well and I know he will want to win the game like I will want to win the game. 'It will be a good cup tie - it will be an interesting one. 'We are at home, I am sure the fans will be right up for it and hopefully we can get the right result.' Swansea suffered a 1-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday after record signing Wilfried Bony was  sent off . Everton also lost at the weekend, going down 3-2 against Crystal Palace at Goodison Park on Sunday . The two men were team-mates when Monk joined Swansea in 2004 and three years later the centre-back was Martinez's captain when the Spaniard took his first steps in management in south Wales. Martinez later moved on to Wigan and then Everton, where he has enjoyed notable success by taking the Merseyside club back into Europe following last season's fifth-placed finish in the Premier League. He also managed two Goodison Park victories over Monk last season while his friend was in caretaker control at Swansea, 3-1 in a fifth-round FA Cup tie in February and 3-2 in a Premier League game the following month. Monk would love to redress the balance on Tuesday and admits he would also enjoy another cup run after Swansea won the Capital One cup two seasons ago. Monk played for Swansea between 2004 and 2014, and was a team-mate of Martinez's until he left in 2006 . Martinez and Monk will go head-to-head on Tuesday when Swansea host Everton at the Liberty Stadium . 'The cup always ranks high and it would be nice to go on a run,' Monk said. 'We also want to bounce back because we lost to Southampton on Saturday and it would be nice to try to make sure we don't lose the next one.' Swansea have actually never beaten Everton in their history, a total of 20 games which have brought 15 wins for the Toffees and five draws. 'We know how Roberto sets up and he knows how we set up,' said Swansea defender Neil Taylor. 'We have played against them a lot of times now and they will always be good games, but hopefully we can come out on top this time because their record here is something we need to put right. 'Everton are a good footballing side but we won the League Cup a couple of years ago and know how good it can be.'","Garry Monk played under Roberto Martinez when the Spaniard managed Swansea between 2007 and 2009 .

"At times during the summer, Southampton looked like a club recently visited by Vikings. The fact they now sit inside the top four has shocked even their own players, with Morgan Schneiderlin admitting he never imagined they would recover so quickly from such drastic surgery. It was telling, also, that the Frenchman claimed: 'I’m happy here, I’m fully focused on Southampton and there is no problem'. It's some statement from a player who pouted about being kept in the summer when other leading lights were getting big moves elsewhere. Victor Wanyama strikes for Southampton after they had struggled for 41 minutes against ten men . Morgan Schneiderlin tackles Swansea's Jefferson Montero as Southampton continued their strong start . But Southampton's run of three Premier League wins has lifted much of the gloom, even if the latest in that streak was arguably their weakest performance of the season. Southampton laboured for 41 minutes against 10 men before Victor Wanyama scored the 80th-minute winner and gave Ronald Koeman cause to remind supporters 'it is very early in the season'. Schneiderlin has been here before, having started last season strongly, but believes it is key that the new squad make a better fist of the winter fixtures. He said: 'It’s a surprise to have got off to the best ever start in the league after going through so many changes in the summer. Schneiderlin wanted to leave Southampton over the summer but now says he is happy to be at the club . Southampton have failed to score in only one of their past 16 league away games. 'The coaching staff changed, a lot of players left so of course it’s great for us to be in such a good position after five games, but it’s only five games of a long season and we need to keep going. 'We had a very good start last year as well but it was difficult after going through a hard time in December and after that it was difficult to get back up the league. We’re going to try to be stronger in that period.' He added: 'The group is closer after the summer, a lot of people were saying that Southampton would struggle this season because we lost so many players. Wilfried Boney is sent off for a second bookable offence handing the momentum to the Saints . 'But we got together as a group after the transfer window shut and we said, “Right lads, it’s us now, we’re going to spend this year together and we need to show everyone that is doubting us that we can do something great”. We are doing it so far.' Swansea manager Garry Monk was left bemused by referee Jonathan Moss, even if he did not object to Wilfried Bony's red card. He said: 'His (Moss) performance, in terms of consistency on his decisions was very, very poor, extremely poor. In terms of consistency, it blew my mind at times.' Garry Monk did not disagree with the decision but described the referee's overall performance as 'very poor'","Southampton beat 10-man Swansea 1-0 to go second in the Premier League .

"West Brom head coach Alan Irvine insists he is ready to make the big decisions after axing Swedish defender Jonas Olsson from his starting line-up. The Baggies chief warned he is prepared to drop any under-performing players ahead of Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash with Hull. Olsson's errors had cost goals against Swansea and Everton, and he was replaced by Joleon Lescott in Sunday's 1-0 Barclays Premier League win at Tottenham. West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has dropped Swedish defender Jonas Olsson after a series of mistakes . Irvine celebrates West Brom's first win of the season against Tottenham . Irvine has a fully-fit squad available after previously struggling with injuries and can now shape his team. 'It wasn't easy telling Jonas what I intended to do,' he told the club's official site. 'I have huge respect for him. He is a top professional and a very, very good player, but he has made a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes which have proved costly in the last couple of games. 'I have a full range of choices for the first time and I had to look a couple of people in the eye and tell them they were not playing. It is never pleasant but it is part of the job. 'And you can be absolutely certain that Jonas will remain a very important member of the squad.' Olsson could be recalled for the visit of the Tigers, with Irvine considering changes. Silvestre Varela could also be involved after he scored in the Baggies' Under-21 win over Brighton on Monday. The Porto loanee is yet to make his debut as he has not been match fit and fellow new boys Georgios Samaras and Sebastian Blanco are also on stand-by. Lescott, who signed in June after leaving Manchester City, is likely to be rested after almost two months recovering from a knee injury before making his debut on Sunday.

'I keep trying to explain that we want to put people in the team but they have to be ready. 'We already had a setback with him in the pre-season friendly at Forest but we felt he was ready this week.

"Ronny Deila  has sought to defuse a perceived rift with Neil Lennon by insisting he’s got no issue with the way his Parkhead predecessor managed his players. The Norwegian has ordered his squad to eat lunch together at Lennoxtown, has imposed a ban on fizzy drinks and has ordered his players to reduce their body fat. Such changes were perceived by some as a slight on the previous regime – with Lennon hitting back on a radio interview over the weekend. Ronny Deila attempted to diffuse the perceived rift with his Celtic predecessor Neil Lennon . Without specifically mentioning Deila by name, Lennon stated: ‘All you hear now is that you need to ban chips, tomato sauce, fizzy drinks. Yeah, because that makes them better players. ‘It’s disrespectful when a new manager comes in and immediately says: “The players aren’t fit enough”.’ Deila, however, yesterday sought to clarify his position and stressed that striving to do things differently didn’t necessarily imply a criticism of the way things were done before. ‘I inherited a champion team so I never said anything to make that performance bad,’ he stated. Neil Lennon dismissed measures such as banning chips and fizzy drinks saying it didn't make players better . ‘What I meant is you get in some new players and you also have players who have been out injured, had surgeries and come back again — there is always room for improvements. ‘As he says as well, there are different ways to look at things and, for me, we still have a job to do to get the players fitter. That’s nothing about what has gone here before because that was great, he did fantastically well and I think I have been respectful all the time. I’m a big fan of what he has done before.’ With his side sitting fourth in the Scottish Premiership and having won just one of their past seven matches in all competitions, Deila intends playing the strongest possible team against Hearts in the League Cup tomorrow. And, despite growing suggestions that Leigh Griffiths is poised to rejoin Hibs on loan after being omitted from the squad which faced Motherwell, Deila reiterated his desire to hold on to the striker. Deila's side will face Hearts at Parkhead mid-week while Rangers will have to overcome Falkirk . On interest from Hibs, Deila said: ‘I know there’s been interest but we haven’t agreed on anything but we’ll see what is happening.’ Asked if he would consider allowing the player to leave, he replied: ‘We’ll see how it goes. ‘There haven’t been any real talks between the clubs. Leigh is playing games here and he’s fighting for a place in the starting 11. We want him here.’ Pressed on what the player needed to do to force his way back into his match-day squads, Deila replied: ‘He needs to show himself in training, work hard every day and take his chances when he gets them, same as everybody else.’ However, when asked if Griffiths would be in his squad tomorrow, the manager answered: ‘We’ll see.’ Hibs boss Alan Stubbs yesterday branded fresh talk of a loan return for Griffiths as ‘just speculation’. But he refused to deny on-going interest in the unsettled Celtic striker and admitted he remains on the look-out for ‘someone who could really make a difference’. Kris Commons scored a second-half penalty against Motherwell to earn a point at the weekend . With Hibs’ worrying start to the season continuing after Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Queen of the South, the suggestion that a third loan spell for Griffiths at Easter Road is imminent refuses to go away. However, speaking ahead of tonight’s League Cup trip to face Premiership strugglers Ross County, Stubbs said: ‘I don’t want to speak about players that are not mine. Is that me ducking it? No, I can’t comment on someone else’s player. ‘Obviously, there’s speculation but, as far as I’m aware, it’s just speculation. I don’t know where it’s come from. ‘But, especially with it being my former club, it would be very disrespectful for me to speak about a player who’s not even ours. Leight Griffiths could be set for a loan move back to Hibs after struggling for game time at Celtic . ‘If it was someone we thought could really make a difference, then I think the board would be very supportive. ‘Obviously, you’ve got a player who’s not playing and people are putting two and two together and making six. I want to really focus on Ross County and not on something that’s got nothing to do with me.’ Saturday’s loss was Hibs fourth of the league campaign and leaves them a massive 10 points adrift of undefeated rivals Hearts. It leaves question marks hanging over the new regime being built by Stubbs under new chief executive Leeann Dempster, but the former Celtic and Everton defender insisted he had steeled himself for the pressures of management. ‘Pressure? I believe in what I’m doing,’ he said. ‘Yes, obviously I believe the results need to keep getting better, but from a pressure point of view I believe in the players. And, as long as they keep seeing me believing, it will turn.’","Ronny Deila banned  fizzy drinks for Celtic players .

"John Collins has challenged Ronny Deila’s critics to do their worst - insisting the new Celtic boss will cope with whatever stick comes his way. The Norwegian is under pressure to dump Championship leaders Hearts out the League Cup at Parkhead after winning just five of his first 12 competitive games. Three months into the job, the former Stromsgodset coach has still to establish a settled, winning starting 11. John Collins believes Ronny Deila is capable of dealing with whatever comes his way . But No 2 Collins says Deila is equipped to deal with the demands of the job following an intense three-month induction period. ‘I’ve no doubt about that,’ said Collins. ‘That goes with the job, I’ve no doubt he can deal with that. You can slaughter him all you want. ‘I don’t think he’s changed, he’s just getting to know it and that takes time when you go into the new job. You’re constantly assessing staff, players, looking at opponents, and as you go along you learn. ‘That’s what he’s doing and I think he’s loving it. ‘He’s settled in 100 per cent and is very comfortable in the job now. He knows everything about what’s happening now, he knows the players inside out, the staff, getting a feel for the club. ‘That’s three months now and he’s nice and comfortable. He’s very intelligent, very motivated, he likes to win, hates to lose so that’s good assets to have.’ A Celtic player in the 1990s, Collins says the infrastructure and demands of the club have multiplied since his first spell there. Deila has struggled to get Celtic playing consistently since arriving three months ago . Deila has already confessed to being overwhelmed by the level of public attention, but Collins insisted: ‘He did his research. You can talk about it but until you’ve actually felt it and been around the place you don’t realise how big it is. Walking around the city now is not quite like walking around his home town in Norway. ‘That takes a bit of getting used to I’d imagine. Celtic fans are everywhere, want to speak to you, love you, so it’s a big part of the job. ‘There’s not many clubs like Celtic in the world and not many cities like Glasgow when it comes to football. But he’s thriving in it, getting used to it, loving it. ‘Celtic have moved up unbelievable amounts since the day I left. The training ground is state of the art, everything you could wish for as a coach, a player. ‘I think it’s a better job now - you’ve got everything at your disposal, haven’t you?’ Celtic have under-performed in the domestic cup competitions in recent seasons, and Deila has already vowed to do better in the League and Scottish Cups. Leigh Griffiths has been linked with a move back to Hibs after struggling for form at Celtic . The League Cup remains a consistent source of failure for the club, an embarrassing home defeat to Morton last season illustrating the difficulties of motivating themselves for the competition. Acknowledging the likelihood of a poor crowd this evening, however, Collins said there are no excuses for falling down in a competition he won as manager of Hibs. ‘I was at the Hearts game on Saturday and I was impressed with what I saw. They are playing good football, passing and moving, and they have good young players with a mixture of experience as well, so we know it will be a tough game. ‘They already know Hearts are a good team. I’ve reported back that they are good players, playing with confidence and are top of their league. They have what I’d call Premiership throughout their team. ‘But we want to win every trophy this season. That’s the target and the League Cup is the first one we can win. Deila's side face Hearts at Parkhead mid-week in the League Cup, and Celtic are under pressure to perform . ‘I don’t think it will be difficult to motivate the players at all. They know how important every match is here. ‘Previously, we might have put weakened teams out in this cup but the manager has stated he wants to win every trophy domestically. ‘As coaches, we have to get the team fired up and when they get out on that pitch, they have to be very professional. I’ve no doubt they will be. They’ll be on their toes and ready to get a result. There won’t be a huge crowd but the players have to be switched on. ‘We are not giving excuses before the game. The bottom line is it is a big game and if we want to win the cup, we have to win these games. ‘We will show Hearts the respect they deserve and I’m sure they’ll be looking forward to the game as well. They’ll come to Celtic Park with nothing to lose.’ Meanwhile Charlie Mulgrew says he hopes to force his way back into Deila’s side sooner rather than later. The midfielder hasn’t featured since injuring his knee in the home defeat to Maribor a month ago but tweeted last night: ‘On my way back from London after having an injection on my knee. Looking forward to getting back training in the next couple of weeks.’","Ronny Deila has come in for a lot of criticism since joining Celtic .

"For someone stuck in the middle of an uncharacteristic goal drought, Kris Boyd’s thirst for hitting the net remains as typically unquenchable as ever. Since returning to Rangers for a second spell, the highest scorer in the modern history of the Scottish top flight could not have foreseen in his worst nightmares that he would approach October without a single strike in the league to his name. The 31-year-old is not only without a goal in his last five games, but has drawn a blank in nine of his 11 outings this season for the Ibrox side. The only times he has found the net have been against modest lower-league opponents, notching three against Clyde in the Petrofac Cup and two in the League Cup against Queens Park. Rangers striker Kris Boyd (right) promoting the game with Hibernian's Liam Craig and BT Sport pundit Gary McAllister . Gary McAllister and Kris Boyd took to Glenbervie Golf Club ahead of Rangers v Hibernian . The Scotland striker has found goals hard to come by in the league . Boyd, to his credit, takes questions on his lack of goals straight on the chin. Where there might once have been a scowl and a stare at his media inquisitors, there is now an honest admission that he need to find the net soon or face losing his place to those of his squad mates who are producing the goods. ‘I base myself on goals and I know I have to start scoring goals if I am going to keep myself in the team,’ he conceded. ‘I might be doing other things in my game better than I did in the past, but I need to start scoring goals. ‘I am not going to hide away from the fact I have missed chances. Some of the chances I have missed have not been like me. But I won’t hide on the pitch. There is no greater feeling than scoring goals for this club and I want to get back to doing that.’ Perhaps in the past Boyd might have pleaded with his team-mates to play more to his strengths to enable him to get on the scoresheet. Kris Boyd tries to battle his way through against Alloa pair Mark Docherty and Kyle Benedictus . Liam Craig and Kris Boyd were all smiles on the putting green - but things will be less jovial on Monday night . Rangers striker Kris Boyd is desperate to get off the mark in the Scottish Champiobship . But he said: ‘As a team I feel we are creating chances. They might not be for me, but we are scoring two, three, four goals in games and the most important thing is the team winning. ‘There’s competition for places. Nicky Clark came into the team and did well, Jon Daly is back from injury now and Dean Shiels came in against Falkirk on Tuesday and scored. ‘But I do feel it will change for me. We have got players in the team who are capable of creating chances for me and it will surely turn pretty soon.’ It should be pointed out that this is not Boyd’s longest dry spell in Scottish football. That came in 2010 when he went seven games in a row without hitting the back the net as he searched for his 100th SPL goal for Rangers. He later went 10 games in a row without finding the net for Middlesbrough in the English Championship.

Kris Boyd in Rangers training with team-mate Steven Smith . Some strikers might turn to bizarre superstitious routines to help them break the cycle when in the middle of a goal drought, but the former Kilmarnock and Portland Timbers forward insists he isn’t one of them. ‘There were no superstitions when I was scoring so I will just train and prepare the way I always do,’ said Boyd during his promotional duties for Monday night’s game at home to Hibs, live on BT Sport 1. ‘I have been through stages like this in my career before. But those are the standards that I’ve set. I was scoring more or less every game first time round at Rangers and I need to get back to doing that. ‘What you do in these situations is you keep getting into positions to miss or score chances. I have set the standard with the way I have finished over the last nine or 10 years and I feel I should have scored some of my chances recently. ‘But I would be more worried if I wasn’t getting chances. In the Raith game, I missed a few, but I have fed off scraps in the others. ‘I will just keep plugging away and getting myself into positions to get back on the goal trail. I know it won’t be far round the corner. It is a matter of time. As long as you keep working hard and getting into positions, it will change pretty soon. ‘I hope it will be on Monday night because we have a massive game against Hibs at Ibrox. ‘I feel they will be in the race for the title by the end of the season. It might have been a bit of a difficult start for them, but they are a good team and they can cause us problems. ‘It’s a challenge for this club to show that it should be back at the top. I hope it is just a matter of time until we get there.’","Kris Boyd yet to score in the league since returning to Rangers this season .

"For Ally McCoist, the least enjoyable episodes of his club’s much vaunted journey back up the leagues have taken place on plastic. It is a clearly a sentiment shared by his battered and bruised players. If Saturday’s 1-1 draw at part-time Alloa was shrugged off by McCoist as merely a ‘blip’ in an otherwise impressive run of results, the news that injuries sustained by Lewis Macleod and Nicky Clark will keep them out ‘for weeks’ came as an undoubted blow to the Rangers boss. McCoist declined to openly slaughter the artificial Indodrill Stadium surface, but Rangers midfielder Ian Black described it yesterday as ‘a shambles’, while captain Lee McCulloch’s succinct verdict on Saturday evening was that it was ‘worse than Stenhousemuir’s’. Rangers manager Ally McCoist has lost key players to injuries during matches played on artificial surfaces . But the manager made little secret of his disdain for non-grass surfaces as he revealed yesterday how he point blank refuses to let his players even train on the 3G surfaces at Murray Park for fear of fresh injuries. It won’t have escaped his attention that first-choice keeper Cammy Bell has not played since damaging his shoulder on the plastic pitch at Falkirk in a 2-0 win last month, ironically with goals from the injured Macleod and Clark. Kenny Miller has also mustered just five minutes of action since pulling up at Westfield that Friday night. And, perhaps with that in mind ahead of his side’s return to Falkirk in the League Cup on Tuesday, McCoist last night chose to damn the Bairns’ surface with faint praise. ‘As artificial surfaces go that I’m not keen on, their one is the best,’ quipped the Rangers manager. Gers captain Lee McCulloch slammed the playing surface  at Alloa's Indodrill Stadium on Saturday . ‘I do understand the economics of some of the clubs requiring them but I’m not a great fan. ‘Alloa, Queen of the South and Falkirk all have them but you don’t get any two pitches the same. They are different quality, the fabric is different, so I have to take into account the surface before I pick my team. ‘Clearly, in our team there are boys who are less comfortable on those surfaces than others. Two years ago David Templeton got a horrendous injury which was certainly down to the surface at Annan. He was out for the best part of eight weeks and it’s probably on his mind when he goes on that surface. ‘I can understand why people would maybe want to train on the surface they were going to be playing on but I wouldn’t do that because – rightly or wrongly – I think there’s a greater scope for injuries. Midfielder Lewis Macleod suffered an injury against Alloa on Saturday and will be sidelined for a few weeks . ‘I don’t even use the artificial surface here (at Murray Park) for that reason. I don’t like training on them because you run the risk of injury. ‘I would be loathe to say that Macleod and Clark’s injuries were caused by the Alloa pitch, but Lewis went over on his ankle and hurt his foot and Nicky, when he fell, hurt his shoulder. But I will reserve comment on that. ‘And the bottom line is that the players have got to play on plastic pitches. They might not like it but it’s the same for both teams - and there are no excuses.’ Forward Nicky Clark also hurt himself on Alloa's artificial surface on Saturday and is out of the Falkirk match . For McCoist, the loss of Macleod and Clark deprives him of two of his top men as he seeks to close in on a first cup win for the Ibrox side since their League Cup triumph over Celtic in 2011. ‘Of course it’s a blow for us because they’ve been two of our in-form players,’ he nodded. ‘And with Kenny and Cammy also out, these are big players missing for us, although Lee Wallace will be back and I wouldn’t hesitate to pitch Jon Daly into the team now that he is back from injury. ‘Our medical department are reluctant to put times on anything, but I think Macleod and Clark will be out for weeks rather than months. I don’t think they will manage the next league game (against Hibernian at Ibrox next Monday) but I would be delighted to be proved wrong.’ After watching star striker Kris Boyd draw a blank at Alloa at the weekend, McCoist insisted that he has no concerns over the Ibrox favourite’s lack of a league goal so far since his return to the club . Goalkeeper Cammy Clark (left) has not played since injuring himself in August on Falkirk's plastic pitch . ‘Boydy’s scored five in the cups,’ he pointed out. ‘We’re all convinced that he will be off and running soon. If you watch him in training, he’s one of the most natural finishers we have ever had. It is only a matter of time because he starts scoring regularly.’ Meanwhile, Falkirk goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald believes that his side can avenge their narrow 2-0 defeat to Rangers at Westfield last month. The Bairns enjoyed the upper hand for the vast majority of the encounter, but a Macleod strike that took a huge deflection off Alan Maybury gave McCoist’s men the breakthrough Falkirk could not find for themselves. A late second from Clark six minutes from time killed off any hopes the hosts had of a comeback. ‘If we can play the same way we did that night we are definitely capable of winning this time,’ said the former Hearts keeper. ‘We played great for 70 to 75 minutes and then lost a very unfortunate goal to Macleod by a huge deflection and that effectively won the game for them. ‘After that it opened up a bit because we were chasing the game and had to try to get a goal back. ‘But hopefully this time our luck will change and we can turn chances into goals.’","Ally McCoist saw Rangers players Lewis Macleod and Nicky Clark injure themselves at Alloa's artificial Indodrill Stadium surface on Saturday .

"Ian Black has backed the Rangers support to rally to the cause if the off-field turmoil at Ibrox takes another turn for the worse. The club's board was forced to call an emergency share issue earlier this month as they sought to plug a £4million black-hole in their budget. They fell £900,000 of their target and will now be forced to turn to investors again before the year is out. Rangers midfielder Ian Black addresses the media at Murray Park . Rangers players train at Murray Park on Monday morning after their 1-1 draw at Alloa on Saturday . However, chief executive Graham Wallace met with Ally McCoist, his players and members of the Glasgow giants' backroom staff on Friday to reassure them that the club was not in imminent danger. But that has done little to placate angry supporters, who have already called for football board chairman Sandy Easdale to be sacked. Around 15,000 of the club's followers have also refused to renew their season tickets in protest at the way the club is being run. Even so, Black believes the Ibrox faithful will not allow the club to be put in danger again. The former Hearts midfielder - who was forced to take up a part-time job as a painter and decorator during Vladimir Romanov's chaotic spell as Jambos owner - said: 'These off-field matters can be distracting if it goes too far and gets to the situation when you don't get paid. That's when it certainly affects you. Manager Ally McCoist, who has managed the club since 2011, speaks to the press on Monday . Rangers' fans will not let the club sink, according to midfielder Ian Black . 'But it's not going to get to that stage. It's too big a club. The fans have helped out and stood by us through thick and thin. They won't let us go into that situation. 'The board have told us as it stands it is going to be fine. We can't affect that so I don't want to pay any attention to things that will interfere with my performances.' Boss McCoist also addressed the club's staff at last week's meeting and insisted he and Wallace were delivering a positive message. 'Graham met with everybody - not just the players,' he explained. 'We had a staff meeting at Ibrox, which we have been known to have in the past, and it involved the staff from the stadium, the players and a lot of the staff from Murray Park. 'I did read somewhere that it was a secret meeting. It was not a secret meeting, that's for sure. All the staff knew about it and were going to it. 'It was fine. Graham addressed the staff, as did I for five or 10 minutes. That's all there was to it. 'There was nothing at all said that would scare anybody. Quite the opposite. 'We just wanted to keep everybody informed of what the plans and hopes are for the future and I would safely say it was very beneficial. Rangers manager McCoist (right) enjoys a joke at training on Monday . David Templeton celebrates after scoring the equaliser for Rangers in their 1-1 draw with Alloa on Saturday . 'It wasn't so much that people wanted reassurance. They just wanted information and a chat about what direction the club was going. 'It was nothing more than that and it was a good idea. It's something Graham is keen to do again in future.' McCoist was speaking just hours after Rangers confirmed to the London Stock Exchange that the stake held by Mike Ashley in the club had fallen from 4.56 per cent to 3.68 per cent. The Newcastle United owner decided against taking part in the open offer - which raised £3.13million after 15.6 million new shares were sold - meaning his holding was diluted. He does, however, retain three million shares. Investment group Laxey Partners strengthened their stance as Rangers' single biggest stakeholder after buying up more than five million shares. They now control just over 13 million shares - or around 16.3 per cent of the club. Meanwhile, Black has urged his team-mates to shake off Saturday's sloppy display against Alloa. Rangers could only draw 1-1 with Barry Smith's part-times at the Indodrill Stadium but now travel to Falkirk on Tuesday looking to claim a League Cup quarter-final slot. Black said: 'We came off the game against Inverness last week buzzing that we had knocked out a top-flight team, so it was disappointing the way we started against Alloa. 'We picked up in the second half but obviously we have come in and we've spoke about it, we know what we did wrong and where we can improve. We're ready to go again and the gaffer's got us sorted.'

"Rangers winger David Templeton has warned his team-mates they will find themselves on the wrong end of another cup shock if they repeat Saturday's dismal display against Alloa. The former Hearts forward rescued a point for the sloppy Ibrox side with just six minutes left at the Indodrill Stadium as he cancelled out Jonathan Tiffoney's first-half Wasps opener. The 1-1 draw now leaves the Glasgow side trailing Scottish Championship rivals Hearts by three points in the race for promotion. Rangers' David Templeton celebrates his goal but admits his side have to improve in midweek . But Templeton is worried Falkirk will not give them a similar reprieve when the Light Blues take on the Bairns in Tuesday night's League Cup third-round clash. Ally McCoist has already suffered a number of cup upsets during his four-year spell as boss - including a major upset at the Falkirk stadium three years ago before their liquidation crisis. And Templeton has warned they will find themselves on the end of another disaster if they do not improve on their weekend showing. 'We definitely won't get away with this kind of performance against Falkirk,' said the 25-year-old. 'We did not play to the standard we showed against Raith and Inverness last week and it cost us. 'The plastic pitch at Alloa didn't help. It was one of the older surfaces and was really sticky. 'Falkirk's pitch is one of the newer astros and come Tuesday I'm sure we will play a lot better.' Rangers had fallen behind to Jonathan Tiffoney's goal and needed Templeton's late goal to rescue a point . Templeton started Saturday's match on the bench but made an early entrance after Lewis Macleod limped off with a foot injury. Nicky Clark was also replaced just before the break after damaging his right shoulder, while Lee Wallace missed the game completely with a calf strain. All three are doubts for Tuesday's match but Templeton believes there are others in the Ibrox squad ready to step up. He said: 'It's disappointing for Lewis to pick up an injury as he has been brilliant for us this season. Hopefully he will be okay - I don't think it was anything too bad. 'We also lost Nicky and had Lee Wallace out as well. Lee and Lewis are massive for us down that left-hand side while Nicky has been doing really well for us too. 'It looked like Nicky picked up a bad one though. It's never nice to see guys picking up injuries but it gives others like myself a chance to come on and get a chance. Ally McCoist's side could be witout Nick Clark after he picked up a seemingly bad injury during the game . 'It was good for me that I was able to get on. The first half I didn't do too well but I had a better second half and then got the goal, which was nice.'

"Paul Scholes believes Rio Ferdinand would have played alongside John Terry for England at Euro 2012 despite the racism storm involving his brother Anton. Chelsea defender Terry was accused of making a racially charged remark to QPR player Anton Ferdinand during a match at Loftus Road in November 2011. He was found not guilty of racial abuse by a court but received a four-match suspension and £220,000 fine from the Football Association. Paul Scholes believes Rio Ferdinand (left) would have played alongside John Terry for England at Euro 2012 despite the racism storm involving the Chelsea defender and his brother Anton . Terry was accused of making a racist remark towards Anton Ferdinand when Chelsea played QPR in 2011 . Terry was found not guilty of racially abusing Ferdinand at Westminster Magistrates Court in July 2012 . Terry was named in Roy Hodgson's squad for the European Championships in Ukraine and Poland but Ferdinand was left at home. But Scholes, who played alongside Ferdinand at Manchester United for the best part of a decade, believes he would have put the controversy behind him to line up with Terry for England. Writing in his column for The Independent, Scholes said: 'It struck me that despite what had happened, and the strength of Rio's feelings about it, he said that he would still have played alongside John at Euro 2012. 'What happened between Anton and Terry at Loftus Road was a bad situation, and its fall-out was enormous. I would never for one moment trivialise racism. 'Terry was cleared in court of racial abuse and found guilty of a racial remark by an independent Football Association commission. Yet it was an issue Rio would have laid aside to play at Euro 2012. Paul Scholes (left), who played with Ferdinand at Man United for nearly a decade, believes he would have put the racism scandal aside to play alongside Terry at Euro 2012 . Roy Hodgson selected John Terry in England's Euro 2012 squad but left Rio Ferdinand at home . 'No one would underestimate the seriousness of the issue between Rio and Terry. But if Rio told Hodgson he could handle being in the same team as Terry, that is all that matters. He should have been in that England squad.' England were eliminated by Italy on penalties in the quarter-finals of the tournament. Scholes also says Manchester City's Yaya Toure 'doesn't look interested' this season and is not putting in the same amount of defensive work as he did last year.

Scholes wrote: 'Yaya Toure's lack of defensive work in midfield has become a major problem for them. 'The amount of time I saw opponents get in behind him in the game in Munich was quite remarkable. 'Alongside him, Fernandinho is having to do the work of two players defensively and against Bayern that was always going to cause City problems.'","Paul Scholes believes Rio Ferdinand would have put the racism scandal involving his brother Anton to one side to play with John Terry at Euro 2012 .

"Bastia striker Brandao has been handed a six-month ban for his headbutt on Paris St Germain's Thiago Motta, the Ligue de Football Professionnel has announced. Footage emerged of a clash between the two players in the tunnel shortly after PSG's 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes on August 16.

"It was the first thing they did on arrival at the hotel. To a man, the American team stepped forward to embrace the valued colleague whose very presence here may just represent the greatest triumph of the whole Ryder Cup week. Lance Bennett, caddie to Matt Kuchar, is back at work less than a month after the sudden death of his 39-year-old wife, Angela. It means a lot to Bennett, clearly, to be among friends. And it means everything to Kuchar to have his old friend back on the bag this week. Matt Kuchar (right) talks tactics with caddie Lance Bennett (left) who tragically lost his wife . Kuchar, pictured, will be able to call on Bennett's advice despite the caddie's recent loss . Darren Clarke played in the 2006 match at the K Club following the death of his wife Heather . ‘It’s been great,’ said Kuchar. ‘Lance didn’t come on the team charter and so, once everybody arrived, he and a couple guys that came early greeted us as we arrived. Everybody went up, gave him a big hug, got to spend some time with him. ‘Most guys are happy to see him back to some sort of normality. We felt so bad for his situation. It’s great to have him back as part of the family. 'We all felt like we lost a little something when we lost Angie. When she passed, we lost a bit of Lance, as well, so to have him back has been great.’ Kuchar explained that the nature of the Ryder Cup — a team event surrounded by friends — was probably a factor in Bennett’s decision to return to work so early. Lance Bennet (bottom centre) crouches below Matt Kuchar for the USA Team photo at Gleneagles . Rickie Fowler has paid tribute to Bennett's wife by wearing a cap with Angela's initials inscribed onto it . ‘I have one other friend that’s gone through a similar thing,’ said the 36-year-old. ‘He said, “There’s no rulebook in a situation like this. You make the decisions whenever you’re ready to do anything”. He shared those ideas with Lance.’ Kuchar’s warmth shines through even as he tackles the most complex subjects and it is not hard to see why he is one of the most popular members of the US team.

"Manchester United winger Angel di Maria's stunning lob against Leicester was all in vain as the Red Devils lost 5-3 against the Foxes, but despite this have we already seen the goal of the season? The Argentine's sumptuous lob midway during the first half put United 2-0 up as they seemingly looked like cruising to victory, with the former Real Madrid winger impressing for Louis van Gaal's side throughout proceedings. After picking up the ball just past the halfway line the 26-year-old linked up well with United captain Wayne Rooney, who in turn laid the ball back to Di Maria before he took matters into his own hands.

"Leeds United are still on the hunt for a manager, but caretaker boss Neil Redfearn is staking his claim after beating Bournemouth to remain unbeaten in his three games in charge. Massimo Cellino, the Leeds owner, has told Redfearn he is needed to manage in the academy but the 49-year-old followed up a win against Bolton and draw at Birmingham with a remarkable victory over Bournemouth. Giuseppe Bellusci struck an unstoppable 25-yard free-kick in the 79th minute to put them ahead after goals from Andrew Surman and Souleymane Doukara had the scores level. Mirco Antenucci then ran through to finish the game off with Leeds’ third goal in the last minute. Leeds United celebrate Guiseppe Beluscci's free-kick, which put them 2-1 up on the night .

Since David Hockaday was sacked after just 70 days in charge, former Leeds players, out-of-work managers and even a piece of computer coaching software have thrown their hat in the ring for the job. The latter may have just been a PR stunt but Redfearn is proving he knows what he is doing. Bournemouth were in complete control in the first half, before and after taking an early lead. It took until only the sixth minute for them open the scoring when midfielder Surman curled a sumptuous effort into the bottom left corner. And had it not been for Marco Silvestri in the Leeds goal, the home side would have streaked ahead. He was sharp from the off, diving to push wide Ryan Fraser’s fierce left-foot shot which was heading for the top right corner on three minutes. Matt Ritchie, on the right of Bournemouth’s midfield, then tested him twice in four minutes but the Italian was equal to the task on both occasions. Bournemouth really should have made their first-half dominance count and were punished when Leeds equalised on 67 minutes.

"Ronny Deila had never seen Wakaso Mubarak in the flesh when he gambled on a one-year loan deal for the Ghanaian winger. Yet it took just one look at the stocky 24-year-old to detect a Celtic cult hero in the making. A potential crowd pleaser who can fulfil the Norwegian’s craving for genuine pace and width in his team. Cast into the starting line-up in pressing circumstances against Salzburg in the Europa League, the World Cup star marked his debut with a stunning 14th-minute goal. His general display raised hopes that Celtic have made an astute capture. For 12 months, at least. Possibly longer, depending on price. Wakaso Mubarak scored on his Celtic debut during the 2-2 draw away at Salzburg in the Europa League . ‘I hadn’t seen him play live before he came here,’ Deila admitted. ‘I have my people I trust and a scouting department here I’m working with every day. They know what I’m after. ‘Wakaso has played in good clubs, like Espanyol, at a high level. I have contacts in Spain and they were seeing very positive things about him. I can now see why. ‘It looks like he could become a fans’ favourite at Celtic. Our fans like quick players, players who can go past people and who have energy. Wakaso had that in his game on Thursday night. ‘That’s the kind of team we want to be. We want to be similar to how Red Bull Salzburg were - that’s our goal. Maybe not so wide, but very aggressive and hungry to win the ball. Wakaso showed that level.’ Noted for a raft of yellow and red cards during his time in Spanish football, Wakaso brought aggression and flair to Celtic’s attacking efforts. He also brought a flair for the dramatic, one instance of rolling around following a heavy challenge from a Salzburg player showing a hint of cynicism. Yet Deila prefers to couch what he brings to the Celtic team in more diplomatic terms. ‘He has a lot of confidence,’ the Parkhead manager continued. ‘African players are different from European players, of course. It’s a different culture. But I’ve worked a lot with African players and they need to be loved, like everyone else. I think he will develop. ‘It’s good that he’s been in Europe now for many years. Had he come straight from Africa, then I would have been more afraid. ‘It’s also easier to be like that in an attacking rather than a defensive position. ‘He’s working hard and tactically he’s been good. He knows the game. ‘He takes cares of himself. He has natural talent there. But he needs time, he has a lot more to come. Celtic manager Ronny Deila had never seen the Ghanaian play before sanctioning a one-year loan move . ‘He needs to be quicker and sharper, but that will come when he gets games. ‘He didn’t get back to Scotland from international duty last week until the Friday night, so that’s why he didn’t play against Aberdeen. I hadn’t seen him in training. ‘But he trained well this week, so he got the chance against Salzburg. He was very good in the game. It was very nice to see. ‘He gives us another weapon in the wide midfield positions. He can eliminate players, get past them and he is good on the ball. That’s what I wanted to see and I’m happy for him.’ Wakaso’s 14th-minute strike, a controlled first-time effort from the edge of the box showed what Deila described as ‘fantastic technique,’ adding: ‘I hope he does more of that. It was a difficult shot to take on. He had a positive impact on the game. I want wingers who can work the pitch both ways, defensively and offensively, and he can do that. It’s very positive for us.’ To suggest Wakaso has already shown enough for a permanent agreement would be premature. On loan from wealthy Russian club Rubin Kazan, there is also no guarantee Celtic could afford him. If the Scottish champions wish to sign Aleksander Tonev or Jo Inge Berget, they already know what they must pay. Asked if the same applied to Wakaso, Deila was nimble on his feet. ‘I know what the fee is,’ he said, ‘but I won’t share it. We’ll see if it’s affordable but there is always a negotiation.’ That sounded for all the world like he wouldn’t be within their price range, but the Parkhead boss insisted: ‘We wouldn’t bring him here if it was not possible.’ Wakaso is one of four loan players, Celtic paying a fee for just one player when they signed Serbian Stefan Scepovic for £2.2million. The early signs are mixed. Tall, but not imbued with great physical strength, Scepovic is no Chris Sutton. In two games against Aberdeen and Salzburg, his impact has been constrained to fleeting glimpses of ability. Wakaso (left, next to Stefan Scepovic) has all the tools to become a cult hero at Celtic Park this season . ‘I think he was better in the second half against Salzburg,’ said Deila. ‘He came more into the game. ‘He hasn’t played much and he needs to adapt. I see in training and in games that he has good qualities. I know in time he will succeed here. ‘He needs to work on his physical side. It’s more physical here than in Spain and he needs to work on his upper body. ‘He needs more power but he’s into the training and wants to develop so that will come.’ Scepovic, himself, admits he needs to bulk up and adapt to a Scottish game significantly more physical than he is accustomed to. ‘I need time to get used to Scottish football but I think hard work on the training pitch and gym will make things okay,’ said the new Bhoy. ‘I will get a programme for the gym and, in time, everything will be how I expect. ‘Sometimes strikers don’t score for three games but then score in two or three in a row. ‘The most important thing is we won the game against Aberdeen and then took a point away in Europe. ‘Now we have to concentrate on the game against Motherwell.’ Captain Scott Brown was returning to Scotland via Germany yesterday after missing Celtic’s flight home. Unable to produce a urine sample for drugs testers before Salzburg Airport closed, the skipper is expected to play against Motherwell tomorrow. Adam Matthews, James Forrest, Charlie Mulgew and Mikael Lustig are still out, while Scepovic is also struggling with a dead leg. John Guidetti is available after being ineligible for the Europa League.","Celtic manager Ronny Deila hadn't seen Wakaso Mubarek play before signing him on loan .

"Ronny Deila branded Craig Gordon ‘fantastic’ after the Celtic keeper produced a top-drawer display to earn his side a Europa League point in Salzburg. The Scottish champions twice took the lead in the Red Bull Arena with goals in each half from debutant Wakaso Mubarak and a deflected Scott Brown effort. It took a blistering free-kick from Salzburg’s skipper Jonathan Soriano 12 minutes from time to salvage a 2-2 draw after Brazilian Alan had cancelled out Mubarak’s opener with a wicked deflection off Efe Ambrose. But the hosts would surely have had all three points but for a sublime Gordon fingertip stop in the first half and a stunning double save in the second. Craig Gordon produces a stunning save to stop Alan getting his second goal for Salzburg . ‘Craig’s performance was just marvellous,’ said Deila, with the Scotland international fast consigning £10million predecessor Fraser Forster to history. ‘I think he has been good all season but he’s progressing all the time and getting better and better. ‘He is a top professional and a fantastic man, a good boy. I am so glad to have him in the group. ‘Before I came to Celtic I had only seen him on TV when he played for Sunderland so I didn’t know all about him. ‘But (goalkeeping coach) Stevie Woods told me he was ready and he is showing he’s such a fantastic goalkeeper. He is back at the level he was at before with Stevie training him so well. He’s done such a fantastic job, too. ‘Together they have got back again – and they will keep on going. Craig has just been a fantastic signing for us. We had a fantastic goalkeeper in Fraser Forster but now we have another one – and a fantastic goalkeeping coach.’ Celtic's Craig Gordon pulls off yet another brilliant save in a performance his manager called marvellous . Despite being beaten twice Cetlic keeper Craig Gordon showed he is back to his best this season . Gordon’s form has been stunning and he is proving the doubters wrong after returning from two years on the sidelines with a knee injury. Salzburg coach Adi Sutter echoed his opposite number, saying of Gordon’s display: ‘He was fantastic and saved a point for Celtic.’ Celtic were accused of penny pinching after replacing Forster with a free transfer, but Deila believes the former Hearts man is making his point on the pitch. ‘I think so. He is very professional and he knows his body very well. He will work all the time but you never know in football - things can happen tomorrow, but so far he has been fantastic and if we keep him fit he will continue to be that. Craig Gordon salutes the Celtic fans after a superb performance helped his side earn a point in Salzburg . ‘I think we have improved in the back four. We have to work on the right side because we had some trouble in the second half, but it was a good performance and the central defenders are working well together. ‘Jason Denayer has been a very good signing and Virgil (van Dijk) is improving with every match he plays at a high level. That gives me a good feeling.’ Deila was also delighted with Mubarak’s debut goal and performance and sees signs of improvement in his team after a dismal double exit from the Champions League to Legia Warsaw and Maribor. ‘I love to work in football to create things and I think now we are progressing. We see there is a lot of work to do to get even better. Ronny Deila praised his goalkeeper Craig Gordon and was pleased with the progress his team are making . ‘I want to control the matches more than we do by controlling the ball, but that will take time. We need more fitness and quickness on the ball and that’s what we are going to work on this year so that hopefully we will be more ready for the Champions League.’ Meanwhile, Scott Brown will today make his own way back from Austria - after Celtic were forced to leave their captain behind in Salzburg. The closure of the local airport at 11pm local time prompted a Celtic dash for their flight minutes after the 2-2 draw, but goalscorer Brown had been called in for a UEFA drugs test and was unable to produce a urine sample quickly. Aleksandar Tonev was also tested and made the plane in time but Brown was less fortunate and will fly home alone ahead of Sunday’s game with Motherwell.

"MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli celebrated signing a new three-year deal at the club by scoring a hat-trick at the weekend. The 18-year-old is attracting interest from the top flight in England and abroad and his manager Karl Robinson has done well to hold on to him. Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham takes a look at who the player is and what all the fuss is about. MK Dons' midfielder Dele Alli is attracting interest from Europe's big clubs after impressing in League One . Where's he come from? Alli was born in Milton Keynes and has come through the club's academy, which he joined aged 11. He had already made his debut by the time he was 16 – his first ever touch in professional football an audacious back-heel in an FA Cup match against Cambridge – and scored in his second game, a 35-yard screamer. He is in the England Under 19 squad, where he was one of the stand-out performers in their recent draw with Germany. The England U19 midfielder joined the club at the age of 11 and has come through the club's academy ranks . Who's raving about him? It's probably easier to list who isn't. After his hat-trick against Crewe on Saturday MK Dons boss Robinson said: 'This kid isn't 19 until April and in every game he has either scored or assisted a goal.' The club's chairman Pete Winkelman told Robinson that he had not seen a better individual performance from a player at the club. Alli has now scored six goals in his first 10 games this season. Alli (centre) has scored six goals in 10 games this season including  a hat-trick against Crewe on Saturday . Who's interested in him? Liverpool had a £3.5million bid rejected for Alli in the summer and news of the player has spread to Germany where Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are showing an interest. But Alli is following some sound advice and sticking with League One side MK Dons, at least for the near future, where the teenager is becoming one of focal points of the team. Alli was the subject of a £3.5million bid from Liverpool this summer but MK Dons rejected their offer . What's his playing style? Alli is an all-action central midfielder, tough in the tackle, strong on the ball, who can pass and finish well and has an engine that effortlessly gets him from box to box all game. He told Sportsmail: 'Whilst I'm young I'd like to think I make forward runs a lot, getting goals and assists. 'That's what I want to add to my game. I think I can play quite defensive as well. That deep midfield role or a high attacking one. I enjoy playing both.' German giants Bayern Munich have also shown an interest in Alli's (left) all-action displays at MK Dons . Who does he most play like? Alli has been compared to Liverpool's Steven Gerrard for his all-round ability. That is quite a player to live up to, but a comparison that he welcomes. 'He is a big idol of mine, I've always watched him,' Alli said. 'Being a Liverpool fan it's great to have someone like that to look up to.' He also, rather jokingly, claimed he was a cross between Gerrard and Yaya Toure recently. Alli's (left) playing style has seen him been compared to Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard . What's he like off the field? The player enjoys relaxing at home when he is not on the training ground preparing for matches or in action with the team. He is also giving another sport a go. 'I'm trying to get into golf,' he added. 'I'm awful at the minute but it's something I'm trying to get into.'","18-year-old Dele Alli is starring for League One outfit MK Dons .

"Milton Keynes Dons' talented midfielder Dele Alli continued his impressive run of form by scoring a hat-trick against Crewe Alexandra. The 18-year-old, who was named Football League Player of the Month for August, scored half of his team's goals as The Dons hammered Crewe 6-1 in their League One clash. Will Grigg, Ben Reeves and on-loan Arsenal striker Benik Afobe scored the home side's other goals while a Kyle McFadzean own goal provided some consolation for Crewe. MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli scored a hat-trick as his side destroyed Crewe Alexandra 6-1 . Alli, who is capped at Under 17, 18 and 19 for England, has been attracting attention from across Europe with a list of admirers that includes Bayern Munich and Liverpool. The midfielder, who can play behind the striker or in a deeper role, has enjoyed a meteoric rise to success this season under the guidance of Karl Robinson. And Alli's development at MK Dons was rewarded last week when he was given a contract extension until 2017.

With plenty of admirers further up the league, it seems unlikely that Stadium MK will be his home for the duration, though. Brendan Rodgers is one manager keen on aquiring Alli's services, and the player is well aware of the interest. 'Before games, the gaffer will sit me down, tell me I'm being watched, and make sure I'm not getting carried away,' Alli told The Telegraph. 'I've heard he (Brendan Rodgers) has (been watching). It's not something I really worry about.' Alli (left) is also a regular for England U19s, pictured against Germany U19s on September 8 .

"European vice-captain Sam Torrance believes the American team will be plagued by doubts when they contest the 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. US captain Tom Watson has made it clear that he feels this year's contest offers those players on the wrong end of the 'Miracle at Medinah' the chance of redemption. But Torrance thinks the manner of that defeat in Chicago, when Europe fought back from 10-4 down on Saturday afternoon and from 10-6 behind in the final day singles, will have a negative effect. Sam Torrance believes the Miracle of Medinah would be playing on his mind if he was in the American team . 'If it was me I don't think that would spur me on,' Torrance said. 'I would think that would put a lot of doubts in my head, the fact that you're four points clear at home and you lose. 'I don't know how that would spur you on, it's almost more deflatory.' Europe have won seven of the last nine contests and not lost on home soil since 1993, but Torrance does not subscribe to the theory that the United States need a win to maintain interest in the biennial contest. 'Not in my book,' the 2002 winning captain said. 'If they never win again I'll still be very interested. They want it just as much as we want it. That's a point that you really must get over. The European team celebrate having won the Ryder Cup in 2012 after a superb comeback . Rory McIlroy and Co came from 10-6 down in the final day singles to claim the trophy . 'They love the Ryder Cup like all Europeans. They really want to win it back just as much as we want to retain it and that's what makes it such a fantastic sporting event.' Seven of the 12-man team from Medinah - Bubba Watson, Webb Simpson, Keegan Bradley, Phil Mickelson, Zach Johnson, Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar - have also made the side for Gleneagles, while wild card Hunter Mahan has his own score to settle having lost the decisive singles match to Graeme McDowell in 2010. 'I made it very clear to them that this trip is a redemption trip,' Watson said. Tom Watson has made it clear that he feels this year's contest offers  the chance of redemption for the US . 'Those players that played on that team, it's time to make amends and try to redeem yourselves from what happened in 2012. I think it's a motivation rather than a negative.'

"Ryder Cup veteran Lee Westwood called it a cauldron and Graeme McDowell rated his experience as bizarre, but European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley wants his players to take on the stature of gladiators when they walk onto the first tee at Gleneagles. Every individual handles the occasion differently, but what they will have to cope with, starting from Friday, is the pressure which comes with the fevered atmosphere of the hugely anticipated clash against the United States. The walk to the first tee goes through a tunnel under a road, and McGinley likened the players' emergence on the other side to that of gladiators entering the arena. Europe captain Paul McGinley (L), speaking to Ian Poulter, wants his players to walk out like 'gladiators' McGinley would prefer his players did not take golf buggies to the first tee at Gleneagles . Westwood, in his ninth Ryder Cup, knows what that feels like. 'I was nervous on the first tee at Valderrama (his debut in 1997) and that was without the 3,000 seats at the first tee and all the hype,' he said. 'I would imagine for the rookies it's going to be a bit of a shock. It's a bit of an intimidating atmosphere, but nothing they can't handle. 'It really gets you going and gets the juices flowing. It's changed a lot, though. 'It's getting more and more like a cauldron-type atmosphere, an amphitheatre to get your round off. 'Nothing prepares you for the Ryder Cup and getting on the first tee there and the atmosphere. 'I played with Tom Lehman in the singles in 1999 and he got the crowd to sing the national anthem. That was sort of the build-up to the atmosphere that there is now really around the first tee.' Lee Westwood, practicing at Gleneagles, admits being nervous before making his 1997 Ryder Cup debut . Europe's leading player Rory McILroy (R) listens to Martin Kaymer during a practice round . As the players stand on the first tee, in their eye-line will be a quote from the late, great Seve Ballesteros posted on the back of the 18th grandstand which reads: 'As a player and captain these are unforgettable moments when you are competing for your team-mates, your country and for the people of your continent.' McGinley has tried to make the walk - and he would prefer his players to make their own way rather than be driven there - to the tee more aesthetically pleasant with some cosmetic dressing, but he does not expect it to lessen the impact when they are greeted by the crowd. 'It was a grey, miserable tunnel for carts to go under (but now) we've got flowers and, to be fair to America, half of it is red and half is blue,' he said. 'I'm very keen on the players walking to the first tee rather than being taken there in a buggy, although some may choose to be so. 'I think it's important to walk to the tee and we want to bring it to life - a bit like gladiators walking into the arena as you walk up that hill coming out of the tunnel. 'The crowd will get a glimpse of them from the huge stands that are there and from the hospitality (area); it should be an electric atmosphere.' The European team line up for their group photo before the start of the competition at the weekend . Wives and girlfriends of the European team arrive in Scotland to support their men . McDowell has experienced pressure situations at both ends of the contest, having holed the winning putt in 2010 and hit the first shot in Medinah two years ago. 'I'm a guy that certainly embraces high-pressure scenarios and tries to put them in perspective and realise that that's why I practise and that's why I should try to enjoy it,' the Northern Irishman said. 'Not that those types of scenarios are easy to enjoy - they are very painful. 'They're very unusual because you crave them but when you're actually there you kind of wish you weren't because it's very hard and all you can think about is not messing up. '2010 was the most nerve-wracking experience probably of my life. 'I thought I would be nervous going into the delivery room four weeks ago (for the birth of his first child) but I don't think I will ever be that tight and that nervous again in my life as that back nine against Hunter Mahan in Celtic Manor. 'Hitting the first tee shot at Medinah a couple years ago was a very bizarre experience. Graeme McDowell (R) has experienced the pressure of hitting the first and last balls at the Ryder Cup . Team USA take a walk around the Gleneagles course during practice on Tuesday . 'I felt very calm and confident as I went to the first tee; the noise was amazing and everyone's excitement levels had peaked. 'I remember putting the tee in the ground, the whole place going deathly silent and standing over the tee shot thinking to myself, 'This is just the most bizarre feeling I've ever had in my life'. 'I didn't put a very good swing on it, like my head was genuinely elsewhere taking in how surreal the moment and the environment was from sort of high noise levels to absolutely zero. The silence level was amazing. 'The great thing about the Ryder Cup is it's Sunday-afternoon pressure from the first tee shot on Friday morning.'","Europe take on USA in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles September 26-28 .

"CLICK HERE to find out why Atletico Madrid had to wait 105 days to get the trophy. Atletico Madrid were finally presented with the La Liga trophy some 105 days after winning it as they snatched their first victory of the season over newly-promoted Eibar at the Vicente Calderon. The reigning champions - minus suspended manager Diego Simeone, who is serving an eight-match touchline ban - received the  trophy before the game, which narrowly ended 2-1 in the home side's favour. It took Atletico just 11 minutes to pounce through Miranda before new-signing Mario Mandzukic doubled their lead in the 25th minute, only for a stubborn Eibar to bridge the gap soon after.

Subs (not used): Jaime, Ekiza, Lillo, Boateng . Bookings: NONE . Goals: Abraham (33) It was Abraham's stunning goal in the 33rd minute which made the La Liga new-boys believe they could compete, and the modest Basque side kept Atletico fans on edge in the second half. Atletico - without departed striker Diego Costa, who joined Chelsea during the summer - failed to deliver the same intensity and conviction that powered them to last season's title on Saturday. Assistant manager German Burgos directed Atletico from the dugout, while Simeone watched from the stands as punishment for vehemently protesting during the Spanish Super Cup earlier in the month. Miranda and former Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic's headers were somewhat routine, but Abraham's strike to reduce the deficit was anything but. A beautifully-curled shot into the top-right corner rounded off a succession of one-touch football and a cheeky back-heeled flick from the new kids on the La Liga block, and drew warm applause from the 48,000 in the Vicente Calderon. Eibar took control of possession in the second half, forcing Atletico to sit deep. The visitors almost snatched an equaliser when Eneko Boveda's header skimmed the post 15 minutes from time, but it wasn't to be. Simeone's men survived to record their first win of the new season, having been held to a 0-0 draw against Rayo Vallecano five days earlier.

"Ryder Cup debutant Jamie Donaldson is more concerned about his table tennis form against fellow team-mates than he is about tackling the Gleneagles course. The 38-year-old rookie secured his place on Paul McGinley's team by winning the Czech Masters in August and has subsequently had two other top-10 finishes on the European Tour. However, arriving in Scotland on Monday he discovered European competitiveness was not reserved solely for the United States. Jamie Donaldson admits he is disappointed with his table tennis form against Thomas Bjorn . 'I played table tennis last night with Thomas Bjorn, who had a jumper on and I had a tee shirt on, and I was dripping with sweat and he didn't have any sweat on him at all and he battered me 3-0,' said the first Welshman to play in the Ryder Cup since Phillip Price 12 years ago. 'He was winding me up all morning and I'll be looking to playing him tonight. 'Talking to Sergio (Garcia) he was going ""Who? Thomas? Beat you 3-0?"" Apparently Sergio is very good. There's a few good players. 'It's amazing how and I've never played with a golfer yet who is not very good at table tennis. 'You can play pool and some people are literally useless but everybody seems to play table tennis pretty well, which is quite mad. Bjorn plays out the bunker during a practice session at Gleneagles on Tuesday afternoon . 'I'll be trying to get my revenge this evening, (I'll) have to change my strategy on the table tennis.' That appears to be Donaldson's primary concern as he is confident the golf will look after itself following an impressive two years in which he recorded three victories. 'I suppose you've got to conserve energy as much as you can - not playing too much table tennis! - and not get too involved or drifting away, but at the same time enjoy the experience,' he added. 'I don't know if it's not quite sunk in but I think because things have taken so long for me to get to this position, everything seems to slip more into my stride than maybe if I was 25 as opposed to 38. 'I don't get so wowed as I might have done if I was younger. 'All the surroundings change but the game still stays the same, so all I try to think about is my game, just like I would do every other week. The game's been good of late.'

The Australian ended it 60 points adrift of Hamilton, yet that could have been 57 if Horner had felt obliged to make a call on position. With double points in the final race in Abu Dhabi, and with Mercedes' reliability record becoming more of an issue, every point could prove vital for Ricciardo. Yet a dismissive Horner said: 'Both mathematically have a chance, even though it's a long shot. 'So it's down to them racing each other on the track. It would be wrong to interfere with that in the situation we're in.' Ricciardo suggested after the last race in Italy it would be beneficial to his cause if the team started to favour him.

'But as I say, with the situation we're in at the moment it's a long shot.'

Despite that, Horner said: 'Mercedes have an enormous advantage at this point, but we'll take it one race at a time. 'Both of them are still just in it, and both have taken a chunk of points out of Nico. 'Daniel, okay he's conceded three points to Seb, but is that going to make the difference?

"Middlesbrough have been something of a forgotten club in recent seasons. Relegated from the Premier League in 2009, chairman Steve Gibson reinvested parachute payments only for the team never to take flight. Indeed, they have remained grounded in the nowhere regions of the second tier. Until now. Middlesbrough take on Liverpool in the Capital One Cup third round on Tuesday... and they are up for a shock . With three wins on the spin – taking them to within three points of top – they are one of the country’s form sides and, on Tuesday evening, they will remind a national audience of their existence with a televised trip to Anfield in the League Cup. So what’s going on down by the Riverside? Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look… . The past five seasons sound forgettable, what happened? It’s more of a case of what failed to happen. Gareth Southgate should have gone in the wake of relegation but Gibson kept faith. It was a mistake and by October Gordon Strachan was installed with the remit of taking Boro back to the Premier League. And so began the Scottish revolution. They may have voted against independence last week, but Strachan set about creating an independent Scottish state on Teesside. By the end of the 2010 winter window five of his compatriots had arrived at significant cost. But Strachan never seemed happy back in the dugout and he was replaced after a year by fan favourite Tony Mowbray. Neither Gareth Southgate or Tony Mowbray managed to bring success back to Middlesbrough . Gordon Strachan brought in a Scottish legion but also struggled at the Riverside . His popularity bought him time – too much of it, in fact. For Mowbray remained in charge for three laborious years during which the club stalled. Enter, last November, Aitor Karanka. I remember him from Championship Manager with Real Madrid? We’re sure he’ll be thrilled by such recollection… but yes, while Real were winning three Champions League trophies around the turn of the millennium, Karanka was an unsung stalwart in defence. He went on to manage Spain Under 16s before returning to Madrid as assistant to Jose Mourinho. Aitor Karanka mixed it with the very best as a player, here playing for Real Madrid against Manchester United . Karanka with Jose Mourinho, then Real Madrid manager, during a Champions League match at Ajax in 2010 . And so to Middlesbrough, how has he done? He may lack the charisma of his close pal Jose, but Karanka is proving a canny coach. Boro won six from eight at the back end of last season to suggest his influence was beginning to take hold and a busy summer followed during which the Spaniard stamped his mark on the squad. How busy was the summer then? Well, total turnover amounted to a staggering 27, broken down by; seven signings, five loans in, 11 released or sold and four loans out. This, then, is Karanka’s team. The Spaniard has changed the team dramatically but is beginning to pick up points in the Championship . How have they done? They certainly don’t do draws and are one of only two sides in the country not to tie a game this season. Three wins from three – the latest an emphatic 4-0 thrashing of Brentford – has lifted them to play-off territory and Karanka believes that is where they should remain, rather than play catch-up like they did last term only to fall short in 12th. Who are the stars? Who aren’t the stars? For be it new signings or those from previous regimes, Boro are bouncing all over the park. Spanish forward Kike has been the pick of the summer arrivals. Karanka worked with the 24-year-old at international youth level and his £2.7million acquisition is proving something of a coup. The silky Spaniard has netted five times already, his latest effort a sumptuous scoop in the demolition of Brentford. Kike could prove to be a snip at £2.7million, he is already banging in the goals . Captain Grant Leadbitter has been the main man this season, already scoring seven goals from midfield . But it is captain Grant Leadbitter who has been the main man this season. If he’s not scoring belters from 30 yards then, well, he’s scoring belters from 25 yards. The former Sunderland and Ipswich schemer has smashed seven goals to already better his tally from last term. His honesty and endeavour from the centre of midfield will be the heartbeat to any potential promotion push. But Boro have options all over the pitch and team selection is a welcome headache for Karanka right now, certainly in attack where Kike is competing with Belgium forward Jelle Vossen, Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford, Emilio Nsue and Lee Tomlin. They also have the chairman's nephew at the back, England Under 21 defender Ben Gibson. What about that connection with Chelsea? Yes, Karanka has made full use of his relationship with Mourinho to bring in Football League goal machine Bamford, defender Kenneth Omeruo and goalkeeper Jamal Blackman on loan. But it was Spurs loanee Ryan Fredericks who caught the eye most impressively at the weekend, coming in for his debut and putting in a combative yet classy display. Patrick Bamford is one of many talented Chelsea loanees who have been brought in by Karanka . So can they shock Liverpool? Yes. They’ve won their last three away from home, are in free-scoring form and Karanka has generated a healthy competition whereby those who come in will be desperate to impress.

"McLaren team principal Eric Boullier has hailed Kevin Magnussen's drive to claim a sole point in the Singapore Grand Prix as 'heroic'. An overheating car beneath Magnussen resulted in the Dane's lower back sustaining minor burns, while the liquid in his fluids bottle boiled and became undrinkable. At one stage during the safety car period Magnussen could be seen raising his arms outside of the cockpit, one at a time, in a bid to get cooling air behind him, but in temperatures of 28 degrees centigrade it was to no avail. Kevin Magnussen has been branded a hero for finishing the Singapore Grand Prix after heating problems . McLaren driver suffered minor burns and dehydration after his cockpit overheated during the race . Despite the problems, Magnussen managed to cross the finishing line at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in 10th place to collect McLaren's only point as Jenson Button retired eight laps from home. After being checked over at the track medical centre, Magnussen then lay on a towel filled with ice in order to relieve the pain. Boullier said: 'It was a heroic performance. He really gave it his all. 'The afternoon was gruelling for him, there's no other word. He was subjected to severe bodily discomfort as his car's cockpit began to overheat. 'That necessitated his holding his arms aloft at one stage in an effort to direct cooling air down his sleeves and inside his race-suit, which was an unusually painful complication for him. 'In the end he was able to score a single point for the team. It was scant consolation, but it's indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit, and I commend him for it.' Lewis Hamilton celebrates the win that gives him the lead in the drivers' championship race . Unsurprisingly, Magnussen claimed his result was 'the hardest point' he had ever earned. The 21-year-old added: 'I don't know if something was wrong, but my seat was very hot which made things extremely uncomfortable for me, so we have to check what's going on. 'That was tough, very tough. I couldn't even drink the water, but at least we got one point. It's better than nothing.'","Kevin Magnussen branded a 'hero' my McLaren principal Eric Boullier .

"Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka has watched former club Real Madrid smash 13 goals in two games following an early-season stutter – and he fears a similar backlash from Liverpool. Real were at their scintillating best as they put eight past Deportivo on Saturday having won 5-1 against Basle in midweek. Those victories came on the back of two successive defeats in La Liga which triggered questions over the future of Carlo Ancelotti. In-form Boro, with three wins on the bounce, travel to Anfield on Tuesday with the Reds having lost their last two in the Premier League. Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka is expecting a very tough evening against Liverpool on Tuesday . The Spaniard believes Liverpool are due a goal glut after a slow start, like former club Real Madrd . Karanka managed Reds defender Javi Manquillo when he coached Spain's Under 16 side and rates him highly . But Karanka warned: ‘I know they aren’t in a good way but they have a good manager and good players. ‘Look at Real Madrid, they were very bad two weeks ago then they score eight goals. They have scored 13 in two games. ‘You cannot know what is, and what is not, a good time to play Liverpool. ‘You have to remember, they are a Champions League team and we are a Championship team. There is a big difference between Liverpool and us. ‘But we must go there to win, you can’t go to enjoy the atmosphere. That is dangerous.’ Spanish striker Kike has been in excellent form for Boro and has five goals from seven starts this season . Karanka is wary of the threat of Mario Balotelli and co despite Liverpool's poor run of form . Grant Leadbitter is another of Karanka's players enjoying his football, and will hope to impress on Tuesday . Karanka - former assistant to Jose Mourinho at the Bernabeu - is set to start with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford in attack. The 21-year-old is one of three Blues youngsters allowed to head north this season because of the relationship of the two bosses. Kike – Karanka looks to have pulled off something of a coup by persuading the silky Spaniard to join the club. The 24-year-old scored 23 times in 46 league games for Murcia and already he has five from seven starts for Boro. Patrick Bamford – The Chelsea loanee has proved a Football League goal machine following spells at Derby and MK Dons last season. He opened his account for his new club at the weekend and will be out to prove his worth against Premier League opponents. Grant Leadbitter – The former Sunderland and Ipswich schemer is in frightening form and has plundered seven from midfield this season, including his Roberto Carlos-esque free-kick at Huddersfield. He is the man who makes Boro tick. And Karanka said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him (Mourinho) yet – but maybe I will ring him at half-time (for some advice). ‘But we know how difficult this will be, no matter what team they play.’ One of the players Karanka could target in Liverpool’s suspect backline is 20-year-old Javi Manquillo, who was hauled off after 22 minutes of the 3-1 defeat at West Ham on Saturday. The Atletico Madrid loanee played under Karanka with Spain Under-16s and he tried to bring him to Teesside last season. ‘I know him very well as a lad and a player and I tried to convince him to come here but it was not possible,’ he revealed. ‘I think he’s the ideal player for the Premier League. He’s very strong and very good with his feet. He is young and has everything to enjoy success here in England. He will be a very good player in the future.’ Boro enjoyed a 4-0 victory over Brentford on Saturday to put them to within three points of top. Liverpool, meanwhile, have struggled for goals in the post Luis Suarez era, and Karanka went on: ‘Football is all about goals. Last season we were working very well and were consistent but we went seven games without scoring one goal. Now, touch wood, we have recovered our consistency and have many options to score goals. ‘For Liverpool, losing a player like Suarez will always be a very important miss, because he is one player who scored an unbelievable amount of goals both for Liverpool and his national team. He is a big miss.’ Rickie Lambert, who has been used from the bench so far for Liverpool, will start against Boro . Leadbitter's good form has helped Middlesbrough with their last three games and climb up to 5th .

"Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has urged his side to show no fear as they bid to move on from last year's survival miracle and establish themselves as a top-flight force. The Eagles came from behind to claim their first win of the season at Everton on Sunday and Warnock believes surprise results elsewhere should give his players confidence for the rest of the campaign. Warnock, whose side face Manchester United's conquerors Leicester City at Selhurst Park next Saturday after their midweek Capital One Cup clash with Newcastle, insisted: 'I think every fixture in this league is there to get points from. Neil Warnock was delighted with his Crystal Palace side's win at Goodison Park of Everton . Fraizer Campbell celebrates his goal as Palace came from behind to record a shock win on Sunday . 'I know on the day most teams will get beaten by the top three or four in the league but teams like ourselves can play home or away and give a good account of themselves. 'It seems to me that apart from the top four or five we have a wide open Premier League and one we can enjoy being part of. Look at the results [on Sunday]. Anyone is capable of beating anyone else.' Having been handed the seemingly thankless task of maintaining last season's stunning form under Tony Pulis, Warnock suddenly finds an absence of riches at his disposal up front. Mile Jedinak's penalty had put Warnock's side level as they stunned an the side that finished 5th last year .

"Matt Le Tissier believes Southampton look 'stronger' than they were last season, despite the summer sales of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert. Southampton sit second top of the Premier League after taking 10 points from their first five games, and striker Graziano Pelle is among the replacements proving an instant hit at St Mary's. And Le Tissier, who made 540 appearances during a 17-year spell with Southampton, thinks the Saints look equally good despite Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal luring their stars away. Graziano Pelle celebrates after opening the scoring for Southampton in their 4-0 victory over Newcastle . Southampton sit second in the Premier League table - three points behind Chelsea - despite their stars leaving . Dusan Tadic, brought in from FC Twente, is another from the Dutch league who has hit form in England . Ronald Koeman replaced his outgoing stars with new faces that have hit it off in the Premier League so far . Toby Alderweireld (Atletico Madrid, loan) Ryan Bertrand (Chelsea, loan) Fraser Forster (Celtic) Florin Gardos (Steaua Bucuresti) Shane Long (Hull City) Sadio Mane (Red Bull Salzburg) Graziano Pelle (Feyenoord) Dusan Tadic (FC Twente) 'They've done really well,' says Le Tissier. 'They put themselves in danger getting rid of so many players. Other clubs knew that (they would have to sell), but that's football. 'Ronald Koeman has done a cracking job on building the squad. In terms of depth, I think we're actually probably stronger than we were last season.' Pelle's start to life in the Premier League has proved positive. The Italian striker has scored three goals to help Southampton creep up the table since signing from Feyenoord for £9million. Dusan Tadic is another who, since joining from FC Twente for £10.9m, has fit in well and the Serbia international has two assists to his name. But Le Tissier acknowledges the fixture list has not been the most challenging for Koeman's men. Matt Le Tissier played for Southampton for 17 years and made 540 appearances, scoring 209 goals .

'The fixtures since then were kind,' adds Le Tissier. 'They are all games you would look at from a standpoint and think you could win. 'Then again, Manchester United probably looked at their first five fixtures and thought it looked like an easy 15 points on the board. 'Pelle has had a terrific start, he looks a very comfortable footballer and there's probably more to come. Toby Alderweireld got his debut against Newcastle and looked good.

"Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been in sensational form since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Atletico Madrid. Seven goals in four games, the best start by any player to life in the Premier League, have seen him establish himself as Jose Mourinho's star performer. But, with respect to the likes of Burnley, Leicester and Swansea, he had not, until Sunday, come up against a defender of the quality of Vincent Kompany. Click here to see Costa and Kompany's key battles in our brilliant match zone . Vincent Kompany and Diego Costa go shoulder to shoulder as the league's top scorer faced a tough test . In the first half Diego Costa spent more time in his own penalty area than anywhere else on the pitch . Costa tackles Edin Dzeko, as the Chelsea striker spent much of the first hour defending rather than attacking . It was always going to be intriguing to see how the Spaniard coped when up against a truly world class defender, and, in the first half at least, the answer was plain. Isolated up front on his own Costa saw very little of the ball and didn't manage a single shot in the first 45 minutes. Only once did he escape his Belgian opponent, on the stroke of half time, but the slightest touch from Fernandinho prevented Costa from scoring after Branislav Ivanovic's knock-down from a corner. Kompany emerges from yet another duel with Diego Costa with the ball as the Spaniard struggled . When the ball finally did come to Costa in the City area he was both offside and fired wide . Up until Zabaleta's red card the Chelsea striker had been unable to have any significant impact on the game . In fact, in the first half, the Spanish striker spent more time in his own penalty area than Manchester City's. Much of this was down to Jose Mourinho's tactical set-up. Cesc Fabregas, the supplier-in-chief thus far for Costa's goals, was rarely close enough to him to provide. When Fabregas did get forward and try and feed Costa, Kompany was there, to intercept, to tackle, to stifle. Willian and Ramires offered energy in midfield, but scarcely made it into the City half, as Mourinho's plan to soak up pressure blunted not only City, but also his own attack. Eventually, early in the second half, it looked like Costa may get a chance. When the ball found him in the City penalty area, however, he was both offside and unable to find the target. Diego Costa tangles with Pablo Zabaleta as the striker continues to be a nuisance despite little service . The two players are pulled apart but Costa's damage had been done and Zabaleta was sent off . The frustration was clearly boiling over, but Costa still had the nuisance factor which resulted in Pablo Zabaleta's red card. Before that moment, Costa had been involved in 10 duels with City players and lost all of them. But, with the increased space, and the onus on Chelsea to come forward, the striker was finally in the game. Costa played a key part in Andre Schurrle's goal and the Spanish striker was quick to celebrate . Costa may have had a quiet game, but he played a crucial part in Andre Schurrle's goal . By the time he was substituted Costa's influence had grown but he was still outclassed by Vincent Kompany . It was Costa who drove at the City defence before feeding Eden Hazard who crossed for Andre Schurrle's pivotal goal. And, as the game wore on, he even managed an effort on target (only Chelsea's second of the game), a header straight into the hands of Joe Hart, before striking the post with by far his best effort of the game. It was fitting that City were back level by the time Costa was eventually removed. Denied the service he thrives on, he never offered enough against Vincent Kompany to earn the win.","Diego Costa struggles against world class defence .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini claimed Chelsea played like 'a small team' and likened their approach to Stoke in the 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium. Unlike the Potters, who recorded a surprise victory last month, the Stamford Bridge side left with a draw after substitute Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser against his former club to cancel out Andre Schurrle's goal. For the second successive season Chelsea, who had a 100 per cent record prior to kick-off, came looking to frustrate and primarily avoid defeat. Manuel Pellegrini questions Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho during the tense draw the the Etihad . Former Chelsea star Frank Lampard refuses to celebrate scoring Manchester City's late equaliser . While it paid off previously this time they slipped up as City fought back despite having Pablo Zabaleta sent off for a second bookable offence. 'It think we played 90 minutes against a small team trying to defend, trying to keep 10 players in front of their goal, and (we were) a team that wanted to win from the beginning,' he said. 'I think we played against exactly the same team we played against Stoke here. 'It was very difficult for us to score but finally we did score. I don't want to analyse Chelsea. What the other teams do, it is not my duty to analyse.' Mourinho and Pellegrini have never seen eye to eye, with the Chilean attacking the Chelsea manager's tactics . Mourinho, whose relationship with Pellegrini dating back to their time in Spain could be described as frosty at best, rejected the accusations. 'Many times he says he never speaks about me and my team but he keeps doing the same thing,' said the Portuguese. 'I am the one that does as he says. I don't comment on his words. Don't ask me about his words, I am not interested in that. 'It is one point won because we arrived here leaders with two points more than second and we leave the stadium with a three-point lead. 'I don't look to direct opponents, I don't look to other clubs in a special way. I look to the table and we are leaders by three points. Pellegrini instructs James Milner against Chelsea, who he feels played like 'a small team' at the Etihad . 'We come here to a super-difficult stadium and a super-difficult opponent and we leave in better conditions than we arrived, so good. 'We hit the post (through Diego Costa) with a 1-0 lead and when you don't kill matches, you are in danger, especially when you play against very good teams. 'We had a tactical reaction to try to win the game. They had an emotional reaction to try not to lose the game. Mame Biram Diouf scored a fine solo goal to steer Stoke to a shock 1-0 win over Manchester City last month . 'We were successful in our tactical change to try to win the game because we scored and had more chances to score and they were successful in their emotional reaction and I think in the end from my perspective the point is maybe a point that they deserve.' Mourinho let Lampard go at the end of last season and he subsequently joined City's Major League Soccer venture in New York being loaned back to the parent club, but he did not want to comment on the midfielder's significant contribution to the result. 'I don't speak about players from other teams, I am sorry. I don't speak about Frank,' he added. 'To speak about Frank is to speak about my past with Frank, the player he was for what he means in my career. Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . 'I will never tire to speak about this. The moment he is a Man City player, he is a Man City player. 'Mr Pellegrini, instead of speaking about other teams' players, should speak about Frank Lampard. 'I am Chelsea manager, I speak about my players. My players were fantastic.' Pellegrini, however, was only too happy to talk about the 36-year-old's contribution. 'When I sent Lampard into the game I told him go and score. I was so sure Frank would play well against Chelsea because he is a very good professional,' said the Chilean. The former England star looked apologetic as he refused to celebrate, and then applauded both sets of fans .","Manchester City drew 1-1 with Chelsea at the Etihad stadium on Sunday .

Gallacher failed to recover from his opening round of 78 at Celtic Manor, with his second round 70 leaving him five shots below the cut line. Shane Lowry shot a 65 to take a one-shot lead after the second round of the Wales Open  in Newport . Stephen Gallacher's Ryder Cup preparations suffered a blow after he missed the cut . 'I've missed the cut but there's no alarm bells ringing and I am looking forward now to next week,' Gallacher said. 'I just felt that I was trying maybe a wee bit too hard yesterday and teeing-up thinking too much about next week, whereas today I was a lot more focused... I feel good both mentally and physically so there should be no concern come next Friday.'

"Rory McIlroy knows he will be the man with a target on his back at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next week… and he can’t wait. The world number one was responding to American captain Tom Watson’s comments that he wants his team to ‘take down the top dogs,’ a reference to McIlroy and Ian Poulter. ’It’s a massive compliment whenever the opposition are talking about you,’ McIlroy told Sportsmail. Rory McIlroy is determined to accept the responsibility of being Europe's leading man at the Ryder Cup . World No 1 was in London to launch Santander's 123 World in front of Tower Bridge . McIlroy can't contain his laughter while watching London Mayor Boris Johnson taking a shot . ‘I know what a huge fillip it would be for them if I lose but it is up to me to make sure it doesn’t happen. I’m a double major champion this year and it’s important that I embrace that and step up and take on the responsibility. 'I know I will have a target on my back but I love that and I am going to play up to it as much as I can. ‘Whoever they want to send out against me, it’s no problem to me. I want to lead from the front and by example, and I’m confident enough in the way I am playing right now to do that.’ Game on, then. McIlroy wants to emulate Europe's success from the 2012 Ryder Cup, the so-called 'Miracle of Medinah' US captain Tom Watson has called for his team to go take down Europe's 'top dogs' McILroy and Ian Poulter, playing together at the 2012 Ryder Cup, are regarded as Europe's danger men . McIlroy addressed a number of pertinent topics during a sponsorship day to help launch Santander’s 123 World against the fabulous backdrop of London’s Tower Bridge on Thursday. He laid to rest any lingering questions regarding his formidable Ryder Cup partnership with Graeme McDowell and hinted at a possible fourballs pairing with French rookie Victor Dubuisson. The 25 year old also gave his first public comments regarding the actions of the judge who intervened this week in McIlroy’s increasingly bitter legal dispute with his former management company and ordered the two sides to get together to try to thrash out their differences. ’We welcome what the judge had to say,’ explained McIlroy. ‘It’s what we have been trying to do for the last six months but it’s been like arguing with a brick wall, so it’s great he has ordered the two sides to get together. It needs resolving, because it has gone on for far too long. It’s the one distracting thing I have left behind the scenes although, thankfully, I’ve made sure it’s not been that distracting. But when that’s gone, that’s everything.’ McIlroy insists his legal dispute with former management company Horizon will not influence his relationship with Graeme McDowell (L) The Northern Irishman shakes hands with Billy Horschel after losing out in the FedEx Cup play-offs . McIlroy has hinted that he may play four-balls at Gleneagles with French rookie Victor Dubuisson . McIlroy’s old management company Horizon also looked after McDowell – that contract has also just ended, albeit amicably - and the latter confessed the dispute had placed a strain on his friendship with the former. But McIlroy dismissed any notion it was long-lasting or should give Europe captain Paul McGinley any cause for second thoughts about pairing them once more next week. ‘I’d love to play with G-Mac,’ said McIlroy. ‘I think everyone can see the chemistry we have together and there’s no reason why it can’t be the same this time. This whole thing about our friendship has been blown up so much. We were both playing in Denver two weeks ago and went out to dinner together. There’s no problem between us.’ The 25-year-old poses with the Claret Jug after winning the Open at Hoylake this year . McIlroy won his second major of the year by claiming the PGA Championships with a one-stroke victory . It’s a partnership we’re more likely to see in foursomes than fourballs, though. As for the latter, there has been some talk on the practice ground that McIlroy is keen on the idea of shepherding a rookie, and there was one particular debutant he was happy to throw into the mix. ‘Of all the guys in our team I guess I know Victor the best because we grew up playing amateur golf together,’ said McIlroy, about the gifted but enigmatic Frenchman Dubuisson. ‘I’m not close to him but I’ve known him a lot longer, so if Paul wants to throw him into the deep end with me, I’d have no qualms about that.’ After eight tournaments in ten weeks, McIlroy looked remarkably fresh, despite only having a day at home. He returned to Northern Ireland last night, but will fly back to London on Saturday evening for the George Groves fight, before heading up to Gleneagles a day earlier than the rest of the team. ‘I’ve got a full day planned with Steve (McGregor, his fitness guru) and Michael (Bannon, his swing coach),’ he said. McIlroy will be pleased that Tiger Woods, pictured together on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, will not be competing for the US team at Gleneagles . Europe fans will be hoping to witness McIlroy holding aloft the Ryder Cup again at the end of next weekend . Before our chat, McIlroy played a few stunt shots to a target situated in the Thames in front of the curious thousands who lined the embankment in beautiful autumn sunshine and, naturally, hit it effortlessly. Which was more than could be said for London’s game Mayor Boris Johnson, who showed he is no golfer. Asked if he gave Boris a lesson, McIlroy smiled. ‘He certainly needs a few,’ he replied. When he finally got one airborne, the Mayor was sharp enough when someone asked if he had made a good swing. ‘Never mind me. We need the right swing tonight,’ he said, referring to Scotland’s independence referendum. As for McIlroy, all Europe will be counting on him making plenty of right swings there next week.

"Jose Mourinho says Frank Lampard's love story with Chelsea was over way before he scored Manchester City's late equaliser against his side on Sunday. Chelsea's all-time record goalscorer emerged from the bench to haunt his old side with a dramatic leveller at the Etihad on Sunday, but Mourinho refused to let sentiment get the better of him when asked about the on-loan Manchester City midfielder in his post-match interview with Sky Sports. He said: 'Frank Lampard is a Man City player, I don't believe in stories of passion and heart, maybe I am too pragmatic in football. Jose Mourinho says Frank Lampard's love story with Chelsea ended when he joined a title competitor . Lampard slots home from inside the penalty area to send the City fans into ecstasy against his former employers . 'When he decided to go to a direct competitor to Chelsea then love stories are over. He did his job as a professional. 'He got a good reception and this is England and this is Chelsea. Chelsea people never forget what Chelsea people do at the club. 'It happened to me when I was manager of Inter. It is Chelsea's culture and beauty.' The 51-year-old conceded a draw was a fair result, despite the Blues taking the lead through Andre Schurrle on 66 minutes against City, who had Pablo Zabaleta sent off moments before the German's opener. Mourinho added: 'We were winning the game against 10 men, but the same 10 men had a fantastic reaction and gave everything to try to equalise. Frank Lampard refuses to celebrate after equalising for Manchester City against the club he represented for 13 years . Lampard holds his hands up and looks to the skies after scoring what must have been an emotional goal for the former Chelsea man . 'When the game gets emotional the numbers are not so important. When the game is tactical - yes they are important. 'We scored, we had the game seemingly under control, we hit the post but then they scored. 'At that point the game was emotional and in that period they were psychologically stronger than us and in the end a draw is maybe a fair result.'","The Chelsea boss said Frank Lampard's love story with the club was over when he signed for the Blues' title rivals Manchester City .

"The final afternoon at Medinah in 2012, and the scoreboard for the first time is showing an ocean of European blue. Captain Jose Maria Olazabal is waiting on the 12th tee for Lee Westwood, who is in the third-last match out. ‘Do you know, I think we can win this,’ said the Spaniard to his most experienced player, with tears in his eyes. And Westwood is thinking: ‘Oh Christ, this is just what I need to see.’ A slimline Lee Westwood watches his drive as he prepares for his ninth Ryder Cup at the Wales Open . The European team celebrate their against all odds victory in 2012 in the so-called Miracle of Medinah . At home in Florida, there are photographs of some of Westwood’s great moments during an immense Ryder Cup career stretching back to 1997. There’s one highlighting a wonderful putt he holed to snatch a half in a fourballs match in Detroit in 2004 alongside Sergio Garcia. There are pictures detailing some of the fine partnerships he’s forged along the way with Darren Clarke, Sir Nick Faldo and the aforementioned Sergio. But what happened in 2012, and a singles match largely overlooked because of the drama happening elsewhere, deserves its own consideration. For this was the first of his eight Ryder Cups where Westwood was not playing the role of ‘thou shalt not pass’. He was struggling with his game. Now here he was, all square in a match against Matt Kuchar with his captain laying it all on the line. Talk about pressure. Westwood (R) pulled off an important singles win against Matt Kuchar (L) at the 2012 Ryder Cup . Captain Jose Maria Olazabal (R) embraces Westwood after returning from victory on US soil . Since his 1997 debut, Westwood has earned 21 points and been a key man in six victorious Ryder Cup teams. He has been on the losing side twice. P     W      L       H . Singles                 8      3       5       0 . Foursomes          15     7       4       4 . Fourballs             14     8       4       2 . Total                    37    18     13      6 . ‘I knew I needed to put my foot down and get the momentum in this game, and I did,’ he recalled. ‘I won the 12th and the 13th and then he holed from about 30ft for a half on 14. But I won the 15th and now I was three up with three to play. It was nice to turn it on when it was needed.’ It’s also something he can draw upon as he contemplates a ninth appearance at Gleneagles next week, following a season where there have been few sightings of his awesome ball-striking of old. But you would struggle to find many among the rank and file on the European Tour who would not have given him a wild card, even allowing for the fierce competition offered by Luke Donald. Englishman Graeme Storm offered a typical view, saying: ‘I’d go for Westy every time. You need to hit it long and straight up there and it’s a course that will suit him rather than, say, Luke.’ Westwood has forged some formidable Ryder Cup partnerships, most recently with Sergio Garcia . Westwood has hinted that he could partner Welsh rookie Jamie Donaldson at Gleneagles . Unless something goes wrong during the practice days expect Westwood, 41, to partner Welsh rookie Jamie Donaldson in the fourballs on Friday morning. ‘Paul (McGinley) and I have discussed the possibility of me being paired with the rookies,’ he said. ‘It’s a role I’ve been playing in the last two or three matches (Martin Kaymer in 2010, Nicolas Colsaerts in 2012) and would happily take on again. ‘That first day is tough for them, and not too many get to play on the first morning. But if you have to go through it, it helps to be alongside an experienced player. Westwood was grateful he could rely on the experience of partner Nick Faldo at Valderrama in 1997 . 'I remember playing on the first morning at Valderrama in 1997 and it was one of those moments where you’re shaking so hard you’re wondering if you can get the ball to stay on the tee. It helped to have Nick (Faldo) as my partner. He told me to play aggressively and not to worry about messing up, that he’d be there. Hopefully I’m a similar mentor. ‘The first couple of Ryder Cups go by in a complete blur. Now I enjoy it a lot more. It’s an enormous privilege, and the more you play in, the more you can slow it down and take it all in.’ Having played in Ryder Cups in England, Wales and Ireland, he will next week become the first player to complete the set in Scotland. He’s witnessed the two greatest comebacks from both a winning and losing point of view — Medinah last time, Brookline in 1999 — and was hugely influential in record victories on US and European soil in 2004 and 2006. Has he got another great Ryder Cup left in him?

"Paul McGinley hopes that the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles will go down as the ‘noisiest’ in the event’s history. Europe’s barely believable comeback victory at Medinah two years ago was even more impressive for being achieved amid the din of fervent home support, which had been whipped into a frenzy by the likes of Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley. But Europe captain McGinley hopes Europe fans can roar his team on to victory in Perthshire next week and again silence the Americans, who are hoping to avoid an eighth defeat in the last 10 Ryder Cups. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Paul McGinley talking about the Ryder Cup . Paul McGinley speaks about the Ryder Cup in an exclusive video for Sportsmail . The Irishman is set to go head-to-head with US captain Tom Watson (left) at Gleneagles next week . McGinley, in an exclusive video for Sportsmail, has given an insight into his dreams for the upcoming contest in Scotland, as well as his memories of past competitions. The Ryder Cup captain, who is a staff player for adidas Golf, also reveals personal insights, such as his favourite golf course, ideal playing partners and most cherished Ryder Cup memories, all of which can be seen in the video below. While the 47-year-old, admits he has admiration for loud-and-proud American patriotism, the skipper admits he hopes Tom Watson’s team are silenced into submission by the home support at Gleneagles. ‘Home advantage is very important in the Ryder Cup,’ said McGinley. ‘We’re certainly looking forward to playing in front of our home crowd. It’s going to be a lot of fun and hopefully this will go down in record as being the noisiest Ryder Cup ever.’ Lee Westwood was the man who played a very successful practical joke on McGinley in 2010 . The PGA Centenary course at Gleneagles is the battleground on which the 2014 Ryder Cup will be won . McGinley is due to play a practice round with US President Barack Obama ahead of the showdown in Scotland, and he also gave an insight into the conversation he would hold with the leader of the free world, who is well known for his love of golf. ‘I’ll tell Barack Obama that the Ryder Cup is a great a sporting event and a great golfing event,’ said McGinley. ‘It’s all about passion and representing your country. ‘As much as we as Europeans are very proud to represent Europe I think it’s great to see the Americans, the American national anthem and how passionate Americans feel representing their country.’ If McGinley appears ready to poke a bit of fun at the President over recent US defeats in the competition, he also reveals that he was once the butt of the best practical joke at a Ryder Cup during the contest at Celtic Manor in 2010. A cheeky Lee Westwood was the culprit, which should make the Englishman even more grateful for his wildcard selection by McGinley. adidas Golf is an official licensee of the 2014 Ryder Cup.

"Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day. Saturday's six fixtures brought plenty of excitement, including Arsenal's return to winning form with a 3-0 win at Aston Villa, West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool and Newcastle's comeback from two goals down at home to Hull. GK - Vito Mannone (SUNDERLAND vs Burnley) - 7 . Mannone was in top form as Sunderland earned a point at Turf Moor.

Vito Mannone makes a brave save at the feet of Burnley's George Boyd during the 0-0 Turf Moor draw . RB - Daryl Janmaat (NEWCASTLE vs Hull) - 6.5 . The Dutchman was a constant threat down the right flank as Newcastle surged back from two goals down to earn a point at home to Hull and alleviate some of the pressure on boss Alan Pardew. Newcastle United's Daryl Janmaat was the best rated right-back in the Premier League on Saturday . CB - Per Mertesacker (ARSENAL vs Aston Villa) - 7 . The giant German was an immovable object at the heart of the Arsenal defence as they recorded a welcome win and clean sheet at Villa Park. Per Mertesacker was unbeatable at centre-back for Arsenal in their victory at Aston Villa . CB - Laurent Koscielny (ARSENAL vs Aston Villa) - 7 . Alongside Mertesacker was his trusted central defensive partner Koscielny, who helped keep the Villa threat at bay and assure Arsenal of victory. Laurent Koscielny was also solid as a rock as Arsenal kept a clean sheet . LB - Andrew Robertson (HULL vs Newcastle) - 8 . Hull's summer signing from Dundee United looks every inch the Premier League player and raced up and down the left side all afternoon for the Hull cause. Andrew Robertson tackles Jack Colback during his fine performance in Hull's draw at Newcastle . MID - Victor Moses (STOKE vs Queens Park Rangers) - 8 . Moses, on loan from Chelsea, produced an accomplished performance at Loftus Road, capped by the cross for Peter Crouch's goal to put Stoke 2-1 ahead.

"Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has told Alan Pardew that he is not happy with his side’s performance on the pitch as the manager prepares for one of his ‘toughest days’ in the job. The pair held talks in the wake of last Saturday’s embarrassing 4-0 drubbing at Southampton, a result which left the Magpies bottom of the Premier League. Supporters called for Pardew to be sacked at St Mary’s and there are protests planned for Saturday’s visit of Hull City to St James’ Park. And the United boss said: ‘We (myself and Ashley) had a long conversation on Sunday and he was obviously disappointed with the performance. He has a right to be disappointed as the owner and he relayed that to me. Alan Pardew is expecting a tough day when Newcastle take on Hull on Saturday .

Papiss Cisse and his team-mates have been told now is the time to fire if they're to resurrect their season . ‘The one thing we both agreed on was that we really needed to focus on this Saturday and try to get a win for the football club. It’s very important that certain issues - particularly the issue regarding me - have to take a bit of a back seat. ‘It’s going to be a difficult environment if we have the atmosphere we had at Southampton for long periods.’ Pardew, though, did not ask his paymaster for assurances regarding his future. ‘It didn’t really come up, if I’m honest,’ he went on. ‘If it sounds like I’m trying to fudge the issue, then I’m not. We talked about the team and a couple of things that were a problem within the team - and also about the performance. ‘He was upset about the performance and that’s what we focused on. I didn’t ask for any reassurance. All I know is that I signed a long contract here for good and bad. We’ve had some great times which seem to have been forgotten recently - and some tough days too. ‘This will be one of our toughest, although I can think of some tough days I’ve had here. The environment for the players on Saturday will probably be as tough as it’s ever been and we have to accept that, knowing that Hull will come and try to make good use of our situation.’ A pamphlet that has been printed for a Newcastle United fans demonstration against Alan Pardew . The Newcastle supporters have printed thousands of posters with the simple message, 'Sack Pardew' Hull's David Meyler and Pardew clash at KC Stadium last season - the incident saw the manager suspended . Pardew admits it has been a testing week with speculation surrounding his position as manager. ‘It’s not been an easy week after the events at Southampton,’ he said. ‘As manager, you have to reflect and the performance really upset me. It wasn’t a performance I was proud of in any shape or form. We’ve spoken to the group about it. ‘I’m not going to offer any excuses but we have some new players and need to make sure that, if they go behind in games, they have a better spirit as a group. ‘We didn’t get the win we needed before then so it has put added pressure on us, particularly myself, and I’m fully aware of that.’","Mike Ashley made it clear he was disappointed with Newcastle's performances in a meeting with manager Alan Pardew .

"The weather forecast for this Saturday evening in Wembley is muggy and that is a warning to George Groves on two counts. This is not the moment for doing anything daft. Nor can he afford to be waylaid. As Saint George sets out upon the road to redemption there is no scope for another mishap. Certainly not one as calamitous as his starching by Carl Froch. George Groves (left) takes on Christopher Rebrasse (right) for the European middleweight title on Saturday . The pair will fight at Wembley Arena as Groves looks to win the belt and become WBC world title challenger . Reassuringly, he knows it. In the early part of the build up for this European super-middleweight title challenge to French holder Christopher Rebrasse, Groves talked - whimsically and almost certainly in vain - about a third tilt at world champion Froch despite two stoppages at the hands of the Nottingham Cobra. He also expanded on his writing of a sit-com and introduced the first recruits to his secondary boxing business as a now-licensed manager. But now he sounds fully focussed on what should be a routine job at hand, assuming there really are no distractions. Groves says ‘I’m back on track to win a world title and I’m aware I can’t afford another mistake.’ Groves (left) weighed in at 11st 13lb 6oz with Rebrasse (right) topping the scales at a heavier 11st 13lbs 8oz . Groves knows he must beat Rebrasse in order to save his career at the highest level and box for a world title . If any additional incentive were needed for him to rebound from that brutal knock-out inflicted by Froch in the Stadium just across the way from the Arena in which he fights Rebrasse, it comes with the WBC’s confirmation that the winner of this one will become the mandatory challenger for that organisation’s version of the world title. And Groves came in just under the 12st super-middleweight limit at 11st 13lb 6oz with Rebrasse weighing slightly more at 11st 13lbs 8oz. Groves proved adept at manipulating the alpha-belt boxing bodies when cornering Froch into two compulsory IBF belt defences in succession. Groves (left) takes is hit cleanly by Froch (right) in their rematch at Wembley in May, his second straight loss . Groves makes his return to the ring on Saturday night at Wembley as he looks to overcome Rebrasse . Now he has done it again with the WBC, much to the annoyance of their new champion Anthony Dirrell who complains that he is not worthy of the honour. To which Groves says: ‘Whether he likes it or not - and he sounds scared of me - that’s the way it is and once I’ve beaten Rebrasse I’m coming for him.’ As a lateral thinker and a young multi-tasker, Groves is one of the more interesting personalities of the prize-ring. But come this Return Of The Saint there is nothing complicated about what must be done to reactivate his career. Simply, he has to apply his superior ring-craft to a crushing of the fanciful world title aspirations of a moderate opponent. Expect a mid-fight stoppage. The Londoner has much to contemplate as he looks to rebuild his boxing reputation on a return to the ring .

"George Groves has hit back at WBC champion Anthony Dirrell after the American claimed the Saint was not a worthy challenger to his belt. Groves has been told by the WBC that he will be the mandatory challenger to Dirrell if he can beat Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse in his comeback fight this Saturday. The west Londoner has not been seen in the prize ring since he was emphatically knocked out by Carl Froch at Wembley on May 31st. But Dirrell told Sportsmail that the former British and Commonwealth super-middleweight champion does not deserve a shot at him after successive defeats to the Cobra and a potential win over 'bum' Rebrasse. George Groves (left) and Christopher Rebrasse pose for the cameras at a  press conference on Thursday . Groves (left) and Rebrasse square up to each other ahead of their fight at Wembley Arena on Saturday . Groves performs a workout for the media earlier this week ahead of his fight with Rebrasse . Groves, who faces the 28-year-old Frenchman for the European and WBC silver titles, responded: 'I'm not taking my eyes off Saturday but Dirrell seems very animated saying I don't deserve it. 'The most important bit of news regarding Dirrell is that, once I win this fight, I have confirmation that my next fight will be against him. 'We've got the letter from the WBC, on headed paper, saying the winner of this becomes his mandatory challenger. We were going to get it blown up and put it on the gym wall. 'I've sparred him, I know him a little bit, we spent some time out in Miami before my fight with James DeGale. I sparred him and his brother.He's a very good fighter and our styles would certainly gel. Groves is put through his paces in preparation for Saturday's big bout at Wembley Arena . 'He's got a lot of courage, good power but he wouldn't beat me in a month of Sundays. 'He was a nice guy then but we were not on each other's radar ­ people change once that happens so we will see how he is now.' And Groves' promoter Kalle Sauerland was left fuming by Dirrell's comments that Saturday's fight at Wembley Arena is against 'a bum' in European champion Rebrasse, known as the 'iceberg', who comes from suburban Paris. Sauerland added: 'Dirrell's statement that he's boxing a bum ­well Rebrasse is two places below him in the WBC rankings. Maybe he should drink some coffee, turn on the internet and have a look. To say the No 3 in his federation is a bum? Well that says a lot about Anthony Dirrell.' Dirrell has also stated that he has no intention of coming over to the UK should Groves earn a shot at his WBC title after his older brother, Anthony, was beaten on points by Froch in Nottingham in 2009. But Sauerland added: 'I've got history with the Dirrell family and the crap they talk about coming over to Britain and getting robbed by Carl Froch? It was a close fight. Champion Dirrell (right) lands a punch on Sakio Bika during their fight in Los Angeles last month . 'I saw what happened in Detroit with Arthur Abraham and Dirrell and it still makes my blood boil to this day. 'I'm already looking into making the [title] fight. Saturday night we're going to do a job and Monday morning we will be on the phone. We've got the money, the talent, the fans and the market. I haven't got a problem with travelling but we're not going to be dictated to.' Groves and his promoter are hoping that, should they come through against Rebrasse, they could secure the world title shot before the end of the year. Sauerland said: 'There's a loose agreement that they're [Dirrell's team] allowed to take a voluntary defence until November. 'Well we're in September and I don't see a voluntary scheduled. We'll be pushing for it and I don't know where else he can go. Cash is king in this business ­and George is cash.'","WBC super middleweight champion Anthony Dirrell claimed George Groves was not a worthy challenger to his belt .

"George Groves is writing a boxing sitcom, which he says is a mix of The Inbetweeners and Entourage. As a fan of storytelling, he believes his own career is following a far darker path but insists it will have a happy ending. Two successive defeats by arch-rival Carl Froch have left Groves at a critical point in his journey and, with a world title eliminator looming next Saturday, he knows a third loss would be fatal for his career. ‘If it was Lord of the Rings, we are still only one book in,’ he says. ‘It’s been a half-decent read but it gets better — a lot better — it may get a bit darker but we’re on our way and there are plenty more chapters to put together. I don’t quite know what is going to happen yet but we’re not even halfway through the series.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch George Groves talk exclusively to Sportsmail about his career . George Groves returns to the ring this months as he prepares to take on Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse . The next chapter will see Groves return to Wembley, albeit at the Arena rather than the stadium which was the scene of his brutal knockout by Froch in the biggest fight in British boxing history, to challenge Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse for his European title. ‘Losing this fight is a much more frightening prospect than losing to Carl Froch,’ says Groves, 26. ‘This is a must-win fight. The second Froch fight in many ways was an event bigger than boxing, it created such an atmosphere, such hype, it captured the public’s imagination and everyone seemed to be interested. But in the bigger scheme of things, this is the biggest fight of my life.’ Win on Saturday and Groves would be the mandatory challenger for the WBC super-middleweight title and back on course possibly to end 2014 as a world champion. But Groves is well aware that fairy-tales rarely happen. Carl Froch lands a punch on Groves in the biggest fight in British boxing history during their bout in May . Groves was brutally knocked out in the eight round of a second successive defeat to arch-rival Carl Froch . His first world-title shot last November ended in a controversial ninth-round stoppage, while the May rematch with Froch finished with him sprawled on the canvas in front of 77,000 people and millions more across the globe. ‘It was a strange feeling, numbing — and not just literally,’ he says. ‘You prepare mentally, physically and emotionally for a fight and it was the first time I’ve really experienced it when will and tenacity and grit and hunger aren’t enough. ‘My first thought was that I had let the whole team down and let my family down. We had worked so hard for that opportunity — it was the perfect time for me to arrive — I know other opportunities will come but that was the one I wanted. Groves has a Rubik’s Cube in his gym like the one he pulled out during a press conference with Carl Froch . The Londoner has much to contemplate as he looks to rebuild his boxing reputation on a return to the ring . ‘Losing was devastating and the first time I saw Kalle [Sauerland, his promoter] I said sorry. But he said all the right things and told me to go away, have a break and not think about boxing. The next day my wife and me flew to Dubai but I could tell Kalle was working on a comeback fight. He didn’t want to bother me but I’m there sending him texts about who and when I think I should be boxing next. ‘I just wanted to get stuck into training again as soon as possible. The Froch fight wasn’t a physically brutal fight where you needed months to recover from injuries or cuts — it was probably the least aching fight I’ve ever had — and I was literally back in the gym a week later. ‘It was harder to recover mentally and emotionally. I was expecting to crash and start thinking I needed a break or start feeling sorry for myself. But as time went on I realised that is not really who I am. I got knocked out, it happens but that doesn’t mean I need to start doubting myself or feeling sorry for myself. ‘It has not necessarily been about going back to the drawing board and changing myself too much as a fighter. It’s about becoming more emotionally strong. ‘I’m always going to be sad about losing and I’ll never get over that. But I don’t want to. I’m not a person who is content in life — I always want to be better and achieve more and I’m certainly more determined now.’ Groves appears relaxed but focused as he trains ahead of his European title fight with Christopher Rebrasse . Brash and abrasive in the build-up to both fights with Froch, Groves is much quieter in person and at times is barely audible as trains rattle above his west London gym. He remains as confident as ever though. ‘If someone said: “Do you want to fight Carl Froch next month” I’d say: “100 per cent” and I’d tell everyone I’d knock him out and believe it,’ said Groves. ‘I trust in my abilities, my work ethic and in my ambition to improve and become the most complete fighter I can be. ‘I still feel I will be considered a great fighter one day, that’s the goal and that hasn’t changed off the back of two losses. I have a deep, ignorant conviction that I’m a great fighter and nobody has yet been able to prove to me that isn’t the case.’ Asked where this confidence and resilience stems from, Groves cites the support of wife Sophie, who interrupts the interview to ensure Groves eats his avocado and salmon salad lunch, and parents Yvonne and Donny. It is a close-knit family and Groves admits the defeats have been hard for his loved ones. ‘I know they were devastated and it must have been tough especially for my dad — he re-decorated the gym before I got back from Dubai because he wanted it to be like a fresh start, which was sweet. The 26-year-old lands a punch onto Froch during their first bout which was controversially stopped . Groves was stopped in the ninth round in his first fight with Froch, prompting immediate calls for a rematch . ‘My parents are not necessarily confident people. If you go on holiday with them they’re not the ones up on stage doing karaoke or anything like that, but at the same time they’ve always encouraged me to be the best I can be. 'They’ve given me loads of love and support and that obviously develops confidence.Anything I know I’m good at, I’m happy to stand in front of a crowd and show off. Ask me to sing or dance and I’d start sweating but, when it comes to boxing, I know what I’m doing.’ Hanging in his gym is a symbol of that: the Rubik’s Cube he pulled out during the build-up to the second Froch fight. It was a moment that simultaneously demonstrated Groves’ ability to sell a fight and play mind games with an opponent. ‘All that was good fun but it’s nice to have a break from it. I feel I know how to tell a story and take people on a journey and that is what you want in boxing. Floyd Mayweather is very good at it, there’s always some sort of controversy ahead of his fights and that is what keeps him interesting and relevant. When my time comes — when I win the WBC title and maybe challenge for a unification fight — I’ll embrace it.’ Groves has always enjoyed mind games and is always able to sell a fight  as this Rubik's cube stunt shows . Groves’ antics outside the ring saw him cast as an arrogant upstart but two heroic performances won much admiration and respect. ‘I’m a much more high-profile boxer now — people are excited about me and want to come see me box. But the flipside is would I trade all that for two wins and a world title? Of course. You want to become a world champion. But you also want to entertain and fight for the fans — so if I’m in more big fights that is just as exciting to me.’ And Groves has not given up on a third instalment with Froch next year. He said: ‘If I had knocked him out I’d have been satisfied with that but he’s not satisfied because he knows he was getting beaten up until that point. Take nothing away from Carl Froch, he found the target with the best punch of his career, but maybe there’s a part of him that thinks: “I wish it wasn’t so lucky”. ‘At various times since the last fight he has had swipes at me, the latest one being that I wasn’t the fighter he was and he was the superstar, but his fight hasn’t been announced yet. He’s rolling around on TV in tights and we’ll see how well he does when his tickets go on sale. We’re not friends, he doesn’t like me. I feel there is a possibility a third fight could happen.’ Whether Groves gets the chance remains to be seen. For now, he must make sure the next chapter of his story is a happy one.

"Alex Song will come up against his idol Steven Gerrard on Saturday - having first met the Liverpool skipper as an awe-struck child. Former Arsenal midfielder Song is in line to make his full West Ham debut, and is likely to spend the afternoon looking to keep Gerrard, the man he believes is Liverpool's greatest ever player, as quiet as possible. Having made his Hammers bow in Monday night's 2-2 draw at Hull, the 27-year-old Cameroon international is once again looking forward to locking horns with the former England captain. Alex Song (right) will come up against his idol Steven Gerrard - having first met the Liverpool skipper as a child . 'It's not just focused on one player but I think Gerrard is the best player I've seen in a Liverpool shirt for me. It's my own opinion,' said Song, who is on loan from Barcelona. 'I have played against him a lot and every time I play against him, I have thought, 'Today will be very hard'. 'He has achieved a lot of things at Liverpool and is still only 34 years old. But he is still good enough to play - he can play maybe till he's 40. When I see him run, he is a very good example to the young players coming through. 'I think it is very important to have those kind of loyal players who play for Liverpool for a long time. It is a very different team when Gerrard is not in it. 'I like Stevie's style and the way he plays. When you are a midfielder, you try to watch other midfielders and how they play. For me, he is a great player - one of the best. Gerrard - photographed at Melwood on Thursday - takes his Liverpool side to West Ham on Saturday . His cousin Rigobert Song (playing for West Ham) passed on Gerrard's shirt back in 1999 . 'I always try to watch the best players in my position and try to learn. Gerrard is one of the players I was watching when I was young.' Song's respect for Gerrard is well-rooted after he first met him during a trip to England to visit his cousin Rigobert Song, who was at Liverpool at the time. He said: 'I remember the first time I played against Liverpool was unbelievable. The first time I went to England was 1999 when I was watching Rigobert play. It was crazy because I took some pictures with the players - I was 12 years old. 'Then Rigobert gave me Gerrard's shirt from that day and I have kept it. I was training every single day in it and then when I played at Anfield it it was against Gerrard, (Michael) Owen and (Robbie) Fowler - I never forgot this in my life. 'That day, I still have the picture I took with Fowler, and I was looking before the game to say their life was crazy and now I'm playing against them. That is a very good thing. 'I have still got the shirt. When you are young and someone gives you a shirt, you have to keep it.' West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will be hoping Song is not in awe of Gerrard on Saturday as he looks to prevent the Liverpool skipper having the same impact he did in the corresponding fixture last season. Gerrard scored two penalties either side of a Guy Demel goal to earn a 2-1 win for Brendan Rodgers' side - their ninth successive victory in what proved to ultimately be an unsuccessful push for the Barclays Premier League title.","Alex Song signed for West Ham United in August .

"UEFA President Michel Platini has criticized FIFA for publicly rebuking football executives who accepted luxury gifts at the World Cup, saying he will donate around £16,000 to charity rather than return a watch. A FIFA statement on Thursday warned officials they had until next month to return the Brazilian football federation watch or face ethics proceedings for accepting a gift that had more than a 'symbolic or trivial value.' UEFA president Michel Platini says he will not return the gift but will instead donate money to charity . A luxury Parmigiani watch was given to representatives from all 32 countries at the World Cup . The watch that has caused the controversy is worth £16,400 and is made by the luxury watchmaker Parmigiani Fleurier. With each watch taking upwards of 400 hours to make by hand with precious metals and stones, the timepieces are extremely-highly sought-after and are very expensive. The watch given to Platini is worth £16,400, but some Parmigiani watches - for example the Bugatti 370 model - cost £122,000 each. Approximately £1million of Parmigiani watches were handed out in 65 gift bags by the Brazilian football federation to 32 representatives from World Cup competing countries, FIFA executive members and South American officials at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo in June. Platini said: 'If the ethics committee was not pleased, they should've told us that four months ago in Brazil, when we received the watches. 'They were aware that we were receiving these watches because everybody received them.' Platini, who is also a FIFA vice president, added: 'I don't return gifts.' Instead he will pay 25,000 Swiss francs (£16,400) to charity. The UEFA President has hit out at FIFA for asking executives to return the luxury watches .","UEFA President was given the watch by Brazilian football federation .

"The Rugby Football Union has been criticised for its use of the Victoria Cross emblem on new England kits launched this week. The Victoria Cross, the British and Commonwealth armed forces' most prestigious medal, has only been awarded 1,354 times during its 158-year existence, most recently in 2012. England's new Canterbury-manufactured shirts - the traditional white jersey and a new crimson alternate shirt - feature Victoria Cross designs that comprise numerous small rubber grips to help deaden the impact of the ball. England players wear the new England rugby home kit, which has caused controversy . England's players model the alternative red kit they will wear . Geoff Parling wearing the new England home kit, a uniform now mired in controversy . The new white shirt will be worn for the first time when England kick off their autumn Test schedule by hosting world champions New Zealand on November 8. But Gary Stapleton, chairman of the Victoria Cross Trust, has hit out at the move. 'It's very frustrating when you see the image being used for marketing purposes,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I think about how much work we put in and the volunteers put in and the work we do restoring the VC graves, and here's an organisation that's probably going to make quite a large amount of money from sales of said shirts. 'It would've been a bit more appropriate if they'd said they'd like to do this because they believe what the Victoria Cross represents and would like to benefit a charity that does actually care about the history of the VC.' While the secretary of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, Didy Grahame, said: 'It’s very disrespectful to use it out of context. That’s quite wrong.' England head coach Stuart Lancaster has drawn heavily on England's rich rugby history to instil a stronger sense of national pride throughout his tenure as head coach. Lancaster created the Arthur Harrison Award, where England coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance. Harrison is England's only rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the Zeebrugge raid of April 1918 in the First World War. England Sevens, meanwhile, launched shirts earlier this year bearing crosses inspired by the George Cross military medal. The England rose badge has moved from the left, pictured, to the centre of their shirts . In a joint statement with Canterbury, the RFU said: 'The grip detail takes inspiration from the Victoria Cross and drawing on this symbol of valour is something of which England Rugby and Canterbury are honoured and very proud. 'We have raised a significant sum overs the years for military charities such as Help for Heroes. 'For every international England Rugby hosts a group of injured service personnel and provides complimentary Twickenham tickets to several service charities. 'We have a long-standing relationship with the Royal British Legion and support their poppy appeal at the relevant Twickenham international every year.'","Victoria Cross is the most prestigious medal awarded to armed forces .

"Tim Cahill has lavished praise on David Moyes and has revealed his former manager is 'chomping at the bit' to return to management following his Old Trafford dismissal. Moyes caught up with Cahill in New York last week after taking time out to visit his former Everton talisman during a trip to the States and the Australian has since commented on the 51-year's desire to bounce back from his nightmare spell at Manchester United. Cahill, who worked under Moyes for eight years during his time at Goodison Park, said: 'I think he's enjoying himself by having some time off.

New York Red Bulls ace Cahill also stated his admiration for a manager who gave him the chance to express himself at the highest level of English football. 'He's a man I admire a lot as a manager and obviously as a person,' added Cahill. 'Moyes is fantastic. He's a fantastic man who has done a lot for my career on and off the park.'

"The makers of the latest edition of FIFA 15 have promised it to be the most realistic ever, with the new 'Parking the Bus' mode a welcome addition to the game - especially if you're Jose Mourinho. The brand new feature will allow you to set all of your players to drop back into their own area and frustrate the opposition, all with the click of a button. Mourinho has previously criticised the likes of Sam Allardyce and Tim Sherwood for adopting the tactic. Eden Hazard and Lionel Messi form the new look cover of EA Sports' latest FIFA video game . Jose Mourinho has adopted a Park the Bus tactic in the past despite claiming he is not a fan of it . The FIFA player ratings have caused a great deal of excitement ahead of the launch of FIFA 15 . Chelsea winger Eden Hazard is the only Premier League player to be in the top 10 ratings with a score of 88 . New Chelsea striker Diego Costa . However, the 51-year-old, who all the way back in 2004 famously vented his frustration at Tottenham for parking the bus at Stamford Bridge in a 0-0 draw, may well be a fan of the new feature after masterclassing the tactic in the past. The most prominent example of that was when his Inter Milan side produced a defensive masterclass to hold on at the Nou Camp and earn a place in the 2010 Champions League final. He also utilised it effectively last season as Chelsea secured a 2-0 win at Anfield in April, as a result stemming criticism from his counterpart and friend Brendan Rodgers. Whether Jose likes it or not it is bound to be a hit with people playing the game who are holding out for a draw or better holding on to a 1-0 lead.","The new edition of FIFA, set to be released on September 26, includes a new Park the Bus mode tactic .

"It will become a familiar sight as the season wears on. Every time Manchester United are awarded a free-kick in the general vicinity of the penalty box, a debate will ensue. Angel di Maria will fancy his chances and Robin van Persie will think it's well within his range. Juan Mata will remind everyone that he has a good track record and Wayne Rooney will try to pull rank as captain. Radamel Falcao may well join the conversation too and others will throw in their thoughts. If competition for places in United's starting line-up is intense for the Louis van Gaal-acticos, then the struggle to become regular free-kick taker is going to be really interesting. Louis van Gaal has plenty of players capable of striking a set-piece at Manchester United . Angel di Maria got his Manchester United career off to a flying start by scoring direct from a free-kick in the 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers last Sunday - though he may not have meant it . Juan Mata is also a fine striker of a set-piece and is a candidate to take them regularly for United . Each of those five players is capable of taking a good free-kick but, of course, only one can win the argument each time. New £60m signing Angel di Maria staked an early claim when he swung in United's opening goal from a wide free-kick against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. He succeeded in delivering the ball into the 'corridor of uncertainty', deceived goalkeeper Rob Green when everyone else missed it and found the far corner of the net. Whether he meant it barely matters. Trouble is, Di Maria's qualities with the dead ball are unproven. He may well be an expert but with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the Real Madrid side he didn't get much of a look in. As captain, Wayne Rooney may be able to pull rank when it comes to taking free-kicks . Robin van Persie is also capable of scoring direct from a free-kick . New loan signing Radamel Falcao can also strike the dead ball well . Goals and assists from free-kicks since the start of the 2011-2012 season: . Wayne Rooney – 5 goals (1 assist) Juan Mata – 4 (3) Robin van Persie – 2 (3) Angel di Maria – 1 (2) Radamel Falcao – 1 (0) Source: Opta . And while he can evidently deliver a killer ball from the wide positions, there are better candidates when the ball is close to the box in a central position. Juan Mata is chief among them - he has scored four goals directly from free-kicks for Chelsea and United since 2011. Two of them came at the tail end of last season, either side of David Moyes's sacking, against Newcastle United and Southampton. In that same period of time, Mata has also contributed three assists from free-kicks, adding to his worth with from set-piece situations. But many have predicted Mata will be the unfortunate one to lose his place as Van Gaal somehow tries to cram all his expensive players into his line-up, so step forward Wayne Rooney. The United captain has curled home five free-kicks over the last three-and-a-bit seasons and is among the best from the 18-30 yard range. Di Maria practises his free-kicks at Old Trafford prior to the match with QPR . Di Maria's (not in picture) free-kick evaded everyone in the penalty box and deceived Rob Green . Mata was on target from open play in the four-goal demolition of QPR . Last season he found the target against Crystal Palace, Manchester City and West Brom with direct free-kicks, rare moments of joy as Moyes struggled to gather points early in the campaign. And now that he has the armband, Rooney will have that little bit extra clout in those all-important negotiations at free-kicks. But he's by no means the only capable front man. Robin van Persie is also an accomplished striker of a free-kick - just ask City, who were on the receiving end of his accurate boot in the last minute of the December 2012 meeting at the Etihad. Rooney curls home a free-kick in United's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Old Trafford last season . Rooney celebrates his free-kick goal against Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final in March 2013 . Robin van Persie curls home his stoppage time free-kick against Manchester City in 2012 . The Dutchman can't quite match Rooney's record - he has scored with just two since 2011 - but is willing and able if needed. Last but not least is Radamel Falcao. He'll be more use in the box to get his head on the cross or pick up the scraps but the hotshot loanee striker can score direct from set pieces too, as shown by this one for Atletico Madrid against Real Sociedad in October 2012. The stats suggest Mata is the best choice but of course each situation will be different. This is one argument Van Gaal might leave to the players to sort out amongst themselves.","Louis van Gaal is blessed with plenty of accomplished free-kick takers at Manchester United .

"Mark Hughes has revealed his time at Queens Park Rangers was ‘without a shadow of a doubt’ his toughest time in management but insisted he has ‘no cross to bear’ over the manner of his departure. Harry Redknapp has claimed there was ‘not a good atmosphere’ when he took over from Hughes in November 2012 but the Stoke City manager says there was ‘resentment around the place’ even when he walked in 10 months earlier. Hughes took over from Neil Warnock with the club struggling against relegation but kept the side up after making a number of high-profile signings. Stoke manager Mark Hughes admits he found the going tough during his time as QPR manager . Hughes speaks with QPR owner Tony Fernandes (L) before poor results led to his departure . He then brought more players into the club in a bid to strengthen the squad but admits the dressing room dynamic ‘didn’t work’ as QPR began the following season without a win in 12 games. ‘At the end of the day I was judged on results,’ he said. ‘So I lost my job I accept that. I was the figurehead of the club at that time. I haven’t got any cross to bear whatsoever. Hughes cuts a frustrated figure as QPR manager in a game against his current club Stoke in 2012 . Rangers boss Harry Redknapp claims there was a 'bad atmosphere' after taking over from Hughes . ‘It was a difficult period, difficult job when I first went in. I had 16 or 17 games and we needed to keep QPR in the league, which we were very pleased to. ‘We made a lot of changes which we felt would enhance the club. Sometimes it doesn’t come off and you hold your hands up. The players were very good but the dynamic of the dressing room didn’t work. ‘We weren’t trying to damage the club. That time wasn’t great for anybody connected to the club. ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I felt we could have turned it around. It’s been done before. It was done last year at Crystal Palace. There were still good players. QPR have lost three of their four league games so far this season, including defeat to Manchester United . ‘It was difficult when I walked in. The atmosphere wasn’t easy, there was a bit of resentment around the place. You try to address that. ‘We made big decisions. I felt at the end of the season the squad wasn’t strong enough to stay in the league. We had the opportunity to change that. ‘The feeling is too many came in at the same time.

"Alan Pardew has called on his Newcastle players to ‘stand up and deliver’ as he prepares for a hostile afternoon at St James’ Park with one protest group having printed 35,000 cards demanding he be sacked. The Magpies – beaten 4-0 at Southampton last weekend to leave them propping up the Premier League table - face Hull City on Saturday. Before the match the people behind the website sackpardew.com will attempt to distribute the A4 cards calling for the manager to be dismissed. Alan Pardew's Newcastle have performed poorly since January when they sold Yohan Cabaye . Newcastle fans have never really taken to Alan Pardew and are now calling for his head . They hope the cards – and upwards of 200 anti-Pardew banners – will then be displayed inside the stadium. Tyneside-based firm printnortheast told Sportsmail they were happy to provide the 35,000 cards free of charge in support of the protest. However, we understand the demonstration will not force owner Mike Ashley into ending Pardew’s four-year tenure and he will be given time to turn results around, regardless of the outcome against Hull. The Newcastle boss, though, wants his under-performing players to snap from their early-season slumber and ease the pressure on himself this weekend. ‘I don’t know about patience, this is a time to stand up and deliver really,’ said Pardew when asked if his side – with seven summer signings – needed time to gel. ‘Saturday is an important game for us because we’ve had a difficult start. ‘Even if we’d got a point (at Southampton) it would have been an okay start because I think we’ve had some tough games. ‘But now we have a game at home where the pressure is really going to be on us. We have to deliver.’ Newcastle owner Mike Ashley handed Alan Pardew an eight-year contract less than two years ago . Steve Bruce has been strongly linked with replacing Alan Pardew should the position come available . Pardew says that he takes responsibility for the start which has seen United pick up just two points from four games, as he reflected on the horror show at St.Mary’s during which fans chanted throughout for him to go. ‘It was a tough day to take,’ he said. ‘As a group and individually we’re better than that, and I take responsibility for that. ‘It was a heavy defeat when we were looking for so much more. It was a tough day for our fans, a tough day for the team and, certainly, a tough day for me.’ Newcastle conceded inside the first minute in their last home game – a 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace – and also fell behind early at Southampton. A repeat on Saturday would intensify the poisonous atmosphere which is already anticipated. And Pardew went on: ‘We have spoken about how important making a good start is. ‘But that’s something that we can’t do. We conceded very early against Crystal Palace as well. ‘That will put us on our guard for Saturday to make sure it’s something we do (start well). ‘The worry (also) is how many goals are we going to score? We’re aware of that. We need to find a formula which will get us some goals.’","Alan Pardew is reportedly close to the sack after a poor start to the season for Newcastle .

"CLICK HERE to register - FOR FREE - and starting spending your £100million now... As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. BOJAN KRKIC IN A NUTSHELL . Plenty wonder whether Lionel Messi could hack a wet, windy Tuesday night in Stoke, and this may be the closest we'll ever get to finding out. But who is the man that made sure his name was on the team sheet before Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thierry Henry at Barcelona? Quite simply, it's none other than Stoke City's new forward. In the 2007-08 season, a teenager by the name of Bojan Krkic was breaking into the Barcelona first team - and nothing was getting in his way. He became the youngest-ever goalscorer for the La Liga giants in October 2007 against Villarreal - aged 17 years and 54 days - and was called up to the Spain squad, only for illness to hinder him. Now,  he's 23, has had his share of tough times with Ajax, Roma and AC Milan, and is about to be given a taste of the Premier League. Will you pick Bojan Krkic? The Stoke City forward costs just £7.1million in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game . BORN: Spain, August 28 1990 (age 23) 2006-2007: Barcelona B (22 apps, 10 gls) 2007-2011: Barcelona (104, 26) 2011-2013: Roma (33, 7) 2012-2013: AC Milan (loan) (19, 3) 2013-2014: Barcelona (0, 0) 2013-2014: Ajax (loan) (24, 4) 2014-NOW: Stoke (0, 0) HONOURS . Barcelona: La Liga (2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11), Copa del Rey (2008-09), Supercopa de Espana (2009, 2010), Champions League (2008-09, 2010-11), UEFA Super Cup (2009), FIFA Club World Cup (2009) Ajax: Eredivisie (2013-14), Johan Cruyff Shield (2013) Spain: U17 Championship (2007), U21 European Championship (2011) Individual: La Liga Breakthrough Player of the Year (2008) WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE BOJAN IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . There's little shame in being bumped out of a Barcelona team overwhelmed by frighteningly-good talent, but the Spaniard learned a thing or two during his spells at the Nou Camp. Most importantly, he proved a natural born goalscorer. He'll nab a goal or two on more than the odd occasion in the Premier League, and looks to be a steal at £7.1million, particularly after proving a quick starter already. In three pre-season games, Bojan scored three goals against Schalke, Blackburn Rovers and Real Betis. There's nothing to suggest he won't continue that trend throughout the season. He did learn from the best in Spain after all. He can only hope his so-so form at Roma and Ajax don't follow him to Stoke. TELL ME SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT BOJAN . How does being Barcelona's youngest-ever goalscorer strike you? Or what about being the youngest-ever player for the club to feature in the Champions League? Or breaking Lionel Messi's record as the youngest Barca player to compete in La Liga? Perhaps most importantly, Bojan broke Raul's record of most goals scored in a debut season, netting 10 times at the age of 17. Yikes. Former: Bojan broke a series of records for Barcelona and is a very exciting prospect for Stoke this season . Learned from the best: Bojan took note from the likes of Lionel Messi and Co during his spells at Barcelona . Youngest Barcelona player in La Liga against Osasuna  (aged 17 years, 18 days) Youngest Barcelona player in the Champions League against Lyon (aged 17 years, 22 days) Youngest Barcelona goalscorer with goal against Villarreal (aged 17 years, 1 month and 22 days) Youngest Barcelona player to debut for Spain after call up aged 18 . HE'S CHEAP . And that's an understatement. Can you afford not to have a punt on Bojan, even as your third-choice striker? The Stoke forward is just £7.1m, and looks well worth every penny. He raised eyebrows making the move to the Britannia, which shows how good the starlet is considered to be. At youth level, Bojan was close to scoring 900 goals in just seven seasons before pushing his way up to the first team. How Stoke City would love him to deliver such form to the Premier League. Five players more expensive than Bojan? Steven Fletcher (Sunderland, £7.5m), David Nugent (Leicester City, £7.6m),Yaya Sanogo (Arsenal, £7.2m), Arouna Kone (Everton, £7.6m) and Darren Bent (Aston Villa, £8.1m) all cost more to name a few... Making a point: Thierry Henry was kept out of the side at times by Bojan during his early days at Barcelona . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Steve Sidwell would recommend you buying Bojan, too. The 31-year-old midfielder told Talksport: 'Bojan has looked very impressive and very sharp during pre-season, and he’s scored some goals as well. 'But it’s what you expect when you look at the teams he has played for, especially his education at Barcelona. 'He’s a great prospect for us, he’s an exciting player and I’m looking forward to seeing him in action when the season begins.' On the up: Bojan will test himself in the Premier League after not-so-good stints with Roma, AC Milan and Ajax .","Stoke bought Bojan Krkic on four-year deal from La Liga giants Barcelona .

"Chelsea started off their Champions League campaign with a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to German outfit Schalke. Cesc Fabregas scored his first goal for the club to give them a first-half lead but as well as Didier Drogba was guilty of missing a gilt edged chance to increase the lead, with the hosts made to pay for their missed chances, as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's second half goal secured a draw for the visitors. Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players. Cesc Fabregas coolly slots the ball home past Ralf Fährmann to give Chelsea the lead against Schalke . CHELSEA (4-4-1-1) THIBAUT COURTOIS - When called upon was excellent, notably with his save from Boateng's strike on 39 miutes. 7. BRANISLAV IVANOVIC  - Possibly Chelsea's best player other than Costa this season and good again on Tuesday night. 7. Experienced Chelsea duo John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic in action during the first half against Schalke . JOHN TERRY - Not the steady performance expected. Struggled against a good attack. 5.5. GARY CAHILL- Like Terry, unassured. Let Draxler run through the middle of him and Terry in the first half. 5.5. FILIPE LUIS - No more than steady. Likely to be replaced by Azpilcueta on Sunday. 6. NEMANJA MATIC -  Provides the core of this Chelsea side, an increasingly influential figure at the base of midfield. 6.5. RAMIRES - Workmanlike rather than inspired. Did his job for 40 minutes, but then game began to run away from Chelsea's midfield. 6. The energetic Ramires looks to get Chelsea going in midfield during the first half against Schalke . WILLIAN -  Good in all fits and starts, with bright runs every now and then but never enough to be decisive. 6. Willian goes in for a challenge with Schalke left-back Christian Fuchs during the first half . CESC FABREGAS - Lucky to score as he fouled Meyer in the build up; missed a great chance to make it 2-0; lost possession for Schalke's equaliser. 6. The Spaniard celebrates putting Chelsea ahead inside 11 minutes against Schalke at Stamford Bridge . EDEN HAZARD - Terrified Schalke early on. Chelsea's most inventive player. But missed late volleyed chance and denied by Fahrmann on 85 minutes. 7.5 . Eden Hazard looks to get on the attack during the first half of Chelsea's clash with Schalke . DIDIER DROGBA - Not the Drogba of old. A yard slower, a degree less frightening. It's not the same. 5.5. Dider Drogba, making his first start of the season for Chelsea, looks on during the first half against Schalke . SUBS: . OSCAR - Brought on to add more flair and helped lift Chelsea. 6.5. LOIC REMY - Great strike on 78 minutes that was headed off line by Neustadter. 6.5. DIEGO COSTA - Not enough time to make his customary impact. 6. MANAGER: JOSE MOURINHO - Tried to lift his team with substitutions but it was a flat night for Chelsea. 6. Jose Mourinho looks on during the first half of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Schalke . SCHALKE (4-4-1-1) RALF FAHRMANN - Great save from Hazard at the end to earn his side a point. 7.5 . Schalke keeper Ralf Fahrmann celebrates with defender Roman Neustadler after the 1-1 draw with Chelsea . MARCO HOGER - Had the misfortune to be up against Hazard. 5.5. AYHAN - For one so young, acquitted himself well. Schalke had three centre halves out injured. 7. ROMAN NEUSTADER - Superb header off the line to stop Remy's shot and dealt well with Drogba. 7. CHRISTIAN FUCHS - Grew into the game and contributed to manfully to Schalke's back line. 6. Willian goes in for a challenge with Schalke left-back Christian Fuchs during the first half . SIDNEY SAM - Didn't stop running and caused Chelsea occasional shaky moments. 6. KEVIN PRINCE-BOATENG - His aggression threatens to get the better of him - but he is a vital cog in this Schalke side. 7. Kevin-Prince Boateng put in another typically boisterous performance at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night . DENNIS AOGO - At times over-run but kept his head and helped Schalke back into the game. 6.5. JULIAN DRAXLER - A constant thorn in Chelsea's side, strolling through the wide spaces in midfield to set up equaliser. 8. MAX MEYER - Unlucky to concede possession for Chelsea's goal when he was fouled by Fabregas. 6. KLAAS-JAN HUNTELAAR - A captain's performance. Held the line wonderfully and took his goal brilliantly. 7.5. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar finishes superbly from close range after excellent build-up play from Schalke . Schalke players celebrates Huntelaar's equaliser during the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . ERIC MAXIM CHOUPO-MOTING - Helped Schalke see out the game and get their point. 6.

"Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta was visibly disappointed after the Gunners suffered a 2-0 defeat in their Champions League Group D opener at Borussia Dortmund. Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck either side of half-time and the German club would have been more emphatic victors than 2-0 but for the reflexes of Wojciech Szczesny and their own wastefulness. Arteta told Sky Sports 5: 'We faced a tough side in one of the most difficult stadiums in Europe, we knew that from the start. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta and vice-captain Per Mertesacker look on after conceding in Dortmund . Ciro Immobile scores Borussia Dortmund's first goal on the stroke of half time which Arteta called sloppy . 'They put us under pressure, it was very sloppy from us to concede the goal with 20 seconds to go in the first half from a long throw from the other side of the pitch and after you are 1-0 down, it's very difficult. They are very quick on the break and we didn't perform well enough tonight.' The 32-year-old Spaniard was aware of the pace Dortmund had up front which Arsenal failed to cope with. He added: 'They put a lot of pace and a lot of pressure up front. When they play here and when you (are familiar) - we've been playing here every year in the Champions League - but we couldn't cope with that and we gave the ball away too many times in our own half in difficult positions.' For the second time in two matches Danny Welbeck illustrated why his finishing is considered below par for a top forward by failing to convert a one-on-one with a goalkeeper. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made it 2-0 early in the second period as Borussia Dortmund dominated . Arsene Wenger looks on as his side are completely dismantled by a high-energy Borussia Dortmund . With the match goalless and Arsenal under relentless attack, Welbeck managed to drag Aaron Ramsey's clever pass wide with just Roman Weidenfeller to beat. It was a key moment and the £16million signing from Manchester United, who had other chances to open his Gunners account, only enhanced concerns over his record in front of goal. On the Gunners' chances during the match Arteta added: 'They took the game from where they wanted to take it and that's the disappointing thing for us. 'I think we had three or four very clear chances and I think they had three as well very clear, when it came to chances it was probably equal but I think they were the better side tonight.' Mikel Arteta is put under pressure as the Arsenal midfielders were throughout in the Westfalenstadion . Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was delighted with the result and said matches like this make his job one of the best in the world. He said: 'We had three players ruled out of the team to muscle problems so it was not the best night we had but in the morning we made some decisions and I have to say it was a great performance from my team. It was really strong. 'We were brave and fast and really worked, it was everything we needed for this game. 'If you give them one metre of space they are so strong and they make everything with you. You need to brave against these strong players. Arsenal's new striker Danny Welbeck had the Gunners' best chance at 0-0 but slid the ball wide . 'You need go out in space and look for one-to-one situations and be brave enough to lose it because the next one is next to you. 'I enjoyed this game from the first second to the last.' Looking ahead to his side's next tough encounter - Saturday's return to the Bundesliga, Klopp added: 'We did what we have to win this game and for us it was near perfection so the important thing for me is three days and against Mainz, my former club. 'It's hard work all the time but if you see games like this, it's the best job in the world.'","Borussia Dortmund score either side of half time to win 2-0 .

"At least Lukas Podolski was able to find the humour in Arsenal's disappointing display against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, albeit with a light-hearted joke about his missing shinpad. The Gunners forward's tactical deployment from the bench for Mikel Arteta after 77 minutes in their 2-0 Champions League Group D opening loss was delayed when Podolski couldn't complete his required playing kit. After rummaging around the dugout, the Germany international had to borrow from his countryman Mesut Ozil, who had been brought off in a double substitution with Aaron Ramsey 15 minutes prior.

"Former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack claimed Mesut Ozil should have fought harder to stay at Real Madrid. The 37-year-old was at a loss to explain Ozil's poor form for Arsenal but suggested that a player of his quality should have tried harder to remain at the Spanish giants. Ballack also mentioned that the same old problems were flaring up for Ozil as, like when he was at Real, the midfielder has struggled to deal with criticism. Michael Ballack said a player of Mesut Ozil's quality should have fought harder to stay at Real Madrid . Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'What's happened with him? I don't know. There must be something behind (the scenes) because his head is mostly down, the body language is not improving even with the world champion (medal) in the pocket. 'I don't really know what's happened over the last year since he moved from Madrid to Arsenal. 'A player like him with his ability should have tried to stay longer at Real Madrid. 'That is my opinion. You could see there was a little bit trouble, a little bit moaning. I think he played well but you need time to adapt at a club. Ozil has struggled for form since moving from Madrid for £42.5 and has drawn criticism for his performances . 'If there is some ups and downs (at a club) you need to fight these things. 'And now it's a little bit the same situation. He got criticised here (at Arsenal), he's not at his best but I don't see a reaction. 'A player like him with his ability should show a reaction but he never was the strongest player in terms of fighting, body language. 'That's his weakness - especially in these situations now when he can't use his technique and his vision. Ballack claimed Arsenal fans should trust Wenger's judgement when it comes to Ozil's position in the team . But Ballack, who himself won 98 caps for Germany, insisted Ozil was a great player and could get over his rough patch. Moreover, he insisted that when it comes to Ozil's position, Arsenal fans should trust Arsene Wenger. He said: 'When you a buy a player like Ozil you know his strengths and Arsene Wenger knows I think where he is at his best. 'If he (wenger) thinks he can help the team more as a No 10 I think he would put him at No 10. 'In his younger ages when he grew up from Schalke and Werder Bremen he was mostly in the (centre of) midfield so he felt very comfortable there but in terms of pace he's good on the side as well. 'But, he needs to learn how to defend as well because on these winger positions you need to defend. 'At this level, if one player's out you have no chance.'

"It’s hardly the most auspicious time for Schalke to be travelling to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea after all are the swashbuckling, free-scoring darlings of Europe at present, spearheaded by Diego Costa, whose extraordinary start in England has already seen him score two hat-tricks and seven goals in four games. Meanwhile, last weekend in the Bundesliga, Schalke lost 4-1 to Borussia Monchengladbach, with striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar admitting ‘they could have scored ten.’ So things would have been bad enough in normal circumstances, given that manager Jens Keller’s job is in the balance, with former Mainz manager Thomas Tuchel, the latest young, hipster German, poised to take over if a poor start to the season continues. Diego Costa has started his Chelsea career in sensational style with seven goals in four matches . Schalke coach Jens Keller is under pressure ahead of the Chelsea match after a poor start to the season . Schalke captain Benedikt Howedes, who will miss the Chelsea match through injury, furiously gestures at his defence as they slipped to a 4-1 defeat at the hands of Borussia Monchengladbach . Schalke players admitted that Monchengladbach could have scored 10 in the weekend match . Schalke find themselves third bottom of the Bundesliga table after three rounds of matches . Worse, though, Benedickt Howedes, the German World Cup winner and mainstay of the defence, ripped his groin in that match and misses Wednesday night's game, meaning Schalke now have an entire back four out through injury and face the prospect of having to field a centre-half partnership with a combined age of 37 in Kaan Ayhan and Marvin Friedrich. The latter, 18, only made his debut at the weekend as a substitute. Centre-halves Josip Matip, Felipe Santana and full backs Atsuto Uchida and Sead Kolasinac are all out as well as Howedes, meaning Keller is left to fight for his future against one of the most-fearsome attacks in Europe with a make-shift defence. Even at near full strength Schalke struggled against Chelsea last season, losing 3-0 home and away. They have never scored against Chelsea in four previous matches and have conceded eight goals. All of which suggests it could be something of a goal-fest for Chelsea. And though circumstances may dictate that Eden Hazard, Oscar, Willian and Costa could have an enjoyable evening’s work given the rawness of their defensive opponents, there is a broader point to be made about Chelsea's direction of travel. Young centre-half Kaan Ayhan (right) faces the toughest test of his career against Chelsea . Ayhan will partner fellow teenager Marvin Friedrich in the centre of Schalke's defence at Stamford Bridge . Schalke get the feel of Stamford Bridge as they train on the eve of the match . There has been plenty of scepticism about the dichotomy between Roman Abramovich’s desire for sexy football and Jose Mourinho's instinctive need to defend a result. At times the tension between the two competing philosophies has threatened to tear the club apart, as it did seven years ago this week. Cast your minds back to a desperately uninspiring 1-1 draw with Rosenborg in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge in September 2007. Two days later Mourinho was sacked, Abramovich seemingly no longer content with results-focused football. Caricature Mourinho like this and he invariably bristles and points you to Real Madrid record-breaking season of 121 goals under his stewardship in 2011-12. Yet there is undoubtedly a safety-first instinct in Mourinho that is missing in his tactical adversaries such as Pep Guardiola and the Johan Cruyff school or among the next generation of innovators, such as Jurgen Klopp. Jose Mourinho appears to have found the perfect balance between attack and defence at Chelsea this season . Roman Abramovich will be very satisfied by the start Chelsea have made to the season . Loic Remy also opened his account for Chelsea in the 4-2 win over Swansea City at the weekend . It was evident as recently as last year’s Champions League semi-finals against Atletico Madrid, where caution in the first leg and a failure to react to Atletico’s aggressive attacking football in the second half of the second leg cost Chelsea. Yet in this line up, with Costa up front, a trio of playmakers behind him and with Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas – or Ramires – holding in midfield there does seem to be formidable goal-scoring potential which for the first time in years is properly balanced in midfield. Of course there is a grave danger in hailing teams on the basis of fine performances in the late summer. Roberto di Matteo’s Chelsea looked good initially. The real test will come when they are not playing against a rookie defence and some truly world-class attacks test what might well be a shaky back four. Certainly Everton and Swansea found Chelsea easy enough to breach and even Leicester and Burnley had their chances. But for now Mourinho seems to have found the right formula and tonight surely there will be much to enjoy in Chelsea’s football?","Schalke forced to field a makeshift defence in Champions League tie with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge .

"England play their first World Cup warm-up friendly on Friday against Peru, a team famous for the sash in their kit, here Sportsmail have ranked the best ten kits with a sash. It is not uncommon for teams to introduce brand new kits ahead of big tournaments or in tournament years and despite not being in the World Cup Peru have released a new home and away kit. The home kit is a classic representation of their white shirt with red sash whilst the new away kit is an interesting red kit with red sash. New: Peru unveil their new home and away kits for this year . 10. Burnley 1887-8 home . A . far cry from their claret kit of today, Burnley started with a white and . blue combo when they were formed in the late 1800s. This edition sees . white shorts with a singular dark blue sash going across the . chest. Different: One of Burnley's earliest kits doesn't look much like what they currently turn out in . 9. Southampton 1885-89 home and 2010-11 home . Sometimes it is best to go back to your roots and in the 2010-11 season Southampton did exactly that. The club were celebrating their 125th anniversary and decided to go back to the first kit the club had ever worn. Simple and effective, it is a shame it isn't in use now. Spot the difference: Southampton's kit from 1885 (left) and Rickie Lambert (right) wearing the 2010-11 version . 8. RC Lens 2013-14 away . A late entry into the contest, RC Lens ditched their traditional stripes this season and opted for a sash on both kits. The home kit is unchanged otherwise but this white and gold number looks very sophisticated. Regal: Adamo Coulibaly (second right) of RC Lens sporting their kit for the 2013-14 season . 7. Inter Milan 1993--94 away . This kit coincided with Dennis Bergkamp's first season at Inter and the club winning the UEFA Cup but that isn't why it was selected. This kit emboldens the famous black and blue of Inter in one sash without looking too big and looks impressive. European: Francesco Dell'Anno sporting Inter Milan's away kit in the season they won the UEFA Cup . 6. River Plate 2009 home . One of the most recognisable kits in the world, River's white with red sash is one kit that nearly every football fan would be able to identify. The Argentinian giants' kit is so similar year on year that it is difficult to pick one out. We've gone for the 2009 home kit which embodies everything that is great about this particular shirt. Famous: The River Plate team in 2009, sporting their famous white strip with red sash . 5. Peru 2014 home and away . The cause of this piece finding itself at number five is simple. The home kit is truly excellent, capturing the white with red sash perfectly however the away kit is a little more of a problem and that is the reason this kit isn't higher. Surely the logical thing here would have been to have had a red kit with a white sash? Red on red just doesn't look right. Good and bad: The Peru home kit (left) is let down by the away kit (right) 4. Sweden Euro 2012 away . The traditional yellow is in the sash and we think that it works really well against the darker section of the kit. International kits have the advantage of no sponsorship and if this had been a club kit there is no doubt it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good. Dynamic: Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic sports Sweden's away kit in Euro 2012 against Ukraine . 3. Crystal Palace 1980-83 home . Few clubs embrace the sash quite like Crystal Palace, throughout the club's history there are some excellent examples and narrowing them down was tricky. This effort from the early 1980s is one of their finest and although it may not have been a successful period for the club, the kit was of the highest quality. Simple: Mike Flanagan of Crystal Palace in action for his team in 1980 . 2. Crystal Palace 2013-14 away . This kit is very unlucky not to be at the top of this list but it remains a fantastic shirt. Palace are famous for their red and blue but on the black the colours seem enhanced. Crystal Palace's support gained plenty of plaudits this season, their kit also deserves a lot of recognition. Sleek: Marouane Chamakh in action in Crystal Palace's black away kit . 1. Belgium World Cup 2014 away . Belgium's football team have shot to world fame in the past couple of years with a talented young squad and a number of Premier League players in their first team. However their kits for the World Cup are also worth talking about, with the black away kit in particular standing out.

"After a disastrous World Cup for Spain, goalkeeper Iker Casillas is now feeling the pressure to turn things around at Real Madrid. Casillas appeared to be the target of jeers from some Madrid fans - while others chanted his name in support - during Madrid’s 2-1 loss Saturday to crosstown rival Atletico Madrid.

"David Moyes was not given proper backing at Manchester United according to his former player Kevin Kilbane. New boss Louis van Gaal has been given a whopping £160m to spend this summer, bringing in Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao. But Kilbane criticised the lack of time and money afforded Moyes, saying those players would still have been signed if the Scot was still at the club according to the Daily Star Sunday. Kevin Kilbane, who played under David Moyes at Everton, doesn't think his former boss was given a fair crack of the whip at Man United . Moyes' disastrous 10-month spell at Old Trafford was brought to an end in April . He said: 'If David was still the manager, United would have made exactly the same signings this summer. 'I don't imagine for one minute that Louis van Gaal has gone out and targeted Luke Shaw. That deal was done. The Ander Herrera deal was done. 'Van Gaal could have said no to those players but he is obviously happy to have them. If David was still there, he would have got the exact same players.'

"Mauro Icardi scored a hat-trick as Inter Milan trounced Sassuolo 7-0 in their second game of the Serie A season. Dani Osvaldo twice got his name on the scoresheet while Freddy Guarin and Croatian youngster Mateo Kovacic completed the rout. Walter Mazzari's side were a goal up within four minutes, Icardi's strike setting the tone for the one-sided game that would follow. Mauro Icardi scored a hat-trick for Inter Milan as they trounced Sassuolo 7-0 at the Giuseppe Meazza . Dani Osvaldo, on loan from Southampton, scored a brace - taking his inter tally to two in two . The Sassuolo defence always looked shaky and it left Icardi in acres of space on the half hour to control Hernanes' pass and curl into the bottom right corner from outside the area. It was then Osvaldo's turn to open his Inter account four minutes from half time after Dodo's initial shot was blocked by Consigli. Icardi completed his hat-trick eight minutes into the second half, with Kovacic again the provider and any hope Sassuolo had of keeping the scoreline down evaporated shortly afterwards when Berardi was dismissed. Guarin generously set up Osvaldo for the forward's second before getting on the scoresheet himself as Inter matched last season's result. Walter Mazzari's Inter side are now third in Serie A, two points behind Roma and Juventus . Colombian midfielder Freddy Guarin scored the seventh after unselfishly setting up Osvaldo before . The 28-year-old Osvaldo, on loan from Southampton, has already scored twice as many goals for Inter as he did during the entirety of his loan spell at Juventus last season. Inter move up to third in the table, two points behind Roma and Juventus, while Sassuolo drop down to 18th. Micah Richards joined Italian side Fiorentina as he continues his pursuit of first steam football, but unfortunately for the 26-year-old he was an unsued substitute as the Viola played out a goalless draw at home to Genoa. Sassuolo have now dropped down to 18th in the table after the first two games of the season . Micah Richards was an unused substitute as Fiorentina drew 0-0 at home to Genoa . Napoli were hoping for a timely boost after a poor start to the season. They lost a Champions League play-off to Athletic Bilbao and then struggled before scoring an injury-time goal for a 2-1 win at Genoa in its Serie A opener. Things seemed to be looking up when they was awarded a penalty in the 26th minute after Bostjan Cesar tripped Gonzalo Higuain. However, Chievo goalkeeper Francesco Bardi dove to his right to brilliantly save the Argentine's spot kick. Maxi Lopez hit the crossbar moments later and that proved to be a warning shot as he scored his first goal since February three minutes into the second half, finishing off a Chievo counter attack. There was better news for Lazio, who had started the season with a 3-1 defeat at Milan.

"Hull boss Steve Bruce has labelled reports linking him with the Newcastle manager's job as 'disrespectful' to current incumbent Alan Pardew. The pressure cranked up a notch on the under-fire Magpies chief on Saturday as his team were humbled 4-0 by former club Southampton, prompting the 53-year-old to skip the post-match press conference at St Mary's. But Bruce, all too familiar with managerial life in the north-east after an ill-fated stint at Sunderland from 2009 to 2011, said talk of him taking over at St James' Park was out of order. Steve Bruce has backed up under-fire Newcastle boss Alan Pardew after he was linked with the Toon job . Alan Pardew looks on as his Newcastle side are thumped against Southampton on Saturday . Alan Pardew looks down after seeing his Newcastle side get thumped at Southampton on Saturday . He told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'It isn't nice - it's a horrible Sunday morning for him and I find it very, very disrespectful that I'm linked with somebody else's job when he's still in a job. 'It's a hard enough job we've all got. We all know what it's like now in football management. 'That part of the game will never change, but for me at the moment I'm just concentrating on the game against West Ham (on Monday night) and leaving all that aside.' Bruce, who guided the Tigers to their first FA Cup final last term, added: 'After what happened to me at Sunderland, it's similar to what Alan Pardew is going through now. I know how difficult the north-east is. 'I've been here for a couple of years. Hull gave me that chance to get back up and running again and for that I'll always be grateful. 'I've only been here a couple of years, and we've had a really good couple of years.' The match at St Mary's could scarcely have gone worse for Pardew, whose side looked extremely vulnerable in defence. Newcastle fans vent out their frustration towards Alan Pardew following their defeat against Southampton . Newcastle fans make their feelings clear on Alan Pardew ahead of the game at St Mary's on Saturday . Fans held up a 'Pardew Out' banner in the away section of the ground, with club owner Mike Ashley attending the match in person. Pardew told Sky Sports on Saturday: ''It is not easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances, so we have to be strong and try and tough it out this week and come back next week. 'We just have to put ourselves on the line, really, and be brave. Certainly, we have a bit more quality than we showed today, for sure, and we need to get that on the pitch.' Pardew famously signed an eight-year contract with Newcastle just under two years ago, having led the Magpies to fifth place in the 2011-12 season. The club's fortunes have waned significantly since then however, and Pardew's position came under great scrutiny in March when he headbutted Hull's David Meyler. Newcastle fined him £100,000 and gave him a formal warning over that incident, while the Football Association handed down a seven-match touchline ban.","The Hull manager says the reports linking him with the Newcastle job is unfair on under fire Toon boss Alan Pardew .

Everything is much more relaxed in England. In Argentina everything is rush, rush, rush. In England you come home from work and you take 10 or 15 minutes to have your te con leche – milky tea – and breathe. There are little things that are different but nothing major,' added the 39-year-old. ‘I noticed the change more on the pitch.

We have a lot of Spanish players who don’t speak English so well so that’s always a difficult part. Okay, you can say that you know in advance also but you want to buy always the best players for the positions that you need. ‘What we have done in the transfer period is very good in spite of the fact we don’t play in the Champions League.

I also put targets. I don’t think it’s an unreasonable target. Whether it’s difficult is another question. A club like United must always put a target.

"If somebody gave us a quid every time Danny Welbeck's name was mentioned this week we'd have enough to put a few big bets on the Arsenal striker and plenty left in the kitty for a punt or two on Radamel Falcao. Manchester United's late capture of Falcao brought the curtain down on the latest deadline day while Welbeck's switch from Old Trafford to the Emirates raised expectations (north London) and eyebrows (everywhere else). Bookies opened a ton of markets on a host of Premier League new boys after the window closed but Falcao and Welbeck are attracting most attention. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . Danny Welbeck will hope he can get off to a flyer in his Arsenal debut against Manchester City . Danny Welbeck is 4/1 with the bookies to score more than 14 Premier League goals this season . Two goals for England on Monday night could be the spark for a bright season for 23-year-old Welbeck, who is second-favourite behind Alexis Sanchez to be Arsenal's top Premier League scorer. Some firms go 2/1 Welbeck with the Chile star 6/4 but Bet365 have the Englishman at 9/2 to top the Gunners' charts. Remember, Santa Claus will be here before Olivier Giroud returns from injury so we should be looking at a two-horse race - no disrespect to Aaron Ramsey. You can also back Welbeck at 4/1 to score over 14 in the top flight this term, something an Arsenal player has managed in four of the last five seasons. Theo Walcott hit 14 in 2012/13. Radamel Falcao is set to make his Manchester United debut against QPR on Sunday . Homes: Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Reading . Aways: Wolves, Hearts, Fleetwood, Wimbledon . Draws: Arsenal vs Man City, Crystal Palace vs Burnley, St Johnstone vs Dundee . Manchester City provide the opposition for Arsenal on Saturday and Welbeck has a less than impressive record against them - scoring one goal (in an FA Cup tie) in eight games during his Red Devils days and drawing a blank in two appearances as a Sunderland player. He's 9/4 with several firms for a debut goal against the champions, widely available at 7/1 for the opener and 5/1 to score in a home win. Back up in Manchester, there was a familiar theme to the press conference as Falcao was officially unveiled as a United player. He spoke about his 'dream move', naturally, and hailed the 'biggest club in the world' with 'great players' blah, blah blah. Louis van Gaal has to keep Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie happy at Manchester United . Less predictable is how Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal will accommodate Falcao, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and the rest of the new recruits. Falcao and Rooney are 7/4 with a few firms to score most Premier League goals for United while the 2/1 with Paddy Power and Bet365 is the best you'll get for Van Persie. Falcao and Co face QPR on Sunday and the Colombian is 3/1 in most places to score first and 4/1 with several firms for two or more. Diego Costa started the season behind Van Persie, Sergio Aguero and Daniel Sturridge in the betting for Premier League top scorer but he's top of the tree (9/4) now after four goals in three games for Chelsea. Falcao is available at 14/1 and Welbeck is 33s. For the full list of top goalscorer odds from our betting partner Coral, CLICK HERE. The runners and riders in this race can't afford to let Costa get too far in front - although Luis Suarez reeled them after starting last season with a suspension - and if you fancy a fast start from the United and Arsenal men it's slightly better than 4/1 that Falcao and Welbeck score at any time this weekend. Mario Balotelli played an hour for Liverpool at Spurs but he's set for his home debut against Aston Villa on Saturday night. Stick the controversial Italian in with Welbeck and Falcao and the anytime treble returns around 9/1.

"The return to the ground of their former club can be the making or breaking of a Premier League player. Will they buckle under the pressure or show the fans what they have been missing? It is Rio Ferdinand's turn this weekend, with the former Manchester United stalwart returning to Old Trafford with QPR. The defender will no doubt get a better reaction than players such as Sol Campbell and Samir Nasri at their old teams, but how do the United faithful usually greet their former heroes? Sportsmail looks at the some of the welcomes over the years. Rio Ferdinand is set to start at Old Trafford this Sunday as QPR take on Manchester United . Rio Ferdinand enjoyed several successful years at Manchester United but left in the summer . Paul Ince (Liverpool, Middlesbrough) Nicknamed the Guv'nor, Ince helped United to their first top division title in 26 years in 1992/93. However, Sir Alex Ferguson soon got tired of his attitude and shipped him off to Inter Milan. No United fan would have expected him to end up at Liverpool two years later in 1997 though, and they didn't give him an easy ride on his first appearance back 'home' at Old Trafford. The England international was booed from start to finish in his two games as a Liverpool player there, and although things were a little easier with Middlesbrough, Ince took it to heart. 'I sweated blood for six years for that club and some of them give me stick,' he said. 'It disappoints me.' Paul Ince was given a hostile welcome when he returned to Old Trafford with Liverpool in 1998 . Ince left United for Inter Milan at first and later played for Middlesbrough at their home . Peter Schmeichel (Aston Villa) Often heralded as the greatest goalkeeper in the Premier League era, Schmeichel, like Ince, ended up at one of United's biggest rivals. But his relationship at the club is much different. After scooping five Premier League titles in his seven years at Old Trafford, Schmeichel made his way to Aston Villa and Manchester City via Sporting Lisbon in Portugal. The goalkeeper received a rapturous reception with the Midlands side, while even when representing the blue side of Manchester he was talked about fondly. Has admitted he was glad he pulled up injured in the warm-up ahead of City's visit to Old Trafford so his feelings wouldn't get the best of him, while he was even forgiven for producing his trademark celebration when Kevin Keegan's side won 3-1 at Maine Road earlier in the season. Peter Schmeichel was emotional when he returned to Old Trafford for Aston Villa but was received well . Schmeichel won the Champions League with United in what was his last game for the club . The Danish goalkeeper injured himself in the warm-up as Manchester City went to play their rivals . David Beckham (AC Milan) The poster boy from the famous Class of '92 graduates, Beckham walked out the door (helped along with a kick from Ferguson) in 2003 to join Real Madrid. The midfield maestro said he would always support Manchester United, but had to wait until a loan move with AC Milan before he could meet the fans once again. The Champions League tie was all but over by the time Beckham got on, while he was seen greeting and cuddling members of staff in the tunnel at half-time. Given a standing ovation at full-time, Beckham donned the anti-Glazer green and gold scarf as he exited the pitch. 'When I first heard about the tie I think I almost cried because it is such a special place for me,' he said. David Beckham applauds the fans after returning 'home' with AC Milan in the Champions League in 2010 . Manchester Untied fans display a banner to welcome Beckham back to Old Trafford . Carlos Tevez (Manchester City) 'I expect to have a good reception. While at United, I always gave my best and I had good relations with the fans,' Carlos Tevez, September 18, 2009. Two days later he was subject of vile abuse, coin throwing and a chorus of boos upon entering the arena. Poor old naive Carlos. But what else can he expect after leaving United despite the admiration of Ferguson, to join the wealthy rivals in a big-money deal? After the 4-3 defeat, Tevez said: 'It was incredible because I have never seen something like that happen in the two years I played at Old Trafford, . 'As soon as I entered the field the atmosphere was very different. It was hard to take because previously I was always wanted by those people. But I suppose in football situations change. Welcome to Manchester. Carlos Tevez controversially made the move to sign for Manchester City from Manchester United in 2009 . The Argentine had several happy moments with United but joined the wealthy rivals . Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid) Ever since turning up as a Portuguese teenager in 2004, Ronaldo's relationship with the United fans was special. For they had watched the scrwany winger transform into the best player in the world. Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford in 2013 for a crucial Champions League round of 16 game for Real Madrid. He had joined his dream side, the Galacticos, for a world record fee two years earlier. Undeterred by the emotions but also appreciative of the booming claps before kick-off, Ronaldo netted in a controversial fixture that saw Madrid advance in front of a fuming Ferguson. The forward refused to celebrate, earning the respect of the Manchester faithful, and may well be back again soon.. ‘I love Manchester,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘Everyone knows that — I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart.

"Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling needs protecting, not putting on a pedestal as England's next great hope, according to manager Brendan Rodgers. The talented 19-year-old has enjoyed a stellar nine months since regaining a place in the starting line-up, becoming one of the Reds' stand-out performers and playing in his first World Cup. Sterling has maintained that progress this season with his club, scoring twice in three matches, while also impressing in his last two matches for the national side. Raheem Sterling trains ahead of Liverpool's fixture against Aston Villa at Anfield on Saturday evening . The England winger talks to manager Brendan Rodgers, who insists his young star needs to be protected . However, Rodgers, who already has an issue with England over the injury which has ruled out striker Daniel Sturridge for up to three weeks, stressed the youngster should not be over-burdened with expectation. 'I think he needs protection. I have seen it over the years,' he said. 'He is a wonderful talent, he is doing great for Liverpool but there are still a lot of things he needs to learn and he knows that and is a mature boy for his age. 'He has grown into a wonderful young man and his consistency and performances are there and the period he has been in the team has been exceptional . 'I expect him to keep progressing but in terms of where he is at I think we need to be careful. Brendan Rodgers has helped Sterling mature into an international player, but he is not the finished article . Raheem Sterling starred for England again against Switzerland and is now a key player for his country . 'You see so many players where there is a reliance on them - especially with England who, for whatever reason tend to look for one player to put up on a pedestal and very quickly knock him down. 'Raheem will make mistakes, he will have bad games but he will also have outstanding games and it is keeping the calmness with him because he still has a way to go. 'He is certainly performing at a real high and consistent level. 'England know as well as anyone they need a team so they don't have to focus just on Raheem. 'It has to be the team and that will always the winner for England when they come together and they were excellent against Switzerland (in their 2-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory) as a team.' Daniel Sturridge is out for around three weeks after injuring himself during England training . Brendan Rodgers says Raheem Sterling should not be put up on a pedastal like other young Englishmen . Rodgers will hope Sterling will again provide the attacking edge for his side against Aston Villa on Saturday in the absence of Sturridge. There will be greater focus on summer signing Mario Balotelli, who makes his home debut after a promising hour last time out against Tottenham, but Rodgers has to decide whom replaces his injured striker. Rickie Lambert, bought from Southampton for £4million at the end of last season, has made two brief substitute appearances and Rodgers' vision was for him to be able to make an impact off the bench. However, it may come down to a choice between him and a tweaking of the system to accommodate another new signing Lazar Markovic. Rickie Lambert (centre) could get his first Liverpool start in the absence of Daniel Sturridge . 'Rickie has been very good since he came in,' said Rodgers. 'He has mostly had an impact from the bench and you see even with England the other night when he came on he showed good ability to play a great weighted pass for Danny Welbeck to score. 'He is working very well and if he doesn't get a start he will certainly start against Middlesbrough in the (Capital One) cup so his game time will come - but at the moment he is playing a great supporting role from the bench.' One player who is still some way off settling for a supporting role is captain Steven Gerrard, who thanks to his international retirement has been able to enjoy a rest during the recent break. 'After 14 years it was his first international break and it was great for him,' said Rodgers. 'I gave him an extra few days off to recover knowing we have a real busy schedule coming up over these next couple of months but he looks after himself ever so well, a great professional.' Last time Liverpool played Aston Villa at Anfield they needed a soft penalty to come back from 2-0 down . Rodgers has had his difficulties at Anfield against Saturday's opponents, taking just a point from his two previous encounters, so he is well aware of what awaits. 'We deservedly lost in my first season and then we started slowly last season and showed real character to draw the game (having trailed 2-0). 'They have started well and I am pleased for Paul (Lambert) because a few years ago when he went in there he looked towards building a young group of players and the first season was difficult. 'But they have developed and grown and got better and this season will see them and their young players - and the faith they put in them - bear fruit.'","Brendan Rodgers says England rush to put pressure on young stars .

"Roberto Martinez believes Everton were denied the chance to sign Tom Cleverley on transfer deadline day as Manchester United regard them as a threat. Martinez, who had worked with Cleverley at Wigan, wanted to take the England international on a season-long loan but Everton were forced to pull out of negotiations at a late stage. Cleverley subsequently joined Aston Villa on loan but should things not work out for him in Birmingham, Martinez has hinted he would be interested in signing him next summer.

I don't think there was just one aspect. ‘It's the parent club that makes that decision. Maybe they just didn't want to send a player on loan to a club that is going to be challenging for things and finished above them last season, I don't know.’ Relations between Everton and Manchester United were strained last summer, following David Moyes leaving Goodison Park to move to Old Trafford and United’ s subsequent aggressive pursuit of Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini. Roberto Martinez says Everton looked at signing Tom Cleverley on the last day of the transfer window . ‘I don't think there is any bad feeling between the clubs (following Fellaini/Baines),’ said Martinez. ‘The chairman (Bill Kenwright) has a very good relationship with Manchester United and, as a football club, we are not carrying any sour grapes about anything. ‘Our information was that the player wasn't available on loan full stop. You can look at the table from last season and we finished fifth and they finished a bit lower, so from that respect you can understand. ‘But, at the same time, Aston Villa have started the season really well. They are going to be a strong team. But we can't comment on that, it is down to Manchester United. A situation with Cleverley came up that I was happy to explore. In the end it didn't work out.’","Roberto Martinez wanted to bring Tom Cleverley to Everton in the summer .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists sentiment will play no part when he comes up against the club's former academy boss Alan Irvine at West Brom on Saturday. The Scot left the Toffees' Finch Farm training base in the summer to take up the role as Pepe Mel's successor at The Hawthorns. Neither side has had a great start to the campaign with Everton, in 17th with just two points from three matches, ahead of West Brom only on goal difference. Cold shoulder: Roberto Martinez will put emotions to one side when Everton face West Brom and Alan Irvine . In the Bag: Alan Irvine left the Toffees academy to take up his first managerial role at the Hawthorns . It makes Saturday's encounter all the more significant and, while Martinez has nothing but respect for Irvine, he knows both will be trying their hardest to out-do the other. 'It will be nice to see Alan. He's a gentleman and a footballing person that everyone has huge respect for,' he said on City Talk 105.9. 'He did a terrific job at our club in different roles and we wish him the very best of luck in his new project - but just not for this weekend. 'He has given a lot of effort and good planning with our academy. 'We had a lot of good work from him and his footballing vision and previously he had a very important job as assistant manager. Sluggish: Everton lie 17th in the table after a struggling start that including a 6-3 defeat to Chelsea . 'I'm sure that good feeling is going to be shared for many years to come and will never be affected by whatever happens on Saturday. 'We know a lot of the individuals there and obviously the manager had been a part of our fabric for a long time so you can imagine that it's going to be a lot of understanding between the two teams. 'But both teams realise it is a very important football game and we will need to be very focused and put in a good performances. 'It's a game we need to perform in and get a positive result.'","Everton face West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday September 13 .

"Marouane Fellaini is determined to win a place in Manchester United's new all-star line-up after escaping the axe at Old Trafford. Fellaini was rumoured to be on a hit-list of players being offloaded by Louis van Gaal this summer, just 12 months after joining United from Everton for £27.5million, and was strongly linked with a move to Napoli.

In a television interview in Belgium, Fellaini said: 'I want to fight for my place. The coach wants to play with the 11 players who make the best team – I want to be part of that.' Meanwhile, the 26-year-old was at the centre of a mystery in his homeland during the international break when it was suggested that United had barred him from attending a family day organised by the Belgium coach Marc Wilmots after the Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel was postponed. Fellaini then turned up at a similar event at his old club Standard Liege. However, it emerged that Wilmots had not notified Fellaini because he assumed United would block the invitation due to the player's injury.

"Arsenal's youngsters succeeded where the first team failed as they beat Borussia Dortmund in their opening UEFA Youth League group match. Two first-half goals from Kaylen Hinds secured victory at the Montanhydraulik Stadion on Wednesday lunchtime. The young Gunners reached the quarter-finals of the continental Under 19 competition last season and made the perfect start towards their aim of advancing further this time round. Kaylen Hinds gets the better of Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Tim Siegmeyer to give Arsenal the lead in their UEFA Youth League fixture . Hinds showed excellent composure to get round the keeper and applied a low finish for his 14th minute goal .

Arsenal: Ryan Huddart, Chiori Johnson (George Dobson 87), Elliot Wright, Stefan O'Connor, Tafari Moore, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Daniel Crowley, Gedion Zelalem, Alex Iwobi (c) (Stephy Mavididi 62), Christopher Willock (Tyrell Robinson 75), Kaylen Hinds . Substitutes not used: Bradley House (GK), Renny Smith, Marc Bola, Ben Sheaf . Scorer: Hinds 14, 32 . Booked: O'Connor, Maitland-Niles .

Substitutes not used: Dominik Reimann (GK), Moise Mbende, Nils Lennart Dietz, Las Dietz . Booked: Stenzel, Franke . Referee: Jari Jarvinen (Finland) Arsenal opened the scoring after 14 minutes when Hinds beat Dortmund goalkeeper Tim Siegmeyer after Daniel Crowley had set him up and the forward doubled the lead just after the half-hour after linking up with Chris Willock. Hinds is highly rated and featured for the Under 19 side at the age of 15. Still just 16, the youngster has impressed for England at youth level too. There was also a start for Gedion Zelalem, who could well be in line for another first team appearance in the Capital One Cup next week. Arsenal's teens faired exceptionally better than the senior side did on Tuesday night. In a one sided affair, Dortmund beat Arsene Wenger's team 2-0 in what was the worst possible start to their Champions League campaign in Group D. Mesut Ozil was once again criticised, while Jack Wilshere turned his ankle late on and is now a doubt for the Premier League game against Aston Villa on Saturday.

"A proposal allowing for a three-minute stoppage if a player suffers a suspected concussion will be discussed this week by FIFA's Executive Committee. The guidance comes from FIFA's medical committee, following a meeting on Monday in Zurich, and will be presented at the Executive Committee's meeting on Thursday and Friday. It follows several incidents during this summer's World Cup of players attempting to play on after suffering head injuries. Germany's Christoph Kramer is eventually taken off after being knocked out by Ezequiel Garay (far right) A FIFA press release read: 'The incidents at the World Cup have shown that the role of team doctors needs to be reinforced in order to ensure the correct management of potential cases of concussion in the heat of competition. 'Following recent discussion with team doctors and confederations, the FIFA Medical Committee agreed at a meeting held yesterday [Monday] in Zurich to submit a proposal to the FIFA Executive Committee in order to improve the protocol. Argentina's Javier Mascherano (right) takes a blow to the head from Netherlands' Georginio Wijnaldum . Mascherano lies on the pitch after the kick left him concussed, but he carried on playing in the match . 'Under the proposal, whenever a suspected incident of concussion occurs, the referee will have the ability to stop the game for three minutes, allowing the relevant team doctor to complete an on-pitch assessment and decide if the player has suspected concussion. 'The referee will only allow the injured party to continue playing with the authorisation of the team doctor, who will have the final decision.' Alvaro Pereira (right of left-hand picture) stayed on the pitch despite this clash with England's Raheem Sterling . UEFA will adopt similar new rules with immediate effect and FIFA's chief medical officer Michel D'Hooghe expressed hope at the recent Soccerex convention in Manchester that the global governing body could implement the proposal as soon as October 1. Germany's Christoph Kramer played on in the World Cup final with a head injury before being eventually being substituted, while Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira and Argentina's Javier Mascherano also returned to the field after being knocked out during matches.

Lloris later admitted he was wrong to continue playing after he was concussed in the match against Everton . In the Barclays Premier League, Tottenham sparked a parliamentary debate by allowing goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to play on against Everton last season after suffering a concussion. Lloris later admitted he was wrong to do so and the league responded by tightening guidelines to allow club doctors to overrule players and coaches in such decisions, assisted by an independent doctor in the tunnel should the need arise.","FIFA's Executive Committee to discuss plans this week to stop matches for three minutes if a player suffers a suspected concussion .

"Former Fulham captain Danny Murphy says all Felix Magath has to offer English football is a masterclass in how not to run a club. Magath was replaced as Cottagers boss by Kit Symons last week following a disastrous seven-month spell in charge, during which they were relegated from the Premier League and then left rooted to the foot of the Championship with one point from seven games. The 61-year-old has defended his reign and told German news agency DPA: 'I am convinced that English football has something to learn from German qualities.' Danny Murphy takes a penalty during his Fulham days, where he played from 2007-2012 and became captain . But Murphy hit back, telling Press Association Sport: 'All he has to offer is to show other people how not to do it.' Magath's methods have come under fierce criticism from former players, notably ex-captain Brede Hangeland who was once told by the veteran boss to treat a leg injury by rubbing cheese onto the sore area. And Murphy, a team-mate of the Norwegian defender for almost five years, revealed an even more bizarre twist to the unorthodox treatment. 'I texted Brede to ask if it was true,' he added. Felix Magath lasted just 18 games in charge of Fulham before being sacked by the Championship strugglers . Murphy has turned from player to pundit since retiring from football but could he be set for a managerial role? 'Brede told me it was, and that the cheese had to be soaked in alcohol, and that he was told to phone his mother because it would help to speak to someone who loves him while the cheese is working!' Magath said of the Hangeland reports: 'I merely suggested it could be worth trying the old wives' tale of applying quark to the injured area. I would never tell a doctor what to do.' Murphy added: 'It's sad that a club as stable as Fulham is now in such a world of trouble. 'It was a mistake to keep (Magath) in charge after they were relegated. The players I spoke to were desperate to get out because of him.' Murphy confirms that former Fulham captain Brede Hangeland (right), now at Crystal Palace, was advised to put cheese on his injured thigh to speed up the healing process by Felix Magath . Murphy has expressed an interest in taking the Fulham job, although he has not applied for it and as yet has had no contact with the Craven Cottage hierarchy. In the meantime Symons took charge for Saturday's clash with Blackburn, which they lost 1-0, and will also be in the dug-out for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup third-round clash with Doncaster. 'Kit's a very good coach,' added Murphy. 'He took over on Saturday and although they lost there were a few more smiles on people's faces. 'It's important they get a win against Doncaster to create some confidence.' Kit Symons is currently in charge at Fulham as the West Londoners look for a new manager .","Danny Murphy spent five years at Fulham between 2007-2012 .

"Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka is wary of a Liverpool backlash – in much the same way his former side Real Madrid returned to form at the weekend. The Teessiders travel to Anfield for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup third-round tie with the Reds having lost two on the bounce in the Premier League. Boro, meanwhile, thrashed Brentford 4-0 on Saturday to make it three wins on the spin. Liverpool lost 3-1 to West Ham on the weekend after a defeat to Aston Villa the previous week . Stephen Gerrard, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli look dejected at the final whistle at Upton Park . But Karanka points to Real’s 8-2 win at Deportivo on Saturday as an example of how quality sides can hit back – they, too, had lost their two in La Liga. ‘I know they aren’t in a good way but they have a good manager and good players,’ said Karanka. ‘We must go there to win, you can’t go to enjoy the atmosphere. That is dangerous. ‘Look at Real Madrid, they were very bad two weeks ago then they score eight goals.

Our real tests are against teams in the Championship. ‘But we will go there and try to win.’ Real Madrid responded to a difficult start to the season by putting eight goals past Deportivo on Saturday .

"Diafra Sakho admits he is relishing the prospect of building a relationship with fellow West Ham forward Enner Valencia. The summer arrivals have looked like a well-established partnership in their last two games for the Hammers, both getting amongst the goals in the draw at Hull and Saturday's impressive 3-1 victory over Liverpool. Sakho, 24, joined from Metz having led the scoring charts for the French outfit as they gained promotion to Ligue 1 and has since scored three goals in three starts for West Ham. Diafra Sakho celebrates with strike partner Enner Valencia after scoring  in West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool . His goal on Saturday came after Winston Reid's opener as he deftly lofted the ball over stranded Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and, whilst confirming he meant the audacious effort, the Senegal international is ready to work on his blossoming understanding with Valencia. 'I saw the 'keeper off his line, at the near post, and I only had one thing in mind,' he told West Ham TV. 'I tried it and it came off. I wasn't sure if it was going to go in or not, but thankfully it's ended up in the net. I'm pleased, pleased for me and for the team. I've dreamed of scoring a goal as good as that, particularly here at the Boleyn Ground.' Sakho, chipped in a sublime goal against Liverpool on Saturday, has become an instant hit at West Ham . Regarding Valencia, he added: 'We've trained together for a short while now. Enner's a footballer who likes to get it down and play, and me, I like to come deep. I try to position myself in relation to him and vice-versa. I hope that's going to continue to serve the club well this season. 'We're working every day in training for that. We're not going to relax and we'll carry on working hard at it, because it's only the beginning of the season and there will be plenty of matches to play together.' West Ham boss Sam Allardyce believes Sakho has benefited from the spotlight being drawn by the big-money signing of Valencia, who starred at the World Cup for Ecuador. Sakho competes with his namesake and Liverpool defender Mamadou during the clash at Upton Park . The duo will both be licking their lips at the prospect of coming up against Manchester United's shaky defence on Saturday but, even if the goals start to dry up for Sakho, he is ready to do his bit for the team as West Ham look to build on their win over Liverpool. 'Goals are why I'm here and that's why West Ham signed me,' he added. 'But beyond that I'll try to help the team, as much as I possibly can. And even if I don't score, as long as I'm useful, that's the important thing. I work every day in training to try to be as effective as possible. 'We deserved it (the result against Liverpool). On the whole, we lived up to manager's expectations and those of the staff. And if we continue to play like that, work together, united as a group, we'll do good things in the Premier League.'

When he makes his Ryder Cup bow at Gleneagles next week, then, he’ll be thinking of the entire clan.

It was a tough time, no doubt, but that’s life.’ Gallacher is away from home this week, playing in the ISPS Handa Wales Open as a warm-up to the main event on a track he knows better than just about anyone on the European Tour; seven top-10 finishes on the PGA Centenary Course suggest a certain affinity with a venue he’s been visiting since he was a nipper. Still, practice rounds there last week came as something as a shock – illustrating to Gallacher just how enormous next week will be. How will the rookie, nephew of former Ryder Cup player and captain Bernard, cope with it all? Firstly, by talking to those who have been through it all before. ‘We are meeting Paul McGinley tonight then I will go for dinner with Paul Lawrie tomorrow night,’ said Gallacher, who tees off in the Wales Open on Thursday. Chasing: Scot Steven Gallacher is one round away in Turin from displacing McDowell but needs a top-two finish . ‘We also have a mega-experienced backroom staff, while I’ve spoken to my uncle a couple of times as well - and they are all saying pretty much the same thing. They’ve said that I should go and enjoy it. ‘As for the first tee in a Ryder Cup, you can’t replicate that anywhere. Can it be any more nervous than holing a putt for a birdie or eagle to win a tournament or get into a play-off? ‘Nervousness or excitement is only really how much pressure you put on yourself. I don’t get up and down much but I feel both nervous and excited, excited more than anything, when I play normal events. ‘The reaction to me getting in the team has been more than I expected, to be honest. I don’t know if it’s down to me being the only Scot in the team or that it’s more than 40 years since a Ryder Cup was played here. It’s a bigger animal now. It’s huge. Gallacher has had seven top-10 finishes at Gleneagles and used to play the course when he was a child . Paul McGinley's full European team to take on the United States later this month in the Ryder Cup . ‘I also live down the road from Gleneagles and there’s a family connection, too, with the Ryder Cup. Me and my wife still have a laugh when we see my face on billboards or trolleys at the airport. It’s a bit surreal but it’s something I’ve got to get used to and embrace. ‘I’m happy to be back at work this week, though. It’s starting to get a bit manic back up the road with it coming up so soon. ‘When you go up to the course now, as I did last week, you see the enormity of the tournament and the enormity of everything behind the scenes, the stands and the hospitality. You realise how big a deal it is. ‘The course is ultimately the same. It’s just how much the infrastructure has changed and the practice area is all merchandise, and all the way down the first 18 is all hospitality. It’s going to be fantastic for the public for viewing. It’s a great stadium course and it’s in fantastic condition. ‘Knowing the course can only help me. I’ve had seven top 10s round there and hit a lot of good shots over the years. When you are standing on tees or walking between shots you are definitely thinking positively.’ Jamie Donaldson (from left to right), Lee Westwood, Thomas Bjorn and Gallacher talk to the media .

"Rory McIlroy predicted there would be some surprises among the European pairings and Paul McGinley certainly hinted at one yesterday when he suggested the world No 1 would not be partnering fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell. Throughout the summer the Europe captain had said they would play together at some point, and never mind that their relationship had become strained owing to a management dispute involving McIlroy and Horizon Sports, who used to look after the affairs of both men. The players had been painstaking in their efforts to show their friendship is back on track. Three weeks ago, McDowell spoke of how he was hoping to partner McIlroy while, in an interview with Sportsmail last week, the latter returned the compliment. World No 1 Rory McIlroy may not be paired with fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell at the Ryder Cup . However, McGinley appears to have had a change of heart. 'Three or four months ago I had a strong view they would play together but the more I look at their statistics I'm thinking there may be value in not doing it,' he said. 'They've played six Ryder Cup matches together and won two. If I don't decide to pair them it would only be for tactical reasons. Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter could lead Europe out on the first morning of the Ryder Cup on Friday . 'Both of them have assured me all along that there's no issues and that's the way I've always seen it. Whether they come together or not is another story.' McGinley can protest as much as he likes but if they don't play together it would inevitably lead to speculation and could prove a distraction. McGinley was speaking at the first press conference of Ryder Cup week, in conjunction with American captain Tom Watson. The first practice sessions begin today when the two start to play their hand publicly. Whether Paul McGinley decides to pair McDowell and McIlroy together or not there could be problems .

"England’s bid for Rugby World Cup 2015 glory has been boosted by Stuart Lancaster securing Pennyhill Park as the host nation’s main training base. Head coach Lancaster has opted to keep England at their accustomed Bagshot headquarters for as long as possible during the pool stages of the 2015 tournament. England could even stay at their normal Surrey base for all but one fixture in the whole competition, should they top Pool A and progress to the final. VIDEO Scroll down for Virtual experience allows fans to train with England rugby team . Base: England will be able to train at the Pennyhill Park during the Rugby World Cup 2015 . Lancaster’s men will base themselves in Salford for their final Pool A match on Saturday, October 10, at the Manchester City Stadium. England will play three of their four pool contests at Twickenham, and will gain clear benefit from sticking to well-practised routines. Rugby World Cup organisers have confirmed 41 training bases will be used throughout the tournament in September and October next year. 'It’s great to have Pennyhill Park as our training base,' said Lancaster. 'It’s a place we are used to - the facilities are first-class, especially with the new training centre.' Wales are perhaps the next biggest winners in the team base allocation, with half of their Pool A preparations taking place at their usual home The Vale Resort. Warren Gatland’s men will play two of their four group matches at the Millennium Stadium, but also take on Australia and England at Twickenham. Decision: Stuart Lancaster (above) has opted to keep England at their accustomed Bagshot headquarters . Wales will be based at London Irish’s newly-completed all-purpose training complex Hazelwood. Gatland is expected to mirror RBS 6 Nations trips to Twickenham, with Wales aiming to travel to London Irish’s set-up in midweek before their weekend clashes in the English capital. 'The selection of team bases are extremely important for the squad’s preparation and we were very impressed with the packages on offer from the approved venues,' said Gatland. 'We are very familiar with The Vale and their pedigree for hosting sporting teams is second to none. 'In addition the new Hazlewood complex is another great base, which really suits our needs.' Tournament organisers England Rugby 2015 vetted more than 100 applications from complexes to become team-base venues. The final list of 41 centres, including pitches, state-of-the-art gyms, swimming pools and hotels, allow teams the flexibility to based close to each fixture. Reigning world champions New Zealand will split their group phase between The Lensbury and St Mary’s University in west London, the Sport Wales National Centre and Darlington Mowden Park. Ireland will move bases between each fixture, making use of Celtic Manor in Newport, the FA’s centre of excellence St George’s Park, Surrey Sports Park and the Sport Wales National Centre. Scotland will rotate between Hartpury College, where Gloucester Rugby train, Leeds Metropolitan University, the University of Leeds and Newcastle Royal Grammar School. Pennyhill Park and The Vale Resort are among the eight training bases for the tournament’s knockout stages. Glory: England will be hoping the home comforts will Pennyhill Park will bring them success . Chief executive Debbie Jevans believes organising committee England Rugby 2015 will provide all 20 competing nations with first-class bases. 'We are lucky to have some fantastic facilities right across the country and the enthusiasm to be part of the tournament has been really encouraging,' said Jevans. 'We are confident that we now have 41 high-quality training environments which provide a home away from home for the teams.' International Rugby Board chairman Bernard Lapasset also hailed the organising committee’s preparations. 'The teams participating at England 2015 will have access to exceptional facilities the length and breadth of the host nation.

But Terry, talking to Sport magazine, rejected accusations that the arrivals of the Spanish stars from Chelsea's principles. He said: 'Fabregas is associated with tiki-taka but at Chelsea we've always played this way: pass the ball, control games, and give ourselves more options going forward.

"Lewis Hamilton feels relaxed rather than relieved after reclaiming the lead in the battle for this year's Formula One world title. In taking the chequered flag at the Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton claimed victory number 29 of his Formula One career and his seventh of the season, two more than when he won his only title in 2008. Championship rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg suffered his second retirement of the campaign - a wiring loom breaking in the steering of the German's car, leaving him without a number of vital functions ahead of the start of F1's only night race. Lewis Hamilton celebrates after taking the lead in the drivers' championship with victory in Singapore . Hamilton's Mercedes leads the field en route to an important victory that changes the balance in the title race . As the field filed away on the formation lap, Rosberg was left on the grid frantically attempting to engage his car into life. It was to no avail, forcing his mechanics to rescue the 29-year-old and push him into the pit lane, from where he managed to get going. But running 21st and last - Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi retired on the formation lap - he made little headway, even against the likes of Max Chilton and Marcus Ericsson. After 14 laps, as he pulled in for his pit stop, the team's bid to change the steering wheel and coax his car into some sort of fighting mode ultimately failed, and with it came retirement. After a consoling hug from Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff in the garage, Rosberg then watched Hamilton win to take a three-point lead in the drivers' championship. Hamilton sprays second placed Sebastian Vettel after securing victory at the Marina Bay Circuit . It is only the second time this season Hamilton has had his nose in front, the other being for one race going into a highly-contentious Monaco Grand Prix. Hamilton said: 'I just feel relaxed. I came here to do a job, and I came through it without any issues on our side of the garage all weekend, which was a real blessing. 'I also came here hoping to gain seven points on Nico (the difference between first and second), with anything more than that a bonus. 'Of course, the extra points are a huge help, and you would think I should be relieved, but that's not the case. At the moment I'm not thinking that.' Instead, Hamilton is more concerned with Mercedes' reliability record that has now resulted in five mechanical retirements overall - three against him and two for Rosberg. Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg could only watch after being forced to retire from the race . That does not factor into account the brake failure which resulted in a crash in qualifying in Germany, nor the car fire in qualifying in Hungary that was sparked by a fuel leak. 'We've had several DNFs (did not finish) now on our cars,' reflected Hamilton. 'I know the team will not be 100 per cent happy because we want to win collectively, to get those one-twos, to be the dominant team. 'So by not getting that result they'll be going back to the drawing board trying to figure out what happened. 'They're constantly coming up against things and perhaps other people are starting to be a bit more reliable than us, so that's an area we can still definitely improve on.' McLaren driver Jenson Button was another driver forced to retire from the race, 8 laps from finishing . Rosberg was despondent but philosophical as the fight now goes down to the final five races. He said: 'It was the toughest day for me this year, even worse than Silverstone (where he retired with a gearbox problem). 'None of the steering wheel functions worked, so I had no DRS, the gears were all over the place, my brake balance was totally in the wrong place. Sitting on the grid I felt helpless. 'From a team perspective unreliability is our weakness and we need to get to the bottom of it and try and improve on that.' There was still drama for Hamilton to negotiate before he claimed his win with the deployment of the safety car on lap 31 after the front wing of Sergio Perez's Force India shattered across the track following a collision with Sauber's Adrian Sutil. After six laps to clear the debris, Hamilton was left running on the supersoft tyre - but needing to make a final stop - whilst those behind were looking to go to the end on soft rubber. Force India's Sergio Perez prompted the introduction of the safety car after a collision with Adrian Sutil . Hamilton then wrung the life out of his car for 16 laps in a bid to come out ahead of as many cars as possible. He filed in between Red Bull duo Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo but on fresh tyres needed only one-and-a-half laps to take over at the front, from which point he stormed to victory, with the race reaching its two-hour limit after 60 of the planned 61 laps. Second for Vettel was his best result of a troubled year, with third for Ricciardo moving him to within 60 points of Hamilton. McLaren's Jenson Button suffered his first retirement for two years eight laps from home, whilst Chilton was 17th and last in his Marussia.","Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the Singapore Grand Prix .

"Summer's sleeveless dresses, bandeau tops and spaghetti straps all call for one thing - the dreaded strapless bra. It's hard to find a woman who loves these creations. Traditionally, they fall down (quite literally) in several areas. Designed for practicality over prettiness, they're usually uncomfortable and unflattering, often squeezing your breasts into any shape other than the silhouette you actually desire. As a 32C, I've found that strapless bras offer very little support for anyone above a B cup, and as for giving you any kind of cleavage, forget it. Then, of course, there's the 'strapless shuffle', the annoying wriggle-scoop-tug move you have to perform at regular intervals to avoid a wardrobe malfunction when moving fast, hailing a taxi, or - heaven forbid  - walking down the aisle. But finally it seems that the fashion industry has woken up to such criticisms and dreamt up a new generation of strapless styles. These high-tech bras promise not only to look good and feel comfortable, but to stay put on bigger boobs, create cleavage and even do away with the wriggle-scoop-tug for ever. With a strapless dress to get into for a family party, I tried some on for size . . . No frills, no nonsense: John Lewis . JOHN LEWIS . Padded, underwired bra, £20, johnlewis.com . Jenny says: A fairly basic white design that does the job without frills. The padded, seam-free underwired cups were nice and smooth and gave good support, but the bra didn't fit as  snugly as some of the other styles. It seemed to separate my boobs rather than push them together, and the bottom of the underwiring dug into my ribs slightly. For £20, it's a decent bra, but not particularly special. 2/5 . GOSSARD . Decent: Gossard . Superboost satin black bra, £30, gossard.com . Jenny says: This comes with little round pillows called 'launch pads' to slot into the cups for extra oomph. They create a decent cleavage but took up so much space there was hardly any room left for my breasts, so the top gaped slightly and I felt a bit exposed. It's not great for wearing with plunging styles unless you want to have someone's eye out. On a positive note, it created a lovely smooth profile at the sides with  no overspill, and looked sexy  yet stylish. 2/5 . H&M - BEST LOOKING . Best looking: H&M . Black bra with white lace, £12.99, hm.com . Jenny says: By far the prettiest, this fitted snugly against my chest bone (the sign of a good bra, an expert fitter once told me), gave a slight uplift thanks to inbuilt padding, and didn't gape at the top. It did dig in a bit at the side, which might make it uncomfortable over long periods, and there was a bit of underarm overspill, but for under £13, you can't complain. A beautiful bargain. 3/5 . Classy: Wonderbra . WONDERBRA . Ultimate bra, £36, wonderbra.eu . Jenny says: It uses 'patent-pending hand-shaped technology to give lift, support and the classic Wonderbra cleavage you're looking for'. The hand-shaped internal supports are made to feel like someone cupping your breasts. It gave me a classy, natural-looking cleavage with just the right amount of uplift. It felt incredibly tight at first, and there was a bit of overhang at the sides, but it didn't budge, even when I jumped up  and down. 4/5 . Best all rounder: M&S . M&S - BEST ALL ROUNDER . Memory foam bra, £22.50, marks andspencer.com . Jenny says: If there is a holy grail of strapless bras, this could be it. It has 'new non-slip wing technology - amazing memory foam moulds to your shape for the perfect fit'. Made of the same stuff you get in fancy pillows and mattresses, the moulds were incredibly comfy. The sides were a rubbery-feel fabric, which gripped without digging in and stopped anything spilling over the top. I almost forgot I was wearing it. What's more, it's a decent price, too. My favourite by a mile. 5/5 . Luxurious: Myla . MYLA . Bodysilk aubergine bra, £45, myla.com . Jenny says: The priciest bra I tested, this is 94 per cent silk, and it certainly felt soft and luxurious. It stays in place thanks to boned sides and silicone bands at the back and sides, but would probably suit small to medium cup sizes best as there's not much there to hold larger chests in place. It gave a flattering natural shape, wasn't too tight and didn't gape. The only downside is the seams might show under tight tops. 4/5 . WACOAL . Least favourite: Wacoal . Nude lace bandeau, £39, Wacoal.co.uk . Jenny says: Understated and nude, this is definitely one for those with smaller chests. A more traditional strapless style, it's underwired with a non-slip, slightly sticky silicone band, but that's about it. The simple lace offered very little in the way of support and it left my boobs looking slightly squished. It's so sheer your nipples would be in danger of showing through your clothes - which is never a good look. My least favourite of the lot. 1/5 . FENWICK - BEST FOR EVERYDAY . Best for everyday: Fenwick . Moulded cup bra, £39,  Fenwick (020 7629 9161) Jenny says: With plain black moulded underwired cups and soft sides that don't dig in, this Princesse Tam Tam bra is great for everyday use. There was slight overhang at the sides - perhaps the price you pay for comfort - but all-over padding gave me a nice shape and the cups sat smoothly against my chest, making it ideal for wearing with snug-fitting tops. Silicone bands around the top and bottom helped it stay put when I raised my arms skywards. It comes with see-through detachable straps, but I reckon you're better off without them. 4/5 . DEBENHAMS . Dreaded overspill: Debenhams . Secret support cream bra, £25, debenhams.com . Jenny says: Seam-free with moulded foam cups would work well under close-fitting clothes. Like many I tried, it has optional straps for extra support when wearing halterneck or  cross-back style tops. The 'integrated secret support panels' claim to provide support and 'create the perfect lift', but while it gave me a better shape than the average strapless bra, it did mean a bit of boob overspill at the top. It's so tight around the ribcage it would definitely stay put while dancing - though breathing might be a challenge. 3/5 .","H&M's £12.99 black bra with white lace is the best looking .

"Council officials told a resident who asked for details regarding paranormal activity through a Freedom of Information request that if he had any concerns he should call Ghostbusters. Staff at Essex County Council offered the response to the request, which asked for information relating to paranormal and zombie activity dealt with by the local authority in the past decade. However, the council responded to the anonymous request by saying information about the services in question was contracted out to external providers. Dr Stantz, Dr Venkman and Dr Spengler, played by actors Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis in the film Ghostbusters. Essex County Council replied to an FOI request on paranormal activity saying anybody with concerns should call Ghostbusters .

And the response then read: 'For all investigation concerning paranormal activity please contact 555-2368 Ghostbusters and ask to speak with Dr Venkman, Dr Stantz or Dr Spengler.” The doctors mentioned are the ghost-hunting characters played by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis in 1980s blockbuster film Ghostbusters. Other requests within the FOI for information on UFO sightings, zombie attacks and pandemics were referred to Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, Shaun from zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead and Major Henry West from 28 Days Later. The anonymous Freedom of Information request was received last month but the response was only published today. Information requested included the number of UFO sightings over the past decade and any contingency plans in place to protect the personal information of staff and clients 'should there be an invasion of zombies or any kind of viral infection that could cause a pandemic'. The letter also referred the resident to Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, pictured, played by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, with concerns about UFO sightings . The mystery requester was told: 'For information regarding UFO sightings please contact Fox Mulder or Dana Scully who have been seconded from the FBI to Essex County Council X-Files project.' Zombie requests were directed to Shaun at The Winchester Tavern, South London - the favourite pub of Simon Pegg’s character in zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead. While information on ‘viral pandemics’ was referred to Major Henry West from Danny Boyle’s post-apocalyptic horror film, 28 Days Later. But the respondent was warned: “Major Henry can only be contacted 28 days later from the receipt of this response.' The response also said that zombie requests should be directed to Simon Pegg's character, Shaun, pictured, from the zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead . And when asked if the response was in fact a true response, a council spokesman said: 'That was our official response.' Earlier this year, Essex County Council leader, David Finch, spoke out about the amount of money the council wasted responding to ‘trivial’ Freedom of Information requests. Each request must be responded to within 20 working days and can cost taxpayers up to £450 a time in labour costs. The FOI response said any concerns relating to pandemics should be forwarded to Major Henry West, the character played by Christopher Eccleston in the film 28 Days Later . A spokesman for Essex County Council also said: 'Earlier this year ECC revealed it spent almost £250,000 dealing with FOI responses in 2013. 'It has seen a 60 per cent increase in FOI requests between 2011 and 2013. 'In 2011 dealing with requests took up 436 officer days. By 2013 this figure had increased to almost 700.

"Former foreign minister Bob Carr has hit back at claims he was lazy in the job saying he was entirely committed to working around the clock. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard made the eyebrow raising comments while talking to channel nine journalist Ray Martin in an interview which is set to be aired Tuesday night. Martin told Triple M's 'The Grill Team', Ms Gillard unloaded on the former foreign affairs minister and she said that it was a mistake to appoint Bob Carr and when he got there he was 'lazy'. 'She certainly makes it clear that he didn't like hard work,' said Martin. Scroll down for video . Ray Martin says of Julia Gillard's interview 'she certainly makes it clear that he (Bob Carr) didn't like hard work'. Channel Nine's Ray Martin says he came away from the three hour sit-down conversation with former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, thinking that Mr Rudd was 'pretty treacherous'. Julia Gillard has accused the former foreign minister Bob Carr of being 'lazy' which has seen the former NSW premier hit back saying he was proud he worked seven day a week in the job . But the former NSW premier has rejected the accusations claiming that had labor stuck with her as leader, many of his friends and colleagues would have lost their seats. Mr Carr told the Daily Telegraph that his published diaries, contained in a book as his time as foreign minister showed the former PM's claims were wrong. 'the great value of a diary is that it presents the daily reality of life and that's what my diary does, it demonstrates that I was totally engaged in a tough and demanding job'. 'I'm proud that I worked seven days a week in the job,' he said. 'I flung myself into that job, if for no other reason than I thought I'd only be in it for 18 months,' Carr told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Carr believes the claims were entertained by Ms Gillard because of her clear disappointment at him for switching his allegiance to Kevin Rudd before he re took the leadership last year. 'I did so for one reason, it was the very viability of the party we love,' he said. 'It's also fair to say that 80 per cent of my reflections about her were fond,' Carr told the Daily Telegraph. Happier times between Gillard and Rudd but her interviewer told Triple M that 'they all knew how dysfunctional he was and they'd been covering him up' On the night she told Kevin Rudd she would challenge him for the leadership: . The way I tell it in the book is my side of it … you know…a very emotional time, if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife, if anything the reputation I have from that night is one of political brutality. Actually in the moment I was hesitant, a conversation went too long, I certainly fed (Rudd)hope. I shouldn’t have done that. On Kevin Rudd after she had deposed him: . I thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress. I know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership, so I expected him to feel very, very battered and bruised. Obviously I was wrong about that. On her decision to campaign as the 'real' Julia: . I put my hand up for that one hundred per cent. That’s my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister. On the 'odd couple' - her relationship with Tim: . You look at all of that and you say, how much of that is gender working, because would we think it was quite so odd if a male Prime Minister or a male chief executive officer of a big bank or whatever had a wife who worked as a hairdresser? Would we think that was kind of you know really, really odd? Why on earth did he marry her? She’s a hairdresser! I just don’t think it would occur to us. I think it was the gender thing a bit. But in terms of you know being supportive, Tim was there and, yes, there’s the blow-drying of the hair, but there’s so much more. On why she hasn’t married Tim: . It’s just the right decision for us and the right decision for me. We’ve just been joking about it, the various descriptors you can put on my forehead, I am an atheist, I’m not a person of faith, and so I don’t think about marriage in that religious sense. And I don’t feel that we need you know some ceremony or anything to you know make our relationship meaningful; it is meaningful. So it’s the right choice for us. On life at The Lodge and Kirribilli: . I’d had no life experience that prepared me for having ah staff around you in that close, intimate sense that staff in The Lodge or Kirribilli are. And I thought there’s only a couple of ways of reacting to this. You could pretend you were poncing around in Downton Abbey or something like that! Or you could just try and embrace it and make it an extended kind of family circumstance. On same sex marriage: . I’ve got what may be in the modern age a kind of old-fashioned, feminist view about can we, take the traditional institution of marriage and stretch it? Or do you create some other way of solemnising relationships and recognising them as of worth and status. And when I was a young feminist I would’ve said overwhelming the gay community was on that track too, but things have changed! I accept the course of human history now is that ah we are going to see same sex marriage here and in you know most parts of the developed world. In her first interview since leaving politics, Julia Gillard also took a swipe at the man who saw her end her career in politics. Ray Martin told Triple M's 'The Grill Team' that he came away from the three hour sit-down conversation with the former Prime Minister, thinking that Mr Rudd was 'pretty treacherous'. 'There are a dozen books out at the moment, all of which I read in advance of this thing and all about that period of time, that dysfunctional Kevin 07,' Ray Martin said. 'It's extraordinary, they covered him up for awful long time and it's not just her but they all say the same thing.' The veteran journalist was asked whether the real Kevin Rudd was hidden from the Australian public. 'Right to the point where she suggests that, at the end, she says she had no choice but to get rid of him,' he said. 'They all knew how dysfunctional he was and they'd been covering him up. 'Certainly she (Julia Gillard) thinks he was heading for an emotional breakdown.' 'The way I tell it in the book is my side of it … you know…a very emotional time, if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife, if anything the reputation I have from that night is one of political brutality,' Ms Gillard said. 'Actually in the moment I was hesitant, a conversation went too long, I certainly fed (Rudd) hope. I shouldn’t have done that. 'I thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress. I know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership, so I expected him to feel very, very battered and bruised. Obviously I was wrong about that.' Ray Martin revealed that Kevin Rudd was not the only Canberra connection or high-profile person targeted by the ex-Labor leader. 'She unloads on The Canberra Press Gallery, she says that's one of the things she doesn't miss, almost without exception,' he said. 'Alan Jones gets a fair thumping, in there for probably in her mind with good reason.' Not all the brickbats are reserved for others. Julia Gillard accepted full responsibility for her 'real Julia' claim, putting it down as a rookie mistake. She admits to Ray Martin that 'I put my hand up for that one hundred per cent. That’s my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister'. Ray Martin pointed out that the ex-PM was warm during the interview and that she did not just focus internally, delivering some strong words on the current Prime Minister. 'She's fairly savage on Tony Abbott, as well,' he added. The former Australian Prime Minister was recently called to give evidence at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption. During four hours of testimony, Ms Gillard denied having any knowledge of an illegal 'slush fund' and having any role in setting up an account for the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association. While in the witness box Ms Gillard admitted that she may have done some things differently but added that 'none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards'. The former Prime Minister takes a swipe at radio broadcaster Alan Jones during the interview with veteran tv journalist Ray Martin . Julia Gillard now says that appointing Bob Carr as Foreign Minister was a 'mistake' and describes him as 'lazy'. He has countered with 'I think she's saying this because I clearly disappointed her by switching to Rudd' Tony Abbott does not escape the wrath of Julia Gillard in her sit-down interview with Ray Martin . 'It's extraordinary, they covered him up for awful long time and it's not just her but they all say the same thing' according to interviewer Ray Martin . Ray Martin interviewed the former Prime Minister ahead of her book release, My Story. Up until Monday, much of the detail in Ms Gillard's memoirs had been kept a closely guarded secret. The interview airs Tuesday night at 6.50 on the Nine Network.","Bob Carr has bit back at claims he was lazy saying he worked around the clock .

"A convenience store owner has been charged with murder after what police believe to be a suspicious fire explosion, which claimed the lives of three people earlier this month. Police allege the fire was deliberately lit and arrested  Adeel Khan from Greenacre, in Sydney's south-west, on Tuesday at about 8.30am at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown. The 44-year-old was charged with several offences including three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Adeel Khan, 44, has been arrested in hospital over the fire explosion in Rozelle - Sydney's inner west - that killed three people . Emergency services were called to a fire explosion at a convenience store on Darling Street on September 4 . Bianka O'Brien and one-year-old son Jude, along with 27-year-old neighbour Chris Noble, died in the fire in Rozelle, Sydney's inner west. Another three people were injured, including store owner Adeel Khan who denied responsibility for the tragedy. He was also charged with three counts of manslaughter and 17 charges relating to the damage of property, including one count of setting fire for a financial gain. Mr Khan, who was rescued from the fire, became the focus of police inquiries after he was admitted to hospital in Sydney's south west. When the Pakistan Consul visited Khan in hospital, the shop owner said the blast was started by a gas cylinder. Reports claim wife Naima Adeel (right) was worried about her husband's (left) unusual disappearance from their home in south-west Sydney at 4am - the morning the shop on Darling Street burnt to the ground .

Daily Telegraph reports than Mr Khan told the consul member: 'I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened, I am very upset.' 'I have sympathy with the people who lost their lives.' However reports claim his wife  was worried about her husband's unusual disappearance from their home in south-west Sydney at 4am - the morning the shop on Darling Street was destroyed in the fatal explosion. A close friend revealed Naima Adeel was concerned when she discovered her husband wasn't at their Greenacre home and tried to reach him on his phone a number of times. Days after the fire rocked the close-knit community, neighbours told media outlets that Mr Khan usually closed his store at midnight and reopened it at 7am. Rozelle businesses say it was unusual for Mr Khan who wasn't often seen behind the counter of his business, to be at the shop that early as it doesn't open until about 7am. But Ms Adeel, who has been questioned by police over the fatal fire at Rozelle, has also dismissed allegations her husband was involved and labelled them as 'rumours'. Soon after the blast on September 4, police discovered traces of petrol at the Rozelle convenience store which burnt to the ground. Mr Khan will remain in hospital under police guard and there will be a bedside hearing. Bianka O'Brien and one-year-old son Jude were killed in the fatal inferno earlier this month . Chris Noble (pictured), 27, was also killed in the fire explosion which also injured three others, including shop owner Adeel Khan .","A 44-year-old has been arrested at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown, Sydney's south-west, on Tuesday morning .

"Traces of accelerant have been found at the site of a convenience store explosion that claimed the lives of three people, including a 12-month-old baby and his mother. Senior police revealed the blast was being treated as a suspected arson attack after traces of petrol were uncovered at the Darling Street store in Rozelle after it exploded and burnt to the ground last Thursday, Nine News reports.

A devastated John O'Brien (pictured with his son) paid tribute to his young family . Investigators have ruled out the involvement of a silver car seen racing from the scene by a witness, just moments after the fire erupted. The owner of the Rozelle convenience store Adeel Khan was interviewed by police from his bed in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at the weekend. Mr Khan, 44, remains in a serious condition after rescue crews found him pinned under a fridge in the wreckage. Police said they will need to re-interview him once his condition improves. It is not clear why the 44-year-old was in the store at 4am when the fire broke out. The surrounding tenants, Chris Noble, 27, Bianka O’Brien, 31, and her one-year-old son Jude, all died as a result of the blast. Mr Khan's wife told Nine News she was concerned about media reports insinuating her husband was a suspect in the investigation. 'Just because he is a survivor doesn't mean he has done anything wrong,' she said. Friends and family have paid tribute to Chris Noble, 27, who also lost is life in the explosion in Sydney's inner west suburb of Rozelle . The family of Chris Noble (from left sister Kate, mother Liz and father Ross) gave a press conference at NSW Police Executive Offices in Sydney on Friday after he was killed in a Rozelle convenience store fire . Mrs O'Brien's husband John is said to have left his home less than an hour before flames engulfed his home located above a shop on Darling Street. He released a statement on Sunday that paid tribute to his late wife who he said was much more than the love of his life, and his baby boy Jude, who Mr O'Brien described as the perfect child. 'On Thursday morning I lost my beloved wife, Bianka, and our baby Jude,' the statement began. 'Bianka was an inspiration to all who knew her – she was loyal, caring and absolutely loved life. People gravitated towards her because of her beautiful and warm personality. 'Bianka and I were together for eight years, married for two, and to say she was the love of my life is an understatement', Mr O'Brien wrote. 'She was an exceptional person, a wonderful wife and an even better mother. This week Bianka was due to finish up her part-time work so she could move into the next phase of her life and fulfil her dream of caring for our boy full time. 'That brings me to my son, Jude, who I love with all my heart. By far the proudest moment of my life was becoming a father. He was a perfect baby and never stopped smiling', the statement continued. 'Jude had just started to walk and was only just discovering the world around him. Everything was exciting to him and he was just a joy to be around. 'He made everyone smile,' Mr O'Brien continued. The message ended with a heartfelt sentiment for the family of Chris Noble, a neighbour also killed in the blaze. 'Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this.' On Thursday morning I lost my beloved wife, Bianka, and our baby Jude. Bianka was an inspiration to all who knew her – she was loyal, caring and absolutely loved life. People gravitated towards her because of her beautiful and warm personality. Bianka and I were together for eight years, married for two, and to say she was the love of my life is an understatement. I can’t believe how quickly those eight years have flown by but they have definitely been the best years of my life. I know I was truly loved by her and the feeling was entirely mutual. She was an exceptional person, a wonderful wife and an even better mother. This week Bianka was due to finish up her part-time work so she could move into the next phase of her life and fulfil her dream of caring for our boy full time. Being a mother made her happy and she was a natural at it. That brings me to my son, Jude, who I love with all my heart. By far the proudest moment of my life was becoming a father. He was a perfect baby and never stopped smiling. Jude had just started to walk and was only just discovering the world around him. Everything was exciting to him and he was just a joy to be around. He made everyone smile. On behalf of Bianka’s father, Bill, and myself I would like to thank the community for the many well-wishes, flowers and phone calls we have received. The events of the past few days have been devastating, but we have been overwhelmed by the response and support from the community. I would also like to thank the police and other emergency services who have been by our side and continue to support us. Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this. We now ask that the media and public continue to respect our privacy during this time. On Sunday, a resident who survived the convenience store blaze that claimed the lives of three of his neighbours has spoken about how their deaths have weighed heavily on him. Anthony Carroll, 49, said he has spent much time since the tragedy wondering if Bianka and Jude O'Brien could have been saved from the devastating fire if he had known they were in the building. 'Had the fire crews known about the access, could they have got to Bianka and the baby?' he told Sydney Morning Herald. 'That's something I don't know. It has sat heavily with me.' The convenience store went up in flames about 4am on Thursday morning and an explosion was heard by residents who lived about 1km away from the scene . Rescue crews have spent days looking through the rubble for Ms O'Brien, Jude and Mr Noble . Mr Carroll jumped from his burning apartment following the explosion at the convenience store and said he knew the owner of the store, Adeel Khan, who was hospitalised after the blaze. He said there were no indicators to suggest the fire could have been part of an 'insurance job' and Mr Carroll also revealed he visited the store most days. 'I saw him on a daily basis. His wife was there in the afternoon and they were talking about the stock. The shop was always fully stocked. If you have got financial problems where are you going to get the money from to keep the shop full?' Mr Carroll said, and also described the owner as a 'family man'. It follows Mr Noble's friends and family sharing special memories of the 27-year-old on Saturday, commemorating him as a 'great guy' with 'real character'. Shaken by the horrific loss of a community member, player and friend, Pythons coach Graham Rice, paid tribute to Noble at his commemoration service on Saturday evening, by dedicating a special jersey in memory of the talented sportsman, ABC reported. 'He just loved his mates in Canowindra and he just wanted to come back and play with them,' Mr Rice said. On Friday, the mother of Mr Noble tearfully remembered her son as a 'beautiful', athletic and sociable young man who loved watches. Mum Liz, dad Ross and sister Kate fronted the media to pay tribute to their son and brother Chris Noble from Canowindra. Mr Noble's sister Kate wiped away tears as mum Liz told reporters: 'We lost our beautiful boy yesterday... He should have been safe in bed'.","Police found traces of accelerant at the Rozelle convenience store that exploded into flames last Thursday .

"Chris Mumme owns the butcher on Darling Street less than 100 metres from where a convenience store went up in flames on Thursday morning . Lucky is not a word many would use to describe a situation where one has lost everything but their life. But those who survived a tragic fire which caused the death of three locals believe they are just that. Chris Mumme, who owns the butcher on Darling Street, Balmain - just a few shops down from the rubble where a convenience store once stood - has not been able to access his shop nor his flat above since the blaze on Thursday. He has lost thousands of dollars worth of meat as his store has been left without power since the explosion. However, he considers himself one of the more fortunate ones in this devastating event. 'It's really insignificant compared to what other people have had happened, I've lost my livelihood and my meat but I'm alive. I'm lucky', Chris told Daily Mail Australia. He told of the toll the tragedy, in which Bianka O'Brien, 31, her 12-month-old son Jude, and another man Chris Noble, 27, were killed in had on the local community. The convenience store's owner Adeel Khan, 44, was pulled from the rubble early on Thursday and taken to hospital along with two other men who jumped from the apartments above. 'Everyone's in tears every five minutes, it's so overwhelming,' he revealed. Despite this, locals have banded together in a show of strength and solidarity and Chris said it's as though the suburb in Sydney's inner west is a 'country town'. 'We're pretty strong, we get knocked down we get up again, we've got no choice'. 'We're all the lucky ones in the context of it all but at the end of the day everyone's affected in different ways, and everyone has different coping mechanisms,' Chris added. A woman who lived next door to the convenience store which went up in flames in the early hours of Thursday morning also told of how blessed she felt despite being left with almost nothing but the clothes on her back. The blaze at 627-629 Darling Street, Rozelle, claimed the life of three people buried beneath the rubble . Apartments on either side were damaged and will be demolished, and a huge stretch of the street still remains blocked off . Lynette revealed firefighters managed to salvage her mobile phone and handbag with her passport and drivers licence inside. However her house will have to be demolished. 'It is lucky, you've got your life and you've got your identity', she told Daily Mail Australia. Local mother Cassandra Kilby has set up a Facebook group called Help For Rozelle Fire Residents to support those affected by the tragedy . The woman relived the moment the building beside hers went up in flames as she watched from the street after escaping. Lynette said the men who lived next door to her were distressed as they searched for their housemate. 'I could hear them calling, I thought it was Robbie Robbie but it ended up being Nobby Nobby when I first came out of the house,' she said, referring to Chris Noble's mates calling for their friend who passed away in the terrible fire. 'The fellow upstairs he was filming it and telling the fire brigade there was a back entry they should look at.' 'That woman, Bianka, and the baby, the fact that it was an internal stair that came in the front of the building and they had to exit via the shop... 'Just from the explosion that occurred and from the impact it had on my building - the same thing in her building? You just knew it was not good.' Lynette also revealed some of the rumors flying around the town following the tragedy. 'There were so many stupid stories going around, saying oh you know the car that took them before the explosion was someone who abducted them and we're going that'd be good, then they'd be alive.' Lynette is referring to reports that a silver sedan was seen speeding down the street away from the store shortly before it burst into flames. In a meeting held in Balmain Town Hall on Sunday morning authorities and local members of parliament addressed questions that locals had about their businesses, homes and community. The building was obliterated in the blaze, and raised concerns about asbestos in the area . The owner of the convenience store had to be pulled from the rubble after he was stuck under a commercial fridge when the building collapsed . Residents voiced their concerns over reports asbestos particles in the air, which authorities confirmed there were in fact none, and what the next steps to rebuild the strip were. A group - called Help For Rozelle Fire Residents - has already been created to assist victims of the tragedy, and at the head of that is Balmain woman Cassandra Kilby. Cassandra knew Bianka and her little boy Jude and said what began on Thursday as a group for local mums to communicate with and support each other quickly turned into something bigger. 'It just started as a way that a group of mums that were acquainted with Bianka to have a means to continue to communicate and see what we could do, and from there it just grew', she told Daily Mail Australia. Leichhardt mayor Darcy Byrne said the 'devastating cost' of the tragedy was the loss of human life . Mayor of Leichhardt Darcy Byrne told reporters after the address that although the local economy would be severely affected by the fire and subsequent closure of Darling Street and many businesses, the real devastation was the loss of life. 'We've lost three of our people, including a small baby, that is the true devastating cost of this tragedy. Our economy will suffer for a time, but Rozelle will bounce back. 'We can't lose sight of the fact that the truly devastating consequence of this explosion is the loss of three of our people. We need to come together to offer every assistance we can to the victim's family and friends'. Mayor Byrne said.","On Thursday morning a devastating fire at a convenience store claimed three lives in Rozelle .

Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this. We now ask that the media and public continue to respect our privacy during this time. On Sunday, a resident who survived the convenience store blaze that claimed the lives of three of his neighbours has spoken about how their deaths have weighed heavily on him. Anthony Carroll, 49, said he has spent much time since the tragedy wondering if Bianka and Jude O'Brien could have been saved from the devastating fire if he had known they were in the building. 'Had the fire crews known about the access, could they have got to Bianka and the baby?' he told Sydney Morning Herald. 'That's something I don't know. It has sat heavily with me.' The convenience store went up in flames about 4am on Thursday morning and an explosion was heard by residents who lived about 1km away from the scene . Rescue crews have spent days looking through the rubble for Ms O'Brien, Jude and Mr Noble . Shaken by the horrific loss of a community member, player and friend, Pythons coach Graham Rice, paid tribute to Noble at his commemoration service on Saturday evening, by dedicating a special jersey in memory of the talented sportsman, ABC reported. 'He just loved his mates in Canowindra and he just wanted to come back and play with them,' Mr Rice said. On Friday, the mother of Mr Noble tearfully remembered her son as a 'beautiful', athletic and sociable young man who loved watches. Mum Liz, dad Ross and sister Kate fronted the media to pay tribute to their son and brother Chris Noble from Canowindra. Mr Noble's sister Kate wiped away tears as mum Liz told reporters: 'We lost our beautiful boy yesterday... He should have been safe in bed'.","Adeel Khan denies responsibility for the triple tragedy during a hospital visit from the Pakistani consel .

"She gave her life to the silver screen, jumping to her death from the 'H' of the Hollywood sign at just 24 years old. Now, 82 years later, struggling actress Peg Entwistle is finally getting a starring role as it is revealed her life will be the subject of a new blockbuster. The tale of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed comedienne who desperately wanted to be given serious roles will be told by Rush Hour producer Arthur Sarkissian and American History X director Tony Kaye. Scroll down for video . Starlet: The story of Peg Entwistle who jumped to her death from the Hollywood sign will be made into a movie . Tragic: The 24-year-old was found in a ravine at the base of the sign, which then read Hollywoodland, on September 18, 1932, by a hiker. She left a purse, jacket, and a note which read: 'I am afraid, I am a coward' And with plans to style her story on Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, it seems Entwistle will finally be recognised as the femme fatale she dreamed of being. The movie will immortalise a myth which has captured the imagination of film anoraks around the world for decades. She started her career with success on Broadway, starring in a string of highly-acclaimed plays between 1925 and 1932. Critics revered her performances in The Wild Duck and The Uninvited Guest and in J.M. Barrie’s Alice Sit By The Fire. Even a young Bette Davis is reported to have said she wanted to be like Entwistle after watching her in an Ibsen play. News report: Entwistle's death caused a flurry of media attention across the world . But her personal life took a dark turn after she married Guys & Dolls actor Robert Keith in 1927 as he later revealed he had a six-year-old son with another woman. They divorced in 1929. Entwistle, who many say likely suffered from depression, was still a darling of the critics in New York. Many reviews touted her acting as 'better than the show warranted'. Finally, in May 1932, she landed a serious supporting role in a play opposite Humphrey Bogart in downtown LA. She then secured her first film role as a minor character in Thirteen Women - widely regarded as the first female ensemble movie. But on September 18, a month before the film opened on October 14, she was found dead. Director: Tony Kaye, who made American History X, will turn Entwistle's life story into a blockbuster . Aspiration: The blue-eyed Welsh actress was often cast in comedy roles but wanted to play serious characters . Blockbuster: The film of her life will be styled on Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, according to the movie crew . She left a jacket, shoes and a purse at the foot of the sign, which then read Hollywoodland, and a note. It read: 'I am afraid, I am a coward. I am sorry for everything. If I had done this a long time ago, it would have saved a lot of pain. P.E.' She was identified by her uncle who read her story in a newspaper. Decades later, hundreds flock to the sign each year to pay tribute to Entwistle, who many claim haunts the hill.","Peg Entwistle, 24, jumped off 'H' of Hollywoodland sign in 1932 .

"The Germans are 'bewildered' by Britain's fixation with the Second World War according to a prominent historian who says it is time to move on from the obsession. Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, says Germany has a 'huge admiration' for Britain and that it wants to build a proper relationship with the UK. But he adds that the Germans are bewildered that Britain 'does not want to know' about the new, modern Germany. Don't mention the war! Basil Fawlty goose-stepping around in the Fawlty Towers episode 'The Germans'. The director of the British Museum say Germans are bewildered with the British fixation with the Second World War . Mr MacGregor's comments come ahead of a new Radio 4 series, where he will present a 600-year history of Germany, through 70 typically German objects from bratwurst to the Brandenburg Gate. The British Museum will also display an accompanying exhibition to the series from next month. But speaking about modern Germany in a interview with Radio Times, he says all the country wants is to be allies with Britain. He explained: 'They have huge admiration for the political traditions, the political stability, huge admiration for the way Britain fought the Second World War and delighted by the sport. 'But they are very dismayed that when they come to Britain they are greeted with Nazi salutes! Bewildered that Britain doesn't want to appear to know about Germany now, but wants to freeze the relationship as it was 70 years ago. The Germans have a huge admiration for Britain, according to director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor . Mr MacGregor says Britain's desire to cling on to World War Two, pictured Operation Overlord in 1944, blocks a proper relationship with Germany now . 'And totally bewildered by this desire to cling on to a moment that was a long time ago and blocks a proper relationship with Germany now.' His comments echo the famous episode of Fawlty Towers, where John Cleese's character Basil Fawlty hosts German guests but then accidentally offends them by talking about the war, goose stepping and impersonating Adolf Hitler. But Mr McGregor also adds that Germany has learned from its past, saying that they know that 'power' and 'acting alone' is dangerous and that they would be happy to have an ally in Britain. However he conceded: 'Whether Britain wants to play that role, and whether Britain sees itself as wanting to be Germany's friend, I don't know.' The programme, entitled 'Germany: Memories of a Nation' begins on Radio 4 on Monday, and will examine the key moments of the country's past using 70 different objects. British Commandos operating inside Germany in March 1945. The director of the British Museum says all modern Germany wants now is to be strong allies with Britain . The series comes after Mr MacGregor and the British Museum joined the BBC for the programme 'A History of the World in 100 Objects', which has had 35 million downloads. It has also inspired the idea of history being taught to schoolchildren through objects to coincide with the introduction of a tough new chronological curriculum. Children aged five to 14 and their teachers are being encouraged to access images online and learn about them from reliable entries written by curators.","Director of British Museum says Germans bewildered by British war obsession .

"A dog has been miraculously rescued after spending a week trapped at the base of the highest sea cliffs in England. Sprig the springer spaniel was only discovered stuck on rocks near Foreland Point, Devon, thanks to a chance sighting by a volunteer RNLI lifeboat crew in Somerset. The nine-year-old dog had been missing for more than a week in the Minehead area. Scroll down for video . Rescuers pictured with Sprig aboard after having pulled him down from the isolated mountainside . The rescuers manage to get a hold of Sprig at the water's edge before attempting to get pull him into the boat . The rescuers called in a second boat, designed for working close inshore, to help take him off the rock . Sprig is hoisted from the rocks after the rescuers spotted him from a distance by pure chance . Sprig with his rescuers, from left, Emma Turner, Phil Sanderson, Andrew Escott, Phil Hobbs, Harry Mouzouri, Ross Purvis and Paul Arnold . Minehead RNLI had taken the boat close into the cliffs after noticing a sheep that was apparently trapped but were just turning away when a movement some way below the animal caught their eye. Helmsman Andrew Escott said: 'We went in as close as we could and then we could see it was a dog. It was about 30 feet above the water and we couldn’t work out how it had got in that position.' Mr Escott managed to jump ashore and climb up to Sprig. Minehead’s D-class boat - designed for working close inshore - was then called in so the dog could be lowered down safely. Mr Escott said: 'He had clearly been there for some time because he was licking water off my dry suit. And he did seem rather pleased to see us.' It was only after Sprig had been taken back to Minehead lifeboat station and given food and water that it became clear he had been the subject of a major search by his owners, Mark and Susie Sanders, from Wheddon Cross, near Minehead. Sprig was trapped after he became stuck at the bottom of the cliffs (circled) at Foreland Point . Reunited: Owner Robert Sanders and his pet Sprig have been reunited after Sprig spent a week on the rocks . They and their family had organised search parties and scoured the area around Foreland Point after the dog disappeared during a walk there on August 22. They had plastered the area with posters appealing for any sightings while local fishing boats and an animal ambulance team from North Devon had checked along the shoreline. But Mrs Sanders said: 'We were coming to the conclusion that he must have wandered off and then been stolen. 'I just could not believe it when we had a call to say the lifeboat crew had spotted him and rescued him. 'It’s amazing - the best news ever. Bless them.'","Pet dog named Sprig was missing for a week around Foreland Point, Devon .

"A cheeky Scottish red-head claims to have saved hundreds of pounds in the high street - thanks to his home-made 'ginger discount card'. Richard Macrae, 30, from Aberdeen, was given the fake card by a friend for his birthday and he has successfully used it in bars, restaurants, cinemas and even with taxi drivers. The comic book illustrator claims to have saved more than £200 and said he is constantly asked by people how they can acquire one too. Richard Macrae, 30, from Aberdeen claims to have saved more than £200 using his 'ginger discount card' The Aberdeen comic book illustrator said he had has successfully used it in bars, restaurants and cinemas . The cheeky Scot tries his luck using the home-made 'ginger discount card' at a Burger King . He told the Tab: 'People have always given me stick for my hair colour, but now I'm going out three nights a week and saving a fortune. The joke is on them. 'It comes out with me more than my bank card. My reputation precedes me and once I was asked by a security guard if I was the ""ginger discount guy"". 'I ask if they do the ginger discount, and when they look confused I slide across my card. 'Usually everyone gets the humour behind it, but some people look confused and wonder if it's real which is always a laugh, but most get the joke. 'I've saved a couple of hundred pounds maybe, with money off booze, taxis, food and club entries and over four years it fairly builds up. 'It opens folk up to a bit of banter back and forth but I never try for any specific amount of discount. Any money off is always handy.' Mr Macrae said people often asked him how they could get hold of a 'ginger discount card' The thrifty red-head said he had received discounts on cinema tickets, drinks and taxi rides. But he admits it has not all been plain sailing and he has suffered his share of setbacks. He said: 'I've been asked to leave a bar once because the bartender assumed that I was too drunk if I was attempting to use the card. 'But usually the only places that have turned it down are places I've used it at before anyway.' Still, he says the card has proved popular with both gingers and non-gingers. He said: 'Once they see it plenty of folk ask about getting one. 'It's not just ginger people. Anyone who has seen it work always asks for one, whether that is for a beard discount card, a popped collar discount card, the list goes on and on.' Mr Macrae tries to use the card in a bar - he says he has saved more than £200 in the four years he has had it . Rik Gillespie, 30, a barman at the city's JamJar pub, said: 'I used to serve Richard and his friends regularly, as they were good customers and a great laugh. 'The first time I saw the ginger discount card I thought it was brilliant and gave him the same discount that we would for students just because it looked so real.' Another to give Mr Macrae discount was barmaid Kirsty Davidson, 24, of Aberdeen's Illicit Still. She said: 'I thought it was really funny and unique as I had never seen anyone try use something like that before. 'I gave him 20 per cent food and drink discount as he was also in for food at the time. 'I decided it was all in good fun and he was a bit of a chancer.'","Richard Macrae, 30, from Aberdeen was given the fake card for his birthday .

"If Darth Vader did fast food, it might look something like this. Burger King Japan’s burger offerings really have turned to the dark side, with the fast food chain now offering a black-bunned burger that comes with black cheese. The chain’s customers first tucked into black burgers back in 2012, when the Premium Kuro Burger (kuro means ‘black’) was introduced. And they proved very popular.

"Love them or not, chrysanthemums are among the world's oldest cultivated plants. They've been grown in China for more than 3,000 years and in Japan since around 800 AD. The flowers might remind you of funerals and their distinctive smell isn't to everyone's liking. But as a plant group, chrysanthemums are so versatile and variable that it would be daft to write off them all off. Huge exhibition blooms, like comic mother-in-law wedding hats, may not be to your taste. Visit a big autumn flower show, however, or a chrysanthemum society event and you're bound to be impressed — especially by the patience and skill needed to achieve such floral extremes. Huge exhibition blooms, like comic mother-in-law wedding hats, may not be to your taste. Visit a big autumn flower show, however, or a chrysanthemum society event and you're bound to be impressed . Growing competition varieties can be rewarding and it's always thrilling to win a trophy. If you'd like to try, contact the Chrysanthemum Society (nationalchrysanthemumsociety.co.uk) and get to know some of the members. There's also a chrysanthemum column in the weekly magazine Garden News. You don't have to be an expert to grow them. You could just buy what Americans call 'pot mums'. These are houseplants, raised in their millions in factories and marketed as soon as the flowers open. But that's cheating. BORDER BEAUTIES . 'Pot Mums' — that name makes me cringe — are pretty enough, for non-gardeners. However if you like perennials or long-lasting patio plants, you'll get far more satisfaction from dependable border chrysanthemums. They're easy to grow and the best will provide superb colour from August to Christmas. Colours range through clean pinks, yellows and white to brooding reds, bronzes and salmon. Flower shapes and sizes vary widely too, from little button blooms to graceful sprays. If you like perennials or long-lasting patio plants, you'll get far more satisfaction from dependable border chrysanthemums . What's more, they flower year after year and blend superbly with such other perennials as asters and late salvias. The tall varieties, work best at the back of the border while the more compact, bushy kinds grow beautifully in big patio pots. RAISE THE STAKES . Border chrysanthemums are good-natured, flourish in full sun in any fertile, free-draining soil. They hate being overcrowded and taller ones benefit from support. I use interlocking metal stakes coated in dark green plastic, which are barely visible Like most perennials, these plants benefit from rejuvenation treatment. A clump will go on for years, untouched. But dig it up every third spring, split the roots down to small divisions and replant. The plants will flower more freely, grow stronger stems and retain vigour. You can also propagate them from cuttings taken in early spring. Find chrysanthemum plants on sale at garden centres now, among other perennials. Specialist growers will carry a wider selection. Woottens of Wenhaston (woottensplants.com) stock an impressive range, some available now; others to be propagated for later. Find chrysanthemum plants on sale at garden centres now, among other perennials . My favourites from their list include the brooding red Ruby Mound, gorgeous single pink Aunt Millicent and purplish pink, button-sized Anastasia. Larger flowered varieties include the tall, old-fashioned white variety Wedding Day. The best border varieties have a long flowering period. In my garden, Early Yellow opens in August, sometimes with a second burst of later flowers. Last to appear, silvery pink Emperor of China still carries bloom in early December. A useful trick with early varieties such as the pink Clara Curtis and straw-to-salmon Mary Stoker is to do the 'Chelsea chop'. During Chelsea week — around May 21 — cut all young stems back by a third of their height. This improves their standing power and extends the flowering period. It also delays flowering, enabling the plants to avoid thrips — a pest that can ruin petals in August, but is usually gone by September. Who'd have thought such brutal treatment would do a plant so many favours?","Chrysanthemums are among the world's oldest cultivated plants.

"With its swathes of waving blue flowers, delicious scent and squadrons of butterflies and bees, I am standing in a field that could be in Provence in the South of France. A great plantation of lavender, rows and rows of it, stretches away from me, snaking across the hillside. Close your eyes and you could be on the slopes of Mont Ventoux, where lavender is as important a crop as wheat or grapes. Amazingly, however, I am on a very special 50-acre farm in North Yorkshire — a county where conservative farmers rarely venture away from traditional livestock and grain growing. Emma Goodwill tends to the lavender on the farmland bought by her father, Nigel. He acquired it as an investment following the death of his wife, Lynne, from breast cancer in 1993 . This lavender farm belongs to the Goodwill family, and for all the beauty it brings to the landscape, the story of how this field of soft blue came to grow there is a deeply poignant one. In 1993, Nigel Goodwill’s wife Lynne died of breast cancer. Their son, Sam, was just five years old and their daughter, Emma Jane, had turned three only a few days before. Their devastated dad, a Yorkshire-born property businessman, decided to leave work and raise the two children himself. He was devoted to his new role. The children went to the school near their village of Terrington, which is not far from Castle Howard. A year after Lynne’s death, Nigel heard about some land just outside the village which was coming up for sale. It may look like a scene from Provence - but this is in fact the Goodwill family's 50-acre farm in North Yorkshire . ‘I wanted to buy something for the children as an investment, so I put in a bid,’ he says. But he said nothing to the children, not wishing to disappoint them if he failed to get it. ‘On the day the deal was to be done, I asked my solicitor to call me at home and, if I had been successful, use code if one of the children answered the phone. The solicitor called later, and said cryptically to Sam: “Tell your father to take a bath.”’ Hearing the message, Nigel realised he’d got the farm and jumped in the car with Sam and Emma. ‘When we got there, I said to them: “This is your farm now.” And when I saw them running across the field towards the woodland, I knew I’d done the right thing.’ Nigel, who insists he is neither a gardener nor farmer, wanted to do something different with the land. ‘I wondered what to grow, and had decided it should be garlic, but then one day, in a waiting room, I picked up a magazine and began reading an article about lavender.’ Inspired, he did some research into the soil and hill position of the farm — then planted ten types of lavender in the field. It became a project for him and the children. They’d regularly go there after school to work on the fledgling farm. Emma, who’s now 22, remembers it well. ‘It never seemed odd to us,’ she says. ‘Dad and Sam did most of the work, while I watched.’ It takes four years for a lavender plant to reach full size. The largest of the species, Lavendin Grosso — the type favoured in Provence for making lavender oil, toiletries and soap — grows to 3ft. There are a number of traditional, English-bred varieties, including my personal favourite, Hidcote, which has the deepest blue flowers yet grows to just 18 in high. Nigel Goodwill at the farm, which is near to the village of Terrington. He refers to his children, who now work there, collectively as 'the boss' At first it seems extraordinary that lavender, a plant associated with sunshine and blue skies, should do so well in the Yorkshire hills, which are often snow-covered in winter and where winds can blow at up to 100 miles an hour. But Nigel, who has never been to Provence, had realised at the outset that lavender could survive on his children’s farm. ‘Lavender is very hardy and can take frosts of up to minus 20,’ he says. In fact, the Yorkshire climate mirrors that of the South of France, where winters are also harsh. The lavender on the farm begins life as a cutting, propagated in a tunnel. Once these cuttings have formed a small but sturdy bush, they can be planted outside. Head gardener Julia Snowball says: ‘All they need is plenty of good drainage, so a hilly position is perfect, and poor soil is fine.’ She plants a variety of lavenders, not just for the pretty patchwork created by the various purples, blue, pinks and white, but so they can pick it from May until September. ‘Folgate is the first to flower, then Hidcote — and we are still picking flowers in November from the Vera lavender,’ says Julia. Once the flowering is over, the lavender is pruned down to the hard wood, which helps ensure abundant flowering the following year and keeps the plants tidy. Today, there is a shop and tea room selling food and products made with their own lavender. I have to admit being sceptical about the use of lavender in food. I remember, years ago, ordering a lavender pannacotta in a café: it tasted like body lotion. ‘Ah, that is because chefs have to know which lavender to use,’ says Nigel. ‘There are two main groups: Lavendin, which is used for soaps and perfume, and Augustifolia, which is best for cooking because it has less oil. If a chef gets the wrong type, then food can taste awful.’ Recipes for their own lavender biscuits, jams, ice cream and scones have been perfected over the years. Sam now runs Lavender World, the farm’s online shop, while Emma, who has just graduated from university, is currently working at the farm. Nigel often refers to them collectively as ‘the boss’. ‘It’s their farm,’ he says. ‘They make all the decisions — and I work for them.’ I taste an ‘EJ’ sundae, named after Emma, from a tall glass packed with a sinful combination of lavender ice cream, honeycomb crisp, crushed berries and whipped cream. Rich and fragrant, the slight, heady hint of mint from the lavender is subtle and surprising. The freshly baked scones, dotted with flowers and served with a dollop of clotted cream and a berry and lavender jam, are a revelation. Outside, visitors begin to arrive. The farm has become a popular stop for tourists. Some just marvel at the oddity of it — a purple patch on a landscape of wheat fields and green pasture; some come to buy lavender and other plants for their own gardens and window boxes. At the heart of a lavender field is a memorial to Lynne: four pyramids each built to the height of father, mother, son and daughter at the time of her death. The pyramid representing the three-year-old Emma is particularly moving. ‘Breast cancer is a terrible disease,’ says Nigel. “My mother died of it, as well as my wife. It is awful ...” He trails off, looking away. His family’s unusual farm has achieved extraordinary success, but none of it was planned. It grew from a small idea to bring some happiness back to three people, and became a lot more besides. ‘We never expected it to be like this,’ says Emma, frantically serving a queue of customers buying lavender plants. ‘I think Mum would be laughing with us from heaven.’","Nigel Goodwill bought farmland as an investment for his children after the death of his wife, Lynne, from breast cancer in 1993 .

"Blooming hanging baskets, immaculately trimmed lawns and perfect topiary have long been used by rural folk to show off the best of village life. But while rivalries have always existed between neighbouring communities desperate to be crowned Britain’s Best Kept village, conservationists say increased competition for pristine parishes is brewing a far bigger wildlife scandal for the UK countryside. They claim all untidy patches of public scrub land, which are prime habitats for insects and birds, are being cleared and made to look ‘too neat and tidy’ for the contests, whose rules afford few points to villages with scruffier areas that encourage wildlife to thrive. Scroll down for video . Perfection or organised chaos? Animal charities prefer messy hedgerows (right) to neat hanging baskets (left). The Bug Life conservation trust said constantly striving for neat and tidy villages could harm wildlife . A touch of colour: Britain's Best Kept Village contests are arranged by regional organisers including the Campaign to Protect Rural England, but much of the emphasis in the scoring is on things looking neat . As a consequence, environmentalists say the competitions are unwittingly contributing to the decline of some species of honey bees, butterflies and birds, which were once in abundance across Britain. Provision for wildlife accounts for just 10 per cent of the scoring for villages entering Best Kept Village contests, with much more focus on the appearance and cleanliness of streets, flowerbeds and other public areas. Campaigners say that, as a consequence, the strict rules are forcing parish councils to get rid of any slightly untidy areas of scrub land, including compost heaps and log piles, which are perfect breeding grounds and habitats for insects and birds. Over-mown lawns and severely trimmed hedges, which are awarded more points, are also leading to the decline of common species, they say. The competition is run in a number of counties in England, including Devon, Wiltshire, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire and Hertfordshire. In each case it is organised by a regional group, including branches of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE). Perfect for the birds: Sparrows make themselves at home in a tangled hedgerow in a residential garden . Picture postcard beauty: Haughton in Staffordshire (pictured) has won a string of Best Kept village contests . Steve Falk, an entomologist at the conservation trust Bug Life, said Best Kept village competitions often had a ‘very old fashioned’ approach to conservation that was ‘unhelpful’ in a modern world. He said the criteria in such contests was contradicting Government efforts to halt the decline of bees and other insects. ‘I’ve come across those sorts of villages,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. ‘The full blown neat and tidy approach is a travesty in this day and age. ‘When you consider the Government has introduced a national pollinator strategy why would you want Best Kept Village criteria that run contrary to that?’ Fading scene: Butterfly species are in decline . But he admitted that conservationists needed to ‘strike a balance’ with organisers. ‘We aren’t purists,’ Mr Falk said. ‘I think most conservation organisations would say there is a lot to be said for presenting wildlife habitats nicely. Rotting material doesn’t need to be visible at all. You can have it in nooks and crannies.’ Half of all bumblebee species in the UK are in long term decline and seven bumblebee species have fallen in number by more than 50 per cent in the last 25 years. Butterflies are another species also on the decline as a consequence of the destruction or poor management of their habitats, Liam Creedon, a spokesman for the Butterfly Conservation charity, said. According to the most recent figures, from 2011, three quarters of British butterfly species decreased in abundance over the previous decade. Both bees and butterflies are vital for pollinating crops – £12.6billion worth of crops (or 84 per cent of the European Union total) rely on such insects. ‘Many familiar butterflies are now far less abundant than they were, raising concerns for the health of our environment,’ Mr Creedon added. ‘Caterpillars also love patches of untidy, unkempt undergrowth with long grasses and other wild plants.’ Diana Moyse, who judges the Best Kept Village competition for the CPRE in Devon CPRE, admitted that, while wildlife provision is taken into account by some, it ought to be better reflected in the formal competition criteria. ‘I think things can be tweaked,’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t be averse to within Devon making it more explicit because I think it is a big issue.’ She said the results for this year’s contest in the county were due to be announced this week.","Over-trimmed lawns and hedges are disadvantaging wildlife, say experts .

"A door bell saved the life of a pooch trapped underground in a rabbit hole for four days. Henry, a border terrier, darted down the hole near his home in Prestbury, Cheshire, and was so far underground firefighters couldn't even find him using a 'snake eye' camera. A crew member then suggested they make the dog bark – and owner Beverley Leonard remembered that though her beloved pet rarely made a noise, he always responded to the door bell. Beverley Leonard, middle, with some of the firefighters who helped saved her dog Henry, who looks worn out after being trapped underground for four days . Henry didn't bark much which made him difficult to find, but he always responded to the sound of the doorbell as his Cheshire home so his owner rang it through an amplifier to help locate him . She rushed back home, took the bell from the door, and rang it at every rabbit hole she could find – until they finally found Henry. The seven-year-old had had race out into a field and disappeared and because he didn't bark much Ms Leonard couldn't find him. After three days of fruitless searching, the animal rescue unit from Knutsford Fire Station were called to help. The crew used a ‘snake eye’ camera for confined spaces and spent several hours searching the fields, but called off the search when no sign of Henry could be found. But after ripping the door bell off her front door and using an amplifier, Ms Leonard was able to find Henry, and then called the firefighters back to finish the job. The field that Henry ran across before getting trapped down a rabbit hole for four days . She said: 'It must have been just about the last hole in the last field, and we were about to give up, when we heard him. 'I rang the fire service’s animal rescue unit again, they'd said they would come back if there were any developments, and they got here quickly. 'They had to saw through a holly bush and dig until they got to Henry. When they got him up it was like we’d won the World Cup. Everyone was cheering and so happy Henry was fine.' Henry is now back at home, safe and well. Ms Leonard had nothing but praise for his rescuers, saying: 'Every one of them was incredibly sympathetic and they didn’t want to leave even when we though all was lost.'","Henry the dog took off across a field and got lost down a rabbit hole .

"She's famous for her down-to-earth approach and as these pictures reveal, that even extends to getting her caffeine fix. As the Gatcombe Horse Trials got underway, the Princess Royal was spotted mingling with the crowds before stopping to pick up a coffee - and a side-order of friendly chat. Dressed in one of her trademark hats, the 64-year-old royal looked on cheerful form as she chatted away to stall holders. Can you make a lah-te? Princess Anne places her order and enjoys a chat with the stall holders . Later, she was seen clutching a pretty bunch of pink roses given to her by a well-wisher as she toured the equestrian event, which are being held on her Gatcombe Park Estate, and watched the action unfold. Although no longer riding competitively herself, the Princess Royal is famous for her love of all things equestrian - a trait passed down to her Olympic silver medal winning daughter Zara. She has also spoken out about the ill-treatment of horses in the UK, even, at one point, controversially calling for people to eat horse meat in a bid to ensure that the animals always have a value and are never abandoned by their owners. The princess, of whom the Duke of Edinburgh once famously said 'If it doesn’t fart or eat hay, she isn’t interested', also owns several horses of her own, including a rescue pony. Watching the action: Suitably fortified, Princess Anne joined husband Tim Laurence to watch the action unfold . Thank you! Princess Anne wanders through the Gatcombe grounds clutching a bunch of roses . Annie the Welsh Cob had been badly neglected before being taken in by World Horse Welfare four years ago and was later given a fairytale ending when she was adopted by the royal. Now living on the Gatcombe Park Estate, the 15-year-old mare spends her days roaming the property with Princess Anne on board. Speaking after the adoption last year, the Princess Royal explained: 'She's perfect for me. She's not wanting to be too ambitious and I don't want to be very ambitious either. Anne, who is the patron of World Horse Welfare which currently has 7,000 horses looking for homes, added: 'She fits in really well and as far as I'm concerned I was really glad they didn't find someone else for her. She is just the size of horse that I could do with now. 'Living here and going across the farm I like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was reasonably reliable when it come to rural activities. 'I hope Annie enjoys it here with me. We will be doing some hacking and she will be helping me herd the sheep and cattle. 'Rehoming from a charity may be the best way of finding a horse because you know so much more about the animal you are getting.' Anne, who shares the Gatcombe Park Estate with Zara and son Peter Phillips, has also been an enthusiastic supporter of her daughter's eventing career. Zara, who also put in an appearance during Prince Harry's Invictus Games during a wheelchair rugby match, is one of the UK's most successful eventing stars and is likely to feature in the Olympic team at Rio 2016.

"Baroness Warsi has called for a ban on selling arms to Israel following her resignation from the Cabinet . Baroness Warsi’s call for a ban on selling arms to Israel received its most high-profile Tory backing last night. A day after her shock departure from Cabinet, former international development secretary and ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell demanded an arms embargo in response to the ‘misery and carnage’ in Gaza. His intervention piles further pressure on David Cameron following the Foreign Office minister’s resignation on Tuesday over the Government’s position on the crisis, which she described as ‘morally unjustifiable’. A number of Tory backbenchers praised her ‘principled’ stand and said they hoped it would encourage the Government to consider her call for an arms ban. Yesterday, Mr Mitchell, who was forced to resign last year over the ‘Plebgate’ row, became the most senior party figure yet to back Baroness Warsi. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World at One, he said the current ceasefire in Gaza must be made permanent before talks move on to addressing the wider issues in the Middle East peace process. On whether there is a case for an arms embargo on Israel, Mr Mitchell said: ‘Yes, I would have thought there is a strong case for trying to ensure that weapons getting into this conflict are minimised as much as possible. I think it’s right an embargo should be considered. ‘On the issue of Gaza, there is a quite extraordinary level of misery and carnage going on. Britain needs to play a role on a whole series of different levels.’ Arms export licenses worth £42million have been granted to 130 UK defence manufacturers to sell military equipment, including drones and armoured vehicles, to Israel in the past four years. The Tories are also coming under pressure from their Coalition partners to consider an embargo on Israel. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said he believed Israel has every right to defend itself from rocket attacks by Hamas – but that its operation had ‘overstepped the mark’. He described the strikes on three UN schools in Gaza as ‘outrageous’ and added: ‘That’s why I believe that the export licences should now be suspended.’ Party colleague Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said: ‘We have been making this case inside Government but have not yet been able to get agreement for this position. I hope and expect that to change shortly.’ A Number 10 spokesman said: ‘A review of export licences to Israel is under way following the sustained barrage of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel which prompted Israel to launch Operation Protective Edge. ‘Since then no new licences have been issued for use by the Israeli military. Suspending export licences is not a decision we take lightly and it is right that we examine the facts fully. Last night it was reported that Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire had also considered quitting in protest over policy on Gaza. Channel 4 News named him as the government figure who had discussed resignation with Lady Warsi. Former international development secretary and ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell (above) has demanded an arms embargo in response to the ‘misery and carnage’ in Gaza . But Mr Swire denied he was ready to resign, saying: ‘I want to be very clear – I have absolutely no intention of resigning whatsoever.’ Announcing replacements for Lady Warsi, No10 said her title as ‘senior minister of state’, which was created specially for her, would be scrapped. Her Foreign Office job will be taken by Baroness Anelay, while her other role as faith minister will be taken over by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Mr Mitchell admitted on the BBC that Lady Warsi’s resignation was ‘undoubtedly a loss’, adding: ‘She’s a very important part of the Conservative Party’s DNA. She reaches parts... which others in the Conservative Party don’t reach so easily.’ But he suggested she should have stayed in government to argue for a tougher line on Israel. ‘You should fight your corner,’ said Mr Mitchell. ‘Her voice needs to be heard.’","Foreign Office minister Warsi resigned with damning letter criticising the PM .

"The Center for Disease Control has issued new, strict guidelines for airline crews in an attempt to stop Ebola from spreading outside West Africa. Released Friday, the new guidance stresses that flight crews should 'treat any body fluid as though it it is infectious,' as the out-of-control outbreak claims thousands of lives in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal. The warning comes as 3000 U.S. troops start to deploy to the developing nations to set up facilities and form training teams to help the Africans treat victims of the gruesome disease. Stemming the spread: The CDC has issued new, strict guidelines for airline crews in an attempt to stop Ebola from spreading outside West Africa . The CDC has released new guidelines concerning the handling of sick passengers as Ebola digs its heels deeper into West Africa: . Source: CDC.gov . The CDC stressed in its release that, per U.S. law,  American airlines and foreign airlines traveling non-stop to or from the country are permitted airlines 'to deny boarding to air travelers with serious contagious diseases that could spread during flight.' In July, a sick Nigeria man managed to board a plane in Liberia and took the deadly virus with him to Lagos. Officials moved swiftly to tamp out the spread in Africa's most populous city after the man passed Ebola to several healthcare workers. None of his fellow passengers appear to have contracted the disease in-flight. Nonetheless, fears remain that a traveler could potentially facilitate that spread of Ebola beyond the confines of West Africa. Meanwhile, thousands of promised American forces will be moving into Africa over the next 30 days to set up facilities and form training teams to help the Africans treat Ebola victims, the Army's top officer said Friday. Out-of-control: Ebola has infected at least 5,357 people in West Africa and has killed 2,630 of those. here, a September 21 photo shows Liberian nurses disinfecting the body of a suspected Ebola victim . Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said the disease has accelerated faster than initially thought, so the U.S. needs to get people on the ground and ramp up numbers quickly. President Barack Obama has pledged 3,000 troops, and the U.S. military commander and a small team has arrived in Liberia to do initial assessments. Before troops are sent in, Odierno says, the Army needs to make sure they are prepared to operate in that environment, which includes health care safety. The military units expected to deploy have not been identified. Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the U.S. Army-Africa commander, arrived in Monrovia on Wednesday with a 12-person assessment team, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary. They are conducting site surveys and other planning needed to construct treatment facilities there. Kirby added that some equipment has already arrived, including a forklift and generator, and two more aircraft are expected this weekend with 45 more military troops. The Defense Department has requested up to $1 billion for Ebola response efforts. Kirby said U.S. troops will not be involved in the direct treatment of patients. Supplies, including 100 tons of emergency medical aid, are seen before being loaded on to a 747 aircraft at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport September 20.

"A mother-of-two who lost her life to bowel cancer has become an internet sensation after her heartbreaking last blog about her battle with the disease was viewed more than two million times. Charlotte Kitley began to record her experiences after being diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2012. Since starting the blog last year, the 36-year-old from south west London had described going through various treatments and the impact of the disease on her life. But it was her final blog, posted by her husband Richard on the day she died, that received the most overwhelming response. Charlotte Kitley's final blog has been viewed by more than two million people since her death on September 16. The 36-year-old was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer in 2012 and faced two operations to remove tumours from her bowel and liver, 25 rounds of radiotherapy and 39 bouts of chemotherapy . The emotive goodbye message to her husband and their two children Lucy and Danny, has been viewed more than two million times, since last Tuesday. In it, Mrs Kitley, wrote: 'As you read this, I will no longer be here. 'Rich will be trying to put one foot in front of the other, to get by, a day at a time, knowing I will no longer awake next to him. 'I have so much life I still want to live, but know I won't have that. 'I want to be there for my friends as they move with their lives, see my children grow up and become old and grumpy with Rich. 'All these things are to be denied of me. 'But, they are not to be denied of you. So, in my absence, please, please, enjoy life. 'Take it by both hands, grab it, shake it and believe in every second of it. Adore your children. 'You have literally no idea how blessed you are to shout at them in the morning to hurry up and clean their teeth. 'Embrace your loved one and if they cannot embrace you back, find someone who will. Everyone deserves to love and be loved in return. Don't settle for less.' Her final words read: 'When you close your curtains tonight, look out for a star, it will be me, looking down, sipping a pina colada, enjoying a box of (very expensive) chocolates. 'Good night, Good bye and God bless. 'Charley xx' Mrs Kitley began her blog, which featured on the Huffington Post, in 2013. Since her death, her husband Richard said he has been overwhelmed by the level of support he has received. He has now set up a Just Giving page in her memory, raising money for the charity Bowel Cancer UK. Mrs Kitley was diagnosed two weeks after running a half marathon in October 2011 after complaining of back ache. The mother-of-two prepared a heartbreaking final blog, which was uploaded by her husband after her death . She wrote in her blog: 'I went to the doctor, but with no real explanation, it took another three months until I met with a back specialist. 'As a matter of routine, he sent me for an MRI. Following a slight suspicion within my pelvis, I was then sent for an ultrasound and a CT scan. 'The following day, the back specialist called to see me. 'I don't remember much of the meeting, other than the words 'suspicious mass'. 'I've since been told that given the location of the tumour, I wouldn't have experienced any of the usual signs, such as blood in my poo or stomach ache. 'My tumour was compressing against my spine, hence my back pain.' Further tests led specialists to diagnose Mrs Kitley with stage four bowel cancer, which spread to her liver following her diagnosis. She faced two operations to remove tumours, the first from her bowel and the second from her liver. In addition, the mother-of-two faced 25 rounds of radiotherapy and 39 bouts of chemotherapy. The treatment worked in clearing Mrs Kitley's bowel cancer but the number of tumours in her liver increased from three to five. In November 2011, she was told the cancer had already spread to her lungs. She said in her blog: 'I was told it was unlikely any further treatment would be effective and I had around six months to live. 'It was time to get my affairs in order and spend time with my family. In her last blog, Mrs Kitley, wrote: 'In my absence, please, please, enjoy life.'Take it by both hands, grab it, shake it and believe in every second of it. Adore your children.' Pictured is her husband Richard and the couple's two young children Lucy and Danny . Bowel Cancer UK is raising awareness about the type of advanced, stage four bowel cancer, Mrs Kitley suffered. The Time For Guts campaign is a call to improve survival rates and support those people diagnosed with the disease - the UK's second biggest cancer killer. Out of the 41,500 people diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, around 3,800 are diagnosed with advanced, stage four bowel cancer. In addition, about half of the 9,800 people diagnosed at stage three will go on to develop advanced bowel cancer. Fewer than one in ten people diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer will survive for more than five years, compared with nine out of ten people diagnosed at the earliest stage of the disease. 'I asked if I would make it to my daughter's fifth birthday and was told I would be lucky to get to her third.' Twenty-two months after being given six months to live, Mrs Kitley passed away on September 16. Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK said: 'We are all completely devastated and saddened by Charlotte's death. 'She was such an inspiration for other people with bowel cancer and through her beautifully crafted blog, created a big following among the online community. 'While bowel cancer is thankfully relatively rare in younger people like Charlotte, around 2,100 people under 50 are still diagnosed with it each year, often late. 'That's why we launched our Never Too Young campaign, to improve the diagnosis, treatment and care of younger bowel cancer patients and to raise awareness among younger people and health professionals. Early diagnosis really does save lives.'

"Every year about 1,000 people in the UK die due to the lack of transplant organs. This shortage is increasingly being addressed by so-called living donations, typically family members donating a kidney. But what happens if it goes wrong? Jason Douthwaite, 45, from Hemel Hempstead, Herts, received a kidney from his sister, Lynn, eight years ago, only for it to fail less than two years later. Here, he tells his story. To be told I had kidney failure was a big shock. I wondered whether I'd ever work again (I run an air-conditioning business) and even if my wife might leave me. Fortunately, Zoë has been incredibly supportive, but those things go through your mind. I'd become ill while on holiday in Goa with Zoë in 2005. I remember my urine being very dark, and feeling so dehydrated that I was unable to leave my room. And I was doubled over in pain. I thought it was due to drinking alcohol in the heat. A local doctor advised me to take a blood test when I got home. Jason Douthwaite pictured with his sister Lynn Fitzgerald, who donated one of her kidneys to him . I did this then had a call the next day from my GP who told me to go straight to hospital, making me panic. Being a smoker, I thought I had cancer. I'd never been seriously ill and was a healthy weight. The diagnosis was acute renal failure brought about by IgA nephropathy, a condition in which the immune system damages the kidneys. Doctors aren't clear why this happens. I was told that my best option would be a transplant. When my mother Delia, brother Vince, and sister Lynn found out, they immediately wanted to help. They were tested for compatibility and only Lynn was a match. Lynn and I are pretty close. She used to be my bossy older sister. I didn't ask her to donate a kidney - she was adamant she wanted to. Back then, they would only consider relatives or long-term friends, although that's changed - anyone who's suitable can become a living donor, but you have to prove people aren't getting paid. Lynn's husband, Andrew, was very worried about her and I know he asked her if she was sure she was doing the right thing. The doctors said I'd need regular dialysis within three years without a transplant, but I deteriorated fast and needed it within six months. My kidney function plunged from 50 per cent to 10 per cent - classed as failure - in that time. Jason at 18 months and Lynn at age 7 1/2 . Dialysis is gruelling. I can lose three kilos of fluid in three hours - imagine doing that five times a week. I've seen a 30 stone body builder turn up for his first dialysis session in tears. By the time of the donation I felt tired all the time and used to vomit almost every morning due to the toxins in my system. Sometimes I couldn't get out of bed for two weeks. We had the operations in August 2006 and the new kidney worked immediately. I felt great the next day. I was in pain from the surgery but my mind was clear. The level of toxins in my blood had fallen dramatically. There was no reason to remove my failed kidneys, so I have three. Lynn was in a lot of pain afterwards, more so than me, because of the location of the kidneys, near the back. The kidney was put in at the front of my body, which is less intrusive. It's hard to describe how grateful I felt to Lynn. It was so brave of her. She changed my life. There's no way to repay something like that. People said the old Jason was back, and I got back the 20 hours a week I'd lost to dialysis. I felt well enough to start a family with Zoe, and we now have two boys,  William, five, and Charlie, three. I also have two grown-up sons from a previous relationship. Unfortunately, my body started rejecting Lynn's kidney after less than two years. I put on weight due to fluid building up because the kidney wasn't working properly. I had a reduced urine output and my blood pressure increased. Live donations last on average 15 years so we were unfortunate. I was devastated for Lynn after the sacrifices she made. But she's never said she's had a problem with it. During a hospital stay for treatment to try to extend the life of the kidney, I had a seizure and went into a coma for three weeks. I bit through my tongue and the blood wouldn't clot due to the anti-rejection drugs I was on. My tongue swelled up and blocked my airways and Zoe got a call in the early hours to say I'd be having an emergency tracheostomy - a hole cut in my throat to enable me to breathe. They couldn't guarantee I'd survive the night. It was a slow recovery after that. I'd been fed through a tube in my nose and had to learn to eat again. My muscles were so weak I had to walk with a frame. I had to start dialysis again, which was depressing. I'm on the list for organ donation but there's no guarantee. The system for organ donations from people who have died should be changed to an opt-out system. The opt-in system sees many organs wasted. My wife would like to donate a kidney to me but isn't a match. However, she might be able to donate to someone else via a pooling system. We'd get an organ back in exchange. I'm getting on board with the idea but I'd much rather use a kidney that would otherwise be wasted than put Zoe through what Lynn endured. Lynn Fitzgerald, 50, is a hairdresser who lives in Hemel Hempstead with her husband Andrew, their daughter Rebekah, 15, and her son Alex, 23, from a previous marriage. As children, Jason and I didn't always get on. He once threw an ashtray at me and I threw a boot back. We were quite argumentative and each wanted the last word. But once I'd left home at 19 I became close to him and our brother Vince. When I found out Jason was ill it was devastating. I visited him in hospital straight away. I remember crying a lot. He deteriorated quickly - it was shocking. His colour changed completely; he went yellow. It was my idea to donate a kidney. When you see your brother that ill you don't need to think about it.I had to undergo tests for about a year before donating. Jason kept saying: 'You don't have to do this.' In the end I told him to shut up! I was told beforehand you can live perfectly well with one kidney, but as part of the preparation I had to see a counsellor. I was asked to consider that if I was in a serious accident affecting the remaining kidney I'd have no back up. But I wanted to help Jason, not worry about things unlikely to happen. My husband said he'd rather I didn't do it but didn't try to change my mind, and my children were a bit frightened. But we explained Uncle Jay was very poorly and what was going to happen. On the day of the operation emotions were running high. When I was in theatre my husband panicked when it overran and had to be reassured by the nurses that I was coming back. Jason and I were in the same wards throughout the procedure. Immediately after the operations our roles were reversed because he was sprightly and I was exhausted. Jason, pictured in his early 20s on holiday camp with Lynn, who was devastated to discover he was ill . He sat on my bed because I couldn't move very well. I told him off when he made me laugh because it hurt. It was so good to see him well. We'd joke that he might start acting like me now that he had part of my body inside him, plucking his eyebrows or something. Jason stayed in hospital a couple of days longer than me. The day I went home was emotional because we'd been together for about a week, which was the most time we had spent together since childhood. After my operation I needed strong painkillers, then paracetamol. It was awkward for a while walking upstairs, getting in the shower and sleeping. I've got quite a long scar on the left side, and I get a bit of numbness there. But I cope fine with one kidney. When I heard that Jason's body was rejecting my kidney I was devastated for him - he'd just started to live a normal life. Poor Zoe was pregnant at the time, so it was very traumatic. I remember her saying to me: 'Obviously we can't save the kidney,' but I said: 'God, I'm not worried about that.' We nearly lost Jason. He was annoyed and upset that his body rejected my kidney. He felt guilty. He kept saying that if he'd known, he wouldn't have let me donate. But I just wanted him to live. I carry a Donor Card so other parts of my body can be used when I die. I only realised how important it is to donate when my brother's life was at stake. Interviews by Grace McCann .","Jason Douthwaite, 45, from Hemel Hempstead, was told he had kidney failure .

"At the age of 20, I was going to have to spend the rest of my whole life . looking like Albert Steptoe. Or at least that's what I told myself on . the day a dentist grabbed my cracked front tooth, tore it out without . warning and gave me a denture. For the past 18 years I've lived with a plastic plate on the roof of my mouth and an utter fear of visiting the dentist. I've . wanted to lose the false tooth and the fear - but time and again my . courage and finances failed me. Ten years ago, I enquired about how to . replace the denture, but the procedure sounded terrifying. Scroll down for video . James Coney prior to receiving treatment (l) and after having a dental implant fitted by Dr Eddie Scher (r) Video courtesy of Studio B Dental . Back then, . getting a more permanent tooth would have involved cutting in half two . good neighbouring teeth and building a bridge with a false tooth over . the gap. No, sireee, that wasn't for me. Finally, though, I've been . nagged into submission by my wife. She never minded the look, but I had . complained about the denture a lot. Also, while in most areas I'd become . less bothered about my appearance the older I got, I found I really . wanted to have a full set of good teeth again. That front tooth had . been knocked out twice - both times playing hockey. When I was 12, a . ball bobbled up, I wasn't wearing a gum shield (idiot) and it cracked my . top front left tooth in half. The dentist removed the nerve and . patched the gaps with filling material. That lasted until a university . hockey match, when I took a stick to the chin. I was wearing a gum . shield this time, but the tooth wobbled loose. I waited months before . visiting the same dentist. He pushed the tooth then, without warning, . ripped it out. There was a searing pain and my mouth filled with blood. That was enough to fill me with a permanent dread of the dentist. In 15 years, I probably had two check-ups. You can't tell it's not a real tooth as it was carefully matched to the colour of James' existing teeth . But . it did at least prompt me to take good care of the teeth I had left - . steering clear of fizzy drinks and sweets, and becoming a meticulous . brusher. Probably more by luck than judgment, I never seemed to suffer . any problems. The denture itself - a plastic plate with a plastic . tooth attached to it - was a neat fit, and unless you really stared, you . couldn't tell the plastic tooth from the real ones. Most . acquaintances never knew I had it - save for the odd mortifying moment . (spitting it into a drink as I chatted to a colleague at a Christmas . party or losing it over the side of a boat on holiday). But there . were times it could cause throbbing pain, particularly where the top of . the plastic tooth rubbed against my gum, and discomfort at the back of . my mouth where the plate met my teeth. Worse, dentists call them 'gum killers', because dentures make gums recede and can cause infection from the constant pressure. There . are an estimated 11 million denture users, and according to the charity . British Dental Health Foundation, most will experience some degree of . difficulty. 'While dentures are a good solution for people who need . them, they are no substitute for natural teeth,' says the charity chief . executive Dr Nigel Carter. Problems include poor fit, ulcers and . difficulty with chewing or speech. 'And the earlier teeth are lost, the . more problems are likely to be experienced in later life as the . supporting bone for a denture shrinks away.' Having an implant fitted . involves drilling a hole in the jawbone and inserting a screw, which . will then hold a replacement porcelain tooth in place. Last December, . I made an appointment with Dr Eddie Scher in Chelsea, London, who is a . leading specialist in oral surgery. As I sat in his waiting area, my . hands went clammy, my legs shook. I'd crossed the rubicon. Dr Scher came into the room and cracked a weak gag. I chuckled and he led me to his surgery.'Do . you know why I made that joke?' he asked. 'I'd already started the . consultation. I wanted to see how you smile - to see if you had a big . Julia Roberts grin. 'I need to see if you show your gums when you smile, and then we can be sure we get the right tooth for you.' The drop in heart attack risk by having teeth cleaned by a dentist at least twice in two years . As many as one in ten adults suffers from dental phobia: it is the third most common phobia after agoraphobia and heights. A . phobia of dentists is triggered by many things - the sound of the . drills, fear of choking, chronic embarrassment, the needles. Mine is all . about fear of pain and the powerlessness. You can get it treated. A . specialist clinic at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London treats . 3,000 to 4,000 patients a year for dental phobia and has long waiting . lists. Or you can find a dentist who is particularly supportive. Dr . Scher is a walking, talking anaesthetic. His soft-spoken charm put me at . total ease even as he ran through the various procedures. There . were risks. The implant might not fix in my mouth, it could get . infected. Then there was talk of making incisions and fixing things in . my mouth. They sounded terrifying - but Dr Scher described them so . practically that by the end of the conversation I was almost ready to go . ahead there and then. 'We're going to do a tooth in a day,' he . said. I was staggered, having imagined weeks of appointments. Implant . surgery has come on hugely since I last checked. These days, using . the latest X-rays, 3D imaging and piezo drill technology - a special . type of precision drill - Dr Scher would drill precisely into my jaw and . insert a screw socket. If needed, bits of bone from my jaw could be . grafted on to the implant site to help the healing process and plasma . from my blood used to help heal the area. This would also speed up the . healing of my gum. He'd then put in a tiny screw and cement an implant on top. I'd . be in at 8am and home by 6pm. The success rate is 95 per cent, though . all I could think is that this meant one in every 20 fails and ends up . falling out. And dental implants are not cheap. Classed as cosmetic . surgery, they are not funded by the NHS. A basic implant costs around . £2,000. On the day of the surgery, I was given a sedative. It didn't . knock me out, but made me forget. One minute I was in the waiting room . nervously reading the paper, the next I was being escorted to a room to . sleep off the drug. I'd been in surgery three hours and the screw was . in. I had to wait a few hours for the swelling in my gum to settle . down. By 5pm, a temporary plastic tooth was glued on top and I went home . with a soft toothbrush to use, antibiotics, painkillers - and very . precise instructions to eat soft foods and take care in trying not to . bump the tooth for a couple of months. Some gums bleed in the days after, but luckily mine didn't. A . few weeks later, after the bone had grown around the screw - to ensure . it was firmly in place and my mouth had healed - I had a permanent . porcelain tooth glued over the screw. It should last ten years or . more. You can't even tell it's not a real tooth as it was carefully . matched to the colour of my existing teeth. Oddly, losing the . denture has proved a bit like losing a limb. Now it's gone, I constantly . think it's there  - and when I realise it isn't, I fly into a quiet . panic thinking everyone can see me toothless. And then I remember... The new tooth does need extra care - particularly flossing, to make sure nothing gets stuck around the top of it. But . not having that horrible plastic plate in my mouth has been joyful. I . can barely believe I put off having the surgery for almost two decades.","James Coney's front tooth had been knocked out twice while playing hockey .

"A Melbourne woman with a severe latex allergy who has been missing for a week has finally returned to her family. Angelika Peters was last seen last seven days ago when she kissed her husband goodbye in their Ascot Vale home - in the Victorian capital's inner city - before he went to work. Fortunately, Ms Peters returned to her family home at 4.30pm on Thursday. Melbourne mother-of-two, Angelika Peters, who has been forced to remain housebound for the past eight months after developing a severe latex allergy, had been missing for seven days . Arna (left) and Jessica (right) Dionysopoulos with their mother Angelika Peters (centre) Arna as a little girl camping with her mother who has been missing for six days . Her family had publicly appealed for information, fronting media two days ago, to help find her. Every day the 45-year-old was missing, concerns for her welfare grew as she had left behind her wallet, phone and most importantly, her Epipen for her latex allergy which has developed so severely since the start of the year that she is under doctor's orders not to go out on her own for more than two hours at a time. Angelika Peters has a severe latex allergy and has been instructed not to leave the house for more than two hours on her own . At the time, Ms Peters' daughter Arna Dionysopoulos said she was trying to stay positive despite fearing that she may never see her mother again. Ms Peters' disappearance had her family completely baffled, struggling to make sense of her mother's mysterious disappearance. 'I have absolutely no idea if she will return – I feel like I should say she will but I’m just not sure because it's been six days,' Ms Dionysopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s absolutely terrifying not knowing if she’s alive or not – it’s hard to actually go there in my brain.' After working as a nurse for the past 25 years, Ms Peters was forced to give up her career when her latex allergy created too many risks for both herself and the patients. Ms Peters had managed the allergy for at least 30 years until she became a relief nurse at the start of the year and began suffering anaphylactic reactions from too much exposure. A usually positive and upbeat woman, being housebound for the past eight months had started to take its toll on the former nurse. 'It really did affect her because she loved being a nurse,' Ms Dionysopoulos said. 'Initially she was being proactive but it was just hard because she is very smart and didn’t have any stimulation which was a lot of the trouble so she tried to keep busy.' 'She might have had a bit of cabin fever because to stay alive she had to start taking really stringent care of her surroundings which was when things got harder because she had to stay away from large numbers of people.’ Ms Peters' husband Adam Gray (left) Arna (centre) and Angelika (right) Daughter Arna Dionysopoulos said her mother was always a very positive person . Husband Adam Gray expressed great concern for his wife as she rarely left the house - let alone on her own . The family had been frantically searching for Ms Peters, including handing out flyers and visiting some of her favourite places. Her husband Adam Gray also expressed great concern for his wife as she rarely left the house - let alone on her own. 'When I say she was at home – she was at home - she wouldn't leave the house without company,' he said. 'She would always have her Epipen with her - unfortunately due to her personal habits she was at home all of the time.' Mr Gray said the condition had significantly impacted on his wife's everyday life - recently she had to leave a restaurant because a balloon had set off her allergy.","Angelika Peters returned to her Ascot Vale home at 4.30pm on Thursday .

"Most of us enjoy a takeaway every now and again but a couple who ate them every day and piled on the pounds as a result have shed more than 13st by learning how to cook them at home. Katie and Roy Marks, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, embarked on their bid to lose weight after being told they were too fat to have IVF. Now, Mrs Marks, 30, who once weighed 22st, is now a slimline size 12, while her XXXL husband has also slimmed down with the couple losing an impressive 13st combined. All change: At her heaviest, Mrs Marks was a size 26 (left) but is now a slimline size 12 (right) As a result of their impressive weight loss, the pair will now start IVF treatment in a bid to finally have the family they have always longed for. 'When we wanted to lose weight, we realised that we didn't know how to cook which was really embarrassing,' explained Mrs Marks, a children's nanny. 'We used to eat take-aways at least twice a week and the other days were microwave meals so it was really hard to learn. 'I remember the first meal was a home-cooked meat kebab and we made our own chips as well. We were really surprised it turned out as well as it did and it tasted so lovely. 'We cook everything together now, with the kebabs a firm favourite, and have lost 13st.' Astonishingly, the pair's new healthy diet isn't all salads either. Both still enjoy full English breakfasts and roast dinners but cook them from scratch and use low-fat ingredients. Fattening snacks such as chocolate and crisps are out and in their place, lean ham, low-fat quiche and yoghurts. Overweight: Katie and Roy Marks decided to lose weight after being told they were too fat to have IVF . Looking good: Mrs Marks says learning how to cook proved crucial in their battle to lose weight . What's more, say the couple, their bid to lose weight and learn how to cook has brought them closer together as a couple - saying that they are much happier as a result. 'It has been really supportive having Roy there losing weight with me,' said Mrs Marks. 'We've always done everything together, but now instead of just sitting and watching a film together, we walk the dogs and cook together too. 'Every Wednesday morning before I go to weigh at my Slimming World class, Roy weighs himself first so we can do it together, and we measure our waists together too. 'We have never been competitive and it is just a massive support going through it side by side.' Their new look is a far cry from the heftier physiques both had at the start of their relationship. When the couple married in 2007, Mrs Marks walked down the aisle in a size 24 wedding dress. 'I was happy at the time,' she admits. 'How I ate and looked was my just my life and what I knew, it didn't affect me at all.' But that all changed when the couple decided they wanted to start a family and discovered that their weight was playing havoc with their fertility. 'We were back and forwards to the GP as I struggled to get pregnant,' explains Mrs Marks. 'The doctor said my weight would be contributing to problems with fertility. 'I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and went on to have four miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy. 'They said I would never be able to fall pregnant by myself naturally. My only hope was IVF treatment.' Unfortunately for the Marks, the NHS refused to fund IVF treatment until they shed some of the weight and, desperate to have a family, the duo joined a local slimming club. 'I had to have a BMI under 30, and Roy under 35,' said Mrs Marks. 'But me being a size 26 and Roy an XXXL, we were nowhere near.' 'At first I was too embarrassed to go to classes so I tried to lose the weight at home. But over two years I only lost two and a half stone because I didn't know what I was doing. 'I decided enough was enough and joined a Slimming World class. Roy works full time so I went to the class and came back to teach him what I had learned. 'The main thing was to cook everything healthily. The first meal we cooked together was Slimming World Kebab meat and we made our own chips as well. We had never cooked before so it was really hard to start learning.' Hopes: The newly slimline couple are now having IVF while Mrs Marks has started her own slimming class . Despite being beginners in the kitchen, the couple soon realised they shared a passion for cooking and haven't looked back since. 'We realised we both loved cooking,' adds a delighted Mrs Marks. 'Maybe things would have been different if we had known this before. 'In just one year I lost five and a half stone and now I am a healthy size 12, and Roy lost five stone too. 'Now we cook every night together and walk our dogs together for exercise. It's been great going through it together and we motivate each other to keep going. 'We have a completely different lifestyle and eat so much healthier.' Better still, the couple are now about to begin IVF treatment having reached the perfect weight, while Mrs Marks is so enthused, she is now running her own weight loss classes. 'It has worked wonders for us,' she added, 'and we have never felt happier.' Breakfast: None . Elevenses: Crisps, sweets, chocolate . Lunch: Sandwich with four slices of bread, butter and cheese.

"Derek suffered form leg ulcers that confined him to a wheelchair . After a brisk hike in the wilds of the Hebrides, Derek Ripley usually felt tired but invigorated. The walking breaks with his wife, Judith, and a group of friends were a welcome distraction from his job as a taxi driver in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. But one evening, back at his hotel, he noticed a slightly sore, red patch on his shin, about the size of a 10p piece. 'I didn't think too much of it and just went to sleep,' says father-of-two Derek, 66, who also has three grandchildren. 'But when I woke next morning the skin over the patch had broken away and there was a little hole in my leg.' When it failed to heal after a few days, he went to his GP and was tested for type 2 diabetes - leg ulcers are a classic complication of the disease. Although Derek was slightly overweight, he was quite fit. But there was a family history of the condition, with his mother and brother both affected. When the result came back positive, it was clear that diabetes had already started to damage his circulation almost beyond repair. The tiny ulcer was due to damage to the lining of the major blood vessels supplying the lower half of his body - damage caused by constant exposure to raised sugar levels. As circulation suffers, 'peripheral' areas such as the skin on the lower legs and feet become starved of nutrients. If the skin gets sore or even slightly injured, it breaks down. Derek, then in his mid-50s, didn't know he was about to descend into a ten-year nightmare during which both his lower legs would become covered in ulcers that would not heal. It would leave him in a wheelchair, in almost permanent agony and facing the terrifying threat of his legs being amputated after doctors tried every available treatment without success. Some ulcers stayed for years. Others cleared up, only to be replaced by more. Every few days, community nurses would call at his home to change his dressings. At one point he was even referred to a psychiatrist for a mental health assessment, such was the psychological toll. But last year Derek stumbled across a 'cure' that sounds so implausible most health professionals would understandably laugh at the idea: sugar. Ordinary, granulated white sugar - the sort we put in our tea, that costs less than 40p a pound - has proved to be an unlikely remedy. Poured on to Derek's weeping wounds, it took a little over a month to heal what costly treatments failed to fix in a decade. Sugar poured on to Derek's weeping wounds took a little over a month to heal . Today Derek's legs are completely healed, though badly scarred, and he hasn't had an ulcer in almost 18 months. His wheelchair has been stowed away, he is pain-free, and can walk and even swim. Derek says: 'When the final dressings were removed, I was speechless. I couldn't believe how much my legs had improved. 'I've even managed to go on a cruise with my wife and surprised my sister, who lives in Germany, by turning up on her doorstep.' Sugar is one of the oldest known remedies for healing wounds. In 3500 BC the Mesopotamians dressed wounds with sugary substances such as honey or resin. Sugar works mainly by drawing excess moisture out of infected wounds. Although some moisture is needed for new skin cells to grow, too much can trigger maceration - the softening of tissues by liquid - which provides the ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Once sugar is sprinkled on a weeping wound, it starts to absorb excess water. There is  also some evidence that it draws macrophages - immune-system cells that can attack foreign organisms - into the damaged area as well. About 6,000 people a year in England have leg, foot or toe amputations due to diabetes complications. The annual NHS bill for treating ulcers alone is estimated at nearly £700 million. The market for wound dressings, ointments and gels is said to be worth around £5 billion. Derek decided to try the sugar treatment after reading a brief news report in the Daily Mail last year about a small-scale trial at Wolverhampton University. Moses Murandu, a senior lecturer in adult nursing, had set up the trial because he didn't understand why sugar - commonly used as a cheap wound-healer in his native Zimbabwe - was not given to patients in the UK. Derek says: 'I mentioned the article to my GP, who said that after everything I'd been through, I had nothing to lose. 'So I rang Moses and the very next morning he drove 90 miles to my house to see me. 'As it happened, there were a couple of wound care nurses there to change my dressings. When Moses looked at my ulcers and said they should be completely healed in four to five weeks using just sugar, I could see them sniggering.' Mr Murandu piped a ring of Vaseline around each lesion to keep the sugar contained, then sprinkled between half a teaspoon and two teaspoons on them. Although over-the-counter sugar is almost certainly safe, he uses white sugar treated with antiseptic, just to make certain there are no lingering micro-organisms. Each ulcer was then topped with a patch containing iodine, dressed with a light, comfortable bandage, then left for up to a week. When the first dressing was changed after seven days, Derek was stunned. 'I rarely swear, but I did then. Where my large ulcers had been oozing pus and blood, there was none. It just looked a bit raw. 'By the fourth week, word had got round and when Moses came back to remove the final bandages, there was a crowd of 15 to 20 healthcare professionals in my house to watch. 'As the dressings came off, you could hear everybody gasp. Every ulcer had completely healed. 'I was feeling quite emotional and asked Judith to fetch my shoes because I wanted to stand outside the front of my house for the first time in years. She reminded me that I didn't have any shoes, because when doctors had said I'd probably never walk again, we gave them to charity.' Mr Murandu says the results of his trial are due to be published in a peer-reviewed journal later this year. But he claims the initial results suggest a diabetic ulcer cure rate in excess of 90 per cent. He says the reason sugar is not used more in developed nations is simply that it is so cheap, there isn't enough profit to justify investing in large-scale randomised trials. These provide the proof necessary to win endorsement from bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). But while research evidence is scant, it is still fairly convincing. One of the largest studies, published in the Southern Medical Journal in 1981, involved 605 patients in the U.S. with wounds, burns and ulcers. The results showed that healing times were reduced by 25 per cent, they needed fewer skin grafts and antibiotics, and the cost of their long-term care was greatly reduced. A 2007 study in the Journal Of Wound Care compared wounds treated with sugar and honey. Doctors at the Beit Cure International Hospital in Malawi treated 18 patients with sugar dressings and 22 with honey. Derek's wounds have now healed . After a week, the proportion of patients showing signs of wound infection had fallen from 52 to 39 per cent among the sugar group, and from 55 to 23 per cent in those drizzled with honey. Honey is thought to mainly promote healing through direct antibacterial action. Unlike sugar, it has emerged as more of a mainstream wound remedy in recent years, with a host of new specialist dressings incorporating medical-grade (sterilised) honey. Honey contains vitamins, minerals, enzymes and sugars, all of which help to heal wounds. Manuka is generally regarded as the most potent because of its high antibacterial content, although it costs up to £20 a jar, as against £2 to £3 for other honeys. Sugar is cheaper, which may be why it is not being used. David Leaper, one of the UK's leading experts on wound healing, says he remembers being invited to a meeting in London in the Eighties by sugar giant Tate & Lyle to discuss the company's plans to develop sugar into a drug that would transform wound-healing. 'They were very excited,' says Professor Leaper. 'But then I heard no more about it. Whether they were warned it might be unfair competition for companies developing more expensive wound-care treatments, I don't know. What I do know is that sugar works.' Professor Peter Vowden, consultant vascular surgeon at the Bradford Teaching Hospital, says a major obstacle is that sugar can't be patented. When a pharmaceutical firm develops a new drug, it is usually protected by patent for at least five years in hope of recouping the millions of pounds spent on research. Undaunted, Derek Ripley is doing all he can to spread the word. He recently wrote to the Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, and has met his local MP to discuss the matter.'This sugar treatment has given me back my life,' says Derek.

"If you’ve ever sent a text to the wrong person, or regretted texting someone while drunk, then the Ansa app could offer some piece of mind. It works in a similar way to Snapchat, by automatically deleting messages, photos and videos seconds after they’ve been viewed. However, unlike Snapchat, Ansa lets you also delete messages remotely, from another person’s device, before they get a chance to read it. Scroll down for video . Ansa (pictured) was created by 23-year-old Natalie Bryla from San Francisco. It lets people send self-destructing messages, photos and videos when using the ‘off the record’ mode. Users can see when people have read their messages and if a text is sent by mistake, it can be deleted from the other user’s device . The free Ansa app is available on iOS and Android and was created by 23-year-old Natalie Bryla from San Francisco. ‘Ansa is the safest place to let go, and be yourself with friends,’ said Ansa. ‘It’s the only messaging app that lets you communicate like you do in person, without leaving a record behind. ‘With Ansa you can go ‘off the record’, and have full conversations that automatically disappear; send self-destructing photos and videos that only last for seconds; and take back the messages you already shared using synced deletion.’ Videos and photos only appear when a user clicks ‘Tap to view’, and once viewed it is visible for 60 seconds before being deleted. However, people don’t have to use the ‘off the record’ function, and can use Ansa to save conversations in a similar way to other messaging apps such as Whatsapp or Skype . Ansa (pictured left) is the latest in a line of Snapchat rivals, which include Facebook's Slingshot (pictured centre) and Instagram's Bolt (pictured right) Only users of the app can message each other in 'off the record' mode. The self-destruct feature does not apply to messages, photos or videos sent using traditional methods or through other apps. Videos and photos only appear when a user clicks ‘Tap to view’, and once viewed are only be visible for 60 seconds before being deleted from both users’ phones. Photos and videos can also be annotated, and captions can be added. However, people don’t have to use the ‘off the record’ function, and can use Ansa to save conversations in a similar way to other messaging apps such as Whatsapp or Viber by not enabling this tool. In February Facebook bought messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client. Facebook announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. It then announced Snapchat rival Slingshot in June. Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a direct messaging service last December, and later announced Bolt - designed to be another rival to Snapchat - in July. In May, Snapchat released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger.","Ansa was created by 23-year-old Natalie Bryla from San Francisco .

"It has covered over 25 miles (40 km) on Mars, setting a new off-Earth driving record. Now, however, Nasa operators have found the Opportunity rover's memory is beginning to fail. They plan to wipe it completely in a bid to fix the bugs and restore the rover to its sprightly best. Opportunity on Earth before its launch in 2003. The rover's memory is now failing, causing operators to begin planning to totally reset it. Flash memory retains data even when power is off. It is the type used for storing photos and songs on smart phones or digital cameras, among many other uses. Individual cells within a flash memory sector can wear out from repeated use. Reformatting clears the memory while identifying bad cells and flagging them to be avoided. An increasing frequency of computer resets has prompted the rover team to make plans to reformat the rover's flash memory. The resets, including a dozen this month, interfere with the rover's planned science activities, even though recovery from each incident is completed within a day or two. 'Worn-out cells in the flash memory are the leading suspect in causing these resets,' said John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, project manager for NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project. 'The flash reformatting is a low-risk process, as critical sequences and flight software are stored elsewhere in other non-volatile memory on the rover.' Flash memory retains data even when power is off. It is the type used for storing photos and songs on smart phones or digital cameras, among many other uses. Individual cells within a flash memory sector can wear out from repeated use. Reformatting clears the memory while identifying bad cells and flagging them to be avoided. Nasa's other rovers have had similar problems. The project landed twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars in early 2004 to begin missions planned to last only three months. One of Opportuniy's first pics from Mars: On Friday, 30 January 2004, Nasa released this image of the rover with its  lander petal extended in preparation for the rover to egress  from the lander. The project landed twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars in early 2004 to begin missions planned to last only three months. Spirit worked for six years, and Opportunity is still active. Findings about ancient wet environments on Mars have come from both rovers.The project reformatted the flash memory on Spirit five years ago to stop a series of amnesia events Spirit had been experiencing. The reformatting planned for early next month will be the first for Opportunity. Even after the rover has been active for more than a decade and is currently about 125 million miles (about 200 million kilometers) from JPL, the rover team can still perform this type of upkeep. Earlier this month is captured the record for longest distance traveled on an extraterrestrial world . Since May 1973 the record for the longest distance traveled on an extraterrestrial world has been held by the Soviet Union’s Lunokhod 2 moon rover, which covered 24 miles (39 kilometres). But that record stands no more as Nasa’s Opportunity rover is now reported to have covered over 25 miles (40 km) on Mars, setting a new off-Earth driving record. And in more than ten years on the surface the rover is still going strong, despite initially being planned only to travel 0.62 miles (one kilometre). 'Opportunity has driven farther than any other wheeled vehicle on another world,' said Mars Exploration Rover Project Manager John Callas, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Nasa's Opportunity rover, illustration shown, has now traveled over 25 miles (40 kilometres) on Mars. The distance, which has taken 10 years, is a new record for off-Earth driving. The previous record was held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 moon rover, which covered 24 miles (39 kilometres) on the lunar surface . On average the red planet is 141.6 million miles (227.9 million kilometres) from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles it’s around half the size of Earth. It’s absolutely freezing there, with an average temperature of -65°C (-85°F). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is desperately thin - one per cent of Earth’s pressure - and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain - Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. The planet's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars also has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 36 feet (11 metres) deep, according to Nasa. 'This is so remarkable considering Opportunity was intended to drive about one kilometer [0.62 miles] and was never designed for distance. 'But what is really important is not how many miles the rover has racked up, but how much exploration and discovery we have accomplished over that distance.' A drive of 157 feet (48 metres) on  27 July put Opportunity's total odometry at 25.01 miles (40.25 kilometers). This month's driving brought the rover southward along the western rim of Endeavour Crater. The rover had driven more than 20 miles (32 km) before arriving at Endeavour Crater in 2011, where it has examined outcrops on the crater’s rim containing clay and sulfate-bearing minerals. The sites are yielding evidence of ancient environments with less acidic water than those examined at Opportunity’s landing site. If the rover can continue to operate the distance of a marathon - 26.2 miles (about 42.2 km) - it will approach the next major investigation site mission scientists have dubbed 'Marathon Valley'. Observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars suggest several clay minerals are exposed close together at this valley site, surrounded by steep slopes where the relationships among different layers may be evident. Nasa's . Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, working on Mars since January 2004, . passed 25 miles of total driving on 27 July 2014. The gold line on this . map shows Opportunity's route from the landing site inside Eagle Crater . (upper left) to its location after the 27 July drive . This chart provides a comparison of the distances driven by various wheeled vehicles on the surface of Mars and Earth's moon. Of the vehicles shown, Nasa's Mars rovers Opportunity and Curiosity are still active and the totals listed are distances driven as of 28 July 2014 . The Russian Lunokhod 2 rover, model shown, landed on Earth's moon on 15 January 1973, where it drove about 24.2 miles (39 kilometers) in less than five months, according to calculations recently made using images from Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) cameras that revealed its tracks . 'The Lunokhod missions still stand as two signature accomplishments of what I think of as the first golden age of planetary exploration, the 1960s and '70s,' said Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and principal investigator for Nasa's twin Mars rovers, Opportunity and Spirit. 'We’re in a second golden age now, and what we’ve tried to do on Mars with Spirit and Opportunity has been very much inspired by the accomplishments of the Lunokhod team on the moon so many years ago. 'It has been a real honor to follow in their historical wheel tracks.' As Opportunity neared the mileage record earlier this year, the rover team chose the name Lunokhod 2 for a crater about 20 feet (6 metres) in diameter on the outer slope of Endeavour's rim on Mars. The Mars Exploration Rover Project is one element of Nasa's ongoing and future Mars missions preparing for a human mission to the planet in the 2030s.","Nasa planning to reformat rover's memory .

"It's not as far-fetched as it might sound, emergency services could soon be flying to the scene of an accident, in a jet pack. New Zealand company Martin Aircraft and its futuristic jet pack program is expected to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange within months and could be selling their flying machines commercially soon. CEO Peter Coker admits 'it certainly is very exciting, this is going to change aviation forever'. Scroll down for video . 'It certainly is very exciting, this is going to change aviation forever' claims Martin Jetpack CEO Peter Coker . It's been said that emergency authorities and military officials from around the world have already begun making enquiries with Martin Jetpack . Unmanned (remote controlled) versions are also being built by Martin Jetpack, 'we have had general enquiries from all over the world, both from investment perspective and buyers' 'To a degree, we are breaking new ground with our jet packs,' he said. They are building the flying equipment for both personal and professional use, with military use also on the agenda. However, it's in the area of disaster recovery, where Martin Jetpack is particularly determined to make an impact. Already, they say, that there has been strong interest in the US, across Asia and the Middle East. While the public listing is likely in Australia, most domestic emergency services told Daily Mail Australia that they remain non-committal when they assessing the invention against current operational requirements. However, one did leave the door slightly ajar, conceding that they are always looking to take advantage of new technology. The Martin Jetpack runs on twin ducted fans, not a jet engine, like previous incarnations . The jetpack is predominantly carbon fibre and weighs 180 kilograms . The jetpack can reach speeds of 74km per hour and rise to an altitude of 250 metres inside a minute . 'The first target is the area of first responder, such as fire-fighting, police, ambulance, any emergency service really.' After the hoped-for success in that area of business, Martin Jetpack say they will then re-focus on the leisure market. And that may, one day, even include flying to work. While Mr Coker wouldn't be tied down to a delivery date on the ASX listing, he did say that 'we are now going through the various stages of due diligence' The company continues its development program, pending approval of both fiscal regulators and aviation safety authorities. The price tag of a Martin jetpack will range in price from $150,000 to $250,000, depending on whether it is the (primary) manned version or unmanned. Martin's first focus will be on the professional market before providing more for personal use . The predominantly carbon fibre pack does not use a jet engine; it has twin-ducted fans to generate lift, runs on 2-stroke fuel, just like your lawnmower or small motorbike . 'We are making them a lot cheaper to run and we can get into a lot smaller spaces,' Mr Coker added. The predominantly carbon fibre pack does not use a jet engine; it has twin-ducted fans to generate lift, runs on 2-stroke fuel (just like a lawnmower or small bike) has a range of about 30 kilometres (or about 20 minutes of flight) before needing to be refuelled and can reach speeds of more than 70 kilometres per hour and fly at a height of about 250 metres. Plans are afoot to adapt future models allow for different types of fuel. 'We will continue to grow the capability,' Mr Coker said. According to Martin Jetpack officials, they are working with technology which 'is only bound by our imagination' He made it clear this was a serious business and not 'a novelty' as has been witnessed at major sporting events or shows, in the past. 'Glenn Martin (the company founder) has been thinking about and working at developing a practical jet pack to build form for more than 30 years,' the CEO said. 'It was very much something that grabbed him during his childhood, he always thought they'd be a part of our lives in the future. 'Others which have been used in the past were based on a jet belt, this (technology) is only bound by our imagination. 'We have had general enquiries from all over the world, both from an investment perspective and buyers.' Jet packs could soon play a part in military operations . So popular has Martin Jetpack's plan proved that they exceeded and had to close off the pre Initial Public Offering (IPO), designed to cover ongoing costs as it continues to push towards commercialisation of the product. Sydney based Corporate Advisory Firm, Axstra Capita, managed the capital raising. 'We are very happy to be able to close the pre-IPO ahead of schedule', Managing Director Reuben Buchanan said. 'This result gives us a strong indication of the positive investor interest in Australia. 'We can now focus our attention on the next step which includes a possible IPO and listing of the company.'","Jet pack maker Martin Aircraft is based in Christchurch, New Zealand .

"Hackers could have gained access to celebrity iCloud accounts using just an email address and a search engine, it has been claimed. Apple's password reset system for accounts has become the latest target in the hunt to find out how nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other celebrities' were leaked. it allows people to reset a password by answering two security questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity users. Scroll down for video . Apple's online system for resetting iCloud passwords has come under scrutiny for its part in the hacking case. Experts say worried consumers should turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account. The tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password. To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID.Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security. Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices. A trusted device is one that can receive 4-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone. Apple has admitted it is 'actively investigating' claims a flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' function of its iCloud service may have helped a hacker to steal the photos. Today it emerged hackers may also have used the service's password reset function to gain access to accounts. This allows users to reset their password by entering their username, date of birth and correctly answering two security questions. Experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities. Apple does email users to tell them their password has been changed. However, on the AnonIB hacking messageboard, those who say they have used the method claim that it's often best to reset the password at night so that the password reset email can be read and deleted before the target is awake. Rich Mogull, a security expert with Securosis, warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online. 'The key is not to put the real answers to these questions,' he told MailOnline. The reset system allows those who have forgotten their password to reset it by answering a series of questions. Users are asked to first confirm their date of birth - which is straightforward to find online . They are then offered two options - to change their password using email authentication or by answering security questions . Users are then asked to answer two security questions, which range from their first car to their favourite job, which were set up when they signed up for the account. Code on software development site Github called iBrute, would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. Apple has since issued a fix for the bug. 'The end of the fun, Apple has just patched,' read an update on the post. Brute force, also known as 'brute force cracking', is a trial-and-error method used to get plain-text passwords from encrypted data. Just as a criminal might break into, or 'crack' a safe by trying many possible combinations, a brute-force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in sequence.In a six-letter attack. 'Many users use simple passwords that are the same across services so it's entirely possible to guess passwords using a tool like this,' said Owen Williams form The Next Web. Mogull, who admitted hackers had tried to access his account, warned that it was still unclear exactly what happened. 'We don't know what happened yet, and In the security world, you need all the facts.' He also believed consumers were likely to stay with the firm despite the breaches. 'Historically we don't see a mass exodus from breaches, consumers don't seem to change their behaviour. 'There's a lot of historical precedent here - and this is just a first strike for Apple. 'It does appear that there was a flaw in iCloud - and we need to hear from Apple what the problem was, and what they are going to do to make it better,’ Experts believe the breadth of the celebrities affected could be down to a ‘chain effect’ - once one celebrities phonebook was accessed, it could lead to dozens more. Security consultant Graham Cluley told MailOnline: 'For these attacks to work, you also need email addresses of target. 'But what we have seen is that hackers can access address books - and this would have helped the hackers.' Clulely also believes the 'reset password' system may have been used. 'It certainly possible that people would have used this,' he said. 'In the case of celebrities, these secret questions are very easy to find online - either in Wikipedia or by searching through some interviews.' Dropbox requires users to respond to an email sent to their address to reset a password . Apple has only issued one statement, last night, on the attacks. 'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told MailOnline. Cluley said that anger was growing at Apple among iCloud users. ‘Even though we don’t know exactly what happened, the feeling is growing that Apple wasn't doing enough to stop this,' he said. However, Cluley believes customers will stick with Apple. ‘I don't think we'll see a mass exodus - people's memory are very short. Jeffifer Lawrence and model Cara Delevingne are among those hit by the leaks so far . 'Apple is about to announce a new iPhone, and people will use iCloud to move their data do it, because it’s such a simple process. The hacker claims he or she broke into stars' iCloud accounts, including those of the Hunger Games actress, Kate Upton and Rihanna, before publishing them on 4chan, the image-sharing forum. A list of the alleged victims of the hack - a staggering 101 in total - has also been posted online; most of whom have not seen any photographs leaked by the hacker. Cluley said he thought 'more leaks are to come'. Experts also think a flaw in Apple's Find my Phone was used for some of the hacks. However, despite not admitting the bug was caused by its system, the tech giant issued a 'patch', or fix, for the alleged 'Find My iPhone' bug some claim is responsible. Code on software development site Github called iBrute, would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. Apple has since issued a fix for the bug. 'The end of the fun, Apple has just patched,' read an update on the post. The hacker who posted the first batch of pictures said it was the result of 'several months of hard work by all those involved' Brute force, also known as 'brute force cracking', is a trial-and-error method used to get plain-text passwords from encrypted data.

'Many users use simple passwords that are the same across services so it's entirely possible to guess passwords using a tool like this,' said Owen Williams form The Next Web. And in a statement issued on Monday afternoon, the FBI confirmed that it had also begun an investigation. 'The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. 'Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.' Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticise Apple on Monday when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter. The Spiderman star tweeted 'Thank you iCloud', the day after naked photos of her were published online.","System allows users to reset password by answering two security questions .
