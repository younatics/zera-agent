"Washington (CNN) -- Venezuela routinely violates human rights, often intimidating or punishing citizens based on their political beliefs, an Organization of American States commission said in a report released Wednesday. The 319-page report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights says a lack of independence by Venezuela's judiciary and legislature in their dealings with leftist President Hugo Chavez often leads to the abuses. ""The report finds that not all individuals are ensured full enjoyment of their rights irrespective of their positions on government policies,"" the human rights panel said. ""The commission also finds that the punitive power of the state is being used to intimidate or punish people on account of their political opinions. The commission believes that conditions do not exist for human rights defenders and journalists to be able to freely carry out their work."" Chavez's critics say his government represses political opponents and the expression of free ideas by jailing critics on trumped-up charges or pulling licenses for TV and radio stations and shutting down newspapers. The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington did not immediately answer telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. The OAS commission's report also notes ""the existence of a pattern of impunity in cases of violence, which particularly affects media workers, human rights defenders, trade unionists, participants in public demonstrations, people held in custody, 'campesinos' (small-scale and subsistence farmers), indigenous people, and women."" The report gives credit to Chavez's government for observing citizens' rights with regard to economic, social and cultural matters. But that does not give the government permission to trample human rights, the panel said. Read the IACHR report . ""The commission emphasizes that observance of other fundamental rights cannot be sacrificed for the sake of realizing economic, social and cultural rights in Venezuela,"" the report states. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an autonomous panel created by the OAS. The commission consists of seven independent members who act in a personal capacity, without representing a particular country. They are elected by the OAS General Assembly.","Report: Judiciary and legislature lack independence in dealings with president .

"(CNN) -- The NFL markets the Super Bowl as the ultimate game, the ultimate contest. Helmets clash like gladiators in ancient Rome. Stadiums resemble coliseums -- especially those without a roof. The contest is macho all the way. Players talk about ""manning up"" (not a reference to the quarterback family) and other testosterone-leaning terms. Other than a few party-oriented commercials, football is marketed toward men. It's a guy thing, and we ladies are allowed in if we know either when to cheer or how to bring the cheer. Or so the stereotype goes. So it used to be. But no more. According to Nielsen demographic data, 46% of the Super Bowl viewing audience is female, and more women watch the game than the Oscars, Grammys and Emmys combined. That perhaps surprising statistic raises two questions: Why? And, so what? History of the Super Bowl: By the numbers . Why do women watch the game? Now, we know that women attended the gladiator fights and chariot races in ancient Rome. But today, it may be more than just the blood sport. Many women are into sports for the same reasons men are: They enjoy the competition. It's entertaining. The tailgating before. The excitement during. The celebrating (or commiserating) after. Lots of action. But a lot of women are football fans because it's a family thing. My father was a lifelong Saints fan, and I'm proud to carry on the family tradition. Lionel Brazile has got to be beaming, knowing I'm going to my second Super Bowl. He would have loved to hear my stories. Maybe I'll tell him one or two while I'm praying. There are lots of studies about the different ways men and women bond, so I find it interesting how the bonding intersects around Super Bowl time. For women, the score is important if our team is playing. But whether we're watching at home or at the stadium, it's about being there and being with -- family and friends. For the men, it's also about sharing -- but I suspect it's about sharing the competition, vicariously. But as long as it's a good game, and brings people together for a positive experience, it doesn't matter why. There is a ""so what,"" though -- a practical economic side to women's interest in The Big Game. She-conomy.com reports that ""women influence the majority of consumer spending across all categories."" On the line of scrimmage: Football and politics . For advertisers and businesses, Super Bowl Sunday should be a prime time to focus on women. Sadly, according to a recent article in adweek.com, advertisers have fumbled the ball. ""In 2013 we saw waitresses turned strippers, scantily clad women tackling each other in the dirt, and a supermodel sloppily kissing a computer programmer,"" said writer Kat Gordon. This turns off men as well as women. So if businesses want their Super Bowl commercials to be part of the event, instead of an excuse to check the fridge, they'd better pay attention to the numbers -- and I don't mean the Roman numerals. And while they are at it, they should seriously consider taking it one step further and using the Super Bowl -- the most watched sports event of the year -- to promote awareness around issues facing women today. Use this testosterone-saturated event, for instance, to make clear that while testosterone-driven violence might be entertaining on the field, it doesn't belong in the bedroom. Use the Super Bowl to do more than determine the best football team of the year. Use it to help end one of the most prevalent crimes of the century -- violence again women. Use it as a warm-up for the One Billion Rising event on February 14, in which more than a billion people worldwide will rise to support justice for women. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","According to Nielsen data, 46% of the Super Bowl viewing audience is female .
Is it the spectacle of the battle or a chance to spend time with the family?
Advertisers now know the audience, and cater to the female viewer ."
"New York (CNN) -- In a city as big as New York, finding long-lost loved ones is no easy task -- especially after they've died. For Elaine Joseph, it took decades. During a massive blizzard in 1978, doctors tried to save her newborn daughter, who was suffering from what turned out to be a fatal heart condition. Joseph, who was still recovering from giving birth at the city's Beth Israel Medical Center, said hospital officials notified her of her baby's death and had her sign off on a city burial. ""It was a nightmare,"" said Joseph, who was then 23 years old and later found it nearly impossible to find where her daughter's remains were buried. ""For years and years, I didn't even know where to look,"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do."" Joseph didn't get answers until much later, when she met a woman named Melinda Hunt of Westchester, New York. Hunt, 53, has made it her life's work to document the undocumented at Hart Island, reportedly the nation's largest taxpayer-funded potter's field -- a term used for a place where the unclaimed dead are buried. The site, located at the western end of Long Island Sound, dates to the mid-1860s, when it was used as a Union training camp during the American Civil War and then as a prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers. But today, its use as a public burial ground isn't always common knowledge -- even to the families of those entombed there. And observers say keeping track of the island's current inhabitants remains a challenge. Joseph said she first found Hunt by happenstance during an Internet search, a part of her unending attempt to locate her daughter's remains. ""For 33 years, I've been trying to find where my child is,"" said Joseph, who said her baby's official burial records were missing. Joseph contacted Hunt through her website at hartisland.net -- a resource Hunt created for family and friends in search of lost loved ones, as well as a nod of acknowledgment to the city's unclaimed dead. Hunt suspected Joseph's child was buried on Hart Island despite the incomplete records. She worked on Joseph's behalf, contacting city officials who eventually granted Joseph access to the island. Though it remains uncertain whether her daughter is buried there, it appears very likely. ""I started the Hart Island Project having lost a number of friends to AIDS in the 1980s,"" Hunt said. ""Many of these people in their 20s simply disappeared."" She first began taking photographs on the thin jut of land, which sits just off the Bronx shoreline, in 1991. Authorities later made the area off-limits to the general public. Hunt has since produced a documentary about the island and has put on art exhibits featuring her own drawings of its inhabitants devised from photos taken during their lives. She is also founder of The Hart Island Project, a nonprofit organization largely dedicated to informing the public of the island's inhabitants. After submitting a series of Freedom of Information Act requests to the city, Hunt got her hands on thousands of the island's burial records and worked to create an online database. She currently has more than 60,000 records listed online. And while Hunt has focused on New York's Hart Island, many other regions of the country have similar sites. In Los Angeles, unknown bodies are cremated and buried in a Los Angeles County burial site. In Chicago, most John and Jane Does are buried at a Cook County public cemetery outside city limits. But in Gotham, where some 50,000 deaths are reported each year, about 1,200 unknowns are buried on Hart Island, according to New York's Department of Correction. It is now the final resting place for up to a million people. City officials say they've tried to create a more official database for public users. But until that happens, those like Joseph and New Jersey resident Lisa-Michele Russo have turned to Hunt and her website for help. From an early age, Russo called herself a ""twin-less twin,"" having lost her twin brother, Anthony, at birth. ""I knew,"" she said, and she pressed her parents until they eventually told her about Anthony. ""As a twin, you're born together, but you don't die together."" Still, her parents remained reluctant to discuss her brother's death. ""It wasn't something that my parents liked to talk about,"" said the now 38-year-old Blairstown resident. ""It was a heartbreaking situation."" Her mother, who was a 21-year-old parent coping with the emotional fallout of having a still-born child, also decided on a city burial. For Russo, that meant Anthony went missing. ""I had all these strong feelings that I needed to do something for him,"" she said. Her years-long search for his grave had gone cold until 2009 when she, like Joseph, enlisted Hunt's help after finding her Hart Island website. Using Anthony's death certificate, Hunt again petitioned city officials to arrange a visit to the island for the baby's now-adult sister. The request was eventually granted. ""We do our best to accommodate every legitimate request,"" said Department of Correction spokeswoman Sharman Stein, who noted that in most cases, family members must first provide documentation proving that their loved ones are buried on the island before they visit. Joseph's case, in which records were incomplete, was among the exceptions. Russo said her trip, however, was restricted to a single gazebo overlooking the plots. Her cell phone and camera were also temporarily confiscated by authorities after she arrived by ferry -- an experience akin to ""an excursion on a cruise ship,"" she said. ""We were never left alone."" Still, the visit seemed to fill a void. ""She is helping so many people and she doesn't know any of us,"" Russo said of Hunt. In October, Hunt testified at a City Council hearing to amend New York's administrative code and force the Department of Correction to cede control of the island, arguing that the agency wasn't equipped to operate a place that ought to be open to the public. ""To me it's a basic human rights issue to be able to visit the dead,"" Hunt said. The Department of Correction declined to comment on her petition, but noted security concerns and a lack of public facilities as reasons to keep the area restricted. Hart Island currently employs inmate labor from neighboring correctional institutions to maintain the graves. Hunt, who sustains the Hart Island Project largely through donations and sales of her documentary and artwork, says she's recently received a grant from the state's Council on the Arts to create a ""posthumous Wiki"" -- a user-generated database of stories, photos and information about those on Hart Island. Since her website launched in 2009, Hunt says, more than 2,000 people from around the world have registered to search for their lost friends and family members.","Melinda Hunt, 53, has made her life's work documenting the undocumented at Hart Island .

The object had generated at least 155 reports to the meteor tracking group as of Friday morning. A similar event happened late Monday, viewed by at least 100 people from Maryland north to Connecticut.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hip hop is one U.S. commodity that has made it past the trade embargo to Cuba. Cuban rap duo ""Doble Filo"" say hip hop allows them to embrace social issues. Cuba has developed a homegrown rap movement, inspired by the sounds and fashions of U.S. hip hop. But what makes Cuban rappers different is that rather than celebrating bling, girls and guns, their lyrics address social issues in a country where free speech is tightly controlled. Cuban rap began to surface in the 1990s, a grassroots affair, with songs recorded in rappers' bedrooms and distributed on cassette tapes. The island's fledgling hip hop scene was given a boost in 1999, when it was endorsed by the government as ""an authentic expression of Cuban Culture."" In the following years the government set up the Cuban Rap Agency (CRA) to promote the scene, as well as a record label, ""Asere Productions,"" and a rap magazine called ""Movimiento."" Government approval helped Cuban hip hop emerge from the underground, but some see that endorsement as a gilded cage. Formed in 1996, rap duo ""Doble Filo"" (""Double Edged"") have been part of the Havana scene since the beginning and work with the Cuban Rap Agency. But rapper Irak Saenz admits there are contradictions in being part of the system. ""It does limit our creative freedom,"" he told CNN. ""The CRA has an agenda that goes with the government's agenda. It doesn't limit me but it does force me to be creative in how I express my ideas."" Along with fellow Cuban rap duo ""Los Aldeanos"" (""The Villagers"") ""Doble Filo"" work with U.S. hip hop audio/visual label, Emetrece Productions. But ""Los Aldeanos"", who formed in 2003, are part of a younger generation of Cuban rappers. They don't belong the CRA, and nor do they want to. They are defiantly underground and outspoken. ""Hip hop is an art form speaks the truth about how people are living,"" says Aldo Rodriguez, one half of Los Aldeanos. Their track ""Niñito Cubano"" is about a young boy growing up during Cuba's ""special period"", when the fall of the Soviet Union brought hardship to the island. Their forthright lyrics about life in Cuba don't make them any friends among Cuba's authorities, and that limits their opportunities on the island. ""Our lyrics don't always go with the standard Cuban rhetoric and often that won't get airplay,"" says Rodriguez. ""I can be famous in other countries, but here they won't let me play a concert in a theater."" Listen to Doble Filo and Los Aldeanos here » . Doble Filo's Saenz has performed the U.S. with fellow Cubans ""Obsesion"", a tour that included playing on the same bill as U.S. rap stars Kanye West and The Roots. He says that where his generation of rappers was forced to limit the way it talked about the realities of daily life, the new generation is bolder with its lyrics. Bian Rodriguez, also known as El B, the other member of ""Los Aldeanos,"" says hip hop gives voice to the concerns of ordinary Cubans. ""People tell me they need this music, not just because they can identify with what we are saying, but because they feel that maybe we can say things they might be afraid to say publicly,"" he told CNN. Like most other Cuban rap groups, ""Los Aldeanos"" aren't yet in a position to make a living from their music. El B has won Cuba's Red Bull freestyle rapping championship three years in a row, but he still has a day job as a primary school teacher. A lack of funds and equipment means the island's hip hop producers have to use a certain amount of ingenuity when it comes to recording their music. Doble Filo's producer Edgaro explains that in the group's early days, he would make tracks by looping the last few bars of songs on cassette tapes. These days, Edgaro produces songs on his PC, but the software is pirated from copies brought into the country and circulated on the streets. It simply isn't available in the stores. More about Cuba's arts: Carlos Acosta takes CNN on a tour of Havana. » . As the scene develops the groups are getting more ambitious. Doble Filo are now incorporating live musicians into their sound, weaving in elements of traditional Cuban music, and they are set to release their debut album ""Despierta"" (""Wake up"") through Emetrece Productions. Emetrece is run by Melisa Riviere, a Ph.D. candidate in the Anthropology Department at the University of Minnesota. More than just promoting good music, she says Emetrece is trying to educate, and to challenge the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Like Cuba's rappers, she sees hip hop as a tool for social change. As El B puts it, ""I think one of the things people take from the music is the idea that we can do anything, we can change anything, we can be anything we want.""","Cuba's homegrown rap scene is known for its socially conscious lyrics .

"New York (CNN) -- Two people arrested in connection with the drugs found in actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment were released Thursday until their next court dates. Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum, both 22, were among four people arrested in a raid Tuesday night in which police recovered 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin, law enforcement officials told CNN. The bags of alleged heroin were branded ""black list"" and ""red bull"" -- not the same brands found in Hoffman's apartment, the officials said. A police source said the Manhattan apartments where the four were picked up are part of the investigation into Hoffman's death. The four under investigation in connection with drugs sold to Academy Award-winning actor were identified as Luchkiw; Rosenblum; Robert Vineberg, 57; and Thomas Cushman, 48. The Manhattan district attorney's office Wednesday declined to prosecute Cushman because there was no evidence he had any control over the drugs. Luchkiw, who pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, appeared Thursday before Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Edward McLaughlin. Luchkiw's attorney, Stephen Turano, told the court his client has no criminal record. He said her father, who was present in court, is a lawyer and her mother a doctor. The prosecution asked for Luchkiw's bail to be set at $1,500, but McLaughlin ordered her released on her own recognizance, saying it was a misdemeanor case and it was ""illogical"" to assume she would fail show for her February 14 court date. ""My client absolutely did not, is not involved in selling any drugs, certainly not heroin, but any drugs and certainly not involved in selling drugs to Mr. Hoffman,"" Turano said outside court. Turano said a search of her apartment turned up cocaine, though prosecutors told the court traces of what was believed to be heroin also were present. ""She's tied to this case because there was a confidential informant who placed sales of narcotics â€” heroin â€” from, I guess, an adjacent apartment,"" he said. ""How that ties into my client's apartment, I'm not sure. But I can be very adamant that my client had nothing to do with the sales. And again, I think I said it before, really, wrong place, wrong time."" Luchkiw walked out of court with her father. Rosenblum appeared before McLaughlin later Thursday. The judge said Rosenblum, who had previously failed to show up in court in connection with a 2010 drug possession case, ""did flip his nose at the court for three years."" His lawyer David Hochheiser said Rosenblum would live with his parents until his court date on Tuesday. Hochheiser said his client will plead not guilty. McLaughlin set bond at $35,000, or $8,500 cash, which his family posted. ""He's never met, spoken to, seen, had anything to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman,"" Hochheiser, speaking outside court, said of his client. ""My client is in no way connected to Mr. Hoffman's overdose and there has been no evidence presented that I know of that connects my client to Mr. Hoffman in any way, except that he lived in a building which apparently Mr. Hoffman frequented a different apartment to do whatever he did."" He added, ""Max is looking forward to turning his life around and resolving this matter. His parents are relieved that he's been released on these misdemeanor charges, which I think will be resolved favorably for my client."" Vineberg, who faces a felony charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance and has pleaded not guilty, is set to appear in court February 14. Vineberg was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his cell phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said. A former neighbor described Vineberg as a talented musician who used the stage name Robert Aaron and once toured with Wyclef Jean. Vineberg had a wife and daughter, said the neighbor, who lived in the building years ago. ""He used to practice at night,"" said the ex-neighbor, recalling that Vineberg played keyboards. ""Honestly, he seemed like a nice guy, always playing music. Nothing sinister."" Vineberg's attorney, Edward Kratt, said he hopes prosecutors will not use his client as a scapegoat. ""These charges have absolutely nothing to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman's unfortunate death,"" Kratt said. A spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner's office said Wednesday a determination of the cause and manner of Hoffman's death is pending further study, including toxicology reports. When police were called to Hoffman's fourth-floor Manhattan apartment Sunday, they found the actor, 46, lying on the bathroom floor with a syringe in his left arm. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, his eyeglasses still resting on his head, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, the law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said. Hoffman's final hours . Final hours . Police are trying to piece together the actor's movements last weekend. A law enforcement source told CNN that the night before Hoffman died, he withdrew $1,200 from a grocery store ATM near his apartment. Hoffman got the money in six transactions Saturday night, according to the source. A witness told investigators he saw the actor talking to two men wearing messenger bags about 8 p.m. Police are also reviewing surveillance video, including that of a restaurant where Hoffman had brunch Saturday morning with two people. How heroin kills you . A family friend of Hoffman's said a small, private wake will be held Thursday evening at Manhattan's Frank E. Campbell funeral home. Hoffman's funeral will be held Friday afternoon at St. Ignatius of Loyola Catholic Church in Manhattan.

"(CNN) -- You're not imagining it: Airline seats are generally getting smaller. But while many airlines have been slimming down their seats over the past few decades, we've been bulking up. According to the World Health Organization, the global prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980. ""Seats are getting smaller and smaller as airlines look to squeeze revenue from their economy seats,"" noted Ranga Natarajan, the senior product manager at SeatGuru, a website that rates the best and worst seats on nearly every plane in the industry. In the 1960s, a seat width of 17 inches was standard, and for a period in the 1990s and early 2000s, that grew to 18.5 inches with the introduction of the Boeing 777 and Airbus A380. Recently, however, airlines been filling planes to a capacity that Natarajan calls ""historic proportions."" ""Airlines used to fly at 70% capacity. Now, that number is closer to 80 to 85%, which means every middle seat is occupied, so the elbow room just isn't there,"" he said. 500-pound man denied seat on plane . Airbus' view: 'Make 'em wider!' To fit in the extra seat, passengers are now facing a width that is 17 inches and in some cases as narrow as 16 inches, a state of affairs that has pushed airplane manufacturer Airbus to launch a new marketing campaign called ""it's the seat."" In a call to action to make 18 inches the industry standard, Airbus partnered with the London Sleep Center. They tested a small sample of six adults and found that passenger sleep quality improved 53% in the larger seats. ""If the aviation industry doesn't take a stand right now, then we risk jeopardizing passenger comfort into 2045 and beyond,"" said Kevin Keniston, Airbus' head of passenger comfort, in the company's press materials. People's growing proportions aren't the only issue, Airbus spokeswoman Ruth Nye said. ""In the early days of jet travel, people were flying less frequently and over shorter distances. Also, due to a lower load factor, many had empty seats next to them,"" she said, adding that all of Airbus' long-haul aircraft have been designed to accommodate 18-inch seats. Ask the airlines . Ultimately, though, seat proportions are dictated by the airlines, not the plane manufacturers. Unsurprisingly, Airbus competitor Boeing is unimpressed with its rival's call to arms. ""Airlines ask us for the flexibility to offer a great experience for passengers in a way that makes economic sense for the airline and economic sense for their passengers,"" Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bergman said. ""What they haven't asked for is an arbitrary, self-serving seat-width standard."" As for whether Airbus' campaign will make any difference in years to come, it's too early to tell, but many aren't convinced. ""The current trend will continue: Airlines will try to make the optimal use of the space available in an aircraft due to the fact that the competition is very strong,"" said Mark Hiller, chief executive officer of Recaro Aircraft Seating, adding that airlines haven't changed their orders. Making less feel like more . In the past couple of years, Recaro has been charged with the difficult task of making seats that are both more cramped and more comfortable. To achieve this effect, the company has slimmed down armrests to give more room for passengers' hips and repositioned the literature pocket above the tray table to increase legroom. Child-free zones on planes. Good or bad? Mainly, though, Recaro has replaced traditional foam with a netting material that adheres more to the passenger's body. The result is that seats are thinner, so even if pitch is reduced, it feels as if there's more legroom. What you can do . According to Natarajan, the best way to eke out some more space in the air is to do what the airlines are banking you'll do: upgrade. Short of that, he notes, airlines treat different model numbers differently, and it's worth looking up the model number and seat width on SeatGuru before you book. ""We've seen complaints that a number of airlines have started putting 10 seats across on the 777. One customer wrote that he flew one leg of a journey on a 777 in a 17-inch seat and flew back in an 18-inch on an A380. 'It felt like an upgrade,' he wrote.""","Airline seats are shrinking from the once standard 18.5 inches to 17 inches across .
Meanwhile, passengers are getting heavier, and flights are getting more crammed .
Airbus is calling on the industry to make seats wider ."
"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is undoubtedly the greatest men's tennis players of the modern era -- if not of all time -- following his epic victory over Andy Roddick in Sunday's Wimbledon final. Reaching for the stars: Roger Federer ithe best tennis player the world has ever seen. His star had waned somewhat in the past year, losing his No. 1 world ranking to Rafael Nadal, but his breakthrough victory at the French Open last month saw him match Pete Sampras with 14 titles at major tournaments. With the injured Nadal absent at SW19, Federer rolled back time to march relentlessly into the final against Roddick, dropping just one set along the way as he reminded fans of the form that saw him top the rankings for a record 237 weeks. Then on Sunday, Federer overtook Sampras' mark with 15 grand slams -- with the American in attendance to view his record finally go. Federer still has some way to go before beating Sampras' all-time record of 286 weeks at the summit, but at the age of 27 he has plenty of time to take back his crown from Nadal, especially with the Spaniard's career seeming in the balance due to his chronic knee problems. The Swiss is already the ATP Tour's all-time earner, with more than $48 million in prize money. He holds the record for most money earned in one season, $10 million in 2007, and is also second on the list for his $8 million the year before. Sampras, in comparison, is second on the earnings list with $43 million up until his retirement in 2002 after a 14-year career. He won 64 ATP Tour titles, compared to Federer's 59, but both are a long way behind the record 109 achieved by Jimmy Connors, with Ivan Lendl next on 94 and John McEnroe third with 77. When it comes to Grand Slams, Sampras won 14 finals and lost four. Including Sunday, Federer has reached the most, appearing in 20. Lendl, who held the world record for 270 weeks at No. 1 before being usurped by Sampras, appeared in 19 finals but could only win eight. The great Bjorn Borg, who shares the record for most successive titles at Wimbledon with Federer -- who completed his quintet in 2007 - won 11 of his 16 Grand Slam finals. None of those illustrious names have been able to surpass the efforts of Australian legend Rod Laver, who is the only men's player to have won all four Grand Slams twice in the same year. He did it first as an amateur in 1962, and then again in the 1969 when he became the first -- and only -- player to achieve the feat in the open era. Federer became the first player to reach seven consecutive Wimbledon finals with his 50th win at the All England Club in his semi-final victory against Tommy Haas on Friday, but still trails Sampras' record of seven titles at SW19. His bid for a record sixth successive crown was thwarted in an epic final showdown last year with Nadal, who has transformed himself from a clay-court specialist into a fearsome all-round talent. Federer, by contrast, has taken a long time to adapt to clay. He did not reach the semi-finals at Roland Garros until his seventh appearance in Paris, then was beaten in the final by Nadal for the next three years. His triumph this year came after the Olympic champion suffered a surprise early exit, although he had earlier ended Nadal's 33-match winning streak on clay in the Madrid Open final. The anxiously-anticipated Paris win made him just the sixth player to complete the set of major titles, the third in the modern era and the first since Andre Agassi -- who added the final piece in his jigsaw with victory at the 1999 French Open. Federer shares the Open-era record for most U.S. Open victories with Sampras and Connors, having clinched his fifth crown in 2008 when he beat young pretender Andy Murray in the final. He has always been generous in his praise of Sampras, who never won at Roland Garros but triumphed twice at the Australian Open and holds the record for winning eight successive Grand Slam finals.  Sampras: Federer is the greatest. ""I think his success here at Wimbledon is amazing,"" Federer has said of Sampras. ""Winning it three times, coming back, winning it four more times and going for five, it's quite something. ""And he finished off with the U.S. Open victory, which was very special against his biggest rival Andre Agassi. I think that's what I'll remember most of him. ""I guess he had the best serve we've seen in tennis history, even though today we also have some good ones. He was also a smooth mover which he never really got credit for. There's many things that Pete did incredibly well."" Federer's career has been no less incredible, but he has claimed that he started out with no such lofty ambitions. ""I'm very proud of all the records I've achieved because I never thought I would be that successful as a kid,"" he said. ""I would have been happy winning a couple of tournaments and maybe collecting Wimbledon.""","Roger Federer has reached 20 Grand Slam finals the most by any male player .

"Gondar, Ethiopia (CNN) -- France has Lourdes, India has the Ganges. Ethiopia, meanwhile, has Gondar. Situated about 450 miles north of Addis Ababa, encapsulated by hills and tall trees, and dotted with 17th-century relics from the city's glory days (when it was the country's capital), Gondar today can seem somewhat remote. During the religious festival of ""Timket,"" however, the city is inundated with pilgrims who come to re-enact the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, and take a dip in the holy waters at the historical Fasilides Bath. Nearly two thirds of Ethiopia's 94 million population is Christian, and the majority of those belong to the Orthodox church. For them, Timket -- celebrating the Epiphany -- is among the most important occasions of the year. It's is a two-day affair that begins with a procession of ""tabots,"" holy replicas of the Ark of the Covenant -- the sacred chests described in the Book of Exodus as carrying the stone tablets on which the 10 Commandments were written. The tabots are wrapped in cloth and placed on the heads of Ethiopian Orthodox Christian priests, who parade the streets en route to the bath. The priests, clad in ceremonial robes, are escorted by drums and by the clapping and singing of worshipers, who hold an overnight vigil until dawn. There are services the following morning which culminate in the priests blessing the waters of the historic bath, while onlookers crowd every nook surrounding the bath -- some getting a pristine view from nearby trees. When the priests are done, the mood turns jubilant, and the spectators rush to jump into the pool. ""The water is blessed in the name of the Holy Trinity ... in the name of God. The water is now sacred, and the sick shall be cured,"" explains Ezra Adis, the head priest at the local Medhanelem Church. ""That is why the young people who jump in first get excited; it is a spiritual love,"" he adds. Read this: Ethiopia's churches ""built by angels"" The plunge is so swift that some participants get battered in the process -- though most are unperturbed by a few scratches. ""I jumped from high above,"" boasts one man who dived into the waters from one of the nearby trees. ""I was apprehensive,"" he adds. ""The branches could give way and you could fall on the rock edge of the pool, and there was a possibility I could have lost my life, but at this moment, I am doing what I feel good about, and that possibility of death doesn't scare me."" The Timket festival dates back to the 16th century, but it was marked only in churches until the baptismal ceremonies were introduced, explains Bantalem Tadesse Tedla, a historian at the University of Gondar. The baptisms, usually held on January 19, are celebrated differently in other parts of the country. ""There are three options for Timket,"" says Tedla. ""To be immersed, to collect water from three pipes and pour it on people, or to collect water and sprinkle it -- it depends on the availability of water. ""In Gondar, the first is implemented, because of the existence of this very important building,"" he adds, referring to the stone bath -- a UNESCO world heritage site built in 1632 for King Fasil (Fasiledes). As the afternoon winds down, people begin to leave the pool and head back to the streets, but the festivities aren't quite over. Each tabot is now paraded back to its respective church with crowds of onlookers eager to get one last look at them. Back at the churches, it's a different, quieter scene. Congregants fill the church grounds to listen in on a final service, and after a closing prayer it's time to send the tabot back inside the church to its resting place. The locals will eventually return to their homes for a special feast, but in the meantime, the celebrations on the streets of Gondar continue -- a chance for orthodox Christians to celebrate and come together for one of the most sacred and festive days of the year.

"(CNN) -- The FBI has questioned people connected to Chris Christie's former campaign manager as part of a federal probe of a traffic scandal that has upended the New Jersey governor's administration, court papers show. Bill Stepien, in arguing why he cannot comply with a subpoena issued by a state legislative committee also investigating the scandal, said federal agents have visited his home and questioned people who know him, according to court papers. ""In recent weeks, federal criminal investigators have made their interest in him plain, traveling to his home and importuning his landlord and presumably others to provide information about his conduct and character,"" Stepien's lawyer, Kevin Marino, said. Specifically, the court documents claimed that an agent called Stepien on his cell phone in January and most recently questioned his landlord. The FBI asked ""if he was married, was a rowdy tenant, did he pay his rent on time,"" according to the papers. The FBI has been investigating Bridget Anne Kelly as well, said her attorney, Michael Critchley. Kelly is another Christie appointee fighting a legislative subpoena. Agents visited her house and spoke with her parents; they also visited her father's job last month, Critchley said. The U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey contacted Critchley to see whether Kelly would be interested in talking, and he told them she was not, he said. These visits are the first indications that investigators have been looking to question those with close ties to Christie. Stepien managed both Christie gubernatorial campaigns, but Christie asked him to leave his political organization in January after his name surfaced in e-mails around the scandal involving abrupt traffic lane closures near the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last September. Kelly was Christie's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, and her name surfaced in those e-mails as well. Christie fired her after the e-mails became public. Both federal and legislative investigators are probing suggestions that top Christie appointees orchestrated the lane closures as part of a political scheme to punish the mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie for re-election. Stepien has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and Christie denies knowing about the traffic gridlock until after it happened. Christie, a Republican viewed as a possible presidential candidate in 2016, also has said repeatedly he knew nothing about any related political mischief by people working on behalf of the state. Critchley said he plans to file court papers on Thursday. The U.S. attorney's office in Newark had no comment on the Stepien matter.","Two advisers to New Jersey Gov.

"(CNN) -- In the fall of 1995, I jumped into a large van with about 20 other young black men, and we headed out from the small college town of Kalamazoo, Michigan, to Washington. Destination: the Million Man March. The mission: addressing the ills crippling black men. We were an intellectually curious and rambunctious group. Loud, idealistic Gen Xers, raised on the sweet nectar of Public Enemy's message of personal responsibility and the films of Spike Lee that encouraged us to fight the power. So convinced that this event was going to change the world that when we turned on the radio, and McFadden and Whitehead's ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"" came on, I took the song as providence. Nearly 20 years later and I'm sure I don't need to rattle off all of the discouraging statistics regarding men of color in this country to illustrate that moment was anything but the awakening it was designed to be. Yet I sat Thursday in the East Room of the White House -- listening to President Barack Obama as he announced his ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative, looking at the young men who stood on risers behind him, listening to the affirmative audibles of the attendants, like the congregation of a Southern Baptist church -- and I found myself fondly reminiscing. I found myself inspired. When I first came to Washington to address the unique circumstances hindering men of color, it was with a megaphone shouting at the White House. On this day, I was in the White House, and the megaphone had been replaced with a microphone clipped to a podium that bears the seal of the President. Progress. Afterward I was asked if I thought this initiative would make a difference. My answer was yes. True, the cynic will look at the laundry list of already created programs -- locally and nationally -- that were designed to dismantle the debilitating factors that have plagued men of color over the years, look at ""Keeper"" and shrug. Others will accuse Obama of promoting division by using the office to highlight the issues of minorities over those of their white counterparts. As if one in three black males being projected to go to prison at some point in their lives can be construed as some sort of highlight. But such is the world of the first black President of these United States. Obama spent the first five years of his administration cautiously touching on the issue of race -- a beer summit here, a hypothetical ""son"" in the wake of the killing of Trayvon Martin there -- likely for fear of being perceived as only caring about the needs of ""his people"" as opposed to ""the people."" As a result, he has been the target of sharp criticism from some within the black community who see him aggressively addressing the pain of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, or tackling issues such as immigration that greatly affect Latinos, and they wonder what about us? What about our pain? The wealth of black households has declined more than any other demographic during Obama's time as President and those hurt most by this wonder: What about us? Blood continues to flow and bullets fly in the neighborhood streets he calls home and the residents wonder, what ... about ... us? Thursday he said, I hear you. I was asked if that would make a difference. My answer is yes. Obama's address was not about government. It was about community. His community, which is my community, which is your community. For as much as the narrative has historically reflected a storyline framed around the troubles of one section of society, the reality is no section is immune economically from the effects of this crisis. Men of color are more prone to drop out of high school than anyone else. A majority of inmates lack a high school diploma. In a 21-year span ending in 2003, the amount of money spent on prisons increased by 570%. That money comes from taxes. Dots connected. Not to mention the loss of workers and the well-documented effects of unplanned pregnancies coupled with absentee fathers. And when news reports of young men dying from gang violence no longer elicit an emotional response -- a sad reality the President talked about -- we are indeed in a moral crisis. Will ""Keeper"" make a difference?. Yes. Whether Obama is freed from the need to appease now that he's in his second term or driven by the urgency of the moment, the forming of ""My Brother's Keeper"" is the most tangible manifestation of his ""Change We Can Believe In"" slogan in years. And while $200 million promised by various corporations and philanthropic groups is but a ""drop in the bucket"" in terms of the resources needed -- as one of his critics, Tavis Smiley, pointed out soon thereafter -- the fact he was able to raise that amount quietly is an indication that addressing this crisis has been on his mind for some time. Even if he was hesitant to talk about it. Michael Cruz, a local student involved in an education supplemental program called Communities in Schools, was one of those young men standing on the risers behind the president. He spoke to me about what it was like to spend time with Obama and how he has already been encouraged by what the President wants to do. ""People are always trying to bring your self-esteem down,"" the 16-year-old from Washington told me. ""I have neighbors and kids in school telling me that I won't turn out to be anything and stuff like that. ""Some parts of my neighborhood are good and some parts people are doing drugs and stuff like that. But I try not to pay any attention to them and stay focused on my goals."" Goals that include going to college and becoming a chemical engineer. Over the past two days, he has gotten to know Michael Carter, a 15-year-old at his school. While Cruz has two parents in the home, Carter said he is raised by his mother and gets support from his aunts and cousins who help him stay out of trouble. ""Getting to know Michael has been a great experience because he has goals like I do,"" Carter said. ""I didn't know him before, but now that I have, we've become good friends. I know I will do all I can to encourage him and help him because seeing him do well will inspire me to do well."" Carter, who wants to attend Syracuse University and major in computer science, is his brother's keeper. And so if you saw the President's address or read some of his remarks and wonder if it would make a difference ... First think of Cruz and Carter and invariably your answer will be yes.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A United Arab Emirates sheikh was acquitted Sunday of charges connected to the videotaped beating and torture of an Afghan grain dealer. Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the emirates' ruling family, was charged with rape, endangering life and causing bodily harm in connection with the nearly three-hour long tape shot in 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf region. However, the court acquitted Issa on Sunday, ruling he had diminished responsibility for his actions because of the effects of medication his defense attorney claimed he was given. Issa had a ""lack of criminal responsibility,"" the court found, defense attorney Habib al-Mulla told CNN. ""The judiciary system acquitted Issa based on the evidence presented by the defense that the sheikh was under the influence of drugs given to him,"" al-Mulla said. ""That deprived him from his poise and caused him to carry out acts that were out of consciousness and that were photographed with the intention for later extortion."" The tape surfaced last year as a piece of evidence in a federal civil suit filed in Houston, Texas, against the sheikh by his former business partner, Bassam Nabulsi. It caused outrage among human rights groups and in the United States, where senior U.S. officials familiar with the case said the tape delayed the ratification of a civil nuclear deal between the UAE and the United States. On the tape, Issa is seen along with a private security officer stuffing sand in the man's mouth. As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers, he is beaten with a nailed board, burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter, shocked with a cattle prod and led to believe he would be shot. Salt is poured into his wounds. In the end, the victim can muster up only weak moans as an SUV is repeatedly driven over him. ""No one can prove that this videotape has not been tampered with,"" al-Mulla said Sunday. The only person who can confirm the incidents happened as seen on the tape is the victim, and he has not confirmed that, he added. ""We deny the incident as it was shown on that videotape."" The defense did not just center on the medication, he said, but claimed that the videotape and other incidents from that night were all part of a conspiracy aimed at blackmailing the sheikh. During the trial, the defense presented medical reports from experts in the United States and the United Arab Emirates showing that the various types of medicines given to Issa, when combined, ""would lead any person to act in a very aggressive manner, losing his control and his behavior."" Asked about a Human Rights Watch statement that one trial was not enough to stop torture and restore the United Arab Emirates' image, al-Mulla told CNN he believed the UAE was ""courageous"" to hold the trial, calling it ""a very positive signal of what the UAE is trying to achieve."" The incident allegedly was triggered by Issa's belief he was cheated in a business deal. UAE officials have said the grain dealer survived and has settled the matter privately with the sheikh, with the two agreeing not to bring formal charges against the other. Al-Mulla said he is ""pleased with the verdict as it was proven that Sheikh Issa was a victim, and he was not what the media tried to portray him [as]."" The Afghan man was in the courtroom, and the court issued him a ""temporary"" compensation of 10,000 dirhams ($2,722), al-Mulla said. Nabulsi, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen now living in Houston, said he met Issa when the sheikh came to Houston for medical treatment in 1994. They became friends and business partners and the sheikh recruited Nabulsi to move to Abu Dhabi to work for him. In the lawsuit, Nabulsi claims breaches of contract and fiduciary duty. A federal court dismissed the suit in June, ruling it did not have jurisdiction, according to online federal court records. Nabulsi has appealed to the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Nabulsi told CNN in April the sheikh turned on him after he expressed concern over the Afghan's treatment. Later, he was arrested on drug charges, and security officers working for the sheikh ransacked his home and demanded the torture video. But the tape -- shot by Nabulsi's brother at the order of the sheikh, he said -- had already been smuggled out of the country. Nabulsi said he was arrested, jailed and ultimately convicted on drug charges -- and was tortured and humiliated by UAE police, who demanded he return the tape. Al-Mulla said Sunday Nabulsi was sentenced to five years in jail in absentia, agreeing that he was responsible for the drugging of the sheikh. Prosecutors will attempt to implement the sentence through Interpol, he said. CNN's Caroline Faraj, Stan Grant and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Sheikh acquitted Sunday of charges linked to videotaped torture of Afghan grain dealer .

"Rome (CNN) -- A Swiss man sentenced in an Italian court to a 16-year prison term in absentia over deaths of about 2,000 workers who prosecutors said were exposed to asbestos will appeal the ruling, his lawyer said Tuesday. Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss owner of the fiber-cement firm Eternit, was sentenced Monday alongside Belgian former executive and investor Jean Louis Marie Ghislain de Cartier de Marchienne. The pair were accused of failing to protect workers in the company's four Italian factories before they were shuttered in 1986. Schmidheiny's lawyer, Astolfo Di Amato, told CNN Tuesday that his client did not accept the sentence handed down by the court in Turin, an industrial hub in northwestern Italy. ""The sentence is certainly a setback, we lost the first battle. (It's) a defeat that we don't accept and we will present an appeal,"" the lawyer said. He said Schmidheiny had invested large sums in the 1970s in restructuring the plants' production process and had never set foot in Italy. ""The sentence is dangerous because if in Italy we affirm the principle that the major shareholder of a multinational company is responsible for what happens in each peripheral plant, no one will invest in Italy any longer,"" he said. Schmidheiny and De Cartier were also ordered to pay a total of â‚¬80 million ($105 million) to more than 6,000 people, including former workers and residents who lived near their plants. Bruno Pesce, the leader of Italy's asbestos victims association, said more than 1,500 people attended Monday's hearing -- including some who were suffering from asbestos-linked illnesses. ""It was a very emotional moment,"" Pesce said. ""People were crying because of tension and then of happiness."" Renato Balduzzi, Italy's health minister, called the sentence ""historic."" The Italian Eternit company was declared bankrupt in 1986, when the Italian plants were shut down, and the company's ownership changed in the 1990s. A spokesman for the Swiss Eternit company, Balts Livio, said it was independent from the Italian firm of the same name. ""Neither Eternit (Schweiz) AG nor its owner had or have any relationship with Eternit S.p.A., Genoa, and thus with the subject of the criminal proceedings in Turin,"" Livio said. Asbestos was once widely used as a fireproofing material and was included in roof shingles and siding for decades. Though now banned in Italy and most Western countries, asbestos is still used in developing countries, mainly in China and India. Exposure to its tiny fibers, particularly over a period of time, can lead to asbestos-related diseases that include lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, according to the National Institutes for Health.","Stephan Schmidheiny will appeal his sentence in an Italian court, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- If you feed your pet a jerky treat and it gets sick or dies, the Food and Drug Administration wants to hear from you. The agency says it has reports of more than 3,600 dogs and 10 cats that got sick after eating jerky pet treats over the past six years and 580 of those pets have died. The FDA isn't naming any particular brand, but says the animals mostly ate a chicken or duck jerky treat or a jerky-wrapped treat. The FDA has already tested 1,200 samples without discovering the exact cause of any illnesses. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, a lack of appetite and sluggishness. ""Most of the jerky treats implicated have been made in China,"" the FDA said on its website. If a pet gets sick after eating such treats, the FDA wants owners to keep the leftover treats for 60 days in case it wants a sample, and veterinarians should report any jerky treat-related cases. ""This is one of the most elusive and mysterious outbreaks we've encountered,"" said Bernadette Dunham, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. The FDA is not recommending that owners stop feeding the treats to their pets, but they should watch their pets closely if they continue to give them jerky treats. The agency says dogs and cats can do without treats, since they should not be part of an animal's balanced diet.","The FDA says it's received reports of thousands of pets getting sick .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Born and raised in the Philippines to a businessman and a socialite model, Monique Lhuillier is today one of LA's most celebrated fashion designers, with a clientele that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Kristen Stewart, Reese Witherspoon, and Scarlett Johansson. A graduate of LA's Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, Lhuillier began designing wedding gowns while shopping for one for herself. She launched her first bridal collection in 1996 and today, her atelier also produces ready-to-wear evening gowns, linens and tableware, fine paper and home fragrances. Her dresses, which sell for $1,500 to $16,000, are stocked at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue and, in a few months, she will open a flagship store -- her third outlet -- and a new showroom in New York City. Lhuillier's average day is spent convening with her design team, monitoring the progress of licensing deals and conducting fittings, overseeing PR and production, making visits to her LA flagship store and her factory. At night, after her two children are in bed, Lhuillier often attends functions too. Here, she tells CNN about building a business from scratch, working with celebrities, and having a husband for a CEO. On early ambition ... Ever since I was a little girl, I always loved fashion. I would watch my mother get dressed and suggest things she should wear. When my parents used to entertain, I would come out and perform after dinner with my little outfits that were cut up and restyled. I always thought I was going to be a dancer and then fashion kind of took over. Every young girl goes through that stage, but it didn't stop. I would go and sketch with our local tailor in the Philippines. On breaking into bridal as a bride ... When I looked at what was out there, I felt that there was a lack of fashionable options for young women so I said, 'This is what I want to do: I want to start with wedding gowns'. I was 23 years old. My husband [Tom] was like 'it's a phase.' We got married and six months later I came up with a small line of wedding dresses -- probably six of them. I went to a local trade show and had a little booth and showed my dresses and to my excitement and delight, five stores ordered pieces from me. We drove home and I realized that I actually had to make everything. On getting established ... The first year, people could barely say my name. They were like 'Monique L ... that Monique girl.' Then after a year or three, they were saying 'Monique Lu-yay' and I was like, 'Well, something's happening.' On her point of difference ... I had not worked for a storied house before, so I had to prove myself from the very beginning. I followed my gut and was always putting myself in the shoes of the ladies I was designing for. 'Would I want to wear that? Would I feel special in that? Would that flatter my figure?' Since we started in bridal, I really perfected the fit. I think, you know, that was the key to why so many women responded to it. On making the old feel new ... I do three bridal collections a year, and what's been helpful is that I do ready-to-wear in between, so when I approach bridal, I'm ready for whites and ivories again. Before, there was a point where I was like 'I can't do one more white wedding dress.' I'm injecting new color. There's blush: That's so subtle, yet it's a big commitment to go outside white and ivory. That's a trend I've been pushing for the last two seasons and now brides are embracing it. Another trend I started five years ago was adding a sash and introducing color that way. On designing for celebrities ... [It's a] platform for the world to see what my work looks like and they showcase it beautifully. They're trendsetters and that's such a positive -- to get that exposure. The downside is you don't have all the control. Sometimes when they put something on, they change the design a little bit to make it their own and our point of view is lost along the way. I love working with Taylor Swift. Kristen Stewart has been amazing. Reese Witherspoon was a dream to work with on her wedding because she knew what she wanted and has a great sense of style. It was a very easy collaboration. On having a CEO/husband ... It's hard to keep family life and workplace separated. We always say we do but we don't. When you're married to your business partner, it's very hard. I always make sure his needs are met. We bounce ideas off of each other and he is my soul mate. Yes, everybody needs to work on their marriage but I feel like he is really an extension of me. I don't know what I would do without him. On work-life balance ... I realized when we were starting our company that you have to give up everything, personally, in the very beginning. There's no balance at that point. It's all about work. The first 10 years we worked almost 24 hours (a day). I mean, obviously we slept, but if we were not in the factory doing something, we were travelling, doing trunk shows, selling the collection. We did everything and I don't think there's any other way to start. I am a perfectionist but I know how to live life. When I 'm working, it's 100%. When I'm with my friends, I put everything away and enjoy life. When I come home to my kids, it's pure joy and everything's worth it. Every time, I really focus 100 percent on one thing. I've learned how to juggle my life and I feel like now I have the perfect balance. On how to live a good life ... I don't know what tomorrow brings, but right now, I'm grateful for everything that I have. In the future, I'd like to be able to give back as well. That's part of how I think one's life should be led -- start with a career, then have a beautiful family, and then it's time to give back. That's just the way the world should be. On delegating ... That's the only way to grow so we're building our team and we do delegate but we never turn off our Blackberries or iPhones.","Monique Lhuillier is one of Hollywood's favorite fashion designers .

"(CNN) -- In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 2009, a gunshot rang out that resonated around the country. At 22, Bay Area resident Oscar Grant was fatally shot by a transit police officer at the Fruitvale train station in Oakland, California, after being detained with other passengers on the platform following reports of a fight. Grant was unarmed, and the incident sparked waves of protests in the months that followed. The incident is chronicled in ""Fruitvale Station,"" an independent film, scheduled for release on July 12, that tells the story of the last day of Grant's life. For the film's first-time director, Ryan Coogler, the motivation to tell ""Fruitvale Station"" was deeply personal. ""If Oscar were alive today, he'd be the same age as me right now, he'd be 27,"" Coogler, who grew up in the Bay Area, told CNN at the movie's New York premiere. ""When it happened, it really affected me. That's also something that I deal with on a day-to-day basis, losing friends to gun violence. I've seen lives cut short too soon."" He adds, ""What gets glossed over is that we're human beings too, like everybody else, young African-American males. Our humanity can often be found in our relationships with the people who are closest to us, and those relations aren't often shown in headlines and whatever types of media you see us portrayed in. I hope the people can see a little bit of themselves in the character if they sit down and watch the film, and have a little bit of insight."" Court upholds conviction in California subway shooting . The issue of young lives being cut off violently and unnecessarily early is what drew notable cast members Michael B. Jordan and Octavia Spencer to the film. Jordan can easily recall the 2009 Fruitvale station shooting, and he told CNN he feels a sense of responsibility to revive Grant's legacy. ""The opportunity for me to play Oscar Grant, I mean I just had to jump at it. I felt a serious responsibility to play that role,"" Jordan said. ""Especially for the family, knowing one day his daughter's going to watch this movie, and his mom, and the rest of his family and friends. I just want to do him justice."" To Spencer, the story of Grant's death is representative of an ongoing societal problem. ""Sadly, (this is) very topical ... we're losing way too many young men of color to this type of violence,"" she told CNN, comparing the case to the more recent Trayvon Martin shooting in February 2012. ""And then of course there's urban violence; so we have to start somewhere with the conversation."" To the Oscar-winner, the root of the problem lies in a lack of understanding between people of different races and backgrounds. The solution to curbing the violence, she believes, is in increased awareness and understanding. ""It actually starts with the individual. What is your response when you see someone different?"" she said. ""Your inner dialogue has to change, my inner dialogue has to change."" Bay Area transit officers cleared in civil rights trial . Spencer reportedly donated and raised money for ""Fruitvale Station"" when the film hit a funding plateau. The movie debuted at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award for U.S. dramatic film. It went on to win the award for Best First Film at the Cannes Film Festival. ""I think when people see this film, they will see that all of these young men are ... they're human lives being lost,"" Spencer said.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Four countries, including Pakistan, were elected Friday to join the UN Security Council in January as nonpermanent members for two-year terms. Also elected, via secret ballot, were Guatemala, Morocco and Togo. In a race for the fifth Security Council seat, Azerbaijan and Slovenia went 10 rounds of voting with no decision Friday night. Azerbaijan built some momentum but was 14 votes short of qualifying for the seat. The battle will resume Monday . This will be the seventh time Pakistan has served on the council and the fourth time it will serve alongside longtime rival India. The council could be a crucial testing ground over the next two years for Pakistan's strained relationship with the United States. ""We hope to play our usual role of taking on matters which affect the underdog, so as to speak,"" Pakistani Ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said. With regard to India, Haroon said that both countries ""have been beneficial in starting dialogue"" and avoiding ""usual tendencies."" Manjeev Singh Puri, India's deputy ambassador to the UN, embraced Haroon after the vote and said that he warmly welcomed the election of Pakistan. ""Pakistan and India share common perception on so many global issues, and we look forward to working with them,"" Singh Puri said. Starting in January, the council will have as members seven of the nine nations known to have nuclear weapons: China, France, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. Absent will be Israel and North Korea. Guatemala will serve on the council for the first time after a failed 2006 bid. That race, against Venezuela, lasted three weeks and 48 rounds of voting, the third-longest in UN history. Guatemala and Venezuela ultimately agreed to drop out of the race, and Panama was elected in their place. Countries are voted onto the Security Council by all 193 UN member nations. Election day transforms the General Assembly Hall into a veritable schoolhouse, with countries exchanging small gifts in an attempt to curry last-minute favor. Hungary, whose bid to sit on the Security Council failed, handed out Rubik's Cubes, which were invented by a Hungarian architect. Leaving the council will be Brazil, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Gabon, Lebanon and Nigeria.","Secret balloting also picks Guatemala, Morocco, Togo .

"PANAMA CITY, Panama (CNN)  -- Panama's director of the National Cultural Institute was killed when he got caught in the middle of a shootout between robbers and security guards, the government reported. Panamanian President Martin Torrijos has vowed to find the culprits and bring them to justice. A security guard and an assailant also were killed and two suspects were wounded in Tuesday's attack, La Estrella newspaper said. Two would-be robbers escaped, the newspaper said on its Web site. Culture Minister Anel Omar Rodriguez had just stepped out of his car in front of the national lottery headquarters when four men and a woman got out of a sport utility vehicle and started shooting at a private armored truck, La Estrella said. He was hit by a stray bullet in the crossfire. A visibly moved President Martin Torrijos, who called Rodriguez ""a friend and a great Panamanian,"" arrived at the scene after the shooting and tried to console the the official's family. ""The pain that we share with his family is the pain that we share with Panamanian families each time a violent incident fills us with mourning and suffering,"" Torrijos said on his Web page. Torrijos vowed to find the culprits and bring them to justice. ""We are not going to lose this fight against delinquency,"" Torrijos said on his Web site. One of the two wounded suspects was taken to San Miguel Arcangel Hospital, where people believed to be fellow gang members unsuccessfully tried to rescue him, La Estrella newspaper said. The other suspect was taken to a different hospital. Opposition presidential candidate Balbina Herrera blamed the shootout on criminals who have invaded Panama, saying that immigration controls must be strengthened and that Mexicans and Colombians should have visas to enter the country, La Estrella said. ""We must stop the spiral of violence before it is too late,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. Panama will hold its presidential election in May. Rodriguez, a former Panamanian ambassador to Cuba, left behind a wife and four children, La Estrella said.

"(CNN) -- Iran has received the first part of its $4.2 billion in oil funds that had been frozen overseas due to sanctions, the country's state-run Press TV reported. In November, Iran and six world powers reached an interim deal under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions. The six world powers, called the P5+1, include the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Britain, China, Russia and France -- as well as Germany . According to the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency, the first installment amounts to $550 million. CNN was trying to reach representatives of the P5+1 countries for confirmation Sunday. The deal . As part of the temporary, six-month deal reached in November, world powers agreed to suspend sanctions on items such as gold and petrochemical exports. That suspension would provide Iran with about $1.5 billion in revenue, according to the U.S. White House. Iran, meanwhile, must dilute its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20%, halt all enrichment above 5% and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that enrichment. The 5% enrichment level is well below the level needed to make nuclear weapons. The Iranian regime has insisted it is using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only. But many countries have been skeptical, and Canada has decided to keep its sanctions against Iran in pace. ""People of #Iran deserve freedom & prosperity denied them by regime's nuclear ambitions,"" Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird tweeted after the November deal. ""Until then, Canadian sanctions remain in full force."" Iran has stumbled from one economic crisis to the next under the sanctions, with unemployment topping 20%. But because the deal is temporary, it remains unclear what the world powers might offer -- and demand of -- Iran in the future. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Six world powers agreed to lift some sanctions against Iran in November .

"(CNN) -- A car bomb exploded on a busy shopping street in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh 10 years ago Friday -- the single deadliest attack in the 30-year conflict between Roman Catholics and Protestants. A memorial has been built for the 29 people killed and 300 injured in the Omagh bombing. The blast killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and wounded more than 300. It occurred at the tail-end of the bloody period known as the Troubles, which lasted from the late 1960s to late 1990s. It was also four months after the signing of the Good Friday peace accord -- which ushered in a new era in the region despite the continuation of some fighting. The 500-pound bomb struck on a busy summer Saturday when people were out shopping on the main street in the market town. The attackers called in a bomb threat but gave police the wrong location for the bomb, leading authorities to evacuate people from the center of town to the end of the street, right where the bomb went off.  Watch a family remember child killed in bombing » . Local authorities plan a 45-minute service Friday with prayers and singing to commemorate the anniversary. They plan a moment of silence at 3:10 p.m. (10:10 a.m. ET), the time the bomb exploded on August 15, 1998. ""All I can remember is going up. I went up and I came down and I hit something very, very hard,"" says Doreen Preston, who lost her right leg and two fingers of her right hand in the bombing. ""A soldier told me I hit the footpath. But as far as I was concerned, I thought I hit a telegraph pole 'cause all I could see was sparks and [the] smell of rubber."" Preston was working at Watterson's, a drapery and linen shop on the high street along with her best friend, Veda Short. They had worked together at the shop for 26 years, along with friends Geraldine Breslin and Anne McCombe. As police evacuated people from the area, the women were herded along with others to the spot where the bomb went off. Preston was the only one of the women to survive. ""I looked down and I could see Anne's skirt, and I thought, 'Oh, poor Anne's been injured, too,'"" Preston said. ""I thought, 'Where's the rest of the girls?' And they weren't -- I couldn't see anybody."" Preston spent more than four months in the hospital, at times so close to death that she planned the hymns for her own funeral, Preston said. She described anguish at learning her friends were killed. ""I miss them terribly,"" Preston said. ""Veda was like a sister to me."" The Real IRA, a dissident republican paramilitary group, claimed responsibility for the bombing. The Real IRA opposed the peace plan, which had the cooperation of the mainstream IRA, or Irish Republican Army. Only one man, Colm Murphy, was ever convicted in the bombing, but his conviction for plotting the attack was overturned and a retrial is pending. A second man, Sean Hoey, was brought to trial, but a judge ruled last December there was not enough evidence to convict him. Families of the victims have said they are angry that so many people who must have had a part in the bombing -- from the scouts and plotters to the bombmakers -- are still free.  Watch a survivor tell her story » . ""I think there is a lot more information,"" said Michael Gallagher, whose 19-year-old son Aiden was killed in the bombing. ""I think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation."" Survivors have waged their own fight to get over the physical and emotional scars from that day. ""My father said, and I do believe his words, there's a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it,"" said Preston, who has wondered why she was spared. ""That's quite true, 'cause it's [been] proved. 'Cause all those people round me were all taken and I was saved. But in saying that, it was a hard fight, a very hard fight.""","Omagh bombing killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins .

"(CNN) -- Singapore was shrouded in haze on Wednesday as smoke from forest fires in nearby Sumatra drifted across the Malacca Strait in the city's worst pollution crisis in more than a decade. Buildings in the city of 5.3 million people have been enveloped in a smoky haze since the beginning of the week as illegal burn off in nearby Indonesia and prevailing winds were causing a smoke crisis not seen since 1997. Interactive: See the smog descend on Singapore . Singapore's pollution index reached 371 on Wednesday, the worst level since 1997 when it reached 226, according to the Straits Times. The city's National Environment Agency said air quality becomes 'very unhealthy' when the index passes 200. The agency said that thick haze would continue for the next few days as forest fires were still raging in Sumatra. Singapore's Environment and Water Resources Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said he would urge commercial pressure against firms causing the haze. Critics have accused Singapore and Malaysian palm oil companies of investing in Indonesian companies that are clearing land for palm plantations. Dr Balakrishnan said on his Facebook site that he had approached his Indonesian counterpart, Balthasar Kambuaya, to express his ""deep distress"" at the situation. ""I suggested Minister Kambuaya name the companies responsible for the fires,"" Dr Balakrishnan posted on the site. Singapore residents, meanwhile, could be seen around the central business district wearing facemasks or handkerchiefs. ""I can say it's actually getting worse,"" a Singapore-based energy industry analyst who did not want to be named told CNN. ""The staff are taking pictures out of the office window because you can't see the cruise ship terminal which is only 500 metres away."" He said for three days the city has been under a pall of wood smoke that gave Singapore's normally highly urban central business district the smell of a campfire. ""It gives off this smoky smell like you've been sitting a bit too close to the hearth,"" he said. ""Whoever would have thought that I'd be going to Hong Kong for a weekend simply to get a breath of fresh air."" Authorities in Singapore are anxious to avoid a repeat of the 1997 Southeast Asian haze which the government estimates cost $9 billion in health care costs and disrupted air travel and business.","Singapore enveloped in a thick pall of wood smoke caused by forest fires in Sumatra .

"(CNN) -- A U.N. special investigator called for the resignation of top Kenyan officials and sweeping changes in the country's security forces to end reported widespread killings by police across the African nation. The report urged President Mwai Kibaki to publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending the killings. ""The special rapporteur concluded that police in Kenya frequently execute individuals and that a climate of impunity prevails,"" Philip Alston said in a report a recently submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. ""Most troubling is the existence of police death squads operating on the orders of senior police officials and charged with eliminating suspected leaders and members of criminal organizations."" The report calls for the resignation of Kenya's attorney general and the immediate replacement of the police commissioner. It also says Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki should publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending unlawful killings by the police. The Kenyan government expressed its ""deep displeasure"" with the report, questioning the special investigator's ""approach, conduct and method of work."" ""The government expresses grave concern regarding the allegations contained in the report by the special rapporteur,"" said Alfred Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government. ""His questioning of the very basis of the Kenyan state and, in particular, its institutions is totally unacceptable and impinges on Kenya's sovereignty."" Alston also accused government security forces of torturing and killing hundreds of men in a March 2008 crackdown on a militia in the Mt. Elgon district, in western Kenya. And he said there was compelling evidence that what he called police death squads were operating in Nairobi and Central Province with a mandate to ""exterminate"" suspected Mungiki gang members. ""These are not ""rogue"" squads, but police who are acting on the explicit orders of their superiors,"" he said. The Mungiki militia, which is loyal to Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe, began as a religious sect, but over the years has morphed into a gang that runs protection rackets -- particularly in the slums. The U.N. investigator suggested Kibaki acknowledge the alleged police killings and commit to stop them. He also advocated creating an independent civilian police oversight body, and said the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should investigate violence after the 2007 election. He urged the government to create a witness protection program as well. Alston, who investigates human-rights problems around the world for the United Nations, traveled to Kenya at the government's invitation. He stayed for 10 days in mid-February while 100 interviews were conducted in the U.N. member nation. There is hope for Kenya despite his criticism, Alston said. ""While the existing situation is bad, it is far from intractable,"" the report says. ""If it so chooses, Kenya can significantly reduce the prevalence of unlawful killings.""","Report: Police death squads operate on the orders of senior officials .

"(CNN) -- In a case that has captured international attention, two of Saudi Arabia's most prominent human rights activists were each sentenced on Saturday to at least 10 years in prison, Saudi activists report. They had been found guilty earlier Saturday of providing inaccurate information to foreign media, founding and operating an unlicensed human rights organization, as well as other offenses. Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid, co-founders of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, had been on trial since last year. The high-profile case has garnered widespread criticism from international rights groups that have said the charges against the men were politically motivated. Saudi activists say kingdom trying to silence them . Al-Qahtani was sentenced to 10 years in prison, as well as given a 10-year travel ban, Saudi activists said. He was ordered arrested after the verdict was issued. Al-Hamid was sentenced to five years in prison as well as being ordered to serve an additional six years from a previous prison sentence of which he had been pardoned by Saudi King Abdullah in 2006. Al-Hamid was given an additional five-year travel ban and also ordered arrested after the verdict was issued. Abdulaziz Al-Shubaily is a member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, and he said he attended Saturday's session at criminal court in Riyadh, the capital. He told CNN the courtroom was packed, ""full of journalists, activists, as well as a heavy security presence."" Al-Qahtani, a 46-year-old economics professor, faced nine charges, including breaking allegiance to the Saudi king, describing Saudi Arabia as a police state and turning people and international bodies against the kingdom. Al-Hamid faced similar charges, including spreading chaos, questioning the authority of official clerics and undermining public order. In an interview with CNN in January, Al-Qahtani called the accusations against him and Al-Hamid nonsense, saying he knows why he and Al-Hamid were really put on trial -- that they had stoked the ire of the kingdom for running an activist group that is trying to expose human rights violations there. ""We have a number of cases where people are thrown in prison arbitrarily, torture, forced disappearances. ... Whatever rights abuses (you could think of), you could find in Saudi Arabia,"" Al-Qahtani said. According to rights groups, Saudi authorities have been increasingly targeting activists through the courts and travel bans. Tamara Al-Rifai, spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa Division, told CNN in January, ""This has been a systematic approach by the authorities in Saudi Arabia -- namely, the targeting and harassing of activists across the country."" Al-Rifai explained that accusations against activists generally include ""instigating chaos, gathering illegally, harming the reputation, talking to foreigners, talking to the media, etc."" She said there is no clear criminal law in Saudi Arabia and that people ""are being arbitrarily arrested and detained for exercising rights that are stipulated by all international human rights laws, but also the Arab Charter of Human Rights, to which Saudi Arabia has adhered."" In June, Amnesty International issued a statement calling Al-Qahtani's trial ""just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom's human rights activists."" Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry for comment. When asked in January about the case and about accusations that Saudi Arabia is cracking down on dissent, Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, told CNN, ""At the Interior Ministry, our area of responsibility is security."" ""My understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now,"" Added Al-Turki. ""Nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts."" Also known by the acronym ACRPA, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, founded in 2009, reported on human rights violations and attempts to help relatives of political prisoners free their loved ones through lawsuits against the government. Despite repeated attempts to obtain an operating license, the Saudi government did not give them one. In December 2010, ACPRA called for all Saudis to participate in a public sit-in to demand political reform. The sit-in was canceled, as the ministry of interior told the organizers their request was refused. In January 2012, ACPRA crossed one of the country's ultimate red lines by being openly critical of Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry and demanding the interior minister be prosecuted for human rights violations. They've also circulated petitions for the release of Saudis they believe are political prisoners. ""After the verdicts were issued, we're worried,"" said Al-Shubaily on Saturday. ""As activists, we were worried before, now we're much more worried."" Al-Shubaily went on to explain that while ACPRA has now been ordered disbanded, human rights activists in the kingdom will continue to try to do their work.","Saudi activists who attended Saturday court hearing report sentence .

"(CNN) -- Four men are accused of stealing more than $1 million worth of jewelry across three states, including more than $700,000 in Cartier watches, charges that carry decades-long sentences, authorities said Wednesday. Authorities identified the suspects as Allen Williams, 35, Roberto Grant, 33, Terrell Ratliff, 22, and Tyrone Dehoyos, 35. They are accused of stealing high-end jewelry from locations such as Cartier in New York City, the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Schwarzschild's Jewelers in Richmond, Virginia, from July 2013 through January 2014, according to court papers. The men were charged in federal court with conspiracy to commit robbery in interstate commerce -- a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, authorities said. The defendants also face related interstate robbery charges that each carry the same 20-year maximum sentence. Dehoyos, who was arrested Tuesday, was being held without bail. The other defendants have not appeared in court. According to authorities, the heists occurred in similar fashion: The robbers allegedly scouted the targeted stores to map the layout. Then, they allegedly ""(terrorized) customers and employees by smashing display cases with hammers and stealing high-end timepieces,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in statement. The robbers escaped in getaway vehicles driven by accomplices. The robberies sometimes turned violent, according to court documents. On one occasion, the men used a stun-gun to ""subdue a female employee"" in a Virginia jewelry store before stealing more than $100,000 worth of merchandise. ""They will now face the consequences of their violent shopping spree,"" Bharara said. Grant and Williams were arrested on January 30 after FBI and New York Police Department officers caught them wearing Cartier watches that matched those stolen earlier the same day from the Cartier store in Manhattan. The attorney for Dehoyos did not immediately return CNN's request for comment. It was unclear whether the three other defendants have legal representation as of Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Carbon monoxide, a silent killer, is being blamed in the weekend death of a restaurant manager at a Long Island Mall. Twenty-seven people, including seven first responders, were taken to the hospital. In another weekend incident, seven people at the Falls Motel in Ogunquit, Maine, were taken to hospitals after complaining of nausea and headaches. Responders found high levels of the deadly gas. Earlier this month, a carbon monoxide leak at Baltimore hotel sent nine to the hospital. And last year, three people died two months apart in the same North Carolina motel room. Here's what you need to know about carbon monoxide: . 1. It has no odor, color or taste . You wouldn't be able to see or smell it, but it can be very dangerous to your health and even fatal. In the Long Island incident, police and emergency crews rushed to Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York, on Saturday night after reports that a woman had collapsed in the basement of Legal Sea Foods. Once they arrived, they felt dizzy as well and determined that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning, said police in Suffolk County, New York. In the Maine incident, readings found 300 parts per million for carbon monoxide. Anything about 35 parts per million is dangerous. 2. If there's a leak, there's a reason to worry . According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, sources of carbon monoxide could include unvented gas space heaters, leaking furnaces or automobile exhaust in garages. In the Long Island case, investigators found a leak in the flue pipe of the water heater at Legal Sea Foods, a spokesman for the town of Huntington said. The pipe is supposed to carry gas from the water heater to the outside. Instead, the leak in the pipe caused the gas to build up in the basement of the restaurant. In the Maine incident, a furnace was to blame. 3. It diminishes your ability to absorb oxygen . If there's too much carbon monoxide in the air you're breathing, you can't take in as much oxygen as you need. This can result in serious tissue damage. In the Legal Sea Foods incident, the manager, Steven Nelson, 55, was found in the restaurant basement and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. In the Maine incident, 21 people complained of symptoms and seven were taken to hospitals. More than 400 Americans die every year from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it is responsible for more than 20,000 people visiting the emergency room annually. 4. Its symptoms are often mistaken for something else . In circumstances where carbon monoxide problems slowly develop, victims may mistake their symptoms for the flu. When carbon monoxide levels are higher and develop more rapidly, mental confusion can set in rapidly. Victims may lose muscle control and will probably succumb to poisoning if they are not rescued. ""If you're lucky, you'll get the symptoms and realize something is wrong. A lot of times people just fall asleep and don't wake up,"" said Bob Bernard, a paramedic with Ogunquit Fire Department, who responded to the Maine hotel call. 5. It can be detected . You can take several precautions to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Chief among them is installing a carbon monoxide alarm in the hallway near every area of your home that is used for sleeping. The Legal Seafood restaurant didn't have a carbon monoxide detector -- because New York law doesn't require them in restaurants; only in places where people sleep, said Huntington town officials. Said Legal Sea Foods CEO Roger Berkowitz, ""We always assume there is something in place but the reality is there isn't anything in place, this is a sad wake up call for everyone."" The Falls Motel in Maine didn't have carbon monoxide detectors in the rooms, authorities said. Maine law requires them.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Cars skidded around me, left and right. An 18-wheeler spun its tires and started smoking. Drivers of other big rigs slammed their accelerators to the floor, trying to get their loads moving across the snow and ice that paralyzed Atlanta Tuesday. I was surrounded by all this, hoping my mini-SUV wouldn't lose control -- and that none of the other vehicles slithering around in this whirlwind would slam into me. I have a wife and four kids to get home to. She and my two older children are recovering from the flu. There were no rooms available in the hotels by CNN downtown, so I left at about 3 p.m. Tuesday for the 23-mile ride to my house in Marietta, a suburb north of the city. It usually takes half an hour. After nine hours, I was only halfway home. So I stopped, waiting for the traffic to ease. When noon Wednesday came -- 21 hours after my journey began -- it became clear that ""home"" was more a wish than a realistic goal. I turned around and made my way back to the CNN Center, where I will wait out the rest of this mess. I've never experienced anything like this, anywhere in the world. Stretches of Interstate 75 looked like a vehicle graveyard. People abandoned their cars -- in some cases on the shoulder, but in others right in the middle of the highway. Some couldn't move in the snow and ice. Others ran out of gas. And some drivers just gave up -- at a certain point, when you're that exhausted, staying behind the wheel is too dangerous. Sure, it was boring to be stuck in your car barely moving all that time, but you weren't bored -- because you had to be alert the whole time, for your own safety and that of everyone around you. The snowstorm was a great equalizer. It didn't matter if you had a late model Mustang or a beater van or a Brinks armored car. Your wheels were still spinning fruitlessly on the ice, along with everybody else. Stranded drivers tell their stories . The unexpected voices of commuters talking and walking between cars added to the eeriness. There were also signs of people assisting each other. Good Samaritans helped walkers back up after a fall on the ice. Others helped push cars whose tires squealed with effort to grip the road. On the other hand, there were drivers who wouldn't lift a finger to aid anyone if it meant giving up an inch. At one particularly gridlocked stretch, many people left their cars and walked to a nearby CVS for supplies. You were suddenly in the ""in"" crowd if you held your plastic shopping bag and its treasures like a designer handbag while trying not to bust your ass on the ice. I found myself looking hungrily at those bags, craving anything to eat. I was exhausted. I had been at work since 6 a.m. I decided to get off at the next exit, Northside Parkway. I thought that was a smart call. But it turned out to be a big mistake. There was even more ice! Here, people were spinning all over the place. I was convinced I would be next. Then, the car next to me couldn't move. Its tires were spinning. So suddenly, a tiny gap opened for me to move. I decided to take that as a sign. I inched my way across the road and into the parking lot of a Taco Bell, which was open overnight. Thankfully, there were still parking spots left. My 2-year-old had played with my wallet a couple of days ago, and now I can't find my ATM card. Coincidence? Perhaps. Anyway, I had exactly $5. So I asked what was the most food I could get for that. They gave me some kind of combo -- a taco, burrito, and quesadilla. And a fruit punch. I had to get some shut-eye. Benefit to having a messy car: Rummaging through the trunk, I found some clothes which I managed to fashion into a pillow. So I headed back to my car, turned on the heat full blast and, when it was warm enough, turned off the car and fell asleep. I woke up when it got too cold and repeated the process a few times through the night. Fortunately, my wife had filled up the car just the day before. That made all the difference. At around 4:30 Wednesday morning, the streets were still filled with stopped cars. And Taco Bell was still filled with people. I walked inside to use the restroom. There were children inside, which broke my heart a bit. One was a toddler. When I walked back outside, I saw a father cradling his infant in the driver's seat. Minutes later, the lights in the parking lot went out and the restaurant closed up, so everyone had to leave. I fantasized that when the sun came up the traffic would be moving. Ha! As the sun rose, the first thing I could see was its reflection -- on a seemingly endless line of stationary cars in the road. A woman in another car near mine told me there was a Caribou Coffee open around the corner. That news came as a relief. It made my day. I spent a chunk of my morning there. Even though the store had just a limited amount of food, the longest line was not for the cashier, but for the bathrooms. I saw an employee enter those bathrooms more than once with a plunger. My thoughts are with everyone who braved the traffic and suffered through the entire night and the morning, and with those who helped them. The stories I'm hearing from my neighborhood are all about abandoned cars and inaccessible roads. So tonight, I will make a different choice-- I will lay my head down on a cot in my office and watch videos of my kids playing in the snow.

"(CNN) -- The Queen has invited the Middleton Family to Sandringham for Christmas, or so the British newspaper headlines recently declared. Oh, that it were true if only because Richard Palmer, royal reporter for Britain's Daily Express, tweeted that if Carole Middleton, the mother of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, emerged alongside the Queen and drove to church, he'd cartwheel naked down the path. Lucky for Richard -- and dare I say even luckier for us -- it's highly unlikely. Invitations to Christmas are never extended to the families of royal spouses and why should they be? Nothing personal, simply that Christmas provides an opportunity for the Queen to enjoy quality time with her own immediate family with no expectation of being on parade. Well, that and the issue of space. Large as Sandringham might be, it is a house, not a castle. When the whole family is in attendance, there just isn't room for anyone else. The Royal Family has Christmas down to a science, and the Queen's festive plans are as reliable as television airings of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and my inadvertently cooking the turkey upside down. It's the same every year. Since the fire at Windsor Castle in 1992, the royal family has gathered to celebrate Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen's privately-owned Norfolk estate. Following arrivals on Christmas Eve, afternoon tea is served. The evening brings a fancy black-tie dinner, and the opening of presents -- a German tradition embraced by Queen Victoria when she married Prince Albert. After breakfast on Christmas morning, it's church, lunch, a huddle around the television to watch the Queen's Christmas message to the nation, a country walk, and an evening of parlor games. It is an occasion steeped in familiar tradition and protocol for the Windsors, but for the inexperienced newbie it's enough to make you want to double-spike your eggnog. Sandringham is the Queen's house, and therefore as the Lady of the Manor invitations are at her discretion. She has consistently been open to change and has adapted to the times accordingly. During her reign she has opened Buckingham Palace to the public, made the royal finances more transparent, made walkabouts the norm, signed the Commonwealth Charter, and she was the first reigning monarch to visit the Republic of Ireland since Irish independence. Christmas, however, is one area where change is unlikely. The Queen is not obligated in any way to the extended families of either her children or her grandchildren. The Middletons may well be the grandparents of the future king, but so too were Earl Spencer and Frances Shand Kydd, yet that didn't see either of them swilling sherry and pulling crackers over the Queen's Christmas goose. Were the Queen to invite the Middleton family, it would in turn pave the way for other in-laws to attend. Camilla's children haven't spent Christmas with their mother since she married Charles in 2005. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie haven't celebrated Christmas with their mum since their parents' divorce in 1996. The list goes on and therein lies the quandary. Invite the Middletons, and suddenly Christmas becomes a free-for-all ""plus one."" Last year, with the Queen's blessing, William and Kate chose to spend Christmas with Kate's family in Bucklebury, Berkshire. While alternating families for the holidays is the standard festive headache for us regular folk, it was an unprecedented decision for the Sandringham lot. By doing something different William and Kate effectively changed the model of a royal family Christmas. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh enjoy a relaxed relationship with Michael and Carole Middleton. Before the royal wedding the Queen asked them to lunch at Windsor Castle. In June 2012 they were invited to sail on the Elizabethan paddle steamer during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant, and they joined other members of the royal family in the Queen's official carriage procession to Royal Ascot in 2011 and 2012. She has already publicly embraced the Middleton family far more than she has the family of any other royal spouse. William and Kate are the new owners of Anmer Hall, a property on the Sandringham estate, but it is currently being renovated, so there's no room at the inn for the Middletons there. Even if it were ready, I don't see William and Kate leaving her family at home while they swan off to the ""big house."" Every family celebrates Christmas in their own unique way, and the Middletons would never presume to be included in the royals' personal festivities, nor would the Queen, Philip, Charles and Camilla expect to load the corgis and a fruitcake into the Range Rover and head down to Bucklebury. There is no slight, no malice, no scandal here, rather a wish to preserve the elements of sacred family Christmas. In that way, the royals are ""just like us."" Looks like Richard will be keeping his clothes on this year after all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victoria Arbiter.","Some newspapers suggest Queen will invite Middletons to Sandringham for Christmas .
Victoria Arbiter says such an offer would break with all royal traditions .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Salma Hayek's brother was driving a car that crashed Sunday, killing a passenger, police said. Sami Hayek, 40, suffered several broken ribs and a cut to his head, while the 20-year-old driver of a pickup that collided with Hayek's sports car was left with a broken foot, a Los Angeles police statement said Monday. A 43-year-old man from Mexico who was riding in the passenger seat of Hayek's 2006 Ford GT ""sustained major blunt-force trauma to his body"" and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, the police report said. The coroner had not released the man's name Monday because his family had not been notified. Hayek, who is a furniture designer based in Los Angeles, was driving east on Sunset Boulevard in the Bel Air community of Los Angeles when he lost control and crossed into the westbound lanes, police said. A 2011 Toyota Tacoma truck crashed into Hayek's car. Hayek was being treated Monday in a Los Angeles hospital. No charges have been filed.

"(CNN) -- Fugitive Colorado sex offender Eric Hartwell, who apparently cut off his ankle monitor and left a group home, has been apprehended in Norfolk, Virginia, the U.S. Marshals Service said. A fugitive warrant was requested minutes after Hartwell, 51, walked away from Independence House in Denver a week ago. Hartwell was convicted of raping a child in 1991 and of attempted indecent liberties in 1996, according to the Colorado sex offender registry. He was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to serve a lifetime of supervised parole by a federal judge in Texas in March 2010 after he was found guilty of failing to register as a sex offender, according to a U.S. Justice Department news release. Hartwell was placed in a halfway house in Washington state in March 2009 for failure to register as a sex offender, but after just a week there he cut off his leg monitor and fled to Texas, according to the Justice Department.","Eric Hartwell is a convicted sex offender who was at a group home .

"(CNN) -- After failing to find her teenage son on the grounds of Danvers High School, Diana Chism called police in the small northeastern Massachusetts town where she lives with her three children. The call came on 6:34 p.m. on October 22 -- one in a long series of contacts and pieces of old-fashioned police work that helped crack a case that shocked the quiet New England town of 26,000. The mother's desperate call was one of the first items in a police affidavit that chillingly chronicled the killing of popular high school teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, allegedly at the hand of shy student-athlete Philip Chism, 14. A grand jury on Thursday indicted Chism on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with Ritzer's slaying, according to Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, who said the case involved ""horrific and unspeakable acts."" Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . Citing Massachusetts law, prosecutors said they would ask that Chism -- who is being held without bail -- be tried as an adult. Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, has declined to comment. The affidavit unsealed Friday -- which police used to obtain a search warrant for Chism's home -- offers a chronology of the gruesome slaying of the algebra teacher and how a student in her last-period class became the prime suspect: . After informing police that her son had not come home, Diana Chism went to the Danvers station house to file a missing-person report. Police had the boy's cellular phone company ""ping"" the device's location. It was last known to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned he had purchased a movie ticket before leaving. Another ""ping"" turned up no results. Police used Twitter, Facebook and other social media outlets to spread the news of his disappearance. The next day, a Danvers police officer reviewed surveillance footage from cameras at the high school and constructed a minute-by-minute timeline of the end of the school day on October 22. At 2:54 p.m, Ritzer walks from her classroom, A209, to the second-floor restroom. A minute later, a person the officer says is Chism appears to follow her into the restroom ""with a hood over his head, donning gloves."" At 3:06 p.m., a female student enters the bathroom and quickly walks out. (She later told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes. The person's rear was exposed, with clothes piled on the floor). A minute later, the person who had followed Ritzer leaves the bathroom. During the next several minutes, he walks in and out of the school building, changes his clothes, puts on a black mask and drags a recycling barrel into the bathroom. At 3:22 p.m., the person in the ski mask leaves the bathroom, pulling the recycle bin to an elevator, then out of the building and toward the student parking lot. At 3:30 p.m., the mother of one student sees Chism ""running away"" from the school. The student's mother relayed this information to the principal at about 6 p.m. that day. At 9 p.m., Danvers High School principal Sue Ambrozavitch sends out a mass e-mail to high school staff reporting Chism missing. Shortly after the e-mail was sent, a math teacher calls the principal to say that Ritzer's parents -- Tom and Peggie -- told her their daughter was missing. The teacher, concerned that both her colleague and a student were missing, told the principal that Chism was in Ritzer's last class that day. Ambrozavitch told investigations that night she and others went to the school to look for Ritzer, whose car was still in the parking lot. Tom and Peggie Ritzer were also at the school before going to the police station to report their daughter missing. The exact time is unclear. At about 11:20 p.m., the Ritzers report their daughter missing. Police had her cell phone provider ""ping"" the location of her phone. The device's last know location was in the area of a local middle school. Meanwhile, in the nearby town of Topsfield at 12:30 a.m. on October 23, an officer approached a young man walking on the road at Route 1 North and Salem Road. It was Philip Chism, who was reported missing in Danvers. Chism was patted down and a knife was found. Later, a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter, according to the affidavit. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He was also carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of blue-green women's underwear. He first tells police he found the items at a gas station. Later, he says he took them out of Ritzer's car. Chism is arrested. In the early morning hours of October 23, Ritzer's body is found during a search of the Danvers High School grounds and an adjacent wooded area. Her body was in a ""supine position covered with leaves and debris"" in an attempt to conceal it. She was raped with an object. Her throat was slit. The green recycle bin in the surveillance video was 20 yards from the body. Clothing and other belongings were scattered nearby, along with the blood-soaked gloves Chism was seen wearing in the video. A crime scene officer unfolded a handwritten note left near the body. It read: ""I hate you all."" That same morning, police officers interviewed Chism's mother in the basement apartment where she had moved her family after recently leaving Tennessee amid a divorce with the young man's father. ""She said that it was a stressful divorce,"" the affidavit said. Hundreds mourn slain teacher . At 5:36 p.m. on October 23, investigators with the Danvers police and Massachusetts State Police interviewed a ninth-grade student who said she was in the same classroom with Ritzer and Chism to get extra help in math on the day of the killing. Chism was ""visibly upset"" after Ritzer mentioned his home state of Tennessee, the student told police. Ritzer noticed and changed the subject. Chism continued to be upset, said the student, who described him as ""talking to himself in the classroom."" It was the first hint of a possible motive.","Court documents provide detailed timeline of case that shocked New England town .

"(CNN) -- Over the decades, celebrities have chosen various ways of dealing with an increasingly intrusive media. Such methods have included suing (Jacqueline Kennedy), punching (Marlon Brando) and putting a bag over one's head (Shia LaBeouf). But Alec Baldwin's coping mechanism opens a new chapter in the paparazzi wars. After celebrity gossip site TMZ released footage of Baldwin shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer (with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur), Baldwin published a bitter ""goodbye to public life"" essay in New York Magazine. Before we permanently lose any other celebrities to their secret hideouts, it's time to consider a way to fight back against the paparazzi. In fact, Baldwin was on the cusp of discovering a new weapon â€” he just didn't realize it. Upon first reading of Baldwin's tirade, you might have missed the solution (after all, the piece is rather long and, at times, tiresome). But the answer is staring us in the face. In fact, it's staring all of us in the face. Every day. These days, Baldwin said, ""everyone has a camera in their pocket."" Not just the Ron Galellas of the world, but all of the John Q. Publics looking for a chance to shame a celebrity. This kind of world is too much for Baldwin, who is prone to losing his temper. But if cameras are small, cheap, and ubiquitous, why not use it to your advantage? Why not take one with you when you go in public, thus ensuring the public can always see your side of the story? ""They are baiting you,"" Baldwin said in his farewell-to-the-world. ""You can tell they want to get into it with you. Some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment..."" Exactly. So why not catch them in the act? Does that sound like too much trouble? Maybe so. But if you're rich like Baldwin, why not hire someone to follow you around and record life as it happens? Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be. Still sound unreasonable? There's yet another solution that just made itself available. You can record your daily interactions with a wearable camera embedded in your glasses. If you want to show the world what really happened with that jerk of a photographer, just upload the footage from your Google Glass. As USA Today reported earlier this month, police departments are outfitting their officers with wearable cameras to protect both police and citizens against unfair accusations. All of this might sound extreme. Why should celebrities have to go to such lengths to protect themselves? It may be a lot of trouble, but isn't it better than being humiliated repeatedly by out-of-context outbursts? Isn't it better than retiring from a job you love and living as a hermit for the rest of your life? Baldwin said in his diatribe, ""You're out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever."" True, but not if you can show your side of the story. It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities. Don't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi. If you do, the celebrity gossip sites will win. It's time for a 21st century solution. It's time to fight photos with photos. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David R. Wheeler.","Alec Baldwin published an essay saying he wants to leave New York .

"(CNN) -- A supersonic combat jet crashed Saturday afternoon on a training complex in rural Nevada, the Navy said. The F/A-18C Hornet went down about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada, an hour's drive east of Reno. The aircraft was conducting a training flight. Navy personnel were en route to the scene Saturday night and had not yet ""confirmed the status of the aircraft crew member,"" according to a news release. The plane was assigned to the air station's Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center. Naval Air Station Fallon is a popular training site because of its weather, which provides ""more than 300 clear flying days per year"" and its facilities, which include four bombing ranges, an electronic warfare range and a 14,000-foot runway, the longest in the Navy, the station's website says.

"(CNN) -- Ellen DeGeneres! Celebrity controversies! Endless self-congratulation! What, you think Sunday's Oscars are about the movies and the fashion? Yes, there is quite a race between best picture contenders ""12 Years a Slave,"" ""Gravity"" and ""American Hustle."" (There are six other nominees, but they're not expected to make waves.) Awards Season 2014: Oscar ballot . However, the Oscars are full of unexpected moments -- whether it's a host's divisive jokes, a winner making political points or simply awkward stage approaches. Here are five things to watch for: . 1. ""12 Years"" and Oscar diversity. A number of films from 2013 were rightly touted as showcasing African-Americans, including ""Fruitvale Station,"" ""42,"" ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" and ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom."" Vanity Fair even highlighted the diversity on its Hollywood Issue cover. But excepting ""Mandela,"" which earned a best song nomination, the only one of those films to get any Oscar love was ""12 Years a Slave,"" about the experience of a free man taken into slavery. Its studio, Fox Searchlight, has run ads that say ""It's time,"" a simple phrase that has multiple meanings. Will the message carry the day? We'll find out Sunday. 2. Your host, Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen DeGeneres received kudos for her first Oscar hosting stint in 2007 -- ""crisp and unpretentious,"" in the words of TV critic Tom Shales. Since then, she has only become more popular, with her top-rated daytime TV show and 25.2 million Twitter followers. She'll be nice, of course, but maybe a little pointed. ""I do think it should be classy. It's the Academy Awards,"" she told The New York Times. ""(But) it has lately turned into something that's a little more about the clothes than the performances, and I will comment on that."" And who knows? The married and openly gay DeGeneres may have something to say about the recent debate over same-sex marriage laws. 3. Patterns and record breakers. Some Oscar nights seem to be all about momentum, with one film sweeping its way to best picture. Other Oscar nights spread the wealth. You may want to keep an eye on certain categories to see which way the wind is blowing. 2014 Oscar predictions . Moreover, it could be a big night for a few individuals in particular. With her fourth win, best actress nominee Meryl Streep, who now has 18 nominations, could tie Katharine Hepburn as the performer with the most Oscar wins. Best supporting actress nominee Jennifer Lawrence could be the first performer to win back-to-back Oscars in different categories (best actress, and best supporting actress). And with an Oscar victory, best song nominee Robert Lopez, who co-wrote ""Frozen's"" ""Let It Go,"" will become an EGOT -- a winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. He would become just the 12th person to do so competitively. 4. Controversy! If Cate Blanchett wins best actress for ""Blue Jasmine"" -- as she's widely expected to do -- will she thank the film's director, Woody Allen? She was called out in Dylan Farrow's open letter and has been diplomatic when asked about the controversy, but didn't mention Allen in her acceptance speech at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. Then there's the ""In Memoriam"" segment. If the Internet is essentially a gigantic outrage machine, then nothing gets people angrier than having their favorite performer left out of the academy's annual tribute to the deceased. Who will it be this year? Harold Ramis? Sid Caesar? Sarah Jones, the crew member who was killed in a Georgia train accident? And will there be complaints over who gets the ""anchor"" position? 5. Sing it! In recent years, the best song race has been little more than a footnote to the Oscar proceedings. (Two years ago, there were just two nominees -- total.) But this year is shaping up to be an interesting competition. You've got Lopez and his tune, sung by Idina Menzel, which hit Billboard's Top 20. You've got rock heavyweights U2, who wrote and performed ""Ordinary Love,"" from ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom."" You've got indie darling Karen O, who performed ""The Moon Song"" from ""Her,"" and be-hatted Pharrell Williams, the mastermind behind ""Despicable Me 2's"" ""Happy."" In other words, you've got four songs people have actually heard -- and like. It's been awhile. You almost might want to keep an eye on space and time. Space, because the weather in Los Angeles has been rainy. The precipitation is expected to let up by Sunday afternoon, but if it doesn't, the rainswept streets might make Ridley Scott proud. And time, because it's the Oscars: ""Two hours of sparkling entertainment spread over a four-hour show,"" as Johnny Carson once said. Of course, if it's an entertaining show, nobody will notice -- except those people who use the show's running time as an Oscar pool tiebreaker. Back to you, Ellen.","Oscars 2014 feature a tight race for best picture .

"(CNN) -- A single mother of six, Cherelle Wright brought her 3-month-old daughter to be immunized at Community Advanced Practice Nurses, one free clinic offering medical care to Atlanta's disadvantaged. ""Since I am unemployed at the moment and was in between having Medicaid insurance, I found out about this place (and) I was able to get all the immunizations that my children needed,"" she says. ""It's a great opportunity to have health care when you are not able to afford it."" With the advent of Obamacare, the health market is changing. Connie Buchanan, CAPN director, has wondered how the Affordable Care Act would change the clinic's mission. ""I ask (clients) every day if they will be signing up for Obamacare and they look at me with a blank stare,"" she says. She explains that Atlanta's economically disadvantaged, who make up an overwhelming majority of her clients, do not know much about the ACA. Most are extremely isolated from current events. Few own televisions and even fewer have Internet access. Because of that, she expects most of her clients to stay with the clinic. However, she worries about its future and the potential for dwindling donations. Most nonprofit donors assume low-income populations will register for Obamacare en masse, so donations aren't necessary. However, many may not qualify for Obamacare. As a result, many free-care providers -- which have been, and still are, the cornerstone of health care services for the indigent -- face an uncertain future. ""When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, there was an immediate assumption that no one is going to need the free clinic,"" says Donna E. Looper, executive director of the Georgia Charitable Care Network. Looper has had to work hard to educate her donors on popular misconceptions about Obamacare. Her first task was to clarify that having an insurance card was not a panacea that made the services offered by her nonprofits redundant. Even patients with Medicaid still look to free clinics to fill the gaps for services like dental care. Georgia is one of the states that refused the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. So people fall in the gap -- those who don't qualify for Medicaid or Obamacare. Meanwhile, the number of patients attending free clinics has not decreased, staying the same or even rising. Those who make too much to qualify for support and too little to afford care are left in a coverage gray area. According to Looper, this group is now flocking to free clinics. It's a trend seen elsewhere as well. ""Regardless of a Medicaid expansion ... we will still have more uninsured people in Virginia than the free clinics currently serve,"" says Linda D. Wilkinson, CEO of the Virginia Association of Free Clinics. In Virginia, free clinics served 75,000 people in 2012, Wilkinson says. She expects that 280,000 individuals will remain uninsured, even with Medicaid expansion. Arlington Free Clinic, the largest provider of its kind in Wilkinson's region, serves 1,700 of Arlington's working poor each year. In Chicago, ""Even with all of the great expectation and positive feelings ... there will still be well over half a million residents of Cook County five years from now who will not have benefited from the Affordable Care Act for a number of reasons,"" says Judith Haasis, executive director of CommunityHealth Chicago, the largest free medical clinic in Illinois. In 2013 alone, her clinic served 11,500 unique patients. Many of those return multiple times, totaling an average of 30,000 visits. ""It is really difficult and often emotional for (health care providers) as they hear from our patients who are desperately asking if they can stay here,"" Haasis says. Her group continues working with patients until they are fully enrolled and have found a new medical home. As a result, the clinic remains in a state of flux as it transitions out the eligible patients to other service providers while making room for those who are left with no options. As many as 29 million documented and undocumented people are still without access to health insurance, Nicole Lamoureux, executive director of the National Association of Free Clinics, testified last February before the House Ways and Means Committee. This figure includes those who are eligible for Medicaid but reside in states which choose not to expand their programs. Many people do not realize that since the 1960s, about 1,200 free and charitable clinics nationwide have been filling in the gaps for those who fall through the cracks, Lamoureux told lawmakers. Back in Georgia, Deloris Baker, a single mom with two kids, has been coming to CAPN for the last five years. She says her 6- and 9-year-old sons receive the best care there. The children qualify for Medicaid, she says, but she is still awaiting approval. During the application process, she was told she herself did not qualify. Baker is not looking forward to any changes that ACA may bring. ""Everything I have heard has been negative (and) I don't think it's a good plan,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- A deputy stopped to help a motorist in Utah on Thursday, and the motorist allegedly shot him dead. Then he wounded two more deputies while running from the law. That's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed, bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties, until officers were able to corner a suspect. They critically wounded him in a shootout -- it was the fourth time the man opened fire while on the run, the sheriff said. The slain officer was Sgt. Cory Wride, a deputy who had been on the force for 19 years. Tracy knew him well and thought highly of him, he told journalists at a news conference. Wride worked directly under him for three years. ""He was a very helpful person, and that's what he was doing,"" Tracy said, visibly moved. ""He was helping people when he stopped."" The wounded deputies were hospitalized and underwent operations. One is expected to recover; the other is in critical condition in an intensive care unit. The suspect, whom Tracy declined to name, is also expected to recover. He has a ""significant"" criminal history, Tracy said. Ambush? Wride called in a ""motorist assist"" when he decided to pull off the road to aid what he thought was a disabled vehicle, Tracy said. The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what ""appears to be a high-powered rifle,"" Tracy said. Then he fled the scene. When other officers got the news, they took up positions at strategic posts to try to intercept the car on the run. Tracy fears the suspect may have set up the situation on purpose as a roadside ambush. ""He may have very well parked by the side of the road, hoping that some officer would stop behind him,"" he said. Tragic chase . After the suspect fled, a deputy called in to say that he was pursuing him. Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said. The suspect raced away but later wrecked the car he was driving. He looked for a vehicle to carjack, approaching multiple people and cars, before finding one. He later crashed it, too, Tracy said. Along the way, he continued shooting. When deputies caught up with him, the man fired at them, critically wounding yet another deputy, the sheriff's office said. The officers wounded the suspect in the gunfight and took him into custody. The sheriff's office plans to obtain a warrant to search the suspect's home to try to establish a motive for the shooting rampage. Tracy personally the broke news of Sgt. Wride's killing to his family. ""He was a good man,"" the sheriff said. Wride leaves behind a wife and five children. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Football's new Financial Fair Play rules have got some of the world's biggest clubs worried. Facing the prospect of being punished with heavy fines and barred from European competition, they are desperate to make sure that generated revenues are equal or greater than expenditure. Barcelona was one of the first to address balance sheet deficits when it allowed its first shirt sponsorship in 111 years, agreeing a $185 million deal with the Qatar Foundation in late 2010. More recently European champion Chelsea, bankrolled since 2004 by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, signed a deal with energy giant Gazprom. One Turkish team has even gone down the surreal route of building a hydroelectric plant in a bid to raise revenue. Inter Milan, owned by Italian oil tycoon Massimo Moratti, is selling a $67 million stake in the club to Chinese investors. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who owns AC Milan, is reportedly seeking investment from his friend at the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, also via Gazprom. Are footballers on a par with bankers? The decision to seek foreign funds is alien to Italian football, where only one club in Serie A has an overseas owner, and illustrates how the need to seek global sponsorship is being used to work around the new UEFA framework. England's Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City signed a $628 million deal with the emirate's airline Etihad that was described as an ""improper transaction"" by a Council of Europe Committee. Welcome to the crazy world of beating FFP. ""Clubs are looking for more revenue-generating partnerships with sponsors in part to ensure compliance with the UEFA FFP regulations,"" football finance expert Daniel Geey of London firm Field Fisher Waterhouse told CNN. ""The concern for many clubs if they breach the FFP requirements is whether they will be sanctioned through expulsion from UEFA competition. ""Some sanctions for breaching the regulations may not be as harsh, but in order to fill a potential revenue shortfall clubs are looking for ways to beef up their accounts."" Will football clubs play fair financially? Perhaps the most intriguing tale is that of Turkish club Trabzonspor, which has created a novel way of ensuring it does not fall foul of the FFP rules. Based in the Anatolia region of the country, which is fast becoming Turkey's economic center, the six-time league winner -- whose chairman Sadri Sener is a civil engineer -- is investing in its future. The Black Sea club will build a hydroelectric plant in a bid to raise revenues after receiving permission from the Turkish government, which is seeking an alternative source of energy after becoming reliant on the natural gas supplied by neighboring Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran. The plant is expected to cost an estimated $50 million, with annual revenues expected to pull in $10 million a year. The deal could prove a masterstroke as Turkey's energy market is growing by 8% each year. Trabzonspor, which will play in the second tier UEFA Europa League this season, is also considering plans for a second and smaller plant. ""The club needs a guaranteed source of income, and we have the ideal conditions for hydro power,"" the Financial Times quoted a Trabzon club official as saying. The world's best-paid sports teams . The hydro project is just the latest in a line of schemes devised by clubs to work around the FFP which may come under scrutiny from European football's ruling body. ""Many of the more recent deals like Etihad's long-term agreement with Manchester City and Chelsea's arrangements with Gazprom have prompted some to suggest such sponsorship deals are a convenient way to use the facade of a sponsorship deal to boost revenues,"" Geey said . ""Such analysis will ultimately be done through UEFA's Club Financial Control Body. They will have to assess whether such transactions fall under the 'related party transaction' provisions of the FFP regulations and if so, what the fair value of the transaction really is. ""Similarly, UEFA will also have to consider at the appropriate time whether Trabzonspor's innovative plan to build an energy power plant to boost club revenues would actually fall within what would be classed as relevant revenues for FFP calculations. ""Such investigations will only occur come the 2013-14 season when clubs have to submit their accounts for FFP compliance for the first time."" In a UEFA report published last year, it was estimated that about 50% of top European clubs were losing money and 20% were recording sizable deficits. Under the new rules, owners can only contribute a maximum of $55.5 million for the 2013-14 and 2015 seasons together, and $37 million during the period covering 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18. Current rules state that should clubs incur losses in excess of $60 million over a three-year period, they will be hit with sanctions as well as exclusion from the Champions League and Europa League. Bumper revenues for Premier League clubs tempered by soaring wages . But while the boardrooms are anxiously preparing for FFP, supporters across the globe may not see much change. Although spending within the August transfer window is down from $761 million last season to around $392 million so far this year, Premier League supporters will still enjoy a first-class brand. ""People are talking about FFP more in the UK than elsewhere,"" Paul Rawnsley, director at Deloitte's sports business group, told CNN. ""But I don't think the normal fan in the stands will really notice anything too different. ""There won't be any radical changes and all it will do is bring a better balance over time. At the very top end of the game we've seen that football is quite resistant to economic downturn. ""Players are still going to be rewarded well and this idea of FFP is not a new thing."" Rawnsley predicts clubs will adapt to the new framework and that none of the major players will fail to meet the FFP criteria. ""I'd be pretty surprised if some clubs across Europe weren't preparing for the FFP rules to come into place because this concept was approved back in 2009,"" he said. ""UEFA has already said it will impose sanctions on clubs which don't comply and that could be a financial penalty or even exclusion from a competition.""","Trabzonspor to build a hydroelectric plant in a bid to raise extra revenue .

"(CNN) -- One backward notion that has been used to differentiate the 1960s Civil Rights movement from today's struggle for LGBT equality in the United States is the idea that gay people are somehow ""invisible"" and can hide who they are. This, in theory, makes them immune to discrimination. ""How do you know who to discriminate against ...?"" Iowa Rep. Steve King asked in an interview that was rebroadcast this week by Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert. I wish that, too, was satire, but King went on in the March 3 interview with a TV station in Des Moines to explain that characteristics that aren't ""specifically protected in the Constitution"" must be ""immutable,"" meaning ""a characteristic that can be independently verified and can't be willfully changed."" The insinuation there is that a person's gayness must be verified for that person to be protected from discrimination. (Keep in mind that a person's religious freedom is protected by the U.S. Constitution, and religious beliefs are not always permanent and identifiable visually). Or that, because LGBT people can't be readily branded as gay, they don't deserve special protections under the law. Logical conclusion: Gay-labeling laws! Colbert, bless him, went on to instruct his viewers to mail photos of themselves proving their gayness to King's office address, which is 2210 Rayburn Office Building, Washington, DC 20515. (Don't send anything pornographic, but I think that stunt is pretty hilarious). All of this comes up in reference to the so-called ""gay Jim Crow"" bills that are popping in up in several states, most recently in Mississippi. These bills vary, but the undercurrent is that some religious groups want protection so that they could, in some instances, deny services to LGBT people based on their religious beliefs. That's outrageous, obviously, as even Arizona's hyperconservative governor, Jan Brewer, realized when she vetoed one such bill in her state late last month. Mississippi's bill already has been toned down some, but activists say the current version is still discriminatory. I'm not that interested in the politics of these laws. What's more important are the sentiments -- fear and ignorance, it seems to me -- that drive this legislation. These sentiments may seem isolated, but they're not. The reality is that gay people, especially in sometimes-hostile states like Mississippi, which I visited last year to report on LGBT rights, spend a lot of their time trying to cover up who they are because they fear discrimination. And they fear discrimination not because they're litigious but because they see discrimination all around them, all the time, even in 2014 America. It shows up in comments like those from King, in comments from friends and family, and, most crucially, in America's broken legal protections for LGBT people. How could a person expect to live free of discrimination in a country where a majority of states don't protect gay people from being fired or evicted because of who they are? Those issues aren't the subject of soundbites this week, but they're equally important. America is quick, and right, to judge the actions of countries such as Uganda and Russia, with deplorable records of persecuting LGBT people. Uganda last month passed a law intensifying criminal penalties for homosexual acts. But our judgment, as long as we continue to support discriminatory policies back home, stinks of hypocrisy. That King would argue in 2014 that being gay is a ""self-professed behavior,"" and therefore one not worthy of explicit protection, is deeply troubling, but I'm comforted to know antiquated views such as that are moving toward the fringe of the discourse. That's true even in Mississippi, where one of these ""religious freedom"" bills is currently being debated and where activists have been staging demonstrations. Gay people -- verified or not -- have increasingly stepped out into the public spotlight in Mississippi to tell their stories. That's what I found when I visited the state last year. I met a prison guard who sued his employer after he was fired, he said, because he's gay. He won. I met lesbian couples in Hattiesburg who marched into a courthouse and demanded marriage licenses even though they would be denied under the law. And I met brave openly gay people who live proudly in the most remote of places. By sharing their stories, I'm optimistic they'll eventually get through to people like King who, for now at least, seems to need some proof of their existence. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Mississippi is the latest state to consider a ""gay Jim Crow"" law .
Sutter: Ignorance and fear promote that sort of legislation .
He says proponents would rather think of gay people as invisible ."
"(CNN) -- When NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony announced earlier this month he was just finishing a 15-day fast, it caught even his closest allies off-guard. Everyone from New York Knicks coach Mike Woodson to teammate Amare Stoudemire said they had no idea Anthony was on a special diet. Others were skeptical: Could a professional athlete really survive, much less perform, without eating for 15 days? It turns out, he probably didn't. Anthony cut out meat and carbohydrates but did take in some calories, according to media reports. Nutritionists say he was pushing his luck, even with that modified version. ""Athletes need a regular intake of carbohydrates and protein, not only to fuel their activity, but to recover,"" says Marie Spano, a sports dietitian from Atlanta who works with professional basketball, baseball and football players. Your brain on food: Obesity, fasting and addiction . Jennifer Gibson, a sports dietitian at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, suspects he might have simply cut out meat or tried some kind of liquid diet: ""With a no-food fast for 15 days, we would have seen a noticeable change in his body, and we didn't."" Moore says a serious athlete should forget fasting altogether -- ""if you're on a quarter tank of gas, you're not going to compete well"" -- but if you do decide to try fasting for religious or other reasons, there are a few things to keep in mind. Remember fluids . If you choose to avoid food for any length of time, you still need to stay hydrated. The human body can function fairly well for up to three days without food, but you shouldn't go even a few hours without ingesting water or juice, say nutritionists. Keep it short . It takes about three days without food for the body to go into an unhealthy starvation mode -- less if you don't have a big meal before the big fast, according to Gibson. It takes about a day for the body to run through stored carbohydrates and start to burn fat and protein for energy. Burning fat may sound tempting, but around the three-day mark, it leads to a buildup in the bloodstream of acids known as ketones -- a condition known as ketosis, which can result in nausea, dizziness and stomach pain, along with severe bad breath. As days turn to weeks, it eventually leads to organ damage. A two- or three-day fast might not be dangerous, but even just a few hours without calories will impact performance, especially for an athlete. ""As you get lower blood sugar, you're feeling some fogginess and dizziness, even if you keep hydration up,"" Gibson says. ""You can function, but there's a point you realize where you're not functioning optimally."" Don't fast to lose weight . ""I can't recommend fasting,"" says Marisa Moore, a dietitian in Atlanta. ""If people want to do it for discipline or mental clarity, that's OK. But my concern is for the other 360 days a year."" ""You have to look at sustainability,"" agrees Gibson. ""A lot of people fast for a week, and all they think about is what they'll binge on when they're done. It's not teaching anyone a healthy relationship with food."" Plan carefully . Planning is critical when you place constraints on your diet. For example, last year during the monthlong Ramadan, Gibson laid out a special meal plan for Olympic fencing hopeful Ibtihaj Muhammad. During Ramadan, observant Muslims avoid eating or drinking between dawn and dusk, so Gibson focused on the narrow windows when Muhammad was allowed to eat. ""We focused on foods that are really easy to digest and not overly fatty,"" Gibson says. ""Things like rice, applesauce and yogurt -- everything in small chunks of food."" Even so, Muhammad cut back her training during Ramadan, backing off when she felt tired or dizzy. Gibson notes that planning can be even tougher for people juggling jobs and families. Fasting isn't for everyone . Some people should never fast: pregnant women, anyone on medication that needs to be taken with food and diabetics -- not to mention anyone else with a medical condition that requires regular food intake. Moore adds that people younger than 18 should also never fast. ""They're still growing and developing, and it can also set up psychological issues with food."" New Year's resolution or not, Anthony said last week in London he is starting to get his energy back and that he doesn't regret the experiment. ""It was just something I wanted to do. I think at times in life you just need clarity on some things and you just want to rebuild your body up, and rebuild your mind, and just clear everything up, and start afresh."" With a wide smile, he added, ""I'm back eating now!"" Muslim Olympians wrestle with Ramadan dilemma . Despite daily Ramadan fast, Muslim NFLer trains for season .","The NBA's Carmelo Anthony says he's back to eating after a fast .
If you're trying a fast, remember to stay hydrated .
Don't use fasting as a weight-loss tool, experts say ."
"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Abu Ali is 58 years old. He could be 78, his beard gray, body frail and his face a leathery road map that traces the unimaginable horrors his family has endured. It is a face that reflects a visceral human portrait of the grinding violence in Iraq and the toll it has taken on ordinary civilians. The al-Jibouri family are not politicians, nor insurgents, nor religious radicals. They are -- or used to be -- a family of humble watermelon sellers, plying their trade with plump fruit from Mosul in their stall, barely 50 meters from their home in Baghdad. Their descent into hell began on July 23, 2007. Their son Ali -- 19 and a week away from his wedding -- was working on the family stall when one of Baghdad's ubiquitous car bombs targeted the market area. He was killed instantly. ""I was a week away from marrying him off,"" Abu Ali sobs. ""Instead I buried him."" Abu Ali doesn't stop crying the entire time we are with the family. Eight thousand Iraqis died last year, according to the U.N. Iraq Body Count lists 640 civilian deaths so far in January. But numbers are anonymous and cold: to visit the al-Jibouri family is to see and feel and be suffocated by the human reality of those statistics. As the politicians play politics, and the insurgents deal in death, it is people like this who suffer the fallout, as they always do in war. Ali's devastated fiance Duaa later married Ali's brother Alaa. Together they had three children: a son, also called Ali, now aged three, and daughters Rukkaya, four, and Narjis, eight months. In July last year the family was preparing for their annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Najaf, where Ali is buried, to honor his memory. It was July 20, a Saturday, and Alaa and brother Abbas were on duty at the water melon stand. Everyone heard the bomb inside the family home. It rocked the walls and shook the ground. Alaa, 23, and Abbas, 17, were blown to pieces, along with several other people. Today, the walls by the old watermelon stand are scarred by shrapnel. Abu Ali has now lost all three sons. ""No one will call me dad anymore,"" he wails. The funeral was well attended: hundreds of neighbors and friends turned out, disbelieving what had happened to this family. Chanting and wailing mourners carried the coffins aloft to begin Alaa and Abbas's journey to Najaf to lie alongside Ali. The children asked daily where their father was. Abu Ali and his wife, Umm Ali, at first couldn't face telling them the truth, instead saying he'd gone to Mosul for more watermelons. Eventually, of course, they had to explain that he, and their uncle, were dead. ""We tell them he has gone to paradise and is watching over them, but Ali especially cannot comprehend,"" says Abu Ali. ""When we say his father is in paradise, he just cries."" Ali is clearly a traumatized boy. His sister seems happy enough, playing on a sofa with her cousin and a tattered doll. Alaa's other child, the baby daughter Narjis, was just a few weeks old when her father died. She smiles at me and touches my watch, enthralled by the shiny wristband and oblivious to her forlorn circumstances. Then Rukkaya surprises us by suddenly counting to 10 in English. We applaud her and her face lights up with pride. She counts again, and then once more. The smiles her performance brings are a rare event in this home. Ali sits nearby, his head dipping and swaying, as it's done ever since his father died. The family has a fourth son, Ammar, but after the second explosion he fell apart emotionally and was certain that one day he too would die. And then he vanished, simply disappeared. The family hasn't seen or heard from him since. Alaa's widow, Duaa, still lives with the family, or what remains of it. She hides in the kitchen during our visit, unwilling to speak about what the two car bombs took from her. Abu Ali continues to weep and lament the family's bleak future. The watermelon stand was the family's only income. They are seven months behind on the rent for their tiny three-room house on a muddy side street. Six people are crammed into the home, Abu Ali and Umm Ali, and Alaa's widow and three children. ""It's like we are living in a dark place,"" says the grieving mother, Umm Ali. ""What does one do when you lose your children? We don't go out, we keep our door closed. We want to leave and not stay in this country, but we can't afford it."" ""They were our bread winners,"" says Abu Ali. ""They supported us, now I have no income, I have to now sell belongings. I haven't paid the rent for seven months. ""It's hard. I think of committing suicide, but what would happen to the children? If an official loses a son, all the media covers it and the family is looked after. I have lost three sons and the fourth fled and no one cares about us."" We leave Abu Ali and Umm Ali and the grandchildren they now raise and they thank us for telling their story to the world. We have no words, nothing that could possibly comfort or offer promise. Just gratitude for their courage in trying to get others outside this place to maybe understand the human cost of what goes on here. Tomorrow, or the next day, there are sure to be more bombs or bullets sending more families down the tortuous road being navigated by Abu Ali. READ MORE: Is Iraq worse than ever?

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan celebrated their fourth successive Scudetto with a 3-0 home victory against Siena on Sunday as coach Jose Mourinho demanded total commitment from his players. Coach Mourinho demanded total commitment from Inter as they celebrated another Italian title. Inter were crowned champions on Saturday after closest challengers and city rivals AC Milan went down 2-1 at Udinese. Any thoughts they would take their foot off the gas were dispelled as goals from Esteban Cambiasso (45), Mario Balotelli (52) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (76) secured the win. ""It was important to win, there wouldn't have been much point to our party if we hadn't won,"" said Mourinho. ""This was a serious match, we weren't kidding around. Our strength is that we always play very seriously. ""Even today I got angry because we still had the aim of winning the top scorer trophy, not for (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic but for the whole team -- even (Mario) Balotelli had to play for Ibra."" The Swede scored his 22nd league goal of the season in the 76th minute and is only one goal behind Bologna's Marco Di Vaio in the Serie A goalscoring charts. But it was captain Javier Zanetti and goalkeeper Julio Cesar who pleased Mourinho the most. ""The player who surprised me the most was Zanetti. His passport cannot be telling the truth (claiming he's 35), it must be 10 years out, he's incredible,"" added the former Porto and Chelsea manager. Mourinho has already started looking ahead to the quest for a fifth successive Serie A crown and already has transfer targets in mind, such as Genoa's Diego Milito. ""If you win one, a second and then more titles it's difficult and a fifth will be harder still,"" he said. ""We are not very far from signing Milito, who is a striker in top form. ""We need a second striker. This year we had big problems in central midfield and we need two players there with physical strength and a different tactical ability to the players we have at the moment. ""And then a defender other than two or three in the youth team that I like a lot."" Milan's hold on second place was strengthened as Juventus could only manage a 2-2 home draw with Atalanta with Fiorentina a point back in fourth after they beat Sampdoria 1-0. Genoa came from behind to secure the point they needed to qualify for the Europa League next season thanks to a 2-2 draw with Chievo. Roma hold the last European spot, but are just two points ahead of Palermo after the Sicilians beat Lazio 2-0. Meanwhile, veteran Inter midfielder Luis Figo has announced that he will retire at the end of the season. ""I finish in the best possible way,"" Figo told Portuguese sports newspaper Abola. ""I will no longer play at a high level."" Figo, 36, won four Primera Liga title in spells with Barcelona and Real Madrid before joining Inter in the summer of 2005. ""This is a first for me,"" he added. ""I've never won a title without playing. It's always difficult to win a league title in Italy. But with respect to the previous Serie A titles, this one feels different because it has been slightly more difficult.""","Inter Milan mark fourth successive Serie A title with 3-0 victory against Siena .

"(CNN) -- One week after 11-year-old Celina Cass was last seen, her body was found Monday by divers searching the Connecticut River, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said. ""We have brought Celina home, not the way we wanted to bring her home,"" Young said early Monday evening. The girl's father, Adam Laro, said he was heartbroken and grasping for answers after hearing the news. ""I ... can't believe what's gone on,"" Laro told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show on Monday night. ""I have no fingers to point ... I hope there will be some answers, that's what I'm asking."" Young said that the case -- which had been considered a ""missing persons"" case -- is now being investigated as a ""suspicious death."" No one has been arrested or named publicly as a suspect in what is now a criminal investigation. ""Based on what we have seen visually, we are treating it as suspicious,"" the official said. Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office. Young described it as a ""routine search because of the proximity to (Celina's) home,"" about one-quarter mile away. The site is also near the Canadian border, where the Connecticut River forms the border between New Hampshire and Vermont. The discovery came a day after Laro -- who was in the hospital when Celina went missing -- said that he was like others ""wondering where my daughter is"" and hoping she was safe. On Monday night, the father thanked all those authorities and residents who had put their time and effort into finding Celina. He said his memories of his daughter are ""beautiful, beautiful, just a wonderful hearted person."" ""(She was) someone who was loving and caring to a lot of people,"" Laro said. ""That's how I would like to remember her."" Celina was last seen in her room, at her computer, around 9 p.m. July 25, according to police. CNN affiliate WMUR reported that her parents told authorities the girl was gone when they went to wake her up Tuesday morning. Since then, local, state and federal investigators had searched for her and for clues about her whereabouts ""by air, by land, by water,"" Young said Sunday evening. Young said on Monday that authorities, including FBI agents, had received nearly 500 tips prior to finding the girl's body. She described investigators' focus Monday around Celina's home as ""routine,"" after being asked about yellow crime tape there and the removal of a vehicle. The aim is to ""determine if we have any evidence"" in places around where the girl was last seen alive. Young added that the discovery of the girl's body should help authorities ""hone the investigation, so you will (still) see searches conducted in different areas."" An autopsy will be conducted on Celina's body on Tuesday morning in Concord, New Hampshire, said Young. The medical examiner will work to determine the cause of the girl's death. Celina's father said that he had not spoken with his ex-wife, who lived in the house with the girl's stepfather of about a year, since the girl went missing. He described his ex-wife as a ""great mother,"" and added he had positive interaction with the stepfather. ""(It was) a household that supposedly gave her great love, that's what she always told me,"" Laro said. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","NEW: The father of Celina Cass, 11, describes her as ""beautiful"" and loving .

Of course, as Slaughter admits with a chuckle: ""We never see the probably 15 people on the 'childcare train' that I'm sure they drag along with them."" But Hollywood A-lister Pitt -- often seen splashed across celebrity magazines with his brood in tow -- nonetheless represents a shift in how society views men, she says. And that has big consequences for women. ""Why women still can't have it all"" Around a year-and-a-half ago, Slaughter was a hugely successful, though relatively unknown academic. Then, in the summer of 2012, she wrote an article in The Atlantic, ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All,"" and it became the most read in the publication's history, with over 224,000 people sharing it on Facebook. Why the huge response? In the article, Slaughter spoke of her decision to leave her job as the first female director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department, after two years working under Hilary Clinton. Commuting from New Jersey to Washington each week, Slaughter was getting up at 4.20am on Mondays and returned on Friday evenings -- all while her teenage son was having problems at school. And so she left her government job and returned to teaching at Princeton University: ""Because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible."" Beyond the women's movement . Now Slaughter is extending the debate on gender equality -- and focusing on men -- in this interview with CNN . ""The conversation has been tilted too far in the direction of women's issues, women's problems, missing women in the workforce. That is a huge issue. And it's appropriate that 60 years after the 'Feminine Mystique' was published, that we should be asking these questions. But I really see this issue as a much broader social issue -- as an issue of breadwinning on the one hand, and caregiving on the other."" ""Men's choices are actually still much more restricted than women's. Because although women no longer have to just be in the home, men are still pretty uniformly socialised to believe their place is in the office. And if we really want equality between men and women, we can't just measure it in terms of how well women succeed on traditional male terms, we have to measure it in terms of the degree of choices that women and men have."" ""About 20% of the responses I got to The Atlantic article I published, were from men. They said: 'I want to be a fully engaged father' or 'I want to take time to be with my parents as they age,' and 'If you think it's hard for a woman to ask for flexible hours, or work from home, or work part time, well if a man asked for those things, not only is he told he's not sufficiently committed to his career, he's told either explicitly or implicitly that he's not really one of the guys.'"" ""If you notice in comparison to 40 years ago, pretty much every male star you see is toting a baby, is out with his children, is equally engaged as a dad and proud of it. So that's an interesting marker on popular culture."" ""I said to my 16-year-old son: 'Would you mind if your wife out-earned you?' He looked at me at first and was like: 'Are you crazy?' And then he said: 'Guys who are really insecure about that are really insecure about something else.' And I thought: 'It's a different generation.'"" ""Why can't a man marry well? Why can't a man find a woman and marry and people say: 'Wow that was a great catch' and part of what that means is that she earns a great living and they're going to both live very comfortably, and they can provide caregiving and breadwinning however they want.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia abortion provider Kermit Gosnell was sentenced Wednesday to life with no parole in the death of one of three babies who died in his clinic. He received the same sentence in the two other deaths Tuesday. Gosnell, 72, was convicted Monday on three consecutive counts of first-degree murder for killing babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said he doubts there would be a doctor that would think three consecutive life sentences ""is not a deterrent,"" but admitted that there might be criticism that Gosnell didn't get death. ""We have shown him mercy where he failed to show mercy,"" Williams told reporters Wednesday. Williams' office announced Tuesday that Gosnell agreed give up his right to appeal in exchange for avoiding a possible death sentence. Judge Jeffrey Minehart, who rendered the decision, also sentenced Gosnell on Wednesday to 2Â½ to 5 years in the case of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during an abortion at Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic. Before sentencing, Mongar family attorney, Bernie Smalley Sr., delivered a statement on behalf of her family. ""She was a mother, a wife and a grandmother,"" Smalley said. ""They lost something that can never be returned."" Mother shares regrets amid trial . ""They will always mourn the loss."" Gosnell also was sentenced to 10 to 20 years each on two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. Those sentences will run concurrently. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 to 20 years for running a corrupt organization. When the judge asked if he had anything to say, Gosnell turned to his attorney Jack McMahon, smiled and said, ""Not at this time."" Defense attorney McMahon, in an impassioned, 2Â½-hour closing argument, said said that none of the infants were killed. Rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. After the Wednesday court appearance, McMahon said Gosnell did not believe his acts constituted homicide and said his clinic ""was not a house of horrors"" ""There was a lynching by the media prior to the trial,"" he said. ""Dr. Gosnell performed over 16,000 abortions, helped many young women."" McMahon said Gosnell knows that ""some of his methodology was wrong"" and that it was ""wrong to perform abortion past 24 weeks. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. ""He bent the rules but he's not a monster,"" McMahon said. After the hearing, jurors spoke and they said it was tough to look at images of victims during the trial. David Misko said Gosnell is ""more of a predator than a monster."" He said the trial was overwhelming and ""took an emotional toll."" Gosnell horror fuels fight for abortion laws . Gosnell's co-defendant, Eileen O'Neill, 56, was found guilty of conspiracy to operate a corrupt organization and two counts of theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine. O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions. She did not plead guilty. Eight people involved in Gosnell's clinic, called the Women's Medical Society, earlier pleaded guilty to various charges. Four of them pleaded guilty to murder. A grand jury report from 2011 says the ""people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself, and not even a single nurse,"" yet they still made diagnoses, performed procedures and administered drugs. Gosnell also was accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer at the clinic, the city's chief medical examiner Sam Gulino testified. Former employee Kareema Cross said Gosnell regularly performed illegal late-term abortions that he routinely recorded as ""24.5 weeks."" McMahon, who called no witnesses, accused prosecutors of ""the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system,"" even adding that they are ""elitist"" and ""racist."" Gosnell has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance. The doctor was first charged in January 2011. The case has drawn national attention and sharp criticism from anti-abortion activists.","Gosnell gets consecutive sentences of life without parole .

"(CNN) -- The use of drones to carry out military strikes is controversial, to say the least. U.S. lawmakers and international leaders continue to examine the legality of the unmanned attacks and whether their role in curbing terrorism outweighs the risk of unintended casualties. But British artist James Bridle has made up his mind -- and he's adopting Web and mobile tools to tell his side of the story. ""There are many ways to approach the use of drones, but being against it, my take is old school: raising awareness,"" he told CNN. ""This means not only knowing that drone strikes are happening, but knowing how we frame it, how we understand it."" His Dronestagram is a project that blends art and technology in an effort to show Americans, and others, a side of warfare that few will ever see in person. The project collects what it says are Google Earth images of the locations of drone strikes. The photos are then posted to Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo-sharing app more customarily used to share filtered images of skylines, cappuccinos and other much lighter fare. From there, they're pushed to popular blogging platform Tumblr and Twitter. The idea, Bridle said, is to make the strikes ""just a little bit more visible, a little closer, a little more real."" He notes the irony of using technology, from GPS location data to mobile social-sharing, to report on a uniquely high-tech form of warfare. ""History, like space, is co-produced by us and our technologies,"" Bridle told CNN. ""Those technologies include satellite mapping, social photo sharing from handheld devices, and fleets of flying death robots. ""We should engage with them at every level. ... We have gotten better at immediacy and intimacy online: Perhaps we can be better at empathy too."" A spokesman for the Department of Defense declined to comment to CNN about Dronestagram or U.S. drone activity. CNN Explains: U.S. Drones . The largely secretive U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies has transformed the nature of modern warfare, becoming a key weapon in the U.S. arsenal against suspected terrorists. Advocates see drones as an effective tool in the fight against extremists. Opponents worry about civilian casualties and loose oversight. While used for the past several years, the drone strikes have drawn increased attention in recent weeks since President Barack Obama nominated counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan to be the next head of the CIA. Brennan is considered by many to be the mastermind behind U.S. drone policy. A Senate committee vote on whether to confirm Brennan as CIA director is expected at the end of the month. The New America Foundation estimates that in Pakistan, between 1,953 and 3,279 people have been killed by drones since 2004 -- and that between 18% and 23% of them were not militants. The nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10% in 2012, the group says. In Yemen, the group estimates, between 646 and 928 people have been killed in a combination of drone strikes and airstrikes, and 623 to 860 of those killed were militants. About 2% of those killed have been ""high-level targets,"" the group said. Bridle, who describes himself as a ""writer, artist, publisher, technologist and a number of other things"" on his website, launched Dronestagram in October. The Instagram account now has about 6,600 followers, with about 2,400 on Twitter and more checking in on the Tumblr blog. Bridle uses media reports and local government sites to find the locales for his images. Many, he says, are in remote areas where information on exact locations is scarce; so if a precise location is unavailable he uses satellite views near the reported location. ""I'm always concerned about misrepresentation, but I also make it as clear as possible in the project description that these are not exact locations, and they're the best I can do,"" he said. It's definitely far from perfect, and I'm sure mistakes have been made, but I just try to be clear about that."" To some observers, that undercuts the impact of his project. ""It's not like you have the exact longitude and latitude of each strike,"" said Peter Bergen, a CNN national-security analyst. ""As an art project, this (Dronestagram) is interesting,"" Bergen said. ""As a piece of actual journalism ... it seems quite off."" Bridle also uses information from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a British independent nonprofit organization which compiles local reports of drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. The debate over the use of attack drones will no doubt continue, even as U.S. troops continue to draw down in places like Afghanistan, reducing the number of combatants apt to encounter militants face-to-face. And Bridle says he'll continue trying to put people at the scene of the strikes -- even if it's only through the screens of their smartphones, tablets or desktop computers. ""It's about trying to make it literally visible,"" he said. ""The very nature of this kind of warfare makes the perpetrators, the victims, the landscape, essentially invisible."" CNN's Brandon Griggs and Doug Gross contributed to this story.","Dronestagram aims to show the impact of drone strikes .

"(CNN) -- The legendary Jack Nicklaus may have won the most titles, a 21-year-old Tiger Woods may have been the youngest champion and Gary Player may have made the most appearances, but a little-known Chinese golfer will be added to the illustrious list of Masters record-holders on Thursday. For when Guan Tianlang steps onto the first tee, the Chinese teenager will become the youngest competitor -- at the age of 14 years and five months -- in the 80 years of the prestigious Augusta event, beating the previous record held by then 16-year-old Matteo Manassero. The boy who has been taking time out of school in his home city Guangzhou earned his place at golf's top table when, as the youngest player in the field, he beat a host of senior players to win last year's Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Thailand. He is just the latest of a small but expanding list of teenage -- and, remarkably, even pre-teen -- golfers to be impacting upon the highest echelons of golf, despite being drawn from a playing pool estimated to be no more than 600 teenage boys and girls. Guan was just 13 when he became the youngest player to ever contest a European Tour event in 2012, the same year that Andy Zhang, then 14, became the youngest player in the history of the U.S. Open -- while that year's Women's British Open found the youngest Chinese female golfer to ever contest a major, Jing Yan, then 16. Cultural Revolution . Just last month, all were slightly upstaged by Ye Wocheng, who became the youngest golfer to qualify for a European Tour event -- at the age of just 12. Yes, that's right. Twelve. ""I don't think there's another country in the world that is putting as much into golf as China -- in terms of the resources, energy and money,"" says Michael Dickie, the Scotland-born head coach of China's women's Olympic team. ""Look at most other countries, they support players as amateurs but the support stops once they get to pro -- then, they're on their own and have to do it themselves. ""But our girls -- all they need to do is train. We do the logistics, which tournaments will suit them and where they should train. We also have a physio, fitness instructor, technical coaches and people arranging logistics, visa, flights and hotels. ""And the state is paying for it all. It is like a monster sponsorship program."" Of course, it wasn't always thus. Opinion: For Tiger, winning does take care of everything . During China's Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, golf was considered to be too bourgeois a pastime and any existing courses were dug up, with the land returned to farmers. Eight years after Chairman Mao's death, though, the first modern-day golf course was built -- in 1984 -- even if there was still a reluctance to invest fully in the sport in the nominally communist nation. Eye-wateringly expensive . For with its 1.35 billion inhabitants representing nearly 20% of the world population -- yet the country's landmass amounting to just 6% of the planet's total land area -- land in China is decidedly scarce. So it makes no sense for politicians to allocate great swathes to golf courses, especially given ecological concerns -- primarily over water use -- that accompany their operational capacity and the association with the wealthy elite. While the number of courses has quietly tripled in the last decade to over 600, golf is still very much a minority sport and even though significant growth is expected with the expansion of a middle class predicted to have doubled its 2010 level of 52 million by 2015, the sport is still eye-wateringly expensive. So much so that a 2008 survey by professional services company KPMG established the average initiation cost of joining a Chinese golf club to be $53,000, with a regular round costing around $150 -- way beyond the reach of all but a fraction of the population. But help is at hand for some following a decision taken in 2009 in, of all places, the Danish capital Copenhagen. That was where the executive board of the International Olympic Committee voted to return golf to the Games in 2016 after a 112-year absence. Overnight, the Chinese government -- which boasts a long history of investing in Olympic sports -- finally had a reason to back golf. Although figures are hard to come by, the intensity of their training programs indicates just how seriously the Chinese are taking a potential fairway to medals. At his academy in Shanghai, Dickie has a team of 15 Olympic hopefuls, eight of whom attend full-time training, which is funded by a state who get value for money -- with the girls training six days a week if they are not contesting a tournament. ""On a normal day, we get up at 0630 and do a fitness session for an hour,"" he says. ""After breakfast, we train until midday, when we rest until 1400. ""Then another two hours of training and then an hour of fitness training -- we are heavy on fitness training -- so it's three hours of fitness and five hours of golf. Quite intense."" Chinese ambition . Improving the players' ranking is the major aim of the program, for the top 15 in the world gain automatic berths to Rio de Janeiro in 2016, following which another 45 competitors will be chosen -- with a maximum of two available players from each country that does not already have two or more players among the top 15. A further indication of the Chinese ambition is that Australian legend Greg Norman has been formally brought on board to advise and identify the country's best golf talent, which is largely drawn from privileged backgrounds -- for obvious reasons -- but he won't struggle with one name for the ladies category. Last year, Feng Shanshan -- now 23 -- became the first Chinese golfer to win a major when she claimed the LPGA Championship by two strokes, five years after she had earned her place on the LPGA Tour as a teenage amateur. Ranked No. 8 in the world, she does not train with the team in Shanghai but looks a certainty for Brazil -- especially since the next best Chinese female golfers are ranked 160th and 285th respectively, whose improvements represent the major challenge for Dickie, Norman and co. Those working on the country's male golfers have an even harder task, for there are only three Chinese in the top 500, with Liang Wenchong -- the 34-year-old whose best finish, by some distance, was eighth place in the 2010 U.S. PGA -- leading the way in 169th place. But it won't be long before the fruits of China's investment -- now reaching the grassroots for the first time -- will be clear for world golf fans to see, says a man who knows just a thing or two about the sport. ""In China, they are incredibly passionate and you see how the game is growing,"" says Hank Haney, who coached Tiger Woods for six years and who now runs several golf schools. ""I know from my academy that Asian golfers are incredibly great students -- they're very, very focused and without a doubt, we're going to see more and more great golfers coming from Asian. ""It won't be long before China is a big part of that."" Perhaps just as long as it takes for Guan Tianlang, Andy Zhang, Ye Wocheng and the rest to exit their teenage years.","Guan Tianlang will become the youngest player in Masters history on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- In Syria, not all rebels carry guns, some carry cameras. Charif Kiwan heads up Abounaddara, a collective of Syrian filmmakers who are hoping to affect change in how the Syrian conflict is portrayed, both by President Bashar al-Assad and the media at large. Abounaddara's members -- all volunteer, all anonymous -- create short films, generally two to five minutes long, in which they give a voice to ordinary citizens. They try to capture the day-to-day lives of Syrians, whether they live inside the country, in a nearby refugee camp, or further abroad in exile. After editing, the films are posted to video-sharing site Vimeo every Friday. ""The idea is to make films that allow the universal viewer to feel something without knowing anything about Syria,"" says Kiwan. The film's subjects can be anybody -- a soldier with the Free Syrian Army, a widowed shopkeeper or a young woman arguing her right not to wear a veil. They, too, are anonymous; their names are never revealed, nor are their locations. ""We try to make the viewer ask himself questions. We want to make him reconsider the representation of this conflict,"" says Kiwan. ""There are anonymous men and women who are fighting for their freedom, no matter if they are Christian or Muslim, soldiers or loyalists. We just focus on the shared humanity and deep humanity that is in everyone."" Who shapes the narrative? Kiwan believes that President al-Assad has been very savvy when it comes to managing his image and that of the war. A prime example is how the Syrian leader has depicted all rebels as ""terrorists"". ""Assad is saying, 'I am a good guy. I may be a dictator, but I am a gentleman fighting against Islamists. You may not like me, but support me, because we have the same enemy.' He's succeeding in making the world believe that's the case,"" he says. Since the conflict started over three years ago, Assad has set up an Instagram account that depicts him as the benevolent dictator -- kissing babies and waving to cheering crowds. He has also allegedly sought to control the information that leaves his country through internet blackouts, while the Syrian Electronic Army has tried to manage public opinion by hacking the websites and social media accounts of major news organizations, including The New York Times and Associated Press, and infiltrating them with pro-Assad missives. ""We don't face the same dangers as journalists or citizen reporters, and we're not fighting with weapons, but the regime views everyone who carries a camera as an enemy, so it's still very, very dangerous,"" says Kirwan. ""In Syria, the image can kill. It's really true."" Kiwan equates Abounaddara with snipers, training their sights on the regime. ""When we started in 2010, in order to film anything in Syria, you had to ask permission from the censors,"" he says. ""Our idea was that if we used the internet, and didn't chose political subjects openly, the censor wouldn't see anything."" Making it difficult to care . Abounaddara doesn't rely on violence to get the message across. For Kiwan, a stronger message is one that doesn't involve bloodshed. ""The mainstream media relies on images of people who have been wounded or killed, but then we as a people are associated with misery. It's voyeurism,"" says Kiwan. ""You make people more accepting of the destruction. They viewer thinks, 'OK, they are dying, but they are not like me.' We believe that the only way to protect people is to show their image with dignity. Once you see them that way, you can feel their humanity, and you cannot accept the situation as easily."" Getting noticed . Abounaddara is starting to garner some attention of its own. ""Of God and Dogs,"" a film in which a soldier in the Free Syrian Army confesses to killing an innocent man, won the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. A selection of shorts were also screened in London as part of the Human Rights Watch film festival. ""It's important for us that we get recognized as film makers by our colleagues around the world, because this protects us from political tutelage,"" says Kiwan.","Syrian film collective Abounaddara posts weekly short movies to Vimeo .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- It's a subject seldom addressed publicly in the Palestinian territories, but for the first time, a report is lifting the veil on the taboo topic of female trafficking and forced prostitution -- and calling for action to stop it. Trafficking and forced prostitution in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza operate on a small-scale basis, rather than being part of a sophisticated and organized activity, the report found. But the two practices are also frequent and widespread -- and the women and girls involved have few means of escape. The 26-page report, released Wednesday and titled ""Trafficking and Forced Prostitution of Palestinian Women and Girls: Forms of Modern Day Slavery,"" was researched and written by SAWA, a nonprofit Palestinian group that combats violence against women. SAWA received support for the report from UNIFEM, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, which is making the report available online. Getting information for the report -- which was completed in June 2008 but published only now -- was difficult because of the stigma suffered by the victims and the sensitivity of the subject within Palestinian society, SAWA said. Explaining the delay between completing the research and publishing the report, UNIFEM spokesman Julien Vaissier said it took a long time to analyze the data from the field, and staff in Gaza were also forced in January of this year to turn their attention to victims of the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. ""Dating [the report] 2009 would have been misleading, because the data was collected in 2008,"" he said. ""It was hard for us to publish it, and it took us a long time to decide how, whom and why, because of the situation and the sensitivity of the subject,"" SAWA representative Jalal Khader added. The report found that unemployment and poverty play a major role in pushing girls and women into prostitution and making them vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers. Most of the women have also been ""violently abused by their families, especially their fathers,"" the report found. The trafficked women who spoke to researchers said they had been ""battered continuously"" at home, then forced into marriage, often facing further violence at the hands of their husbands. The situation is no better if the trafficked women and girls are accompanied by pimps or madams, who threaten the girls with violence if they refuse sex with clients. In one case, a trafficker called ""W"" threatened to inform a girl's family if she tried to escape and to disseminate embarrassing pictures of her engaged in sexual activity. Researchers found no studies or reports on the issue, just local newspaper reports on specific cases, SAWA said. They did manage to conduct 11 face-to-face interviews with ""informants,"" or Palestinians willing to speak out about the problem. Those included police officers, victims' lawyers, taxi drivers and hotel owners. Field researchers also managed to conduct in-person interviews with three trafficked women and included their case studies in the report. SAWA said its groundbreaking report is not meant as a comprehensive study, but rather an initial step in identifying the problem. ""For the first time, people have chosen to break the silence and speak out, and this briefing paper can be seen as a first step to start answering the need for protecting women and girl victims of trafficking and forced prostitution in the [occupied Palestinian territories],"" the report says. If the victimized women somehow escape their situations, they face further problems on several fronts. The report found there are few social networks or shelter houses to which they can turn, that they may be ostracized by their communities and families, and that the law may treat them as criminals. The first case study in the report is of a 23-year-old married mother of three from Jerusalem. A Palestinian, she says her father used to abuse her violently on a daily basis, tightening a belt around her neck until she fainted, then forcing her to live in the basement for days without food. After the woman's father forced her into marriage at 16, her husband raped her on their wedding night, then continued to beat her, she said. She ran away from home and met two men who promised her shelter and employment in Israel -- but instead, when she got there, she was kept in a house and forced to be a prostitute, she said. When she once refused to sleep with a client, the woman said her pimp called her father, who took her home and hit her violently until she fainted. She now lives at a safe house, the report said. In another case, a field researcher overheard two women talking in the front seat of a public taxi on the way from Jerusalem to the West Bank city of Ramallah. The woman told her friend she was unable to obtain a birth certificate for a baby fathered by one of her former clients at a brothel. The woman said she was forced to leave the brothel after becoming pregnant and now didn't know what to do: ""I went to the social services in Jerusalem, but they could not help me either,"" she was overheard as saying. A lack of willingness by law enforcement to investigate these cases and prosecute the traffickers -- along with criminalizing the victims' behavior -- only compounds the problem, the report said. The Palestinian territories use a hodgepodge of laws applicable to different areas, which also makes it difficult to take action, the report said. The report calls on Palestinian governmental organizations to draft new legislation guaranteeing that girls and women are treated as victims of crime and not as offenders, and referring to forced prostitution as sexual violence. It also urges civil groups to document cases of forced prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes and to push the government to change the law. The United Nations defines human trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, harboring or receipt of people by force, coercion, fraud or abuse of power. Traffickers seek to exploit their victims for sexual purposes, forced labor or removal of organs, SAWA said.","Trafficking, forced prostitution in Jerusalem, West Bank, Gaza called small scale but frequent .

"(CNN) -- The larger-than-life story of baseball great Jackie Robinson will open on the big screen this month along with the beginning of the new baseball season. ""42"" is slated to open on April 12, just three days before the 66th anniversary of Robinson's debut game that broke baseball's color barrier. The film follows Robinson, the first African-American to play Major League Baseball, as he plays for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and highlights the bond that formed between Robinson and Dodgers general manager and president, Branch Rickey. Rickey is played by Harrison Ford, who was not originally on the shortlist for the part. ""The filmmakers didn't send (the script) to me, I just happened upon it,"" Ford recently told CNN. ""I came through backdoor channels and I read it and I thought this is a great opportunity to play this character if anybody's interested in seeing me about it."" Except no one was. ""They would not have known about my ambition to play this kind of character in a faithful way ... to approach it as a character actor and be willing and ready to let loose of my former career as a leading man."" After some persuasion, Ford landed the role of Rickey -- although, true to his intent to get lost in the character, you might not even recognize him in the part. When it came to casting Robinson, writer/director Brian Helgeland, who has previously written screenplays for ""Man on Fire"" and ""A Knight's Tale,"" knew upon meeting Chadwick Boseman that he wanted him to fill the uniform. The actor, who's previously appeared on TV in shows like ""Lincoln Heights"" and ""Persons Unknown,"" was directing an off-Broadway play at the time of his audition, but just so happened to be in Los Angeles when his agent called about ""42."" But though Helgeland knew right away, ""I definitely didn't know right away,"" Boseman told CNN. After reading for Helgeland the first time, ""I came in the next week and read for him again, and realized that he already made his decision and he was trying to prove it to somebody else.

Boseman played some Little League baseball as a kid and describes himself as an athlete. ""So it wasn't like I couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time,"" he joked. But he obviously needed practice in order to emulate one of the best in the history of baseball. ""We did spring training from the middle of January to May,"" he said. ""We prepared as if we were going to play a game."" In order to see how he was shaping up in his attempt to accurately bring Robinson's skills to life, Boseman would watch a split-screen of his own practices next to some of Robinson's Hall of Fame footage -- so he could see ""how bad I was"" compared to Robinson. Like Boseman, Ford logged hours extensively researching his character, working to understand the ins and outs of the sport, though he's not a huge sports fan generally. ""I researched the character and the history, and I know the history. I know the circumstances that took place and the character of our nation at the time, but I didn't know much about the man: Branch Rickey,"" Ford said. ""There was a lot of research material and I took advantage of all of it, and studied it."" As for the reason we haven't seen more Jackie Robinson biopics flood cineplexes, Ford muses that it might be because Robinson's wife, Rachel, has been careful with her husband's legacy.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rare Lincoln manuscript sold for $3.4 million on Thursday at Sotheby's auction house. The 1864 letter in which Abraham Lincoln replies to the abolitionist pleas of 195 young boys and girls was bought by a private American collector over the phone. The sale of the letter, from the Dr. Robert Small Trust, set a record for a Lincoln manuscript, a presidential manuscript and any American manuscript ever auctioned, Sotheby's spokeswoman Susan Ollinick said. The ""Little People's Petition"" had asked Lincoln ""to free all the little slave children of this country."" Lincoln wrote, ""Please tell these little people I am very glad their young hearts are so full of just and generous sympathy and that, while I have not the power to grant all they ask, I trust they will remember that God has, and that, as it seems, He wills to do it."" Although Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had declared freedom for all slaves held in areas ""in rebellion"" against the United States as of January 1, 1863, full abolition of slavery was not accomplished until adoption of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution late in 1865. The letter had been expected to sell for $3 million to $5 million. About 20 Lincoln documents were among the 111 items for sale from the Small Trust. Also included were other documents from U.S. presidents, including pages from George Washington's diary and correspondence from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams; a rare document signed by both Meriwether Lewis and William Clark; about 10 documents from Robert E. Lee; and documents from John Brown, Samuel Clemens, Orville Wright and others. E-mail to a friend .","Letter is president's reply to children asking him to free slaves .

"Macau (CNN) -- Triad attacks. Prostitute calling cards. Illicit money flows. This is the dark underbelly of Macau -- Asia's gambling capital. The only Chinese territory where casinos are permitted, the city has transformed itself in little more than a decade from a sleepy backwater to a neon-lit monument to China's passion for gambling. Gambling revenues in the city surpassed Las Vegas in 2006 and are now six times greater. But the former Portuguese colony's dramatic rise has come at a cost, with many in Macau questioning whether growth has been too fast and furious. ""You really don't know whether society as a whole has benefited,"" said Samuel Huang, an associate professor in gambling studies at the Macau Polytechnic Institute. Portuguese lawyer Jorge Menezes, 47, has experienced first hand the city's more brutal side. Last month, he was attacked in broad daylight by two men as he walked his five-year-old son to pre-school in what he believes was an intimidation attempt linked to his work as a lawyer. ""I was walking with my son and suddenly I felt a huge blow on the back of my head,"" he told CNN from his office just a block away from where the attack took place. ""I turned around, already bleeding, and he threw another blow toward my head and then a second guy came at me from behind. ""I couldn't run away because my son was there. I needed to protect him."" Menezes, who injured his wrist and required stitches to his head, said the two assailants each had a brick tied to one of their hands. ""I was told it's a technique used by mafioso in mainland China, because they can carry it without being seen as a weapon."" A spokesman for Macau's Public Security Police, confirmed that the lawyer was attacked by two Chinese men brandishing hard objects who later fled. They added the case was under investigation. In the run-up to the city's return to China, gang violence was commonplace, claiming the lives of some 37 people in 1999 alone -- though violent crime became rarer as the city's gaming market boomed. However, some recent cases have unsettled residents. In 2012, a longtime operator of VIP casino junkets, Ng Man-sun, was beaten by six men in his hotel in what was reportedly a dispute with his ex-lover. The city also feared a return to violence after the release of a notorious gangster known as Wan Kuok-kio or ""Broken Tooth"" in December after 15 years in prison. WATCH: 'Broken Tooth' released from prison . Menezes says he rarely goes out to socialize and he cannot think of a personal motive for the attack: ""I have no doubt that it's linked to work. It is definitely an attempt to intimidate me or put me out of action for a few months. ""I was working on cases that could bring direct or collateral damage -- collateral in the sense that there are third parties that are affected by what I am doing,"" he said, declining to say who he thought was behind the attack. As a precaution, he has recruited a security guard cum secretary, but Menezes says he intends to stay put and continue representing his clients. Steve Vickers, a former intelligence officer with the Hong Kong police and a specialist in triad activities, claimed Macau's gaming sector retains deep ties to organized crime. ""The scene has changed over the past 10 years as the pie has vastly increased,"" said Vickers, who now runs a specialist risk mitigation and corporate intelligence consultancy SVA. ""It's not the cowboy town it was when Broken Tooth was running around. ""The big boys have moved in ... and they do not want visible street fights, with people being beaten up because it's bad for business and brings attention."" By and large, Macau remains a safe place with 182 violent crimes reported in the first three months of this year, up one from the same period a year earlier, according to figures from the Secretary for Security. The city is home to 500,000 people, while Macau's three dozen casinos attract more than 28 million visitors a year. Vickers says that while the city's big casinos, some owned by U.S. tycoons Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, operate correctly and legally, they work in a ""messy environment."" They are reliant on income from high rollers and these VIPs are usually brought in from China by junket operators. ""The junkets are an integral part of the gaming scene and they facilitate the transfer of funds, the finding of the high rollers and they facilitate the breaching of Chinese capital controls. ""You won't find their names on the front (door) but the hard reality is that Chinese junkets are largely controlled by triad societies."" China tightly controls the amount of money individuals can take out of the country, with a limit of 20,000 yuan ($3,262) per day and citizens traveling to Macau, which is considered a special administrative region, are subject to these limits. However, China has turned a blind eye to the abuse of capital controls, said Vickers although he added, this could change as the country's new leaders look to crack down on corruption amid worries about officials funneling money through the city. Macau government officials did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. The triads are also said to be involved in prostitution rings, another bone of contention for local Macau residents -- although prostitution is not illegal. Macau is on a U.S. State Department watch list for human trafficking and according to the 2012 report, criminal syndicates are involved in recruitment. It says many women fall prey to false advertisements for casino jobs but upon arrival are forced into prostitution. Many of the city's sidewalks and underpasses are littered with prostitutes' calling cards and fliers for saunas and pole dancing clubs. ""I don't know how to explain this to my children,"" said Huang at the Macau Polytechnic Institute. Authorities are keen to diversify Macau's appeal and turn the city into a broader entertainment destination that attracts families and not just casino goers. New resorts boast attractions like wave pools, fake beaches and high-class dining but there's little evidence that sales of spa treatments and slap-up meals will ever begin to approach revenue from the gambling tables. ""I don't think promoting a more family-friendly environment will be easy,"" said Huang.","Macau home to three dozen casinos and six times bigger than Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- In a sudden turnaround this week, the Mexican government will provide vigilante groups fighting a drug cartel in western Mexico a path to become recognized, moving away from earlier calls for the groups to disarm. The state of Michoacan, long a flashpoint in Mexico's drug war, has of late been the scene of fighting between a cartel calling itself the Knights Templar and so-called ""auto-defense"" groups that have armed themselves and patrolled the streets. The vigilante groups grew from complaints that the government was not doing enough to protect citizens from the drug cartel. The government acted this month, sending federal forces to the region and ordering the vigilante groups to lay down their weapons. But Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto appears to have abandoned that call, and instead announced a plan wherein the vigilante forces -- if they meet certain criteria -- can become part of a government-sanctioned Rural Defense Corps. Those members of the auto-defense forces who want to be part of the government forces will be required to pass all the tests that other Mexican law enforcement does, PeÃ±a Nieto said. ""The government is obligated to provide peace and tranquility to Michoacan, that is what the majority wants,"" one of the president's supporters, lawmaker Emilio Gamboa Patron, told the state-run Notimex news agency. ""The grand majority does not want to live in violence."" The about-face comes as officials said they arrested a high-ranking leader of the Knights Templar. Dionisio Loya Plancarte was arrested in Morelia, Michoacan's capital, on Monday morning by federal forces, the executive secretary of the National System of Public Security, Monte Alejandro Rubido, said. Loya Plancarte was a major drug trafficking figure in Morelia, the official said. He is known for distributing videos online that reported on cartel activity and threatened other criminal organizations, Rubido said. A 16-year-old minor was apprehended along with the drug cartel figure, Rubido said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and CNNMexico contributed to this report.","Mexico says vigilante groups will have a path to become institutionalized .

"Kigali, Rwanda (CNN) -- Every year, beginning in April, Rwanda's government urges its citizens to ""Kwibuka"" -- the Rwandan word for ""remember."" To remember the hundreds of thousands of lives lost during the country's 1994 genocide. But all Marie Jeanne wants to do is to forget. The 36-year-old's entire family was slaughtered during that dark period in her small East African country's history. The massacre saw Hutu militias and civilians alike murder vast numbers of members of the Tutsi ethnic minority: Men, women and children, many of whom had been their neighbors before the conflict began. The killings finally came to an end 100 days later, when Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops, led by Paul Kagame, defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the country. To Marie Jeanne the end of the war also meant an end to the repeated, brutal rapes she had been forced to endure at the hands of many different men. ""Wherever we used to go and meet a roadblock at least two would rape you and release you,"" she tells CNN. ""Some could let you go and others would hold you for longer."" The genocide left Marie Jeanne emotionally and physically scarred, HIV+ and pregnant. She was just 16 years old. Community members gave her shelter and she says some of the women told her they would help her with the abortion she so desperately requested. But as time passed, she knew they had lied to her. Then, the labor pains came. Marie Jeanne says it was some time before she could finally look at her newborn baby girl, who she named Kirezi. And 20 years on, Marie Jeanne says her daughter's birthday is still a source of pain to her. ""I never remember the birthday of my child because there was nothing good about it,"" she says. ""I have never celebrated her birthday because most of the times I never want to remember it."" Kirezi mirrors her mother's pain. Seated on a wooden chair in their small living room, she fiddles with a bead bracelet on her wrist. Her lips tremble as she tries to bare her soul to us. Her anguish is palpable. ""I was born going through all bad things, so I feel that I don't really care about my birthday. Birthdays are for people who are happy only,"" she says. ""It's painful - it hurts me, I always ask myself and I lose all my courage. I ask myself why I existed. And ask myself why it happened. And I feel that I am not worth anything. It makes me so sad,"" she cries. Marie Jeanne says she loves her daughter and would do anything for her, but at times she feels that her daughter is a constant, painful reminder of the horrors she went through two decades ago. ""Within thirty minutes my heart can change and I feel bad against her in my heart,"" she says. ""Whenever I see her, I remember so many things."" Marie Jeanne unscrews a plastic bottle containing anti-retroviral tablets (ARVs). The medicine, taken twice daily, is helping her stave off the worst symptoms of HIV/AIDS. For now. ""During the genocide, the militia deliberately infected women with HIV,"" Odette Kayirere, co-ordinator at the Association of the Widows of Rwanda (AVEGA), explains. At the AVEGA headquarters in Kigali, genocide survivors with HIV/AIDS line up to receive ARVs. Most have similar stories to Marie Jeanne. Passed on from attacker to attacker, they contracted the AIDS virus. For them, this is the legacy of the genocide. ""It was a plan,"" says Marie Jeanne. ""Their aim was to make genocide carry on."" But Kirezi is determined to unchain herself from the dark past. Instead she dreams of a brighter future. ""I want to be a very important person,"" she says. ""To help people in similar situations as me, vulnerable people like orphans, and also to be a minister.""","Rwandan genocide took place 20 years ago: Hutu militia massacred members of the Tutsi ethnic minority .
Many of those who survived the carnage were left scarred; rape was used as a weapon, spreading HIV .
Marie Jeanne's daughter Kirezi was born as a result of rape; two decades on this still pains both of them .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the space of 48 hours, Secretary of State John Kerry likened climate change to a weapon of mass destruction, Newt Gingrich called Kerry delusional, Sunday talk shows argued about it and President Barack Obama announced another executive action to combat it. After what seemed like a lull in political focus on the issue, why is everyone talking about it this week? A convergence of events and factors -- blizzards in the East and drought out West, an administration acting on oft-stated intentions, the pending Keystone pipeline decision -- have renewed debate on a topic that alternately captures attention or numbs the public. Here are five reasons why it is being discussed now: . 1) Obama walks the talk . The President had pledged action on climate change since before he entered the Oval Office five years ago, and he renewed his commitment in his second inaugural address as well as last month's State of the Union address. However, he spent his first-term political capital on stimulus programs in response to the recession and then health care reforms, instead of carbon cap legislation sought by his liberal base. Faced with relentless Republican opposition to his agenda in a divided Congress, Obama promised to take more executive action in 2014 to get around what Democrats call an obstructionist GOP strategy. He also brought on stronger voices for combating climate change, including Kerry, who became secretary of state last year, and John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who headed the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. ""Before there were certainly many people in the administration, including the President, who had a public commitment to the notion of doing something about climate change,"" noted David Goldston, the director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a major environmental group. ""Now there's a plan. ... They are ready to move."" In his first term, Obama set tougher emissions standards for cars and trucks and on Tuesday, he instructed environmental and transportation agencies to work on the next round of higher gas mileage requirements for big trucks that he said comprise 4% of all vehicles on the road but cause 20% of their carbon pollution. The presidential moves don't require congressional approval, unlike a new $1 billion climate change preparedness fund that Obama proposed last week. With elections coming in November, congressional approval of such a funding proposal looks impossible. ""There's no way on Earth he's going to get $1 billion out of this Congress to do anything, let alone fight climate change,"" USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers told ""Fox News Sunday."" 2) Extreme weather . Frigid temperatures and heavy snow up North, ice storms down South and drought out West instigated a new round of the now familiar debate over whether climate change causes such extreme weather. Opponents of aggressive action against climate change, such as Republicans protecting the oil and coal energy industries, question if any link to weather exists and how much human activity contributes to it. ""What we have to look at is the fact that you don't make good laws, sustainable laws when you're making them on hypotheses or theories or unproven sciences,"" GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee argued Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Her comment brought a sharp response from Bill Nye, known as the Science Guy from the PBS program. ""There is no debate in the scientific community, and I can encourage the congresswoman to really look at the facts,"" Nye said on NBC. ""You are a leader. We need you to change things, not deny what's happening."" To Nye, the benefits from reducing carbon emissions should be obvious to anyone, whether or not they agree that climate change contributes to the increasing weather extremes. ""The fewer very dirty coal-fired power plants we have, the better,"" he said. ""The less energy we waste, the better. The less inefficient our transportation systems are, the better. The more reliable our electricity transmission systems are, the better."" Powers, the USA Today columnist, said on Fox that the environmental lobby and the politicians supporting tougher climate change action should emphasize the benefits of reducing pollution, rather than talking about the weather. ""Less pollution is definitely a good thing, so that might be a better way to make the argument rather than claiming that climate change is the cause of every single thing that happens with the weather,"" she said. 3) Kerry's trip to climate change hotbeds . On an extended trip to Asia, the longtime advocate for firm action to reduce carbon emissions went to two countries at the center of the debate -- China and Indonesia. China is the world's biggest carbon emitter, with the United States close behind, and the two global powers have so far balked at working out new global emissions limits as part of an international climate change treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. Last week, Kerry announced in Beijing that the two nations would work together on efforts to ""move the climate change process forward"" in advance of the next major global climate change conference -- in France in 2015. On Sunday, he delivered one of the strongest speeches on climate change by any American official while visiting Indonesia, which has lost more than 40% of its tropical forests that store carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. Anyone still arguing against the reality of climate change was ""simply burying their heads in the sand,"" Kerry said, adding that he and President Obama ""believe very deeply that we do not have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society."" In one sense, he continued, ""climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction."" Kerry also called it ""the greatest challenge of our generation."" His speech evoked a protest from Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and GOP presidential candidate, who posted on Twitter that ""every American who cares about national security must demand"" Kerry's resignation, adding that ""a delusional secretary of state is dangerous to our safety."" ""This is not some U.S. senator just having some wild speech to please the left,"" Gingrich, a host of CNN's ""Crossfire,"" said Tuesday. He argued that Kerry, a former senator who now is the top U.S. diplomat, should be held to a ""higher level of seriousness."" Kerry: Climate change as big a threat as terrorism, poverty, WMDs . 4) Keystone decision pending . A Republican attack on Kerry comes as no surprise, because as secretary of state, he will make his department's decision on whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada that has become a political lightning rod. The issue has loomed for years, prompting supporters of the project to accuse the Obama administration of stalling to appease his liberal base. It pits the oil industry and its Republican backers against environmentalists and liberal Democrats who complain the project bolsters the especially dirty fossil fuel production from the tar sands of northern Alberta. However, the politics get messy for Democrats, because organized labor supports the project that will create several thousand jobs. Kerry's history makes it appear highly unlikely he would approve the pipeline project, but the final call will certainly come from Obama. His chief of staff, Denis McDonough, recently said a decision would likely take months while the full review process plays out. Republicans impatient with what they consider to be a political stall, now until after the congressional elections in November, have urged Obama to use his executive authority to approve the project. U.S. report on Keystone indicates little climate impact . 5) It's an election year . Election-year politics always harden positions, and the bitter partisan divide in Washington means little chance for progress on any major initiatives such as immigration reform or deficit reduction. In that political environment, climate change becomes an easy issue for either side to use to attack the other. Goldston of the NRDC noted that another major environmental decision is likely in 2014 -- the administration's new limits on carbon emissions for existing power plants. Under Obama, the EPA in January proposed new rules for emission levels at future plants, which opponents called an effort to prevent additional coal-fired power plants from being built. A further step to also limit emissions from existing plants, which is expected as soon as June, could shut some of them down and would certainly inflame the debate. ""All this stuff has been in the works,"" Goldston said, noting that such administrative steps get opponents ""more publicly active"" and spawns more raucous exchanges. ""Obviously, controversy gets attention,"" he said. ""It's all part and parcel of forward movement on the policy side."" U.S. sets up 'climate hubs' to help rural communities affected by extreme weather .

"(CNN) -- Afghan voters will go to the polls on April 5 in what could be one of the most significant presidential elections in the country's turbulent history. The third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, it marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country, with incumbent Hamid Karzai -- who is constitutionally bound to step down -- handing over the reins. With NATO troops scheduled to pull out of Afghanistan by the end of the year, and following the refusal of Karzai to sign a bilateral agreement -- the so-called Status of Forces Agreement -- with the U.S. to keep some troops in-country, Afghan security is in the hands of the next man to be sworn in. Karzai, once the darling of the West but long since fallen out of favor amid cries of corruption and cronyism, was widely credited with engineering the result last time out, but hopes are high that this election will yield a genuine result -- with the proviso that recent Taliban-orchestrated violence does not disrupt polling. Out of a field of eleven candidates, analysts believe there are three serious contenders, Abdullah Abdullah, Arshaf Ghani and Zalmai Rassoul. ""Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah are campaigning on the implicit message that they will bring change,"" Martine van Bijlert, Co-director, Afghanistan Analysts Network (AAN) told CNN from Kabul. ""Abdullah has long tried to be a leader of the opposition. Ashraf Ghani is going on the impression of being a highly educated man, very serious. So the two of them are trying to give this impression of change. Zalmai Rassoul is presenting himself as the favored candidate of the president ... representing continuity."" If next Sunday's poll doesn't produce a clear winner, the top two backed candidates will enter a runoff. However, a back-room deal may be struck to avoid this scenario, van Bijlert says, in order to avoid dragging on an election which is likely to be contentious. CNN takes a look at the three main contenders to be Afghanistan's next leader. Abdullah Abdullah . An ophthalmologist and former Northern Alliance medic in a previous life, Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power and although he was a previous Karzai ally, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years been a thorn in the side of the man who has ruled Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. This urbane politician, known for his eloquence -- and his elegance -- took on Karzai in 2009's election but dropped out after the first round in protest to what he saw as large-scale voter fraud. His campaign this time around has been wracked with violence, with three separate attacks by militants on Abdullah campaigners in the past few weeks., according to the Afghan news agency, Khaama. ""The environment is not risk free, but when I look at the enthusiasm of the Afghan people to participate in the elections -- that is part of it is encouraging. It is highly encouraging,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this year. As with many countries, both democratic and otherwise, loyalty along ethnic lines matters a great deal in Afghanistan. Pashtuns make up more than half of the population in this multi-ethnic country, with Tajiks the second-largest group, and a number of minor Turkic and other ethnic groups. Part Tajik and part Pashtun, Abdullah is considered a relative outsider given his background. He is generally associated with his Tajik side, giving him a possible advantage in reaching out to non-Pashtun voters, but which may work against him if he is forced into a runoff and the other candidates back his Pashtun challenger. He is seen as a relatively liberal candidate and advocate of women's engagement in public life, telling Britain's Independent newspaper, ""If you want to see this country or any other country even being able to deal with the challenges and develop, it cannot happen without the role of half the population."" He has signaled his intention to sign the Status of Forces Agreement with President Barack Obama in an effort to offer his constituents some security following NATO''s planned withdrawal at the end of 2014. Zalmai Rassoul . While Karzai has said that he will not publicly throw his weight behind any of the 11 candidates running, Rassoul is seen as the establishment candidate. A Karzai ally, he received the backing of the current president's brother, Qayum, who withdrew his candidacy and endorsed the former foreign minister. ""He hasn't been formally endorsed (by the president) but the impression has been allowed to persist,"" says van Bijlert. On Wednesday another hopeful, Sardar Mohammad Nadir Naeem, also stepped down and backed Rassoul, giving him further momentum in the run-up to next week's vote. Another doctor, the former Karzai cabinet minister has a reputation for honesty, despite his years in an administration widely plagued with accusations of graft. He has said that he will abide by the results of the April 5 poll, even if he suspects fraud, and has urged his fellow challengers to do the same. There have been doubts aired of the government's impartiality and rival candidates have expressed fears that his connections in the presidential palace could be the invisible hand that nudges him to victory. A moderate, he has urged better relations with the war-torn country's neighbors, and has also followed his fellow candidates' lead by pledging to sign the joint security agreement with the U.S. His running mate, Habiba Sarabi, is one of only three female vice-presidential candidates on the ballot. Van Bijlert says that this may be a calculated move. ""When you're putting together your ticket you try to appeal to as many people as possible, this is also an attempt to reach out to the women voters."" Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai . A former academic who previously taught at Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University in the U.S., Arshaf Ghani has emerged as a dark horse who recently polled as a potential leading candidate. A former U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009, he's known as having an impatient, fiery temper but also of being incredibly detail-oriented. Another ex-Karzai man, Ghani served as both an adviser to the current president and also as finance minister in his cabinet. He was working at the World Bank in Washington D.C. during the September 11 attacks, and used the tragedy as a springboard for his re-engagement in Afghan politics, returning to his home country just months after the event. Considered a moderate, he says he has seen positive signs while campaigning around the country. ""(At) rally after rally people are responding to a message of moderation, to message of reform, to message of transformation, to peace, stability and cooperation,"" he told CNN's Anna Coren. WATCH: CNN's Christiane Amanpour interviews Ashraf Ghani . His experience in the development agency was invaluable during his time in Karzai's government, reconstructing the country, and he hopes voters will be convinced that it will stand him in equally good stead for the top job. A shrewd operator, Ghani has enlisted the support of ex-warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a native Uzbek, as his running mate. With this choice, van Bijlert says, ""he'll appeal to the Uzbek vote. The ethnic groups are not solid block,s but the Uzbek one is probably the most solid one. It also shows us that he's prepared to play politics, he's not only principled, which goes both ways. For some people that's a plus and for others it isn't."" However, his many years in the United States -- especially while his countrymen were suffering, first under the yoke of Soviet imperialism and later the strictures of the Taliban -- may impede him as he is seen as an outsider with strong ties to the U.S., merely the latest foreign invaders of Afghan soil. Long memories . As with 2009, voters' hopes are tinged with skepticism going into Saturday's vote. ""People (remember) the last election,"" van Bijlert says.""They know there's been a lot of manipulation, a lot of irregularities. They hope it will be better but most people are fairly realistic.""","Historic presidential election looms for war-torn country .

A lot like the politicians on our list of Turkeys of the Year. Turkey No. 10: Rudy Giuliani puts all his eggs in one basket -- Florida. ""We are going to win in Florida, and then we will be talking about exactly who made the right decisions,"" Giuliani says on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" a week before the primary. Giuliani ends up third in Florida, with 15 percent of the vote. The former New York City mayor was relying on the many former New Yorkers who have moved or retired to Florida. There's just one problem: most of them are Democrats, and Democrats can't vote in Florida's Republican primaries.  Watch what made these turkeys memorable » . Turkey No. 9: In 2006, Tim Mahoney defeated Florida Rep. Mark Foley after it was revealed that Foley had sent sexually suggestive messages to congressional pages. Mahoney's campaign demanded an investigation. This year, Rep. Mahoney again called for an investigation -- this time by the House ethics committee into his own behavior, after it was reported that he had paid off a staffer to avoid a sexual harassment lawsuit. Mahoney later admitted to ""multiple affairs,"" including one with a local government official who had business with his office. Mahoney lost his bid for re-election. But not everything was lost. ""The irony is not lost on any of us,'"" a senior Democratic operative observed. Turkey No. 8: In June, Barack Obama addresses a meeting of Democratic governors in Chicago. His rostrum bears ... what is this? A presidential seal? Not quite. The eagle looks familiar, but instead of a shield, there's the letter ""O.'' The seal says,""Obama for America.'' And that Latin phrase, ""Vero Possumus''? It means, ""Yes, we can."" A little presumptuous, perhaps, four months before the election? ""That was a one-time thing for a one-time event,'' Obama's campaign spokesman tells CNN. Turkey No. 7: Sen. Elizabeth Dole runs a TV ad accusing her Democratic opponent of taking ""godless money.'' The ad refers to ""a secret fundraiser in Kay Hagan's honor'' co-hosted by an adviser to an atheist advocacy group. The ad shows a picture of Hagan while a woman's voice declares, ""There is no God.'' The voice is not Hagan's. ""I am a Sunday school teacher,'' Hagan tells reporters in a conference call. ""I am an elder at First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro. My family has been going to this church for over 100 years.'' Hagan files a lawsuit against Dole for defamation and libel. She subsequently defeats Dole in the North Carolina Senate race. And drops the lawsuit. Turkey No. 6: Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, the king of pork, turns into a turkey. The longest serving Republican senator in history is convicted on seven felony charges of corruption for failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and free services. John McCain, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell call on Stevens to step down. Stevens' response: ""I am innocent.'' He tells Alaska voters that he ""has not been convicted of anything.'' In a close race, Stevens narrowly loses his bid for re-election and becomes a symbol of corruption and arrogance in Washington. Turkey No. 5: Not politicians this time, but arrogant auto executives who come to Washington looking for a bailout. In their private jets. ""I'm going to ask the three executives here to raise their hands if they flew here commercial,"" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-California, adding ""let the record show that no hand went up."" The AIG insurance company does get an $85 billion federal bailout. Whereupon 70 of their executives reward themselves with a weeklong spa retreat. The cost? A cool $440,000. Turkey No. 4: After videos surface of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's controversial sermons, Barack Obama delivers a major speech distancing himself from his pastor's sensational comments. Then Wright appears at the National Press Club to give his side of the story. He claims Obama ""didn't denounce him'' but ""did what politicians do.'' ""I said to Barack Obama last year, 'If you get elected, November 5th, I'm coming after you because you'll be representing a government whose policies grind under people,"" Wright said. Obama does get elected, and Wright keeps his word. ""As long as you are presiding over policies that grind God's people into the earth, I'm coming after you,"" Wright threatens in a radio interview after the election. Turkey No. 3: The financial crisis hits in mid-September, and John McCain declares, ""The fundamentals of our economy are strong."" The Republican nominee makes a startling announcement a few days before the first debate. McCain says, ""Tomorrow morning I'll suspend my campaign and return to Washington."" Why? To rescue a federal bailout package for the financial industry. McCain goes to Washington and what happens? His own party kills the rescue package. Men can really be turkeys. Want proof? Turkey No. 2: ""I have responded consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying I don't respond to these lies."" That was John Edwards in July. But they were not all lies. The next month, the former Democratic presidential candidate responds with a public confession of an extramarital affair. He explains his behavior as ""a self-focus, an egotism, a narcissism, that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want. You're invincible. And there will be no consequences."" Want another example of men being turkeys? Turkey No. 1: New York governor -- make that, former governor -- Eliot Spitzer, who had to resign because of his involvement with a high-priced call-girl service. ""Over the course of my public life, I have insisted, I believe correctly, that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor,"" Spitzer said. ""To every New Yorker and to all those who believed in what I tried to stand for, I sincerely apologize,'' said the hard-charging, suddenly humbled ex-governor. And with that, the turkey is served. More turkey? We invite you to add turkeys of your own.","CNN's Bill Schneider names the Top 10 Political Turkeys for 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Christian Karembeu knows what it takes to win the World Cup -- and the former France midfielder is tipping today's generation to shine brightly in Brazil's football showpiece this year. Part of the French team which won the trophy on home soil in 1998, Karembeu is confident the current crop can spring a surprise when the tournament starts in June. Forget that France had to qualify through the playoffs and endured a disastrous tournament in South Africa in 2010, Karembeu is adamant Les Bleus can succeed this time around. ""I believe in our chance. I think Didier Deschamps is building a new team,"" he told CNN, referring to the France coach, who captained that 1998 World Cup-winning team. ""I know when he starts something he always tries to reach his dream, his goal -- and I know his goal is to win."" Four years ago, French football was riddled by infighting, unrest and a national manager with a penchant for astrology. The nadir in South Africa, where France failed to qualify from the group stage and the squad tore itself apart over a dispute between coach Raymond Domenech and striker Nicolas Anelka, left scars which took some time to heal. Anelka's tirade at Domenech resulted in his expulsion from the squad while his fellow teammates boycotted training to register their disgust. Captain Patrice Evra was involved in an altercation with fitness coach Robert Duverne and the players sulked on the team coach as the watching world gazed on in astonishment. Evra was dropped for the final group game and subsequently suspended after the tournament along with Franck Ribery and Jeremy Toulalan, while Anelka subsequently retired from international level after receiving an 18-match ban. Fast-forward to today and things are looking far more optimistic for Deschamps' side, albeit after a tricky qualification campaign which included a dramatic second-leg playoff victory over Ukraine in November to seal a place in Brazil. Trailing 2-0 from the first leg, France emerged with a 3-0 win in Paris -- and was even more impressive in a 2-0 friendly win over Netherlands in Paris this month. France is 22/1 to win the World Cup but will be confident of progressing from a group which includes Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras. ""Brazil knows that we can challenge and be an outsider,"" Karembeu added. ""I know many countries are afraid of us and because of what we've demonstrated in the two games against Ukraine and Holland. ""We are a team which can play, score and of course step up to claim victory."" While France has several talented players including Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, it is not expected to challenge the likes of Brazil, Argentina, Spain or Germany. It is 16 years since Karembeu was part of the team which won the competition on home soil by defeating Brazil 3-0 in the final at the Stade de France. That side, which included the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Marcel Desailly and Youri Djorkaeff, was viewed as representing a new France -- a microcosm of the kaleidoscope of color which had become interwoven with the country's society. This was a team which brought players together from all different backgrounds, whether it be Lilian Thuram, who was born in Guadaloupe, Karembeu from New Caledonia, or Desailly -- who hails from Ghana. Under the guidance of coach Aime Jacquet, that generation of French players was lauded as an example of how successful multiculturalism could be. Even now, Karembeu gets emotional when he speaks of the success he enjoyed with that group of players. ""I was in Paris yesterday and still there are still too many emotions going around,"" he said Thursday at CNN's London bureau, as part of his role in FIFA's World Cup Trophy Tour. ""For us it was like a big revolution. We made France recognize its own communities, its differences, and the mix of cultures. ""We won a big fight because it made us as one. I think when you win a big trophy or big event like that, you don't think about sport. ""We think about social matters, integration, education and happiness when you are celebrating.""","Christian Karembeu tips France to spring a surprise at World Cup .

"(CNN) -- SeaWorld has been fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed in February. In a statement Monday, Cindy Coe, OSHA's regional administrator, said that SeaWorld knew of the inherent risks of allowing trainers to interact with dangerous animals. ""Nonetheless, it required its employees to work within the pool walls, on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals,"" Coe said in the statement. SeaWorld denied what it called ""unfounded"" allegations by the U.S. Department of Labor agency and said it would contest the citations. ""OSHA's allegations in this citation are unsupported by any evidence or precedent and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care penalties,"" a SeaWorld statement said Monday. In February, a 12,000-pound killer whale at the Orlando, Florida, SeaWorld pulled trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, underwater and killed her as horrified park visitors watched. An autopsy report showed Brancheau died from drowning and traumatic injuries to her body, including her spine, ribs and head. The OSHA statement said the whale involved was one of three also involved in the death of an animal trainer in 1991 at a Vancouver, British Columbia, water park. The agency's investigation ""revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando,"" the OSHA statement said. ""Despite this record, management failed to make meaningful changes to improve the safety of the work environment for its employees."" OSHA issued one ""willful"" citation -- defined as a violation committed with plain indifference or intentional disregard for employee safety health -- for ""exposing its employees to hazards when interacting with killer whales,"" the statement said. A second citation classified as ""serious"" was issued for failing to install a stairway railing system on one side of a stadium stage, the OSHA statement said, adding that such a violation is when ""death or serious physical harm is likely to result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known."" A third citation considered less serious involved a failure to put weatherproof enclosures over outdoor electrical receptacles, the statement said. In response, the SeaWorld statement said its internal review reached a different conclusion. Without providing details, the statement said the conclusions were ""drawn from decades of experience caring for marine mammals."" ""The safety of SeaWorld's killer whale program was already a model for marine zoological facilities around the world and the changes we are now undertaking in personal safety, facility design and communication will make the display of killer whales at SeaWorld parks safer still,"" the SeaWorld statement said. It noted that killer whales at SeaWorld ""are displayed under valid federal permits and under the supervision of two government agencies with directly applicable expertise: The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the U.S. Department of Commerce National Marine Fisheries Service."" The SeaWorld statement also said its trainers were ""among the most skilled, trained and committed zoological professionals in the world today."" ""The fact that there have been so few incidents over more than 2 million separate interactions with killer whales is evidence not just of SeaWorld's commitment to safety, but to the success of that training and the skill and professionalism of our staff,"" the SeaWorld statement said.","NEW: SeaWorld calls OSHA allegations ""unfounded""

"(CNN) -- If you were a Formula One fan who attended the U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis in 2005, it could be argued you witnessed one of the strangest races in motorsport history. A field of 20 cars should have lined up for the grand prix, but on that Sunday of June 19 just six were on the starting grid. It was the result of a bizarre sequence of events which left motorsport fans feeling so shortchanged it nearly drove F1 out of the U.S. for good. So frustrated was the Indianapolis crowd that fans hissed and hurled bottles when Michael Schumacher's Ferrari led home the six drivers -- as the other 14 brooded in their garages. ""It was sad not to have the GP that we wished to have,"" Rubens Barrichello, who finished second behind his Ferrari teammate, told CNN. ""The weekend was long. It was sad because of something we weren't prepared for and something the fans didn't understand. ""It was a horrible feeling not to see the cars racing, but unfortunately it wasn't safe for everyone to race."" Tire trouble . The controversy unfolded after a punctured tire during practice caused Ralf Schumacher's Toyota to crash at the circuit's banked final turn -- the fastest part of the track. Toyota used Michelin rubber and, after further investigation into the tire failure, Michelin advised the seven teams who used their tires -- Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, BAR, Sauber and Red Bull -- not to race. Faced with a dilemma over whether to risk racing on unsafe tires, nine of the teams -- including Jordan and Minardi, who along with Ferrari ran on Bridgestone tires -- agreed only to compete if a chicane was added to the final turn to lessen the tire load. But Ferrari and motorsport's governing body, the FIA, vetoed the plan. From there, the GP descended into farce. As all 20 cars circled the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on the formation lap, it was still unclear whether the Michelin teams intended to boycott the race. Red Bull driver David Coulthard even argued on the team radio: ""If it comes down to my choice, I want to race."" But at the end of the parade lap, the seven Michelin teams peeled off into the pit lane -- leaving only Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi to contest the race. ""Without question it was the strangest race I commentated on in F1,"" remembered commentator Maurice Hamilton, who was calling the race for BBC Radio. ""I can clearly recall my heart sinking when one car after another peeled into the pit lane. ""The full extent of the problem became apparent when the camera showed just six cars on the grid -- and in their original positions, separated by huge gaps. ""I have no idea how my fellow commentator Ian Phillips and I got through the next hour and a half. I was praying the producer in London would switch to the U.S. Open golf but she didn't!"" Bitter taste . For the six racers on track, the events of that day were no less bizarre as they raced strung out on the asphalt. Barrichello was involved in the race's only incident of note, when Schumacher squeezed the Brazilian's car onto the grass as he emerged from the pit lane to retake the lead. ""Sometimes you do race alone so the U.S. GP wasn't strange for that,"" said Barrichello with the pragmatism of a racer who has taken part in more grands prix than any other driver in F1 history. ""But it was bad because mentally you knew that there was only six cars out on the track. For me, I still had to fight for it but it was a horrible feeling."" A weekend of petty squabbling and farcical racing undoubtedly left U.S. fans with a bitter taste in their mouths. ""The fans were incensed -- and rightly so,"" said Hamilton. ""While the mood in the paddock was a mix of bewilderment, silent anger and resignation."" Many felt then FIA president Max Mosley had not done enough to find a compromise which would have allowed all 20 cars to race. Michelin also faced criticism for failing to bring suitable tires to the race and the French company later agreed to refund disgruntled fans. ""I thought that would be the end of the U.S. GP,"" Hamilton recalled. ""But reparation by Michelin and the passage of time brought a surprisingly large crowd back in 2006. ""F1 fans in the U.S. may be a small percentage of that huge sporting audience but they are very loyal and knowledgeable."" Racing history . Over the last few years, the outrage at the events of the 2005 U.S. GP has mellowed into rose-tinted nostalgia. ""I call it the train wreck theory,"" said Speed TV F1 presenter Bob Varsha, who has been the voice of the sport in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. ""As time goes by people get over the shock of not being provided the show they paid their ticket price for. The 2005 race was the kind of event where people want to say 'Yes I saw that, I was there for that.' ""People look back at it now as a phenomenal moment in racing history."" At the time, however, that was not the way F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone viewed the race. When the contract for the U.S. GP expired at the end of 2007, Ecclestone chose not to renew his deal with Indianapolis for the following season. Both parties insisted money wasn't the only factor. F1 wanted to expand its horizons and in 2008, the U.S. race was gone as Singapore rejoined the wold championship calendar. Free gifts . For Barrichello, the events of 2005 echoed another bittersweet race at Indianapolis. Three years earlier he had taken his only U.S. GP victory by just 0.011 seconds -- the second closest finish in F1 history. But there had been no breathless surge to the checkered flag to snatch victory from defeat. Michael Schumacher, who had been leading the race, tried to lead the two Ferraris across the line in a dead heat. But the plan backfired and Barrichello edged the narrowest of wins. Aftewards, Schumacher suggested he had conceded victory to the Brazilian as a gesture of thanks after he had overtaken Barrichello under team orders to win the Austrian GP. Many felt the result in the U.S. was manipulated and cheated fans who had turned out in high numbers, even though Schumacher had wrapped up the 2002 title two months earlier. ""That is a story that we never talked about,"" recalled Barrichello. ""I was pushing Michael hard up to the last straight and he backed off and it was almost instant that I backed off too -- no thanks, I don't want any free gifts like that. ""Then he backed off even more and I had to think 'I'll go for it' but then he may have thought 'OK he doesn't want it, I'll go for it' -- and I think that is why it went so close. ""When you dislike something you must try to see something in a different way and try to enjoy it when you do well. I had to think 'a win is a win.'"" After a three-year absence, the U.S. GP is back at a new circuit build outside Austin after an on-off agreement was finally settled and race fees were paid to Ecclestone's company. And Barrichello is looking forward to the November 18 race -- though this time as a spectator. The 40-year-old will travel to Austin to watch his first grand prix since calling time on a 19-year F1 career at the end of the 2011 season. ""I've always loved the U.S. GP,"" said the Brazilian, who raced in the U.S.-based IndyCar Series for KV Racing Technology this year after losing his place with the Williams F1 team. ""Long Beach, Detroit, I used to watch those races when I was a kiddo and I fell in love with it. ""I'd always wanted to race in the U.S. as an F1 driver and so the year that they said we're going to go back to Indianapolis in 1998 I thought this is great, I'm going to race at the famous track. ""When I got there I loved the layout it was fantastic, it was 100% enjoyment. I loved the place, I really did. ""Texas is going to be awesome. We feel that F1's reputation is bad in the U.S. because that's what people say, it's something we create, but I had the opposite feeling this year when I raced in IndyCar. ""Americans are big fans of motorsport and America deserves not just one race F1 race, but two -- and, you know, Indianapolis could be a good one to go back to.""","The U.S. Grand Prix of 2005 was one of the bizarre races in Formula One history .

"(CNN) -- Hailing a taxi in New York City is hard enough, what with fighting off other would-be passengers and getting the attention of a swerving, speeding cabbie. Getting the taxi to drive you from New York to Los Angeles? Fugghetaboutit. At least that's what the father of John Belitsky, a former taxi driver himself, said when he heard about his son's plan to pay a cab driver $5,000 to bring him and his friend Dan Wuebben from the East Coast to the West Coast in one trip. Six days and 3,000 miles later, Belitsky put an exclamation point on the journey with an unadorned post on his Twitter page: DONE. Writing that word might have been easy, but the trek wasn't -- at least for Mohammed Alam, the cab driver who left his crying family behind to endure several sleepless nights with a pair of strangers. But he made it, with a little help from his new friends. One of them, Wuebben -- an English professor -- explained in a YouTube video that he didn't hesitate when Belitsky pushed what he ""just thought ... was a cool idea."" ""And so when (Belitsky) said I'm going to do this, are you going to do this with me, I kind of just said yes, knowing that John has a lot of ideas,"" Wuebben said. ""I just like tagging along."" Belitsky, an investment banker, was motivated by a desire to pay tribute to his father. But he also admitted online to having Hollywood dreams. ""At the moment, the running concept is that we're going to take it to some movie people when we get there and see what happens,"" he said to a camera being held by Wuebben. But they couldn't do it alone, not without a real, live New York City taxi driver behind the wheel. This was going to be hard, as Belitsky learned when he asked one such driver -- who rolled up his window, without bothering to answer. After thinking they'd scored a ride with another cabbie (who agreed to do it, only to be rebuffed by his boss, according to Belitsky's Twitter post), the two friends found Alam at LaGuardia Airport, in the Queens borough of New York City on April 16. The three went to Alam's home, so the driver could pack some bags and say goodbye to his tearful wife, child and parents. Convincing them that it made sense for him to go was the first, but hardly the last, major challenge for the Bangladeshi man. ""I said, 'No crying. I will be fine,"" Alam told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""I'll come back very soon."" So off they went. Through Pennsylvania, into Ohio, then onto Chicago. Along the way, they recorded their observations on the ride in 140-character bursts on Twitter and using a camera they'd bought at a New Jersey Best Buy just before heading out. By the time they got to Omaha, Nebraska -- Wuebben's hometown -- Alam was exhausted and ready to quit. He had driven nearly two days straight without significant rest, refusing to let Belitsky and Wuebben drive the cab because they were not properly licensed. His family, back home in New York, still missed him and worried about him. Belitsky tried to persuade him to keep going. ""Alam is taking a timeout in my old bedroom, speaking to his wife, trying to get it together,"" Wuebben wrote on Twitter. ""Everyone is very tired."" After a break, Alam changed his mind and the three hit the road again. They cruised through the Rocky Mountains and into Denver, and then a giddy Alam and Belitsky took in the view at the Grand Canyon. By Friday, they'd finally arrived in southern California. ""I CAN SEE SMOG AND WE JUST HIT TRAFFIC!!! We are cruisin in HOV lane,"" Wuebben wrote on Twitter, as the cab rolled through Los Angeles. Their mission complete, the two friends said they weren't sure if they would take the taxi back, across the country, to their jobs, their homes, their lives in New York. Alam didn't have much choice, though Belitsky insisted on Twitter that the cabbie ""IS NOT driving by himself anywhere ... He will 100% have company."" For the two friends, the trip was an adventure, a dare and a chance to prove one of their father's wrong. For Alam, it was at times a nightmare but also a dream and the chance to make his mark. ""It's about the record. I want to be a part of the record,"" he told KUSA. ""But, it's not money. I don't think about money, I told them."" While it started as his ideas, Belitsky wrote on Twitter that he believes the trip meant more to their new friend Alam than to anyone else. ""No one will ever understand how badly Alam wanted this,"" he said.","Two friends decide to take a taxi from New York City to Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- Two cabin crew and six passengers were hospitalized after a Cathay Pacific flight hit severe turbulence as it passed over Japan yesterday. The aircraft, a 747-400 flying as flight CX879 from San Francisco to Hong Kong, flew into turbulence early Tuesday, six hours before it was due to land at Hong Kong International Airport. ""Regrettably, two cabin crew and a number of passengers were injured in the incident,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement. ""Those injured were given preliminary treatment during flight. Medical assistance was provided for the injured passengers and cabin crew immediately upon arrival. ""After initial medical examination, two crew and six injured passengers required further examination and treatment at hospitals while one passenger with minor injury was released."" The South China Morning Post reports that one crewmember was seen heading to the hospital in a neck brace and wearing an oxygen mask. It quotes a passenger as saying: ""It was even more intense than sitting on a roller coaster."" Earlier this week, five people were injured when a United Airlines flight hit turbulence. Last year, a similar incident on a Singapore Airlines flight during meal service was caught on camera and spread around the Internet. Turbulence is the most common cause of injuries in flight, though severe turbulence, which can force aircraft to deviate in altitude by up to 100 feet, is rare. The website Airsafe.com claims to have identified six fatalities caused by turbulence. Cathay added that it's collaborating with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department as they investigate this latest incident.","Cathay Pacific flight CX879 from San Francisco to Hong Kong hit by severe turbulence over Japan .

"(CNN) -- Many people have heard of the Slow Food movement -- the global organization founded in Italy to counter fast food and the ""fast life."" Its adherents favor gastronomic tradition and the calm, contemplative enjoyment of cuisine and life in general. Now another idea is taking hold in the wake of Slow Food -- the quest for a quiet Italy. It's embodied in the establishment of a new Academy of Silence (Italian site only), in Tuscany, which seeks to gather a list of the quietest hotels, towns and other places in Italy. We've collected 10 idyllic spots -- among the calmest, quietest and most powerfully relaxing in all Italy -- to suggest to the Academy as prime candidates for inclusion. 1. Eremito Hotelito del Alma (Parrano, Umbria) No TV, no phone, no mini-bar, no air-con. Go to bed when it's dark, wake up at dawn. Candlelight only after sunset. Phones to be used outside only. This is also the first hotel in Italy with only single rooms -- so not the place for romance. It still feels like the monastery it once was -- the monk's cells have been converted into rooms -- except now there's a spa, and great Umbrian food instead of bread and water. There are even Gregorian chants -- listening to them makes lying in the heated rock pool all the more relaxing. During the day, there's little to do except explore the surrounding 3,000 hectares of national reserve. Or practice doing nothing. Eremito Hotelito del Alma, Localitá Tarina, 2; +39 (0)76 389 1010; rooms from $208 . 2. Stargazing from the Rocca D'Orcia Tower (Siena, Tuscany) A single, stone medieval tower sits atop a wooded hill, overhanging a precipice. From this superb lookout, you'd once have been able to spot enemies approaching from miles around across the Val d'Orcia valley. Now it's open to the public -- a noble family fell on hard times and sold it to the state. Surrounding it are just a few stone houses and cobbled streets. Maybe the odd cat. On clear nights, standing atop the tower, thick star clusters illuminate hills, vineyards and Renaissance-era dwellings. If Tuscany has anywhere more quiet and calm, someone's keeping silent about it. La Rocchetta (Via della Chiesa, 8; +39 (0)55 228 0413; rooms from $40) is a B&B in the middle of the hamlet, right under the tower. The Osteria Perillá (Borgo Maestro, 72; +39 (0)577 887 263; dishes from $20) serves traditional meals such as bean soup and pici, typical handmade pasta. 3. Segesta ruins (Trapani, Sicily) It's much easier to be transported to ancient times when you're contemplating ruins in virtual solitude. Segesta's ruins are superb and all the better without the crowds at the Valley of Temples elsewhere in Sicily. Legend says Segesta was built by Achilles' companion, the Greek warrior Aeneas, on returning home after burning Troy. There's a temple, theater and sanctuary. Set in a remote part of Sicily, surrounded by fields, the archaeological site is nonetheless well-kept. It's way off the traditional tourist route and one of the least visited ancient sites in Italy. Baglio Segesta (Italian site only; Contrada Pispisa; +39 348 883 0124; rooms from $54) is a typical Sicilian rural estate close to the site. 4. The Gardens of Ninfa (Norma-Latium, Lazio) Eden, if it existed, quite possibly looked like this. There are cascades of multicolored plants, spouting fountains and rich bird life. Running water is the only sound, and the odd tweet and whirr of wings. Once a hellish, malaria-infested backwater, the Ninfa Gardens were turned into a 105-hectare oasis in the early 20th century by the Caetani Princes. The Ninfa (""Nymph"") River cuts through the space, which includes rare ruins of an entire medieval town. Norma on the Lepini Hills, overlooking the Pontine Valley and the sea, is the closest city. Hotel Villa del Cardinale (Via dei Colli 44, Norma; +39 (0)773 354 611; rooms from $38) has a well regarded restaurant with Latium specialties. 5. Stagnone Lagoon (Marsala, Sicily) Separating you from the open sea -- the Mediterranean -- is an archipelago of small islands dotted with ancient windmills. On the lagoon in a boat, you hold a glass of sweet Marsala wine. In the background, there's an orange-pink sunset. The only sounds come from things stirring in the hot breeze and low waves rocking the boat. The sunset aperitif served out here on the water by a tour company (Italian site only) comes with what's almost a dinner: 12 types of Sicilian finger foods -- it's tempting to stuff yourself at the first dish. The boat takes you out when the sun starts to set, anchors in the middle of the lagoon and brings you back when you've had enough of the quiet. Hotel picks in Marsala include New Hotel Palace (Via Lungomare Mediterraneo 57; +39 092 371 9492; rooms from $108), close to the harbor. Restaurant La Corte dei Mangioni (Via Giovanni Bovio 28; +39 (0)923 951 939; from $20) serves traditional Sicilian cuisine. 6. Linosa (Pelagie Islands) Stuck in the Mediterranean halfway between Sicily and Tunisia, this tiny volcanic atoll is off most travelers' radar. People who do make it out here cluster on the noisier sister island of Lampedusa. But to silence seekers, Linosa is bliss. Ultimate silence can be found hiking up the extinct crater of Monte Vulcano. At the summit, a panorama of black rocks dotted with fluorescent green cacti and prickly pears stretches to the sea. This is the kingdom of a special kind of silence -- sea silence. A single road circles Linosa. There are a few, low-rise traditional dwellings and a bar that makes great slushies when it's hot. On the beach of La Pozzolana, you might be lucky enough to find sea turtles from the island's animal hospital being released into the sea. Linosa has few hotels. Linoikos (Via Vittorio Alfieri, +39 (0)92 272 212; rooms from $45) has modern, brightly colored rooms and serves fish bought direct from island fishermen. 7. Civita di Bagnoreggio (Viterbo, Lazio) Here you find ""the silence of a dying city."" That's how the citizens of Civita di Bagnoreggio describe it. The town sits atop a high, narrow plateau of crumbling rock formed from compressed volcanic ash. Each year, it slips a little further over the edge. The population has dwindled over the past century to little more than around 10 hardy hangers on. It's quiet. The original bridge to the town collapsed, replaced by a dizzying metal catwalk. Once within the town, you can only get around on foot -- cars threaten further erosion. Writers and yoga practitioners are drawn here for the calm that prevails -- strange, given that catastrophe seems just around the corner. Or over the edge. Corte della Maestá (Via della Provvidenza; +39 (0)335 879 3077; rooms from $330) is a small villa inside the hamlet. Alma Civita (Via della Provvidenza, +39 (0)76 179 2415 from $162) serves guests traditional recipes. 8. Porcini mushroom hunting (Frignano Park, Emilia-Romagna) The deep mountain silence of the rugged Apennines, Italy's smaller Alps, is what's on offer here. Solitary valleys are dotted with stone structures the Celts erected during their invasion in the 4th century BC. Wild porcini mushrooms, one of the great delicacies of Italian cuisine, are part of the allure. For a $20 ticket from park authorities (Italian site only; +39 (0)536 72134) you can go on a porcini hunt and pick as many you can find. There's a magical ambiance in the forest -- a local legend describes ""the ghost of clouds."" If that's not a silent image, what is? La Capanna dei Celti (Doccia di Fiumalbo; +39 (0)5367 4444; rooms from $60), set at 1,400 meters, has the feel of a cozy mountain hut. The menu served to guests includes strong-flavored dishes such as wild boar. 9. Alicudi (Aeolian Islands) The farthest and wildest of the Aeolian Islands, Alicudi offers a no-frills, zero sound pollution break amid turquoise waters, pebble beaches and prickly pears. ""Donkey taxis"" are the main means of transportation across the island's 10,000 steps and 25 kilometers of ancient pathways -- you'll hear no roaring engines. And there are no banks -- you'll need cash -- only one tiny supermarket and a newsstand. Casa Ibiscus Resort (Via Roma, +39 (0)3409 207 605; stays from $1,800) is an Aeolian-style villa with a seafront terrace rented on a weekly base. Spaghetti with caper cream is a top dish at Restaurant Ericusa, part of Hotel Ericusa (Via Perciato; +39 0909 889 902). 10. Mt. Soratte (near Rome) You needn't go too far from possibly the noisiest place in Italy, Rome, to find silence. A sacred hill to the ancient Romans, the ""sleeping giant"" of Mt. Soratte spikes up from the Tiber Valley an hour from the capital. Hiking routes wind through a dense forest gouged with rock chasms. You might find wild boar footprints beneath you and hear hawks' cries above. The so-called Hermit Path leads to the highest peak, where there's an ancient stone shrine. Here's where Pope St. Sylvester I is said to have miraculously cured Emperor Constantine of leprosy. For a moment, given the purity of the air and the heavenly view, you can believe it. The Panta Rei rural estate (Localitá Ponticello, Sant'Oreste; +39 076 1578 728; rooms from $54) overlooks the promontory. Al Campanile (Italian site only; Via Filippo Leoni 8; +39 (0)76 157 9950), in the hillside town of Sant'Oreste, serves recommended local cuisine.

"(CNN) -- William Potts, the ""homesick hijacker"" who returned from a life on the lam in Cuba to the United States in November, may soon plead guilty to commandeering a passenger plane to the island at gunpoint in 1984, according to U.S. federal court documents. After Potts' arrival and arrest in Miami, Potts' family said they feared he had made an error by handing himself over. ""It's taking a toll on my family to think he might go to prison again,"" Mekoda Potts, his brother, told CNN. ""They are trying to put him away for another 20 years? It's not right."" But according to recent court documents, the hijacker has been meeting with prosecutors and may soon agree to a plea deal. ""In all likelihood this case will be resolved without the necessity of a jury trial,"" assistant public defender Robert Berube said in court documents. ""However obtaining the potential discovery in this case is complicated."" The discovery includes documents from the State Department that could back Potts' assertion that he already spent more than a decade in a Cuban jail for the hijacking. On Wednesday, a federal judge agreed to postpone the start of Potts' trial from December to March to give his attorneys more time to obtain those documents. A militant past . Nearly 30 years ago, Potts was a black militant hoping to overthrow the United States government by violent means. After smuggling a pistol aboard Piedmont Airlines flight in a fake cast, Potts threatened to kill everyone aboard the plane if the pilot didn't divert the aircraft to Cuba. ""We are all going to hell or Cuba,"" Potts said he told the pilot of the Miami-bound flight. In Cuba, Potts said, he believed he would be given military training by the government to carry out his armed struggle in the United States. Instead, Potts was tried by the Cubans for the hijacking and sentenced to 15 years in jail. Potts said he served more than 13 years in Cuban jail and then nearly two more years under a conditional release program. During that time, he said, he received regular visits from U.S. diplomats. Those visits could be key to a possible reduction of the 20 years to life-sentence that Potts now faces in the United States. ""I am sure that any American can understand that 15 years in prison in a communist country is 15 years,"" Potts told CNN in October. ""It's not a club med situation."" Potts had petitioned U.S. authorities for more than a year to be able to return to the United States, even though he still faced air piracy charges there. The hijacker said he wanted to return home to see family, including the two daughters he had in Cuba and then sent to live in the United States. In November, U.S. authorities issued Potts a single-use passport and arranged for two American diplomats to escort him from Havana to Miami. ""I understand I will be taken into custody, after that I don't know what to expect,"" Potts told CNN aboard the plane flight from Havana. ""That act of terrorism that I did has come back to haunt me every day."" FBI agents arrested Potts as he stopped off the plane.","William Potts, who hijacked a plane and forced it to Cuba in 1984, served time in Cuba .

"(CNN) -- A therapist who worked with visually impaired children. A doctor who did everything he could to help his patients. And the doctor's grandson, a teen auditioning for a singing competition that could win him a scholarship. Love defined their lives, friends and family said -- lives that were cut short outside two Jewish centers near Kansas City on Sunday by a gunman long accused of spewing hate. ""That idiot absolutely knocked a family to its knees for no reason,"" said Will Corporon, whose father and nephew were gunned down in the parking lot outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. ""My dad should be seeing patients today at his work. ... There is no reason. No reason for this. And it's just a tragedy."" The suspect, Frazier Glenn Cross, 73, faces charges of premeditated first-degree murder after he allegedly opened fire at two Jewish centers. Organizations that track hate groups describe Cross, who is also known as Frazier Glenn Miller, as a long-time white supremacist. Investigators say they plan to pursue federal hate crime charges against him. As authorities built their case against the alleged shooter, friends and family shared memories about the lives of the victims he's accused of killing. Reat Griffin Underwood . The 14-year-old high school freshman was dressed up in a coat, tie and hat on Sunday -- ready to belt out songs for an audition that he hoped would win him a scholarship. Tryouts for KC Superstar, an ""American Idol""-style contest for the best high school singer in the Kansas City area, brought him to the Jewish Community Center. For his first song on Sunday, Reat had planned to sing ""On the Street Where You Live"" from ""My Fair Lady,"" his mom, Mindy Losen, told reporters. If he had made it to the next round, he was ready to sing ""You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone."" That morning he practiced performing both numbers for Losen before his grandfather picked him up to drive him to the competition. For three years, the teen -- who loved his school, singing, theater and debate -- had been eagerly awaiting his chance to try out for the competition once he was old enough to enter, Losen said. It was a chance he never got. Shot in the center's parking lot in the truck his grandfather was driving, Reat died later of his injuries. After her other son's lacrosse game was canceled, Losen went to the center, hoping to hear him sing again. Instead, she happened to arrive just after the shooting, and found her father and son lying on the ground near the truck. ""I was there before the police and I was there before the ambulance,"" she said at a vigil Sunday night. ""And I knew immediately that they were in heaven, and I know that they're in heaven together."" Tom Trigg, the superintendent of schools, said he had a chance to get to know Reat at a school breakfast event earlier this year. ""His talents were on full display that morning,"" Trigg said. ""I found Reat to be an engaging and exceptional young man."" To begin the breakfast, Reat sang the national anthem. William Lewis Corporon . A family practice doctor who moved from Oklahoma to the Kansas City area to be closer to his own family, Corporon loved spending time with his grandchildren. That's exactly what he was doing when he was killed on Sunday. Corporon, 69, was taking his grandson to the center for his audition when they were gunned down outside the facility. Losen said her dad had offered to take Reat to the audition so she could take her other son to his lacrosse game. ""He cherished his family, and more than anything had a passion for caring for others,"" the family said in a statement. The doctor had been scheduled to see patients on Monday. ""My father leaves a huge legacy of community and of healing,"" Will Corporon told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""And it's just unbelievable that a senseless, stupid act can cause so much hurt and grief and pain."" Jacob Schreiber, president of the community center, remembered the family fondly. ""This is one of the nicest, kindest, most supportive families that we have here,"" he said. ""This has left us all breathless."" The Corporons were active members of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood. ""They have a deep faith. They don't believe this was God's time,"" said the Rev. Adam Hamilton, the church's pastor. ""They don't believe God wanted a man to pick up a gun and start this shooting."" Now, Will Corporon said, the family is turning to their faith, and to each other. ""It absolutely provides comfort. Evil is evil, and no one in my family believes that God is doing this to punish us or cause us harm,"" he said. ""You know, evil people do evil things, and what we will rely on is our faith to get us through this, knowing full well that it's only by the grace of God that we're going to be able to pull together and come to grips with what's happened."" The funeral service for Corporon and his grandson is planned for Good Friday. Terri LaManno . LaManno, 53, was visiting her mother at Village Shalom, a trip she made every Sunday. Her Catholic church, St. Peter's Parish, posted a message on its website describing her as ""a loving mother and wife, and a gentle and giving woman."" Tuesday would have been her 25th wedding anniversary, family spokesman Brian Fowler said. She worked for eight years as an occupational therapist at the Children's Center for the Visually Impaired in Kansas City. On its website, the center described her as a ""victim of the senseless shooting ... at Village Shalom"" and expressed sympathies to her husband and children. ""Terri was a gracious, generous, skilled and deeply caring individual who made a great difference in the lives of so many children and their families,"" the center said. On the center's Facebook page, commenters sent prayers and condolences. ""We were immeasurably blessed by our time in therapy with Ms. Terri,"" commenter Nicole Spence wrote. ""Her love, patience, dedication and skill changed the course of our son's life."" In a statement, LaManno's family said it was devastated by her death and asked for privacy as they grieve. ""My mom was a beautiful soul, she always thought of everyone before herself. The world needs more people like her. She was a warm, loving and beautiful person,"" the statement said. ""She was the best mother, wife, sister and friend that anyone could ask for. She lived for God and the people she loved."" 3 dead in 2 shootings . Suspect's history .

"(CNN) -- Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, is set to return to competitive swimming less than two years after announcing his retirement. Phelps, who has won a record 22 Olympic medals, will return to the pool later this month at the Arena Grand Prix at Mesa, Arizona, according to USA Swimming. The 28-year-old will join a field including fellow Olympic gold medalists, Ryan Lochte and Katie Ledecky at the event taking place at the Skyline Aquatic Center from April 24-26. Phelps called time on his career after winning four golds and two silvers at the London Games in 2012, but fueled speculation that he was preparing to stage a comeback after re-entering U.S. drug testing program last year. Swimming's global governing body FINA requires athletes intending to return to competition following their retirement to be tested ""at least nine months before he or she expects to return to competition."" The three-time Olympian wouldn't be drawn on the subject of a return to the pool when quizzed last November telling the Associated Press (AP) that ""nothing is set in stone. If I decide to keep going and swim again, then I'll compete."" Phelps, a regular tweeter with nearly 1.5 million Twitter followers, has yet to break his silence on the subject of his expected return. His last tweet was on Sunday congratulating Bubba Watson on his ""sick win"" at the Masters. Read More: Phelps' fairway to retirement heaven? Known as the ""Baltimore Bullet,"" Phelps was without peer in the pool winning 18 Olympic gold medals including a record haul of eight gold at the 2008 Games in Beijing -- one more than compatriot Mark Spitz won at the Munich Olympics in 1972. He collected a further 27 gold medals in World Championships and a total of 58 gold, 11 silver and three bronze in all during his career and still holds three individual world records in the 100m and 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley. Phelps' next chance to add to his medal tally will come in July 2015 at the World Championships in Kazan, Russia with the ultimate goal, perhaps, an appearance at a fourth successive Olympics at Rio in two years time.

"(CNN) -- A new powerful earthquake struck Saturday in southwestern Pakistan, shaking an area already trying to recover from a quake that killed more than 300 people. The 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck in Balochistan province Saturday about 96 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Awaran, the United States Geological Survey said. Rasheed Baloch, the Deputy Commissioner Awaran told CNN seven people died when a house collapsed in Mashkay Tehsil as result of new earthquake on Saturday. Just Tuesday, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the same area of Pakistan. The death toll in that quake has risen to 366 people and another 765 are injured. Authorities estimate that 21,000 houses were destroyed in Tuesday's earthquake. But Rasheed Baloch, deputy commissioner for Awaran district, told CNN more than 60 mud-walled buildings had collapsed in the Nok Jo area of the district. Four bodies have been found in the rubble, he said, but they appear to be casualties of Tuesday's quake. Baloch said a rescue operation was under way in Awaran district to retrieve the dead bodies and shift the injured to hospitals. The remoteness of the affected area and damaged communications networks are hindering the rescue operation, officials said. Rescue teams are also reluctant to visit some troubled areas owing to attacks by Baloch separatists, the deputy commissioner said. The separatists are blamed for firing two rockets at a military helicopter ferrying the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority, Maj. Gen. Muhammad Saeed Aleem, and another general to the earthquake zone on Thursday. Both survived the attack, said Jan Buledi, spokesman for the government of Balochistan. The defunct Baloch Liberation Front reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack. Militants fighting for a separate state in Balochistan operate out of part of Awaran district, which has been the site of bombings. Tremors were also felt Saturday in Kech district, Khuzdar, Kalat and other towns of Balochistan province. Injured flee hospital ward . Some of those injured in Tuesday's quake fled their hospital wards in Arawan as the new tremors rocked the area. ""More than 100 injured are now outside Awaran hospital,"" local journalist Muhammad Tariq told CNN. Local TV footage also showed ministers and members of the Balochistan Assembly walking out of an Assembly session due to the tremors. The session was subsequently suspended. ""We cannot sit in the house after such strong tremors,"" Assembly member Mufti Gulab told CNN. The quake also caused people to come out of their homes far to the north in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan. ""I was sitting in my office when the earthquake struck,"" Nazeer Ahmed, a Balochistan government official, told CNN. Saturday's 6.8 magnitude tremor ""could be an independent earthquake and not an aftershock,"" of the 7.7-magnitude quake from earlier this week, Zahid Rafi, director of the National Seismic Center, told CNN's Pakistan affiliate Geo News. The second quake will only add to the difficulties for Balochistan's residents. Officials had already warned that thousands of survivors in need of assistance after Tuesday's quake are having to cope with high temperatures, a lack of drinking water and little in the way of shelter. October is the hottest month in Balochistan and the region is in a perpetual state of drought, said Muhammad Hanif, the director of the National Weather Forecasting Center. Temperatures in Awaran and Kech have reached 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit). CNN's Saima Mohsin in Islamabad contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 60 mud-walled buildings collapse in Nok Jo area of Arawan district .

"(CNN) -- Bode Miller may have ended up in tears, but he's not upset with the reporter who pushed him to that point. ""I was really surprised. I mean, I felt like it was me, not her,"" he told CNN about NBC reporter Christin Cooper. After Miller won a bronze in the men's super-G alpine skiing race Sunday, Cooper asked him about his emotions and stuck with the questions after Miller teared up talking about his brother, Chelone, a snowboarder with his own Olympic aspirations who died last year at 29. Miller -- who ended up unable to speak, doubled over and crying -- says he doesn't blame her for asking the questions. ""She asked questions that I feel like with her knowledge of my brother and the situation, I felt like were pretty normal questions,"" Miller said. ""I've known Christin for a long time, and I think she's really comfortable with me, and I felt terrible that she was getting just massacred in the press and in social media."" Miller's brother was in a motorcycle accident in 2006. He suffered several seizures after that but still dreamed of competing in the Olympics. ""That was part of the reason why I was staying with it, and coming back to continue to race, so we would be here together and, you know, hopefully win together,"" Miller said. Winning was an incredible way to honor his brother, he said, which made Sunday great and painful. ""In the end, people will sort of see that it was more me just dealing with all these emotions and the build-up of several years of very tough personal life stuff,"" Miller said.

"(CNN) -- What can Sen. Barack Obama do to turn the Democratic campaign around? He has to try a different kind of campaign. Polls show Barack Obama as the most likable Democrat but Hillary Clinton with the best chance to beat the GOP. No more Mr. Nice Guy. When the senator from Illinois got into the presidential race, he promised something different, saying, ""I've been struck by how hungry we all are for a different kind of politics."" Obama has been running as a uniter -- someone who can reconcile divisions.  Watch the senator in peacemaker mode » . In August, he said, ""We're going to need somebody who can break out of the political patterns that we've been in over the last 20 years. And part of that is the notion that half the country's on one side, the other half's on the other."" But is that what Democrats are looking for right now? Maybe not -- Obama's running 30 points behind Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York in polls of Democrats nationwide. What is she doing that's working? She's showing some fight. ""The idea that you're going to escape the Republican attack machine and not have high negatives by the time they're through with you, I think is just missing what's been going on in American politics for the last 20 years,"" Clinton says. Democrats are tired of being bullied. They want a candidate who will punch bullies in the nose. A majority of New Hampshire voters -- who have seen the candidates up close -- say Clinton has the best chance of beating the Republicans next year, according to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. Obama and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina are not even close. Which candidate do they find most likable? Obama, followed by Edwards. Clinton trails on likability. But Democrats don't seem to be looking for Mr. -- or Mrs. -- Nice Guy. The only way Obama might be able to overtake Clinton is by saying, ""No more Mr. Nice Guy."" Can Obama get tough? He's trying. In an appearance last week on ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" Obama said, ""Hillary is not the first politician in Washington to declare 'Mission accomplished' a little too soon.'' That hurt, a little. His criticism of Clinton's efforts to overhaul health care as first lady also stung -- Obama criticized her for not reaching out enough, saying, ""The problem was that she closed the doors. She just worked with her own people. She locked out potential allies.'' Obama also criticizes Clinton for being too divisive, saying, ""The only person who would probably be prepared to be president is Bill Clinton, not Hillary Clinton. We are all very qualified for the job. The question is who can inspire the nation to get beyond the politics that have bogged us down in the past.'' In a new ad, Obama continues to play the peacemaker. In the commercial that started running Monday in New Hampshire, Obama says, ""When we break out of the conventional thinking and we start reaching out to friend and foe alike, then I am absolutely confident that we can restore America's leadership in the world.'' What we're not hearing is criticism such as this: ""One more time -- 'I have a million ideas. America can't afford them all.' No kidding, Hillary -- America can't afford you.'' That was Republican White House hopeful Rudy Giuliani in Sunday's GOP presidential debate in Florida. Or from the same debate, this comment from rival Republican Mitt Romney: ""She hasn't run a corner store. She hasn't run a state. She hasn't run a city. She has never run anything. And the idea that she could learn to be president, you know, as an internship just doesn't make any sense.'' That's wasn't very nice. Republicans play rough. If Obama's going to overtake Clinton, he has to make it clear to Democrats that he's ready to rumble. E-mail to a friend .","Sen.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain that one day she'll meet someone, fall in love and get married. But when her wedding day comes, her husband won't see her eyes, and she won't see her husband. Bahrami is blind, the victim of an acid attack by a spurned suitor. Ameneh Bahrami said her attacker pestered her with marriage demands. If she gets her way, her attacker will suffer the same fate. The 31-year-old Iranian is demanding the ancient punishment of ""an eye for an eye,"" and, in accordance with Islamic law, she wants to blind Majid Movahedi, the man who blinded her. ""I don't want to blind him for revenge,"" Bahrami said in her parents' Tehran apartment. ""I'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else."" Bahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002, when they attended the same university. She was a 24-year-old electronics student. He was 19. She never noticed him until they shared a class. He sat next to her one day and brushed up against her. Bahrami says she knew it wasn't an accident. ""I moved away from him,"" she said, ""but he brushed up against me again.""  Watch Bahrami return to the attack scene for the first time » . When Bahrami stood up in class and screamed for him to stop, Movahedi just looked at her in stunned silence. He wouldn't stay silent for long. Bahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats, even as he asked her to marry him. ""He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' "" On a November afternoon in 2004, Movahedi's threats turned to violence. That day at 4:30 p.m., Bahrami left the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she remembers sensing someone behind her. She turned around and was startled to see Movahedi. A moment later came the agonizing pain. Movahedi had thrown something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin. ""I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me!' "" The acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms.  Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes » . Two weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along. Bahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse. ""He says he did it because he loved her,"" Sarrafi said. Attack victims in Iran usually accept ""blood money"": a fine in lieu of harsh punishment. With no insurance and mounting medical bills, Bahrami could've used the cash, but she said no. ""I told the judge I want an eye for an eye,"" Bahrami said. ""People like him should be made to feel my suffering.""  Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes (includes graphic content) » . Bahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists. Criticizing acid-attack victims is almost unheard of, but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami's decision. ""We cannot condone such cruel punishment,"" wrote one blogger. ""To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights."" Late last year, an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for. It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye. This month, the courts rejected Movahedi's appeal. Bahrami's lawyer, Sarrafi, said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks. He said he doesn't think Bahrami will change her mind. Neither does Bahrami. ""If I don't do this and there is another acid attack, I will never forgive myself for as long as I live,"" she said. Bahrami is largely self-sufficient despite not being able to see. She can make a salad, prepare tea and walk up the five flights of stairs that lead to her parents' apartment. She has undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face, but she says there are many more to come. She can't afford to pay for her medical care, so she's using the Internet to raise money. She's lost her big brown eyes, but she likes to smile, especially when she imagines her wedding day. ""I always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown, and why not?""","Woman blinded, disfigured by acid wins case to have attacker also blinded by acid .

"(CNN) -- It may seem stunning that one of the most visited tourist attractions on the planet is a mall. Attracting 75 million visitors a year, The Dubai Mall gets more foot traffic than the Eiffel Tower, Niagara Falls and Disney World combined. Of course, The Dubai Mall is no ordinary shopping center. Billed as the world's largest (in terms of total floor space) by the Guinness World Records when it first opened in 2008, the mall is larger than 50 football pitches. It houses 1,200 stores, an Olympic-sized ice skating rink, an aquarium, the world's largest shoe store, 14,000 parking spaces, and a Boeing 737 flight simulator. It was no small investment; the entire complex cost $20 billion to build. ""It's a city within a city,"" admits Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Emaar, the development company responsible for building the mall. As one can imagine, running such an enterprise is challenging, and it takes a lot of man power. With 20,000 employees, the mall's staff is equivalent to the size of a small army. ""To make it work, you need to have a tremendous amount of people that are on the job 24 hours a day,"" says David Macadam, CEO of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centers. Though the mall closes at 10pm (midnight on the weekends), in some ways it is busiest after hours, when a cleaning crew of 100 sweep, vacuum and polish over 1.5m square feet of space every night. ""It's a huge mall,"" notes Ahmen Hussein, the night shift supervisor for cleaning. ""We have to finish before the opening hour. Sometimes we only have five or six hours to do it. It's hard, but we like the challenge."" An even more arduous cleaning task sits just outside the malls doorstep. The Burj Khalifa Lake -- an 150m liter artificial body of water that also houses The Dubai Fountain -- requires daily maintenance, partly because the desert climate itches to contaminate it with sand. ""The job is to target the areas where we have the highest sand accumulation, and clean it in a systematic way,"" says Jean Hanna, director of operations for The Dubai Fountain. In addition to the human staff, there are underwater robotic vacuums employed to undertake the task. Despite the manpower that goes in to running the mall, Alabbar concedes that even more can be done to ensure it lives up to its full potential: . ""We've tried really hard to make sure it's prestigious, respected, looks after people, customers, companies, shareholders -- the whole thing. I think we're getting there. We still have to work a little bit, but we're getting there."" Watch: Bollywood dreams in Dubai's labor camps .

"(CNN) -- Did you hear that a barge leaked 31,500 gallons of crude oil into the Mississippi River over the weekend? When the tanker collided with a tugboat, the resulting spill caused 65 miles of the river to be shut down for two days as New Orleans Port traffic ground to a halt and drinking water intakes were closed. Or did you hear about the radiation leak at a New Mexico nuclear waste storage site? The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant stores plutonium-contaminated waste from Los Alamos National Laboratory and other government nuclear sites. The storage site has been closed since the Valentine's Day leak, but just this week, officials reported that more airborne radiation has been detected in southeastern New Mexico. Both incidents come at a dangerous time, where American oil and energy companies are getting increasingly wide discretion and the Environmental Protection Agency has been hollowed out, losing its authority and resources to protect public safety. In Louisiana and New Mexico, officials insist there is no public health threat, but such assertions are suspicious when our government at all levels is more interested in protecting the power of the military and energy industries than the public interest. A month after coal-processing chemicals leaked from an energy company's storage tank into West Virginia's main water supply, officials say the water is safe to drink. But residents are still wary. West Virginians report that just showering in their water causes headaches and rashes. In the staunchly anti-government, anti-EPA state, people wish there had been more government oversight and regulation to prevent the leak. Which should make us all incredibly skeptical of expanding domestic dirty energy projects in the United States. For instance, the Keystone XL pipeline. Forget the inflated claims about how many jobs the pipeline will create or even its environmental implications. Just think for a second about the fact that an existing stretch of the Keystone pipeline leaked 12 times in its first year of operation. Forbes energy analyst James Conca, commenting on the second pipeline spill in a week in 2013 involving Canadian crude oil, wrote, ""It's crazy to think the Keystone XL pipeline won't leak."" That is a terrible risk to bear for a pipeline that many experts believe will simply pump a lot of Canadian crude oil over United States soil in order to be processed and sold internationally and which will actually increase the domestic price of oil in America, according to a study by Cornell University and a report by Bloomberg news. Keystone denies that the oil will end up being exported -- despite many reports that its refined product will. Recently a judge in Nebraska ruled that legislation there allowing the governor to approve the Keystone XL route violates the state constitution â€” a victory for opponents of the pipeline. Days later, the State Department's inspector general determined that the federal government had not violated its own conflict-of-interest policies in selecting a company that stands to benefit from the Keystone expansion as the to prepare a report analyzing the pipeline project â€” a victory for Keystone XL proponents. Meanwhile, the ultimate decision about the Keystone XL pipeline is expected to be made by President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry in the coming months. I'm not saying we should turn off all the wells and nuclear facilities in America tomorrow. Given our massive consumption of energy, that's unreasonable. But is it too much to ask that in the wake of disaster after disaster, we restore regular levels of funding to the EPA so that our government can properly monitor risks to public safety and health? Already hobbled by the Bush administration, the EPA's budget has declined every year for the past four years. ""The jurisdiction is wide here and it's hard enough to do the job of environmental protection when working with the Department of Energy and the military, even when you have a well funded agency,"" said Michelle DePass, former EPA assistant administrator in the Office of International Affairs and a dean at The New School. ""And this is another case, like the West Texas plant fire (in Smith County last year) and the BP oil spill where industry will refuse to acknowledge that the worst case scenario can happen -- until it does,"" she said. In addition to strengthening EPA oversight, we must seriously invest in green energy and new fuel technologies.  Once upon a time, this was a nonpartisan issue -- with Republicans and Democrats alike not only voicing concerns about climate change but also wanting our nation to get ahead in the inevitable global green energy industry. Green energy not only reduces the risks of such devastating spills and leaks but -- an important bonus --  according to studies, green energy production actually creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production. And yet China is leading the globe in establishing green energy sources and manufacturing solar panels for export. The United States appears to be lagging behind on every count -- except maybe when it comes to oil spills. The problem with dirty energy disasters is that we don't hear about them unless they're big -- on the scale of the BP Gulf oil leak or the Exxon Valdez. The other, ""smaller"" stories pop up quickly, but fade from national attention. And yet for people along the Mississippi River or in southeastern New Mexico or throughout West Virginia, the disaster doesn't go away. And as long as we keep our heads buried in the tar sands and refuse to step up and fully regulate dirty energy industries while investing in safe, green energy, the disasters will only spread. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: Many environmental disasters -- radiation leaks, oil spills -- aren't reported widely .
Kohn: It's a bad time: EPA stripped of authority, energy corporations get wide latitude .
Kohn: It's time to pursue green energy, stop fossil fuel projects, regulate dirty industries ."
"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police arrested a well-known Basque politician linked to the armed Basque separatist group ETA on Tuesday, along with nine suspected collaborators, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Former leader of banned Basque party Batasuna Arnaldo Otegi after his arrest. The politician, Arnaldo Otegi, is a leader of the former Batasuna party, outlawed for its ties to ETA, which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its four-decade fight for Basque independence. Otegi and the others were arrested in northern Spain for trying to regroup the leadership of the so-called Basque left movement in order to ""carry out ETA's orders,"" the statement said. Otegi and four others were arrested during a meeting at an office of the Basque union LAB in San Sebastian. Two others were arrested on the street in the nearby town of Hernani, and three others were arrested in Pamplona, including one for allegedly possessing documents from another suspect's home in an attempt to avoid having them seized by police, the statement said. The operation is being directed by anti-terrorism Judge Baltasar Garzon of Spain's National Court, and the suspects were due to be taken to Madrid to appear before him in the coming days, the statement said. Otegi has been in trouble before with the law. In 2007, he was arrested shortly after Spain's Supreme Court upheld a lower-court's conviction of him in 2006 for glorifying terrorism at a memorial in December 2003 for a dead ETA leader. Otegi was sentenced to 15 months in jail. But at the time of his 2007 arrest, he had been free on $300,000 bail in a separate terrorism case of inciting violence. A senior government source who insisted on anonymity said last month that officials had been expecting Otegi to try to step forward soon as an interlocutor promising to help end ETA's violence and negotiate a deal with the government. The aim, according to the source, was to permit a rebranded Batasuna to run for local office again, on the promise it would seek to end ETA's violence once it had regained elected government positions. But government officials have said publicly there can be no further talks with ETA, which is listed as a terrorist group by Spain, the European Union and the United States.  Watch background behind ETA's decades-long struggle » . When ETA declared a unilateral ""permanent"" cease-fire in March 2006, the government began steps toward a peace process, but ETA then bombed Madrid's airport in December 2006, killing two men and causing extensive damage. ETA in 2007 called off its cease-fire, which the government had already considered finished. The government has said since then that the only way to end more than 40 years of violence will be for ETA to renounce its campaign and lay down its arms or face its demise through a police crackdown. Yet ETA has continued its killings and bombings, including fatal attacks in the Spanish island of Majorca in August. But police in Spain and in neighboring France -- ETA's traditional rearguard base -- have cracked down hard, arresting dozens of ETA suspects, including four of its alleged top leaders. The arrest of Otegi and others on Tuesday comes two days after police detained two of the most-wanted ETA suspects in France. They were allegedly involved in ETA logistics and police later found weapons and material to make car bombs, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.","Politician Arnaldo Otegi is a leader of the former Batasuna party .

"(CNN) -- When did conservatives become prisoners to idiotic vulgarity? I ask that question as someone who self-defines as conservative and who is sick and tired of being embarrassed by Ted Nugent. Last month the aged rocker called President Barack Obama a ""subhuman mongrel"" in an interview with Guns.com. That was bad enough, but what was just as shocking was the willingness of Texas GOP gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott to keep him aboard his campaign. Rick Perry and Ted Cruz also failed to rule out appearing with him. Only Rand Paul took to Twitter to demand an apology, which Nugent eventually gave. He downgraded Obama to a ""liar,"" which is, at least, a more colorblind insult. There is a view that Nugent simply ""speaks his mind,"" and, yes, he has every constitutionally guaranteed right to do so. Maybe what he says appeals to some people, those for whom good manners are a bourgeois affectation and correct spelling the preserve of Harvard pointy-heads. Nugent insists comments not racist, promises to stop 'calling people names' Either way, what is disturbing is that some serious Republican politicians think that he matters and are happy to count him among their endorsements -- as though selling records and getting angry make him a spokesman for the masses. Animal from the Muppets also speaks his mind, but we've yet to see him headlining a rally for Chris Christie. This isn't what conservatism is supposed to be about. Conservatism is the rejection of ideology in favor of common sense and anger in favor of cool rationalism. Of course, there have always been intemperate voices on the American right -- from Joe McCarthy to the John Birch Society. (I'm not including Southern Democratic racists such as George C. Wallace because their place on the political compass is impossible to plot.) But the American right has an intellectual tradition that has all been forgotten by the media in recent years. There were the Progressive Republicans (Irving Babbitt), the anti-communists (Whittaker Chambers), the libertarians (Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman), the traditionalists (Russell Kirk), the neo-conservatives (Leo Strauss), and the sages of the National Review (James Burnham, L. Brent Bozell, Willmoore Kendall) -- the latter embodied by the urbane, cosmopolitan wit of William F. Buckley. Most of these groups quietly linger around today, largely ignored in the noisy mess of 21st-century politics but still patiently taught at some colleges and think tanks. In modern-day Washington, you'll find all the Catholic Republican interns spending Sunday at St. Stephens on Pennsylvania Avenue and weekday nights at lectures by bishops on the nature of good and evil. Not at the assault weapon firing range. Sometime in the 1970s, the intellectual right made common cause with populism, and historians such as Rick Perlstein tell us that this is when they surrendered their brains to cultural conservatism. But Ronald Reagan was neither inarticulate nor rude. He was happy, sunny, funny, and his speeches so dense with philosophy and history that they make Obama sound like a high school student. Crucially, he had a faith in the intelligence of the average American, which meant he didn't resort to meanness or bad syntax to win their vote. Reagan would never call an opponent ""subhuman."" So how do we explain the rudeness of contemporary politics? Nugent's followers might insist that his language reflects the desperate seriousness of his cause, that any conversation about fundamental issues such as guns or Obamacare is bound to cause a loss of temper. But in the 1960s the Republicans were debating urban riots, sex, drugs and Vietnam -- and yet the GOP sold itself as a party that could resolve these challenges with calm sensibleness. Nixon ran as an antidote to the chaos caused by the left, offering order over anarchy. What has changed is that back then conservative politicians had faith in themselves and their own philosophy, that it would win out because it was right and middle-class Americans could see that. Today's breed are all too often chasing a ""base"" that, they imagine, includes yahoos, survivalists and people who think the world is both flat and about to come to an end. This pursuit of the base ends with basically intelligent men deferring to those who are rightly socially unacceptable. Cue John McCain in 2008 being told by supporters that Obama is an Arab, or Mitt Romney nearly paralyzed with socially awkwardness as he courted the Joe Six-Packs in 2012. And it ends in politicians failing to call Nugent out for being a Neanderthal. As the midterms approach, conservative presidential aspirants face this challenge: Can they elevate rather than reduce the political debate? Rand Paul has made a good start, and it's probably because he is driven by philosophy and all the self-assurance that brings. For the rest, I'd like to see them defy a few stereotypes. Rather than being photographed shooting bears or doing pushups with Chuck Norris, let journalists catch them reading a book. Russell Kirk is a good place to start. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: Conservatives mostly let Ted Nugent's outrageous remarks slide .
It's shocking they seem afraid to dissociate themselves from Nugent, he says .
He asks: What happened to the intellectual tradition of conservatism?

"Seoul (CNN) -- North Korea said it's ready to fight a war with the United States and South Korea, as the two allies kicked off their annual joint military drills Monday, according to state-run media. ""Hundreds of thousands of troops are poised for a war carrying nuclear war equipment,"" North Korea's KCNA news agency reported, saying Pyongyang considers the drills to be practice for a preemptive strike on the North. The international community has been negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program for years. The most recent talks between North Korea and the United States ended Friday with little visible progress. They were the first high-level talks since the death of North Korea's longtime leader, Kim Jong Il, in December and the subsequent transition of power to his youngest son, Kim Jong Un. Kim's death threw into flux U.S. plans for renewed diplomacy with North Korea, including formal talks on ending Pyongyang's nuclear program and possible resumption of U.S. food assistance. The North Korea government was expected to suspend its uranium enrichment in exchange for food assistance as part of a deal that was to be announced around the time of Kim's death. The annual Key Resolve military drills that began Monday involve 2,100 U.S. troops with their South Korean counterparts. Washington insists the exercises are defensive in nature and unrelated to any geopolitical events. The current military drills are scheduled through March 9, with a second set of overlapping exercises beginning March 1 and running through the end of April. South Korea and the United States regularly hold military drills, and just as often North Korea denounces them as a provocation. KCNA reported Saturday that Kim Jong Un, the new North Korean leader, visited military units in the southwest of the country, including one that fired upon a South Korean island in November 2010, killing two civilians and two marines. North Korea said its forces were responding to a South Korean military drill in the area. While visitng the troops, Kim Jong Un ""ordered them to make a powerful retaliatory strike at the enemy, should the enemy intrude even 0.001 mm into the waters of the country where its sovereignty is exercised,"" KCNA reported.","Military drills are scheduled through March 9 .

"(CNN) -- Sinkholes, like the kind that swallowed part of a resort near Disney World in central Florida this week, are more common than you might think. In the late Sunday night incident, all the guests inside the buildings at the Summer Bay Resort made it out OK before the ground opened up, leaving a 60-foot-wide,15-foot-deep crater. But sometimes the results have been deadly. In February, a Florida man fell into a sinkhole that opened suddenly beneath the bedroom of his suburban Tampa home. He didn't survive. Here is a look at what causes sinkholes, where they occur and just how dangerous and costly they can be: . What causes sinkholes? Many sinkholes form when acidic rainwater dissolves limestone or similar rock beneath the soil, leaving a large void that collapses when it's no longer able to support the weight of what's above, whether that be an open field, a road or a house. These are called ""cover-collapse sinkholes,"" and it would appear this is what's happening in Florida, where the ground beneath the home suddenly gave way. Where do they happen? Sinkholes are particularly common in Florida, which rests on a nearly unbroken bed of limestone, according to the Florida Sinkhole Research Institute. Central Florida is particularly known for sinkholes. It's part of Florida's so-called Sinkhole Alley, where two-thirds of insurance claims for sinkhole damage occur, according to a report prepared for state lawmakers in 2010. Other places that frequently see sinkholes include Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, the U.S. Geological Survey says. Do all sinkholes collapse so dramatically? No, some merely cause the ground above to sag, or result in small ponds or saltwater marshes, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection says. How often do they happen? There do not appear to be any solid numbers, but the Florida Senate Committee on Banking and Insurance reported that insurers had received 24,671 claims for sinkhole damage in that state alone between 2006 and 2010. That's an average of nearly 17 claims a day, just in Florida. How dangerous and costly are sinkholes? Deaths and injuries from sinkholes are rare, but certainly not unheard of. For instance, in 2012, a 15-year-old girl died when her family's car fell into a Utah sinkhole, according to media accounts. But the holes are enormously costly. Insurance claims submitted in Florida alone between 2006 and 2010 totaled $1.4 billion, according the Florida Senate report.","Central Florida is particularly known for sinkholes .

"(CNN) -- Garrick Utley, who worked as a globetrotting foreign correspondent during the flush decades of network news, has died at age 74 of prostate cancer, his wife of 40 years said Friday. ""He has been fighting -- as you always call it -- prostate cancer for two years,"" Gertje Utley said. ""He had a very, very rare, very aggressive kind."" He died Thursday night at his home in New York overlooking Central Park, she said. ""He was really the old kind of journalist,"" she said of her husband, who reported from more than 75 countries. ""He was the old kind of trenchcoat-clad journalist who wrote his own copy -- always wrote his own copy."" During his early years at NBC, the network did not scrimp on devoting resources to newsgathering, she said. ""That's what he always talked about: The early days were the lucky days."" Born in Chicago in 1939 to a radio and television news couple, Clifton and Frayn Utley, Garrick graduated from Carleton College and studied at the Army Language School in Monterey, California, before winning a Fulbright Scholarship and moving to Berlin to study East-West relations, she said. In 1963, NBC's John Chancellor -- who had worked for Utley's father -- hired him as an office assistant in the network's bureau in Brussels, Belgium, she said. After NBC News's ""Huntley-Brinkley Report"" expanded that year from 15 minutes to half an hour, the network was looking for more material, and Utley caught the eye of the brass. ""He covered a couple of stories for the Common Market, as it was called then,"" she said of what is now the European Economic Community, and did some work in London. ""But mainly, within the year, there was this little war going on, and they didn't have a journalist there. So Garrick started the NBC office in Vietnam."" When he arrived in Saigon, the newsman was the bureau's sole occupant. By the time he left a few years later to report from capitals around the world, 20 people were staffing it, Gertje Utley said. He went on to serve as bureau chief in Berlin from 1966-68 and then in Paris, where he met his wife in 1971. From 1973-79, he was chief foreign correspondent for Europe and the British Isles. But he returned several times to Vietnam for such key events as the 1968 Tet Offensive and the pullout of U.S. troops in 1973. They were heady days for foreign correspondents. It was not unusual for NBC to send Utley for three weeks to report a story in China or for two weeks to cover a story in Zimbabwe, his wife said. ""It was still the journalism where you actually had to have the knowledge and explain a situation."" Utley prepared to be a man of the world, becoming fluent in German and French and developing a working knowledge of Russian and Spanish, she said. He was a ubiquitous presence on the network, serving as a weekend anchor of ""NBC Nightly News"" and a moderator of ""Meet the Press,"" in addition to his work as a correspondent. But over the years, the network cut its newsgathering resources, she said. ""Today, journalism is somebody telling you what you see behind them,"" she said. ""Garrick still gave the background of the political situation and why it is that way. I'm sorry, this is a proud widow talking."" After GE bought NBC in 1986, ""he really witnessed the decline,"" and Utley went briefly to ABC as its chief foreign correspondent, but left after it was bought by Disney in 1996, when its news division endured similar cuts. In 1997, he moved to CNN as a contributor. ""And what a presence he was,"" CNN Editorial Director Richard T. Griffiths said in an e-mail to colleagues on Friday. ""In his calm, measured, voice anchoring on 9/11 and in countless pieces, Garrick delivered thoughtful analysis that always raised the bar. ""Garrick was the consummate gentleman in every encounter. He was relentlessly curious, passionate about storytelling, and unafraid to take on the controversial topics. ""Those here in those days learned so much from Garrick. ... He left a mark. We can all hope to do the same."" But the network did not embrace Utley's tone, his widow said. ""He actually was reprimanded for it: 'Garrick, why do you have to be so serious?' "" He carried a serious demeanor throughout his life, said his sister-in-law Carol Marin, a Chicago journalist who is married to Utley's brother Jonathan. ""He was always kind of the grownup in the room, even when he as much younger,"" she said. ""I really think he had a kind of dignity. We saw it in his death, and we knew it in his life."" When he left CNN in 2002, Utley's farewell note cited advice he had received more than four decades before from Chancellor. ""Keep your voice low and your sentences short."" ""I am not sure how much of a place there is for low, quiet voices in our chosen field today, but brevity is still a virtue,"" Utley wrote. ""For a journalist, there are few joys greater than the opportunity to craft and contribute reports on subjects ranging from the weighty, to the ephemera of a changing culture. CNN has offered me the opportunity to do so, and for that I am grateful. I will continue in various guises. ""I could go on, but I won't."" Utley's producer at CNN recalled him as a mentor. ""He was a journalistic giant, who took me under his wing as a researcher and producer when I first started with CNN,"" Alex Walker said in a Facebook posting. ""Garrick taught me how to write for television and helped me develop an eye for pictures ... My fondest memories are chats we had in his office late in the day. I would pick his brain about his long, storied career."" Walker noted Utley's love for his wife, who called him ""Big Man,"" and for the opera broadcasts he hosted for PBS, but he said it was something else that most impressed him. ""Garrick loved to laugh, and that's what I will miss most. Sometimes he would laugh so long and hard and start shaking. It was just the funniest thing in the world. I will miss that man. Such a tremendous loss today for journalism and for me personally. Rest in peace, Big Man."" After departing CNN, Utley went into academia, helping create the Levin Institute for International Relations and Commerce at the State University of New York and serving as professor of broadcasting and journalism at SUNY Oswego. During his career, he received a number of honors, including an Edward R. Murrow Award and a George Foster Peabody Award. He also served on the boards of the Council on Foreign Relations, Carleton College and Public Radio International, the board of advisers of Medecins Sans Frontieres and as chairman of the American Council on Germany. The couple had no children. ""I always thought it was because Garrick traveled so much,"" Gertje Utley said. But they were ""blessed with"" several godchildren and found happiness in other ways, she said. ""If you never become parents, you remain lovers,"" she said. Utley's 2000 memoir, ""You Should Have Been Here Yesterday: A Life Story in Television News,"" was described by the New York Times as ""a moving account of Utley's experiences in the business"" and a history of television news. ""He openly acknowledges his frustrations at both the limitations of reporting and television's corporate parents' squeezing of foreign news in the name of profits,"" it says. ""Still, he chooses to see the positive. And while he regrets the decline of traditional foreign news reporting, he remains optimistic about new media taking up the slack, writing that all the new sources will offer 'more in both breadth and depth. That is what makes the future in electronic and digital journalism so exciting.'"" ""He was a big, big guy,"" NBC's Matt Lauer said on Friday's ""Today"" of the 6-foot-6-inch man. ""He was an imposing figure physically, but also intellectually. He was a smart man."" During a 2012 reunion of NBC hosts, Utley said of his work as a foreign correspondent, ""It was wonderful to have this platform and the wherewithal and the budgets to go out into the world."" NBC meteorologist Al Roker said Utley had always wanted to be a country singer. ""He had a great voice,"" Roker said. His widow said she had not heard that, but ""I know that he loved country music when he was young."" Utley's other brother, David, lives in Madison, Wisconsin.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A few days ago, I received an Instagram message from a young girl who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She was struggling in school and depressed since being diagnosed. She shared her situation knowing I had found a way to live peacefully with my attention deficit disorder, which gave her hope she could do the same. I was so deeply touched because her story is mine. As early as the second grade, I knew something was different about me. I couldn't sit still in class. It was torture for me. My teachers constantly requested I stop fidgeting, but I couldn't. I was confused because other kids didn't seem to have my problem. Additionally, it was impossible to focus on my teacher and her lessons. My mind would float off with the clouds, way more interested in imagination than the reality of a boring textbook. School always paled in comparison to the vibrant world I created in my mind. The classroom was my jail. The highlight of my day was recess, where I was a natural born leader. On the playground, I was somebody for one glorious hour a day. Then it was back to the classroom and my feelings of inadequacies. My inability to sit still and focus eventually took its toll on my academic performance. If students couldn't or didn't keep up, they were labeled ""learning disabled"" and placed in a ""special"" class with other kids who shared the same shame. Regardless of your specific learning challenges, all students were thrown into one big class. I was mortified. It changed my mindset about my capabilities and who I thought I was. I labeled myself ""stupid"" and set out to prove my theory right. I lost all self-esteem and self-respect. In fifth grade, I gave up on myself. I stopped learning and started surviving. As my academic workload intensified, so did my self-loathing. I feared my deep, dark secret would be discovered at any moment. To prevent that from happening, I became the class clown. I developed skills to mask my inadequacies. For example, if I was asked a question and didn't know the answer, I would simply crack a joke. Although I seemed happy, my despair over my academic performance weighed heavily on my heart. My parents tried their best to support me and lift my spirits, but their efforts fell on deaf ears. I felt alone, hurt and by high school, suicidal. Sports provide a turning point . Luckily, sports were an arena where I excelled and felt good about myself. I was a natural athlete, and my sport of choice was softball. My parents took notice of my ability early. They practiced with me daily, came to my games and even coached my Little League softball team. Often they taught me life lessons using sports analogies. They learned to speak ""my language,"" and it made sense. My tenacity, competitiveness and desire to win developed on the softball field. By the time I reached high school, I was a softball super star! I still wasn't a fan of schoolwork, but to play softball, I had to maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA. So, I did the bare minimum to be eligible for the team. During these years, my inability to control my emotions became a major part of my struggle. My temper tantrums were legendary. I started hanging out with some high school dropouts and experimenting with drugs because I wanted to fit in. Still struggling with the undiagnosed ADHD, I was a full-blown teenage jerk. Luckily my parents were on top of it and implemented a strict and relentless set of rules. It got ugly. I would scream obscenities at the top of my lungs. I rebelled and threatened. I tried the silent treatment. None of it worked. My parent's rules were set in stone like the Ten Commandments: no drugs, no loser friends and no dropping out of high school. I resigned myself to my fate. All I could see was the finish line my senior year. Although my academic struggles still made me feel worthless, I stayed involved in school because as captain of the softball team, I was determined to see our team get to the state finals. We did make it, but were eliminated in the first round. Nonetheless, I was honored as an all-state softball all-star -- a rare proud moment during my bleak high school years. High school musical to the rescue . When softball season ended, I felt hopeless. I had no prospects for my future. College wasn't an option because I could not imagine four more years of torture. On a whim and to procrastinate doing homework, I signed up to work as a props master for our annual high school musical. As I watched the performances from backstage, a small flame was ignited in me. A few days later, I sheepishly asked my parents what they thought of me becoming an actor. Clearly concerned, they paused for a moment, then my father said, ""You'd be great at acting."" My mom then chimed in sarcastically, ""You can put all those emotions to work"" as she winked at me. That's all I needed to hear. Acting became my new softball, my new passion. Suddenly the kid who hated school was going to college. My parents were overjoyed. In college, many of my ADHD characteristics that had created so much grief in the past became assets. With my vivid imagination, I could believe wholeheartedly in the imaginary worlds portrayed in plays. I'm also very emotional and impulsive. While these may not be such great qualities in a corporate office, they helped me excel in the world of theater. By my sophomore year, I was on a full academic scholarship. After I graduated from Howard University in Washington, I moved to Hollywood to pursue my dream of becoming a professional actor. Finally, my questions had answers . Fast forward to 2009. I'm one of the stars of Lifetime's hit TV series ""Army Wives."" My early struggles in school were a distant memory. Life was great, except for one little thing -- my daughter Kobi was a real chip off the old block. She was fidgety and had a tough time sitting still in school. Her second-grade teacher suggested Kobi get tested for ADHD. The results confirmed she had it. On a whim, I decided to follow suit and get tested. My diagnosis: ADD. Finally my entire childhood made sense! I wasn't happy about having the disorder, but at least now I knew I wasn't alone. I had a child to shepherd through the ADD landscape. I wanted her to thrive, not just survive like I did. I had to learn more. I googled ADHD, and the first link to pop up was www.CHADD.org. Everything I needed to know was there, including critical information about how to be a powerful advocate for your child in school. It was a light at the end of a tunnel. The website gave me the information and tools I needed to best support my daughter and myself. I contacted CHADD and spoke with several members of their leadership team. I was so impressed with their resources, their commitment and dedication to this condition that I offered my services to support them. In late 2013, CHADD asked me to be their national spokesperson. I proudly accepted this important role to help people feel comfortable living with ADHD and let them know they deserve the opportunity to live up to their full potential. Early diagnosis and treatment greatly increase their chances of doing that. I want to share one more message with the young girl who sent me that Instagram message and with others who are struggling with ADHD/ADD. (And lean forward because this is important). You're NOT stupid, broken or disordered. Celebrate the good, step over the bad and work around the ugly. Realize that those of us with ADHD/ADD have a skill that allows us to see the world through a unique lens. We are different, not defective.

"(CNN) -- As far as I'm concerned, John Matuszak said everything there is to say about professional football back in 1979 when he was playing the role of a bent lineman in ""North Dallas Forty."" Matuszak, or ""Tooz"" as players and fans knew him, was something of a renegade individualist in the National Football League and the movie's script gave him the opportunity to unleash a rebel yell: Embittered by his team's tough loss, and by an assistant coach's lame scolding, his character goes off on the coach, shouting at one point, ""Every time I call it a game, you call it a business. Every time I call it a business, you call it a game."" And it's that very dichotomy that looms even larger during Super Bowl week. The media keep insisting there's a game being played Sunday night in New Jersey. But all anybody really cares about is the Business -- as in, the torrents of revenue being raked in from advertising (have you seen that there are now trailers---for the commercials?), the marketing, the gambling and, of course, the partying that goes on not only in New York and New Jersey in the lead-up to the Ultimate Game, but from sea to shining sea Sunday night. Players know it, for sureâ€”and it continues to embody my own ambivalence about American tackle football. I get caught up in the game's drama, its unexpected twists, its ongoing tension between best-laid game plans and the ever-looming potential for their disruptions. I get caught up, too, with the sideline rants, growls, collisions and screw-ups caught at varied speeds by the wizardry of NFL Films. But while football's orchestrated aggression and violence may entertain me, my family and friends--and the rest of Living Room Americaâ€”we're all newly alive to the physical and mental risks these players are taking. How does one stay passionate about football in the face of the grim, steadily mounting number of cases involving ex-players undergoing physical and mental injury and anguish over the sport's long-term effects? In last Sunday's New York Times Magazine, author Steve Almond wondered whether it was immoral to watch and enjoy the Super Bowl while knowing full well that playing the game has caused ""catastrophic brain injury ... not as a rare and unintended consequence, but as a routine byproduct of how the game is played."" I've expressed similar misgivings here about the flood of disclosures about long-term injury and the manner in which the NFL tried at first to either disregard or demean this peril. It's not just the dementia, memory loss and other symptoms that cast shadows over the NFL's gaudy, golden image. This seems the right place to mention that Matuszak, who was so physically imposing as a player that he seemed invincible, died 10 years after ""North Dallas Forty"" was made. He was only 39 years old and his death was attributed to an overdose of prescription pain medication. Gregg Easterbrook, who publishes the weekly Tuesday Morning Quarterback column for ESPN.com, wrote this week that painkiller abuse ""may be pro football's next scandal."" Over time, watching these players run into each other at top speed while imagining what their minds and lives will be like 20 years afterward could finish me off as a fan. So could the sheer fatigue of witnessing, year after year, the NFL's seemingly inexhaustible capacity for inhaling money, which only compounds its overbearing corporate culture. I already have little patience with the game's ethos as articulated in such bromides as ""Doing Whatever It Takes to Win"" or that deathless line that the late, exalted Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi appropriated from a John Wayne movie, ""Winning isn't everything, but it's the only thing,"" which even Lombardi, the man for whom the Super Bowl Trophy is named, came to believe was too simplistic. Such platitudes have made tackle football a useable, if not overused metaphor for what it's like to work, live and, above all, prevail in modern corporate society. But it's not just a metaphor. Hard-working men such as my father found release, empathy and satisfaction watching the comparably hard work of his beloved New York Giants for decades. It used to be enough for he and millions of fans over the decades of professional football history to watch skilled craftsmen ply their trade, defy the odds, impose their wills, share their joy and passion. It'd be nice, too, if somewhere in the hype and hysteria, we could all calm down enough to see the Super Bowl in such elemental terms. But as near as I can tell, it's the Business that now holds an overpowering edge over the Game. And what's worse: I can't tell how much longer the Game itself will hold out. opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Super Bowl points up how NFL's money machine mars joy of game .

"(CNN) -- When Edward Snowden unleashed the flood of classified documents and surveillance data secreted from U.S. spy agencies earlier this year, it is unclear if he anticipated the high-level damage it would do to U.S. international relations. Headlines have focused on irate calls by heads of state to President Barack Obama and parliamentary moves to restore privacy. Diplomats have been summoned to repair fractured relationships. And just this week, the United Nations' senior counterterrorism special rapporteur, Ben Emmerson, announced that he would launch an investigation into the surveillance tactics used by American and British intelligence agencies citing the Snowden leaks at ""the very apex of public interest concerns."" Yet for all the ruckus globally, the most enduring damage from omnipresent surveillance may be right here at home. Early evidence suggests that knowing that our e-mails, phone calls and social media circles are being vacuumed up into a giant government database may reshape what we say and write, and whom we associate with. Surveillance may be chipping away not just at our privacy, but at the American values of freedom of expression and association enshrined in the First Amendment. Invasion of privacy or no big deal? Yet while foreign politicians are up in arms, many Americans are shrugging their shoulders. There have been lawsuits, bills introduced in Congress and even a few public demonstrations. But surveys from Pew Research indicate that the National Security Agency programs are actually supported by roughly half of Americans, even though many believe that their own personal e-mails and calls have been read or listened to. However, a survey of American writers done in October revealed that nearly one in four has self-censored for fear of government surveillance. They fessed up to curbing their research, not accepting certain assignments, even not discussing certain topics on the phone or via e-mail for fear of being targeted. The subjects they are avoiding are no surprise -- mostly matters to do with the Middle East, the military and terrorism. Because they rely on free expression for their work and livelihoods, some writers may be more prone to caution in what they say and who they say it to for fear of activating an NSA tripwire. But as awareness of mass surveillance sets in for the general public, it is hard to imagine the rest of us will be far behind. In a country that has prided itself for the world's staunchest protections of free speech and association, certain subjects, names, and ideas may become virtually off-limits for all those who'd rather not tangle with the NSA. Topics that are foreign, alien or frightening may become all the more so if researchers, writers, journalists and even students are afraid to investigate and explain them. Surveillance so intrusive it is putting certain subjects out of bounds would seem like cause for alarm in a country that prides itself as the world's most free. Americans have long protested the persecution and constraints on journalists and writers living under repressive regimes abroad, yet many seem ready to accept these new encroachments on their freedom at home. We've already given it away . Some Americans' relative nonchalance toward the government prying into e-mails and calls we long thought were private may stem in part from knowing that we have already ceded so much of our privacy voluntarily. Social media, online shopping, and simple browsing have become semi-public acts. It's hard to know who can see what, and worrying about it can stand in the way of buying a birthday present, posting a great photo or getting your taxes done. Moreover, for most Americans, learning that the government is a lurking hidden online ""friend"" doesn't evoke the fears it would have in communist Eastern Europe or today's Russia or Iran. Because we are all subject to the NSA's intrusions, there is no single group -- not Muslims, or African-Americans, or people of Middle Eastern descent -- that has emerged as a target of these newly revealed programs. While Americans are used to fighting against discrimination, we are less accustomed to standing up for rights to privacy, expression and association that belong to us all. Finally, because of the utter secrecy of the programs -- schemes we would not even know about short of Snowden's astonishing breach -- unless you're Angela Merkel you wouldn't know whether you were under investigation, questioned at the airport, or denied a visa because of something you said or wrote. It may be years, if ever, before stories come to light of people done in by their own texts, web-surfing or Facebook posts. Did it really matter? When the Snowden story first broke, Obama claimed that the newly exposed programs had foiled 50 terrorist plots. After reading through a classified list of the thwarted assaults, Sen. Patrick Leahy called the figure ""plainly wrong."" In the few cases where details have been released, journalists and intelligence experts have argued that the evidence gathered through surveillance could have been obtained in other ways, or wasn't crucial. Not all surveillance powers are bad. The Congress and courts have, for decades, focused on where to draw the boundaries to ensure that both we and our constitutional rights are kept safe. With new and expansive surveillance technologies, and new evidence that our most treasured rights may be at risk, the public is depending on judges and representatives to demand the information they need to properly weigh up the purported benefits of surveillance, as well as its harms. Americans shouldn't be out-outraged by the international community about a program that puts our own liberties at risks. The public's dulled senses when it comes to online privacy should not be grounds for forfeiting the rights the Founding Fathers put first above all others. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Suzanne Nossel.","Suzanne Nossel: Edward Snowden has done damage to international relations .
Nossel: Some writers have begun censoring themselves out of fear .
Nossel: Still, many average Americans may not see the intrusion as that big of a deal ."
"(CNN) -- Time to think up one of those ""a man walked into a bar"" jokes. Because in a Chicago suburb, a man walked into a bar with a tiger recently. That's right, a real tiger cub -- a fluffy baby about knee-high. And it apparently wasn't the first time. John Basile has taken the tiger cub to Uncle Richie's Bar in Lockport, Illinois, at least one other time, reported CNN affiliate WBBM. Police didn't think it was funny and have filed charges against Basile from disorderly conduct to possession of a dangerous animal for the latest incident. ""My concern was really for the people who frequent the downtown area,"" Lockport Police Chief Terry Lemming the affiliate. The charges are all misdemeanors. Not the first time . As Basile trotted the tiger cub down the street on February 15, it caused some rubbernecking. Some people seemed to think it was adorable. ""There were people in their cars shouting like, 'Is that a tiger? Is that a tiger?' going over the Ninth Street Bridge,"" Frances Escoe told the affiliate. At least one man took a video. Not everyone at the bar thought the tiger was cute. During a previous visit, the cub reportedly bit a guest. ""While we were looking into possible charges, officers spoke with a woman who claimed the tiger bit her in Uncle Ritchie's on Dec. 14, 2013,"" Lemming told the Joliet Herald-News, a local newspaper. Running a ranch . Basile, 57, has a familiarity and trust with predators and other wild animals that most people don't. He has handled them for 25 years, he says on his website for the animal rescue he runs. It's called Big Run Wolf Ranch and is federally licensed, he says. Basile sports photos of himself cuddling and wrestling with a full grown black bear and links to photos, in which he is handling snakes and wolves. On one of the photos is a Siberian tiger cub named Shere Khan. He holds open houses to show the animals to visitors and to teach them about nature, he says. The affiliate reached out to Big Run for comment, but an employee declined. Why did the elephant cross the road? To avoid the drunks .","After a man took a tiger cub to a bar, police filed misdemeanor charges .

"(CNN) -- Guns, grenades, human skull fragments and a pepper spray disguised as a lipstick -- just a few of the things confiscated by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers from travelers in U.S. airports last year. In TSA's recent blog post: TSA Blog Year in Review: 2013, TSA blogger Bob Burns reviewed some of the dangerous or unusual items officers confiscated in 2013 as well as some of the creative ways passengers tried to hide them. A total of 1,813 firearms were discovered, 1,477 (80%) of which were loaded. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest, topped the chart for gun catches with 111 guns discovered over the year. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport followed, with 96 guns discovered, while George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston (68 guns), Pheonix Sky Harbor International Airport (66 guns) and Denver International Airport (51 guns) rounded out the top five. The key message the blog wants to impart is: passengers can't fool TSA officers. Deterrent vs detergent . ""In what was believed to be an attempt to avoid declaring his firearms, a passenger at Houston (IAH) wrapped two guns in newspaper and placed them in a box of detergent powder in his checked baggage,"" wrote TSA blogger Bob Burns. Another passenger was found at Salt Lake City with a non-metallic dagger strung around his neck with fishing wire. A stun gun concealed in a cane and a pepper spray disguised as a lipstick both failed to escape detection by the TSA. The TSA also busted people hiding various kinds of knives. ""Our officers regularly find sword canes, credit card knives, belt buckle knives, comb/brush knives, knives hidden in shoes, knives hidden in thermoses and knives hidden under the bag lining near the handle mechanism,"" wrote Burns. Other knife finds included one hidden in an ink pen and a multi-tool inside a computer hard drive. Ninja stars too . The TSA also found 562 stun guns, a wood and metal mace, throwing stars and grenades -- both real and replicas. Another takeaway: inert weapons are as confiscable as real ones. That should serve as a lesson for the self-claimed military instructor who carried six inert pressure plates, 20 inert initiators, an inert land mine, inert explosives and two initiation systems in his bag and got detained at Norfolk, Virginia. The only non-weapon mentioned in the review was that of some human skull fragments in clay pots found at Fort Lauderdale in Florida. The passengers claimed they bought the pots without knowing there were skull fragments inside, according to the blog. The TSA Blog was launched in 2008 covering various stories, from Valentine's Day travel tips to the truth behind the behavior detection officer, the officers who glare at travelers as they pass through a TSA checkpoint.","More than 1,800 guns discovered on fliers last year, according to new TSA report .

"(CNN) -- A Renoir painting finished in the 1800s, loaned to a museum, reported stolen in 1951, then bought at a flea market in 2010 has to be returned to the museum, a judge ruled Friday. The story -- and the painting -- date back to 1879, when impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted ""Paysage Bords De Seine,"" or ""Landscape on the Banks of the Seine,"" which was believed to be for his mistress. It was later purchased by the Paris art gallery Bernheim-Jeune. Then, in 1926, Herbert L. May, a Renoir collector, bought it from the Paris gallery. In 1937, May's ex-wife, Saidie May, loaned the painting to the Baltimore Museum of Art, which reported it stolen in 1951. Fast-forward nearly 60 years to a flea market in West Virginia, where a Virginia woman was attracted to a nondescript box holding the painting, along with items like a Paul Bunyan doll and a plastic cow. She paid $7 for the box. The woman took the painting to the Potomack Company, an Auction House in Alexandria, Virginia, to ask about its value. A Potomack Company specialist thought it might be an original, and further investigation by the National Gallery of Art in Washington and confirmation by a Renoir expert confirmed the hunch. The painting is valued between $75,000 and $100,000. The whereabouts of the painting during the six decades it was missing remain unknown. ""Life has so many twists and turns. It has friendships and deaths and divorces and all kinds of chaos, moving, you know changing of occupation,"" Doreen Bolger, director of the Baltimore Museum of Art, told CNN in 2012. ""It's very hard to speculate what of those circumstances would cause the painting to change hands."" The Virginia woman, who had requested to be anonymous, felt the painting was rightfully hers. However, the Baltimore Museum of Art wanted the 5Â½-by-9-inch Renoir returned. So the FBI took possession of the painting until the rightful owner could be determined. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in Alexandria decided that the painting must be returned to the Baltimore Museum of Art.","Renoir painted ""Paysage Bords De Seine"" in 1879 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The battle over the budget often revolves around politically partisan issues of taxes and spending. But President Barack Obama's proposed spending plan for the next fiscal year totals $3.9 trillion so there's a lot that can be overlooked. We read the budget plan so you didn't have to. Here's what else is in it: . Obama's budget: Help for workers, taxes for the rich . Lessons learned? The State Department would receive $4.6 billion to protect staff at consulates and embassies overseas. It's a recommendation from the Benghazi Accountability Review Board after the deadly attacks that killed four Americans in 2012. Mental health: As mental health has received increased attention after multiple mass shootings in recent years, the budget outlines $75 million for mental health programs specifically for youth and young adults. Mass violence: To prevent mass shootings, $10 million is proposed to train local law enforcement to respond to mass shootings. Some of that money is for a public awareness campaign to prevent such events. Compounding pharmacies: After a Massachusetts pharmacy that mixed its own medication was found to be the source of a meningitis outbreak, it was realized that compounding pharmacies slide under the radar. This budget provides $25 million for the Food and Drug Administration to inspect the facilities. From welfare to work: It's true. Obama receives a lot of flak from political adversaries for bolstering the nanny state and creating a culture of dependency. In this budget, he proposes to ""redirect"" $602 million to a program that works with employers to provide subsidized employment opportunities for low-income people. Unemployment benefits: While the President proposes an increase in federal unemployment benefits, he would also invest $3 billion to ensure people who received disability insurance benefits don't also receive unemployment benefits as well. Perhaps another item where Republicans and Democrats can reach common ground? Airport lines: The budget proposal would direct the Transportation Security Administration to focus its resources on high-risk passengers and make it easier for low-risk passengers to pass through airport security check points. ""TSA will improve the customer experience while enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of its screening operators,"" the budget document says. Obama wants better tax deal for working families . More prisons? The United States locks up more people per capita than any other country. To accommodate the massive number of prisoners, the President proposed $8.4 billion ""to continue bringing newly completed, or acquired, prisons on line."" Military sexual assault: While New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been unsuccessful in passing her legislation that would reform how the military handles incidences of sexual assault, the President includes some of her proposals in his budget aimed at ""eliminating sexual assault from the military."" He calls for a ""full-scale review"" of changes by December. Nine to five or six or seven: The Department of Labor would receive $41 million for 300 new investigators to ensure that employers follow wage and overtime laws. International AIDS: The President proposes an additional $300 million to the $1.35 billion budgeted to fund AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria prevention around the world. Illness in the U.S.: This budget prioritizes the accelerated development ""of a universal flu vaccine."" Flat-line: The President makes some cuts to federal programs, including eliminating funding for grants for abstinence-only education. The feds' customer services: Speaking of customer service, $100 million would be spent to ""significantly improve Internet and in-person services at the Social Security Administration. Another $150 million would ""further reduce wait times and enhance services for the public."" So-long penny. And the nickel? The Treasury Department is taking on a major review of the use of coins in U.S. currency. It ""will result in the development of alternative options for the penny and the nickel."" The not-so-secret life of bees: It's widely known that bees are disappearing. What's not known is the reason. The President dedicates $50 million worth of public-private research grants and preservation for bee habitats.","The President's budget for fiscal year 2015 adds up to $3.9 trillion .

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows Google is big. But the truth is that it's huge. On an average day, Google accounts for about 25 percent of all consumer internet traffic running through North American ISPs. That's a far larger slice of than previously thought, and it means that with so many consumer devices connecting to Google each day, it's bigger than Facebook, Netflix, and Instagram combined. It also explains why Google is building data centers as fast as it possibly can. Three years ago, the company's services accounted for about 6 percent of the internet's traffic. ""What's really interesting is, over just the past year, how pervasive Google has become, not just in Google data centers, but throughout the North American internet,"" says Craig Labovitz, founder of Deepfield, the internet monitoring company that crunched the data. His probes show that more than 62 percent of the smartphones, laptops, video streamers, and other devices that tap into the internet from throughout North America connect to Google at least once a day. Labovitz calls Google's traffic ""astounding."" The lion's share of it comes from YouTube. But Google traffic involving search, analytics, web apps, and advertising is far from insignificant. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, though. It's impossible to get a total picture of the internet, so Deepfield's numbers are a best guess based on the traffic flowing through its internet service provider partners. Still, there's no question that Google is big and getting massive. To handle its growth, Google has been on a building binge. It now has data centers on four continents. All this work has been getting a lot of attention. But the tech titan is also hip-deep in another type of build-out, one that's largely gone under the radar. Google has added thousands of servers — called Google Global Cache servers — to ISPs around the world. These servers store the most popular content from Google's network — a YouTube video that's going viral right now or apps from the Android marketplace, for example — then serve it directly from the ISP's data center, rather than streaming it all the way from Google's data center. These servers were in a handful of North American ISPs three years ago. Today, they're in 80 percent of them, Labovitiz says. Companies like Akamai and Level 3 have been doing this type of caching for years. It helps speed up popular pages on websites like WIRED. But lately some big websites have started cutting content delivery deals directly with ISPs. It's a strategy that Netflix very publicly embraced just over a year ago, but one that Google is much more reluctant to discuss. The company declined to comment for this story, and ISPs that use the Google Global Cache servers aren't allowed to talk about them. That's not a huge surprise. Google does some pretty amazing things behind the scenes, and while it's considered to be the world's leader in infrastructure magic, it generally considers this work to be a closely held proprietary secret. Still, Netflix and Google's move into so many of the ISP network operations centers that are just a few miles from its customers — what networking geeks call the ""edge"" of the network — is likely to be followed by other internet giants such as Apple and Facebook, Labovitz believes. ""It used to be that the focus of people like Google and Facebook was about building data centers,"" he says. ""They're still doing that, but what is equally interesting is watching these edge boxes — these servers being embedded just everywhere."" This article originally appeared on WIRED.

"(CNN) -- Turkish police on Tuesday raided the offices of a Turkish Islamic charity on the border with Syria as part of an operation against the al Qaeda terror organization. Leaders of the charity, known by the acronym IHH, denounced the police investigation, suggesting it was caused by ""Israeli infiltration."" The police operation was ""against aid organizations helping Syria, to try to stop aid, and against the IHH, because it is the largest charity organization in Turkey,"" Yasar Kutluay, the IHH's secretary general, said at a news conference Tuesday. Kutluay went on to call the raid an ""ugly operation"" by groups that had been ""infiltrated by Israel."" Turkey purges police force . The IHH gained international notoriety in 2010, when it led a convoy of ships that sought to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Israeli commandos launched a botched raid of the IHH-owned passenger ship Mavi Marmara that resulted in the deaths of eight Turks and an American citizen of Turkish descent. The Mavi Marmara raid ruptured relations between Turkey and Israel, two close allies of the U.S. that had previously enjoyed military, economic and intelligence-sharing ties. More recently, the IHH had taken the lead in providing humanitarian assistance across the border to war-ravaged Syria. The organization, which says it does charity work in more than 100 countries, operated soup kitchens and distributed food in camps for displaced people in northern Syria. Its leaders also helped broker the release of Turkish journalists who had been held captive by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Over the last year, several al Qaeda-linked militias have taken root in opposition-controlled northern Syria. The IHH announced on its official Twitter account that at least one of its employees had been arrested in Tuesday morning's police raid. Is instability the 'new normal' for Turkey?","Turkish police target IHH offices as part of an operation against al Qaeda .

"Sweetwater, Texas (CNN) -- To win the Miss Snake Charmer beauty pageant requires beauty, grace, talent and a strong stomach. It's probably the only pageant in the country that requires the winner to decapitate and skin a snake. ""Tomorrow I get to skin snakes and chop their heads off, and I am super-excited about it,"" said Laney Wallace, Miss Snake Charmer 2011. The pageant kicks off the annual Rattlesnake Roundup festival in this West Texas town. Hunters from as far away as Japan catch as many snakes as possible in the countryside then bring them to the county coliseum for the festival. ""This event is a way for us to help control the population of the western diamondback rattlesnake in our area,"" says Donnie Willman, a volunteer with the Sweetwater Jaycees who run the event. The roundup began more than 50 years ago as a way to combat the rattlesnake population that was killing livestock and threatening pets and even people. ""The rattlesnakes were literally coming into Sweetwater, down the streets looking for water,"" says Willman. ""They bite livestock, they bite the animals, your pets. They'll bite kids, people. They're a very serious problem around here."" The roundup has become a huge part of the town's identity. The Jaycees say 30,000 to 50,000 people attend the roundup each year. It's become as much party as public service event. ""We have a lot of fun doing it. We enjoy it. We're all Jaycees back here in the snake pits,"" Willman says. Jeff Hulstein and Nathan Sheets left their wives at home in Dallas, Texas, and brought their sons to the roundup. They hired a guide to take them snake hunting and then brought their box full of snakes to the event. ""We saw this as a rite of passage to be able to bring your boys out here and let them see how you have good clean fun and learn something and appreciate nature,"" says Jeff Hulstein. ""It's one of the ways we are going to raise these boys into men."" The guide uses gasoline fumes to drive the rattlers out of their dens. The dads then use long handled tongs and hooks to corral the snakes. Nathan Sheets says he has dreamed of coming to the Rattlesnake Roundup since he was a boy. ""For me it's been a bucket list thing my entire life."" The roundup is clearly more fun for the humans than the snakes. The rattlesnakes are dumped into a large pen with hundreds of other snakes. They are weighed and measured and their venom is milked into glass beakers where it will be used for research and to make anti-venom. It goes down hill from here. Next comes the chopping block where their heads are cut off. They are then skinned and gutted. The meat is fried up and the skins are used for boots and wallets.

"(CNN) -- General Motors CEO Mary Barra headed to Congress Tuesday to give testimony about GM's alleged mishandling of defective ignition switches in its cars. It's an awkward moment. After all, the automaker is having to explain its questionable behavior to the same benefactor -- the U.S. government -- that financially supported the company when it needed the protection of bankruptcy laws in 2009. Despite tougher laws enacted in 2000 and 2010 to encourage automakers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to aggressively root out safety concerns, it is believed that it took GM more than 10 years to publicly acknowledge that it had a potentially fatal problem. Barra testified, among other things, about GM's recall of 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches that may have led to deaths of 13 people. Facing impending litigation, it is proffering an interesting defense, essentially saying: . ""That was the Old GM. We are the New GM. Therefore, we're not responsible. Thanks for buying American."" As you can imagine, whether in the courtroom, the workplace or home, a defense like this would not get you too far. It's not likely it would even fly in kindergarten. Whether it's gun charges or throwing Play-Doh at others, avoiding responsibility because the bad behavior occurred at a point in time prior to the present has never been a viable excuse. Yet, for some of the largest corporations, this defense not only thrives, it's government-approved. Like the mythical phoenix, GM's bankruptcy filing in 2009 -- and the subsequent restructuring agreement -- allowed the company to rise again from its ashes. After GM filed for bankruptcy, the U.S. government rescued it with a restructuring agreement that, in part, protected the company from legal claims arising prior to bankruptcy. In fairness, the idea of avoiding past liability is not a novel concept in the esoteric world of bankruptcy. In fact, the public policy behind it makes sense. Bankruptcy is a process where people and businesses can eliminate or repay some or all of their debts, under the watchful eye of an intervening federal bankruptcy court. To help them ""start over,"" companies or persons may obtain a discharge, or forgiveness, of debt in the process. The debtor is released from liability for the debt. Sorry creditors. Under the approved asset sale agreement in GM's bankruptcy, what was called ""New GM"" agreed to assume liability for products liability claims arising from accidents involving GM vehicles, but only where the accident occurred after July 10, 2009, regardless of when the product was purchased. ""Old GM"" retained liability for other products liability claims, and ""New GM"" assumed no liability for injuries prior to July 10, 2009. New GM kept the productive assets, with none of the irritating encumbrances of Old GM. Plaintiffs with pending claims prior to the magic date, and any injuries that arose prior to July 10, 2009, are stuck going after Old GM in the bankruptcy court proceeding. The same Old GM that went bankrupt. Good luck. Because of the 2009 cutoff, the lawyers will have to use creative tactics to hold New GM liable. For example, if New GM continued with an ongoing fraud after 2009 to conceal defects, or if it knowingly deceived the bankruptcy judge about its wrongdoing, that could potentially neutralize GM's supposed immunity. If this is troubling, blame the bankruptcy court and the others who agreed to this cutoff. You can blame New GM, too, but it was just acting as any company does, whether new or old: It exists to maximize profit. Any company's management is legally obligated to do just that. Bankruptcy recognizes that there will be losers in the process, and those losers are creditors of the company. After all, if a bankrupt company could continue to be hammered by creditors ad infinitum, it would never climb out of debt. Bankruptcy gives many people and businesses a chance to survive, where they would otherwise be ground into dust by creditors, leaving everyone on the losing end. But even though we may justify the economics, the defense itself is anathema to virtually every lesson our society teaches about responsibility and punishment. Imagine if you could declare criminal ""bankruptcy,"" and refuse to be incarcerated for any crime occurring before the most recent Groundhog Day. Consider your response if your teenager came home and announced he was declining responsibility for any broken windows or bad grades prior to Tuesday. As a cultural consideration, this abdication of responsibility just feels a little strange when applied to, well, virtually every other aspect of life. Nonetheless, readers are encouraged to try the new defense out the next time the boss calls you into the office for a bad review or you get locked up for drug possession, whichever occurs first. Try this excuse out, and report back. Just remind your persecutor: ""That was then, this is now.""

""The Tomorrow People"" (2.4 million, 0.9) and ""Reign"" (2.1 million, 0.8) felt like one might survive while the other might not. Not because either are doing really well, exactly, but because The CW has limited inventory to play with (The CW has Twilight-but-with-aliens-romance Star-Crossed and Lost-meets-Avatar-meets-Lord of the Flies drama The 100 in the pipeline).

"(CNN) -- Thursday, the White House revealed its efforts to reform the patent system, following up on President Obama's call in the State of the Union address. The White House called on Congress to pass legislation to combat patent trolls, known less pejoratively as ""patent assertion entities."" PAE's are firms that don't manufacture anything. They buy patents and threaten to sue people to extract licensing fees, like the mythical troll charging a fee to cross a bridge. Apple, Google and AT&T have each faced more than 100 such suits since 2009. Critics suggest that trolls create a drag on innovation by diverting resources to litigation. In response, the House of Representatives passed the Innovation Act of 2013 in December. The Senate is considering various anti-troll bills. Even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act, hearing cases this term that relate to the troll issue. If all three branches of government are reacting to trolls, clearly they are a huge problem. Except, they aren't. What is lost in this mudslinging is that much of what PAEs do is laudable â€” paying inventors. Patents don't grow on trees. Someone came up with the invention and incurred considerable expense to obtain the patent. Many inventors can't bring their invention to market themselves, however, so selling the patent may be the only way for them to make money. By buying these patents, PAEs compensate inventors, one of patent law's objectives. Patents give their owners the right to seek compensation for unauthorized uses of the invention, so there is nothing wrong with a PAE enforcing a valid patent. The key word, though, is valid. Problems arise when PAEs sue on improperly issued patents, ones that never should have gotten out of the US Patent and Trademark Office. For example, many patents on software and business methods -- areas where PAEs often operate -- are not sufficiently different from earlier technology to justify the patent, or are too vague to discern what they legitimately cover. Even though companies can knock these patents out in court, most parties settle. But, if they aren't legitimate patents, why do parties settle? Simple: to avoid the expense. According to a 2013 American Intellectual Property Law Association survey, median litigation costs are $3.3 million when $10 million to $25 million is at stake. Discovery -- the process of looking for evidence relevant to the case --is responsible for much of the expense. Defendants must wade through voluminous records and e-mails to find anything relevant to the case. For a case worth $10 million to $25 million, the survey estimates that the median cost through discovery in defending a PAE suit is $1.5 million. A PAE doesn't face these expenses. Discovery is easy for it because all it has is the patent. Plus, its lawyers usually take these cases on contingency, taking a percentage of whatever money they bring in, so there are no upfront attorney costs. When manufacturing companies face these costs, many simply settle, leaving the invalid patent in place. But these are not troll problems; they are litigation and patent quality issues. Scapegoating trolls risks disrupting the useful compensatory purpose they serve and may cause unintended consequences in non-troll litigation. Unfortunately much of the Innovation Act's proposals are ill-considered from this perspective. For example, the act makes all patent litigation -- troll and non-troll -- a ""loser pays"" system. The losing party must pay the attorney fees of the other side unless the loser's case was ""reasonably justified."" So, if a PAE sues on a bad patent and loses, it may have to pay the company's attorney fees. By having more skin in the game, hopefully PAEs would think twice about asserting bad patents. Unfortunately, the provision applies to all patent cases, likely increasing litigation expenses in all cases as parties fight over fees -- worrisome and chilling the willingness of non-trolls, such as startups, to enforce their patents. Such legislation is premature because two of the troll-related cases at the Supreme Court deal precisely with this issue. Other provisions in the act attempt to reduce litigation expenses, but they inappropriately micromanage the federal courts. Patent quality concerns must be addressed by the patent office. Unfortunately, the relevant provisions of the Innovation Act were removed prior to passage, so the final version contains no provisions relating to patent office procedures. The President's proposals, however, are directed to improving the quality of the patent office's review of patent applications. If successful, enhancing the clarity of what a patent covers would be a welcome improvement. The patent office's efforts to create greater transparency of patent ownership is also important because PAEs often hide their ownership behind various corporate shells. Finally, in 2011, Congress created new procedures to challenge patents after the patent office has issued them. Time will tell whether they successfully enhance patent quality, yet the promise is there. But all three branches must remember that not all patent trolls are demons. PAEs create markets for compensating inventors. Patent reform efforts should not myopically focus on trolls per se, or it may disrupt these markets and create other unintended consequences. Reform must address patent quality and exorbitant litigation costs. The President's proposals offer hope, but the Innovation Act's efforts are misplaced. The Senate proposals are more modest. Let's hope Congress pauses to consider the broader role PAEs play in our economy and appropriately tailors legislation to the patent system's real problems. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Holbrook.","President Obama, Congress have proposed reforms to curb patent trolls .

"(CNN) -- Every day, we happily entrust more of our lives to automated machines at home and in our cities. But you could be forgiven for blanching at the prospect of a four-armed robot bearing over you, scalpel glinting. But fear not, a human, and a highly-trained one at that, is at the controls of the da Vinci robotic surgical system. ""I think it's very important to explain robotic surgery,"" says David Rosa from da Vinci creators, Intuitive Surgical. ""The robot doesn't do anything on its own. Every movement, all of its controls are controlled by a surgeon who sits at a console."" The company's tele-operated robots have performed more than 1.5 million operations from abdominal general surgery and gynaecology procedures to thoracic and lung operations. Interactive: Future of printing is 3-D . ""The benefit is minimally invasive surgery. The patient will feel less pain, need less time to recover, generally (lose) less blood depending on the operation. There's just a raft, a whole host of benefits to the patient,"" Rosa said. Three components form the operating core of da Vinci: a patient cart -- which house the robotic arms, the surgeon console and a vision system that provides all the connections, which allow the console and instruments to communicate. Every movement of the surgeon's hand is relayed to the four arms that control up to 50 different instruments, from the basics like scissors and needle drivers to more advanced instrumentation that include electrocautery and staplers. ""When you sit down at da Vinci console, it can do things that you cannot do through other means,"" Rosa says. ""The robotic mechanisms and the 3-D vision that come along with it (means) you can manipulate tissue and perform surgery like no one else can."" Read/Watch: Future of transport is self-driving cars . Rosa has been with the California-based company from its beginnings in the mid-1990s and has seen the da Vinci system develop from concept to the 10,000-component, $1 million-plus machine it is today. He still remembers the first time he saw it in action. ""I was nervous. There were ten engineers in the room. I remember a few people would joke about me in terms of my gloves being filled with sweat ... but we were all nervous in those days. We had a lot riding on the successful outcomes in terms of continuing to fund the company,"" Rosa said. But anxiety soon turned to optimism as the benefits to patients became clear. Consultant surgeon and chief medical adviser to Intuitive Surgical, Dr Myriam Curet has pioneered the use of the robot in hospitals. ""I spent several months developing a robotic procedure for operating on morbidly obese patients and then we did it on our first patient,"" Curet said. ""Things went extremely well, we were really, really pleased at what it allowed us to do that we couldn't do with traditional methods."" That said, the system is not without its detractors. Dr Martin Makary -- a senior surgeon at the John Hopkins Medical Institute in Baltimore -- is concerned that many people are not aware of its limitations. ""The Achilles heel of robotic surgery is that the robot cannot feel the tissue, so the surgeon can make an inadvertent injury to a major structure, and that is a unique problem with this kind of surgery,"" he said. ""I'm not anti-robot, but for most of the operations where robotic surgery is used, there's no benefit to the patient. More technology doesn't necessarily mean better quality healthcare."" However, since making their first sale in 1998 -- to German customers at the Leipzig Heart Center -- the company has sold more than 2,500 robots to hospitals all over the world and reported revenues in excess of $2 billion last year. As for the future, Rosa predicts that surgeons and their patients will be even further apart -- an idea that not so long ago would have seemed like a remote possibility. ""I can imagine being a surgeon in San Francisco and working on a patient in another state, even New York,"" Rosa says.","Da Vinci robotic surgery has performed more than 1.5 million operations since late 1990s .

"(CNN) -- The designs painted on planes help distinguish one airline from another, using colors that promote and represent the brands. But with frequent mergers and acquisitions in the industry over recent years, traffic in and out of paint shops has increased to keep planes updated with new airline identities. The latest to emerge from a respray, covering the remnants of bankruptcy, is American Airlines. US Airways and American Airlines will form the largest airline in the world by passenger numbers, worth an estimated $11 billion. The new company will retain the American Airlines name, but it will have up to 73 aircraft repainted by the end of this year to reflect its new branding. The former look of its planes features a silver, bare-metal finish with a red, white and blue stripe running along the body, its iconic logo of an eagle and double A adorning the tailfins. The new design covers the planes in silver paint and puts stripes on the tail. ""It brings American into the Apple age with its nice reflective coating,"" says Sudeep Ghai, a strategist with Athena Aviation, and airline management consulting firm. ""I think where there are challenges are perhaps some of the brand mark elements that have been left behind, which have been around for 40 years,"" Ghai says, referring to the airline's logo, which has been radically changed. In recent years, the six major U.S. carriers have consolidated into three. Northwest Airlines was completely absorbed when it merged with Delta in 2008. Two years later, Continental merged with United. With each merger, airlines must choose carefully which parts of brands to hold onto. In the case of Continental and United, the newly formed company kept Continental's distinctive logo of a yellow globe. ""They did a very sensible thing, actually. They retained the United name -- the more recognized name worldwide -- with the Continental logo,"" says Willie Walsh, the CEO of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways. ""And I think that was meant to bring the Continental people into the business. There's a sense of inclusiveness, which I think was a smart move."" There are instances of companies getting the rebranding wrong, Walsh says, like the unpopular tailfin designs on British Airways planes in the late 1990s. ""But out of that came something fantastic: the Chatham flag, the livery that we have on our aircraft today,"" he says. Acquisitions and the new coats of paint that often follow have been cropping up across Europe, too. After IAG bought the airline British Midland International from Lufthansa last year, dozens of BMI's planes needed to be repainted to reflect its new branding, a process that used around 750 liters of spray paint per plane. Meanwhile, Lufthansa is getting ready to relaunch Germanwings, a low-cost airline that it acquired in 2009. Part of the preparations involves repainting the fleet in the new Germanwings livery, which incorporates colors that signify Lufthansa's ownership. ""We decided we needed a fresh approach. And what you see in our new livery is Lufthansa's yellow colors and our raspberry colors,"" says Thomas Winkelmann, the CEO of Germanwings. And passengers can expect more fresh paint jobs ahead, as the flailing airline industry continues to see mergers as a way to strengthen businesses. ""It happens on a slow-drip basis,"" Walsh said, ""but I think we'll see more consolidation, and I think the industry recognizes that it is a positive development.""","Consolidation of airlines has led to name and logo changes .

"(CNN) -- Egypt on Tuesday deported an American anti-war activist who was trying to travel to the Gaza Strip. Medea Benjamin, who co-founded the Code Pink anti-war group, said she was detained on arrival at Cairo airport Monday evening. She had planned to join a delegation of activists on a visit to the Palestinian coastal enclave this week. She told CNN she was assaulted by airport police, resulting in her arm being broken and shoulder dislocated, before being put on a flight to Istanbul on Tuesday. ""I was never told why I was arrested. I was detained as soon as I arrived and I was violently assaulted in prison,"" she said by phone on arrival in Turkey. ""My arm is broken. I did not do anything wrong. No reason was given for my arrest."" She spoke briefly as she said she was on her way to a hospital. She said she was deported despite Egyptian doctors saying she was not fit to fly. An official from Egypt's Interior Ministry communications department said Benjamin had not been detained. ""She was denied entry, not detained. There's a big difference,"" Brigadier Alaa Mahmoud told CNN. ""There is no legal basis to detain her."" He said she had stated her reason for visiting as a trip to Gaza, but authorities explained to her that the crossing was closed and consequently refused to allow her to enter the country. He denied any use of force or assault. He also said that he had no information on whether Benjamin had been banned from Egypt. Benjamin chronicled the events on Twitter. Heckling Obama .

On its website, Code Pink said it was sending a U.S. delegation of 15 women to join a larger coalition that would travel to Gaza. It said they would meet in Cairo on March 5 and attempt to travel to Gaza from there. ""Due to the political and security issues in Egypt, there are no guarantees that we will be able to get into Gaza,"" the group said. Israel and Egypt restrict the flow of goods into the coastal territory, which is ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas, designated as a terrorist group by Israel and Western countries. On Tuesday, a Cairo court banned all activities by Hamas in Egypt, calling it a terrorist organization.

"(CNN) -- Reading the official website of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and you would be forgiven for thinking the reclusive Stalinist state was the Cayman Islands of East Asia. No taxes, zero unemployment and a performance-related reward-for-labor bonus regime, North Korea touts itself as having ""a people-centered social system in which the masses of the working people are the masters of everything and everything in society serves them."" This Sunday, North Koreans will be required to show their assent for this political system at general elections universally expected to return the current incumbent Kim Jong Un. ""Constituencies and sub-constituencies are crowded with citizens confirming their names on voter rolls,"" the state-run news agency KCNA said in a report. ""Now the Korean people are fully determined to highly exalt the DPRK's dignity and demonstrate once again the might of single-minded unity by casting ballots for their candidates."" Political show . While critics say the poll is merely a political show to legitimize the country's rubber stamp parliament -- previous elections in 2009 returned Kim Jong il (Kim Jong Un's predecessor and father) with a 100% mandate on a 99.98% turnout -- observers will be poring over the list of legislators for clues as to how Kim will govern the Communist nation over the next five years. Kim himself is running for a seat in the Paekusan Constituency No.111; significant because the numbers are regarded as auspicious in Korean culture and because North Korea claims Mount Paektu, located in Paekusan on the border with China, to be the legendary birthplace of his father. The ruling Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland holds all 687 seats within the Supreme People's Assembly and voters have only one candidate to vote for in each of the seats. While the umbrella grouping officially contains four parties -- the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean Social Democratic Party, the Cheondoist Chongu Party and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan -- all candidates must be sanctioned by the party including three independents currently sitting as deputies in the assembly. De facto census . While it is possible for a voter to cast a ballot against a candidate, they must walk to a special booth to do so. Critics say few are brave enough to cross out the name on the ballot. According to one defector, Mina Yoon, the elections serve as a de facto census at a time when many North Koreans have slipped over the border to China. ""The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it,"" Yoon told the Telegraph newspaper. ""It is often during elections that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed."" Andrei Lankov, a North Korean expert from Kookmin University in Seoul, said the sole purpose of elections in North Korea was to legitimize the regime. ""It's a bad analogy, and maybe you shouldn't compare any acting leader to Hitler, but Hitler also had elections,"" Lankov told CNN. ""Officially North Korea is a republic and you are supposed to have elections. ""Stalin had elections, Kim Il Sung had elections, why not Kim Jong Un? It's a way to legitimize (itself), to show that 99% of all registered voters came to vote and all of them -- 100% -- voted for the regime, therefore we are the world's most popular government. ""Do 100% of Americans vote for their current American president? Never, so to North Korea the American government is far less popular, far less democratic."" Who's in, out? He said that while the Supreme People's Assembly was little more than a sham election, it was still be of interest to Pyongyang watchers keen to know the composition of the ruling party. ""It will give us some new names and the absence of some names will be equally important,"" he said. ""We will see who is losing power and who is gaining power because according to their unspoken tradition, the top 200 people or so are always by default members of the Supreme People's Assembly."" Analysts will also be keenly watching for signs that supporters of Jang Song Thaek, Kim's once-powerful uncle who was executed in December for treason, have been eliminated or sidelined in the elections.","North Koreans head to polls on March 9 to vote for deputies in the Supreme People's Assembly .

"New York (CNN) -- Printed on the back of ""the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" are the words ""Don't Panic."" And it is just this sentiment that Congress needs to internalize now that we have a decision from the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. As expected, the court of Chief Justice John Roberts took a decidedly regressive tack on campaign financing limits and granted corporations the same speech rights enjoyed by living, breathing persons. This is a bad decision. Gone are the ban on the use of corporate treasury funds in federal elections and the requirement that corporations use political action committees to advocate for a candidate. Corporations can now dip into their deep treasuries to spend on politics. Corporate money may now be infused into elections in ways we can only begin to imagine. For Congress, this ruling comes in the runup to important midterm elections in 2010. The rules of the fundraising game have changed radically. With key issues like health care, climate change and regulation of the financial sector in play, the impulse for managers to pull out the corporate checkbook in an attempt to influence Congress will be great. Not only are we likely to see money pouring into ads supporting key House and Senate committee members to curry favor, we are likely to see it flowing to ads supporting potential challengers as a way of threatening sitting lawmakers with ouster. But there can be sound policy responses to this change in the legal landscape. The key now is for members of Congress to not panic and take a moment to consider the possible options. Adding corporate money into politics is like setting a brush fire. If the fire is contained and managed, it won't do much damage to the political culture. If it gets out of control, a whole territory can go up in flames. One possible policy response to Citizens United -- significantly raising federal contribution limits for individuals and parties -- would be like adding fuel to the brush fire, turning it into a conflagration. Increased corporate money may encourage congressional and presidential races to turn into unprecedented arms races for funds. In the 2008 federal election, individual giving topped corporate PAC funding, but in the wake of the Citizens United decision, this ratio could flip in 2010. Corporate money could dwarf -- by many multiples -- dollars spent by individuals in every future American election. This would inevitably damage public trust in our system and open the door to the corruption that money can bring to politics. The Citizens United decision calls for thoughtful firebreaks to keep billions in corporate money from sweeping into our elections, to slow the progress of the corporate money wildfire. One immediate firebreak would be to change the securities laws to allow shareholders authority and oversight over corporate political spending. After Citizens United, corporate managers are free to spend corporate treasury money on politics without the knowledge or consent of their shareholders. The new law can be modeled on one from our peers in Britain, who since 2000 have required shareholder authorization for political spending by British companies. The U.K. also requires British companies to report political spending to shareholders in annual reports. Adopting this system in the U.S. would give shareholders a way to check such spending of corporate managers. Another, and perhaps the best available solution, is public financing for congressional elections. Under the proposed Fair Elections Now Act, sponsored by John Larson, D-Connecticut, in the House and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, in the Senate, candidates for Congress who qualified after demonstrating some amount of constituent financial support would receive public grants to run a campaign. Candidates would have an alternative to privately funded elections. So instead of being beholden to large individual donors or large corporate donors, congressional candidates could be un-bought and un-bossed. Combined, these two approaches won't stop corporate money in politics completely the way the previous ban did; but they would create protections to keep the corporate money brush fire contained rather than turning it into an out-of-control wildfire threatening the integrity of our democratic system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ciara Torres-Spelliscy .","Ciara Torres-Spelliscy: Supreme Court ruling loosening campaign finance limits is mistake .

"(CNN) -- The European Union committed Friday to sending 500 troops to the tumultuous Central African Republic -- a number that the coalition is ""looking"" to double, according to its foreign policy chief. The announcement from the EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton came after her address to the U.N. Security Council and after France announced it will send 400 additional troops to its former colony. Already, France, an EU member, has deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops following a U.N. Security Council vote in December authorizing military intervention. In late January, the Security Council voted to not only continue its peacekeeping mission in the war-weary African nation but to authorize the use of force by EU troops there -- setting the stage for Friday's announcement by Ashton. The Central African Republic plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, in the latest in a series of coups since the country gained independence in 1960. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. One of the Seleka's leaders, Michel Djotodia, then seized power only to step down as President in January after failing to halt the escalating violence. Catherine Samba-Panza, the mayor of Bangui, was recently tapped as the country's interim President. Still, the climate is volatile. The United Nations recently pointed to an ""increasing cycle of violence and retaliation"" and the ""continuing deterioration of the security situation."" Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks on Christian communities, vigilante Christian groups have fought back. The United Nations -- estimating more than half the country's population is affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis -- has said it fears genocide brewing. According to the United Nations, more than 700,000 people across the Central African Republic have been displaced -- including about 290,000 alone in the capital of Bangui -- and 2.6 million ""need immediate humanitarian assistance."" Attempts to purge Muslims from parts of the war-torn country have prompted ""a Muslim exodus of historic proportions,"" according to rights group Amnesty International. And on Friday, a public prosecutor said that a mass grave with at least 13 decomposing bodies had been discovered in Bangui. Maturin Grenzengue said Central African Republic and allied troops were working to remove concrete slabs of an underground cement tank ""to determine the exact number of bodies that will be found here."" Valerie Amos, the U.N.'s humanitarian chief, is set to spend three days in the country starting next Tuesday. The same agency's top official on refugees, Antonio Guterres, said Wednesday the country is ""a humanitarian catastrophe."" ""There is an ethnic-religious cleansing taking place. It must be stopped,"" Guterres said. ""There are people who are still being killed here and there -- even some massacres still taking place.""","NEW: Prosecutor: A mass grave with at least 13 bodies is discovered in Bangui .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed legislation Thursday that would bar federal funding for National Public Radio -- a longtime target of conservatives irritated by what they consider the outlet's liberal bias. The bill passed 228-192 in a sharply partisan vote. Most Republicans backed the measure while every Democrat opposed it. While the measure was expected to pass the GOP-controlled House, it is believed to have little chance of clearing the Democratic-controlled Senate. The move to strip funding comes after a conservative activist secretly taped a NPR fundraising executive criticizing Tea Party supporters and saying public radio would be better off without federal money. On Tuesday, the House voted to cut $50 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps support NPR. That measure was part of a larger bill to keep the government running for the next three weeks. The House moved last month to eliminate all federal funding for the CPB as part of its bill to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year. That bill, however, failed to pass the Senate. Among other things, the measure which passed the House Thursday would bar any of NPR's affiliate radio stations across the country from using any federal funds to purchase programming from NPR. Forty percent of NPR's funding comes from member station fees, according to the outlet. Roughly 2% comes from federal grants. ""We have to deal with the fiscal reality of this country,"" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. America has to figure out ""how to do more with less. ... We can't afford to be all things to all people."" Public radio ""has been wildly successful,"" Chaffetz argued. The outlet's total number of listeners is rising, so ""it should be moving toward a model where (it) can sustain"" itself rather than relying on taxpayers. NPR's listeners are largely ""wealthy"" and ""well educated,"" claimed Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee. ""It is time for us to remove the federal support system ... and see what NPR can do on (its) own."" ""With the national debt over $13 trillion, the government simply can't afford to fund non-essential services,"" said Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado. ""NPR can survive on its own."" We need to ""remove the taxpayer from the equation."" According to NPR's website, the outlet currently provides content to 900 independent stations, reaching 27.2 million listeners every week. Democrats argued that NPR serves a vital public function. Stripping it of public funds will do little to reduce the federal deficit while cutting popular programming in small towns and rural areas across the country, they claimed. ""This bill would wipe (programs like) 'Car Talk' off the road. It would wipe 'Lake Wobegon' right off the map,"" said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts. ""GOP used to stand for Grand Old Party. Now it stands for Gut Our Programs."" Markey argued that many local public stations would not be able to attract a sufficient audience and fundraising base to survive keep without easy access to NPR's signature programs, such as ""All Things Considered."" This bill ""will snuff out stations from coast to coast,"" he predicted. ""This makes no sense."" The GOP has launched an ""ideological crusade against balanced news,"" claimed Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, circulated a letter to House members earlier in the week citing press reports that he said demonstrated that James O'Keefe -- the conservative activist who set up the taping -- ""deceptively edited"" the video to target NPR. ""Biased? No. Unbiased,"" said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. ""NPR speaks the truth. ... It provides a fair and balanced presentation.""

"(CNN) -- The Italian navy has rescued about 6,000 people in the past four days from more than 40 overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean, the United Nations' refugee agency said Friday. Its figures give a new indication of the scale of the challenge faced by Italian authorities in keeping up with the flow of migrants seeking to reach European soil. About 18,000 people have arrived by sea in Italy so far this year, while in 2013, the number of arrivals was near 43,000, the UNHCR said. Of those who arrived last year, the largest group, more than 11,300, were Syrians fleeing the conflict in their homeland. Of those picked up off the Italian islands of Sicily and Calabria in the past four days, a large number were women and children, including newborns and unaccompanied minors, UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a prepared statement Friday. Many were fleeing violence, conflict and persecution, the statement said. The migrants, who had set off from Zwara, in Libya, in search of safety within the European Union, have now been taken to Italian ports. The UNHCR has urged countries to work together to rescue people at sea at the same time as looking for legal migration channels that will prevent people from risking their lives at sea. ""The Mediterranean is one of the busiest seaways in the world, as well as a dangerous sea frontier for many asylum-seekers trying to find safety in Europe,"" the statement said. ""The challenges of protecting refugees traveling irregularly by sea in search of safety, often together with people moving for other reasons, are complex."" The agency also says that the reception centers in which asylum seekers are held after they are rescued must be adequate. Last October, the world was shocked by the deaths of hundreds of people in shipwrecks off Italy's coasts. More than 300 died in one shipwreck alone off the tiny island of Lampedusa. The Italian government set up a rescue operation after that tragedy, the UNHCR said, which has saved more than 20,000 people at sea.","The migrants were picked up from more than 40 overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean .

"(CNN) -- Are technology companies ailing? Hewlett-Packard certainly is. The venerable behemoth announced it will implement a restructuring that includes eliminating 27,000 jobs. HP tried to bring itself around by replacing its CEO last year. That didn't quite do the trick, so now it's resorting to the good old-fashioned mass layoff. One suspects that HP is a little too venerable. It was the first ""Stanford spinoff,"" fittingly reflected in the presence of Hewlett Hall and Packard Hall in the engineering corner of the Stanford campus. Yet HP hasn't stayed ahead of the innovation curve, failing for instance to adapt well to the tablet craze. This could be the end of an era. Consider two Stanford neighbors of Hewlett and Packard Halls -- Gates Hall and the Huang Center. Bill Gates' company may be losing the innovation war, too. It's getting pummeled by the tablets as well, and just this week Google's Chrome Web browser overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer in popularity. By contrast, the Huang Center was funded by Jen-Hsun Huang, whose firm NVIDIA has been revolutionizing the supercomputer field. But won't those laid-off HP engineers be snapped up by the booming tech sector? Many will not. The tech job market is excellent for younger workers, but many of those who are laid off and over 35 will find the market less welcoming. They're perceived as too expensive. The HP layoff will consist disproportionately of older workers. Indeed, jettisoning the veterans is often the hidden agenda in mass layoffs. It's no coincidence that many of the U.S. core engineering openings at HP have titles like Recent Graduate, Intern and Post Doc, all aimed at the younger crowd. The difficulties of older techies have been investigated statistically in studies at American University and the National Research Council, but a very public human face was placed on this recently in an online town hall meeting with President Obama. The wife of electrical engineer Darin Wedel explained to the president that her husband has never found a permanent job after being laid off by the electronics giant Texas Instruments. Granted, family issues restricted him to the Dallas area, but if the hype regarding a seller's market for engineers were true, Wedel should have been able to find something in that region, which sadly has not been the case. A former student of mine was a star at HP for 10 years or so, acquiring patents and promotions. Yet he, too, got caught up in a huge layoff, and could find engineering work only sporadically afterward. Ultimately he left the field. Those who survive this round of HP layoffs will likely find themselves being asked to not only do their own jobs, but also those of the departed. Engineers are exempt employees, hence no overtime pay, and HP will accrue a net reduction in labor costs. Another tried and true fix for a sick firm (and for the well ones) is to ship work abroad. A few years ago, HP executive Ann Livermore made it plain: ""A basic business tenet is that things go to the areas where there is the best cost of production."" HP's jobs Web page shows that 48 of the 113 open core engineering positions are outside the United States. Unlike Livermore's explicit position on cheap labor, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina said that HP offshores work because the American educational system doesn't develop good math skills in its students. That claim is a red herring. HP workers, including those being discarded, are among the best in the business, and were whizzes in math when they were in school. Many of our technology leaders, from Hewlett to Huang, are products of the American school system. The offshored operations often require U.S.-based workers to make periodic site visits. Survivors of the HP layoffs who always wanted to visit Singapore may now get their chance -- monthly. To her credit, HP's current CEO, Meg Whitman, conceded that layoffs ""adversely impact people's lives."" But she insisted that the action is necessary. Probably so, but the message here is that engineers, like many others, will have to get used to a life of layoffs in a globalized economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Norman Matloff.","Hewlett-Packard announced it will eliminate 27,000 jobs .

"(CNN) -- Libya's newly appointed Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni stepped down from his post on Sunday after an attack on him and his family. The General National Congress, the country's interim parliament, appointed al-Thinni Tuesday as interim prime minister and gave him a week to form a new cabinet. In a letter to the GNC posted on the government's website, al-Thinni said he and his family were the victims of a ""cowardly attack"" on Saturday night, a ""shooting that terrified people in a residential area and endangered the lives of some."" ""I do not accept a single drop of Libyan blood be shed because of me and I do not accept to be a reason for fighting among Libyans because of this position,"" al-Thinni said. ""Therefore I apologize for not accepting my designation as interim prime minister."" Al-Thinni said he and members of the cabinet will continue their work as a caretaker government until a new prime minister is chosen by the GNC. Before his appointment on Tuesday, al-Thinni had taken over the cabinet as acting prime minister after his predecessor, Ali Zeidan, was voted out by the GNC last month. Zeidan, who was briefly kidnapped by a militia while in office, fled to Germany after his ouster because of security threats. There were no injuries reported in the attack on al-Thinni and his family, and no details about the incident were released. A resident in the neighborhood told CNN that al-Thinni was with his family when his convoy came under attack by a militia close to the area where he lives in Tripoli. After they escaped the attack and entered the neighborhood close to Tripoli's airport road, heavy gunfire erupted in the area. There have been increased concerns about the worsening security situation in Libya and the country's rocky transition to democracy after the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The government has so far been unable to build an army and a police force to rein in the hundreds of militia groups with competing interests, ideologies and agendas who continue to destabilize the North African nation. Officials have frequently been targeted and intimidated by the different militia groups. While serving as defense minister, al-Thinni's son was kidnapped in Tripoli last September and released earlier this year.","Abdullah al-Thinni is stepping down after he and his family were attacked .

"(CNN) -- Three bangs. Four shots. Nine witnesses. ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius has been on trial for a week, charged with the murder of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp. At this point, some facts are beyond dispute. The Olympic and Paralympic track star killed his girlfriend in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. He fired four bullets through the door of a toilet room she was in. Three hit her; the final one in the head, and she died. The overarching question in the trial is why he did it. He says he thought she was a burglar and made a tragic mistake. Prosecutors say the couple argued and he shot her in anger. In the first week of the trial, it became clear that the judge's verdict would hinge on several questions that, so far, remain unanswered: . What were the bangs that neighbors heard on the night of the shooting? Four people who live near Pistorius said they heard loud bangs on the night of the shooting, with a pause between them. All four -- Michelle Burger, Estelle van der Merwe, Charl Johnson and Johan Stipp -- said they thought at the time that the sounds were gunshots. They generally agree that there was a pause between two distinct sets of bangs or booms, with screaming in between. Defense lawyer Barry Roux argues that the second set of bangs was in fact the sound of Pistorius breaking down the toilet door with a cricket bat after he realized what he had done. But Burger and Stipp said the three bangs they heard came in such quick succession that there would have been no time to swing the cricket bat back before striking the door again. Does Pistorius sound like a woman when he screams? There were some chuckles in court when Roux first asserted that Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams, but it turns out to be a critical part of the defense. Some witnesses testified to hearing screams before any of the bangs, including the sound of both a man and a woman shouting. The prosecution argues that the screaming was the argument that led Pistorius to murder Steenkamp. But there was a second scream or series of screams that the neighbors said sounded like a woman in terror. Burger called them ""petrifying,"" and Stipp said the woman sounded ""scared, almost scared out of her mind."" That screaming, the prosecution suggests, was Steenkamp fleeing in fear from an enraged Pistorius. But the defense says it was Pistorius himself, screaming in anguish as he realized his deadly error. Neighbor van der Merwe gave some support to this theory, saying she heard what she thought was a woman screaming and asked her husband what it was. Her husband, who knows the track star, told her it was Pistorius, she testified. But Samantha Taylor, an ex-girlfriend of Pistorius, testified that he had yelled at her and others often and that when he shouted, he sounded like a man. Is Pistorius trigger happy? This is a key element of the state's case, which prosecutor Gerrie Nel admitted in his opening statement is ""circumstantial"" -- there were no eyewitnesses to the killing. So the state has brought two unrelated gun charges against Pistorius -- one that a gun went off in a crowded restaurant when he was holding it, and one that he fired a gun out a car's sunroof in irritation after an aggravating police stop for speeding that turned into an argument over his gun. It's not clear that the prosecution witnesses who have talked about the two incidents have done much to build the state's case. Boxer Kevin Lerena, a friend of Pistorius, was with him at the restaurant, he testified. Lerena said a third friend, Darren Fresco, passed Pistorius a loaded gun under the table, telling the athlete he was ""one up."" That meant there was a bullet in the chamber of the gun, ready to fire. Almost immediately, it went off under the table. Pistorius apologized to his friends and asked Fresco to take the blame, which he did in order to avoid drawing attention to the Blade Runner. Taylor is the only source for the sunroof incident thus far, and she was unable to provide any details about where it took place. Roux said that Pistorius was in fact golfing at St. Andrews in Scotland the day after Taylor said it happened. But Taylor also said that Pistorius carried a gun with him and that at least once when he heard a noise at his bedroom window at night, he woke her, took his gun and went to investigate. Another time when he thought his car was being followed, she said, he took his gun and knocked on the window of the other car with it. Did Pistorius lie to a security guard after killing Steenkamp? The ninth and last witness of the week was Pieter Baba, who was on duty as the security shift supervisor at the Silverwoods Estate on the night Pistorius shot Steenkamp. Several neighbors called his office to report hearing gunshots, and Baba went out with another guard to investigate. He ended up near the Pistorius house, speaking to Pistorius on the phone. According to Baba, Pistorius said: ""Security, everything is fine."" But Baba could hear Pistorius crying and decided to go to the house. He arrived in time to see Pistorius carrying Steenkamp's body down the stairs. ""My lady, I was so shocked I couldn't think for a few moments,"" he told the judge. Roux made a concerted effort to shake Baba's version of what Pistorius said on the phone, asking twice in a row whether the runner had said ""everything"" was fine or that ""he"" was fine, then whether he had said ""OK"" or ""fine."" Baba stuck to his story and finally turned to the judge to say: ""My lady, Mr. Pistorius's exact words were, 'Security, everything is fine.' "" Testimony for the week ended on that note, with Baba to continue on the stand Monday. Why do South Africans call security rather than the police when they hear gunshots? South Africans who can afford it tend to live in areas with private security. Their alarm systems alert their private security guards, not police. South Africans who use private security say their guards are based closer and will be on the scene faster than police. Of the four Pistorius neighbors who testified, only one, Stipp, said he called police -- and even he called private security first. He said that the estate's security guards arrived soon after he called, and that after talking to them, he went to the house to see if he, a doctor, could help. He found security guards there and told them to call an ambulance. He left after the ambulance team did, by which time police still had not arrived.","Oscar Pistorius says he thought Reeva Steenkamp was a burglar and made a tragic mistake .

"(CNN) -- There is a growing belief among many in the West that Europe and the United States provoked President Putin into annexing Crimea. Moscow's reaction to NATO expansion and to the EU's efforts to bring Ukraine into its orbit was, it is said, inevitable. In this view, Western leaders backed Putin into a corner and, with the situation worsening in eastern Ukraine, it is time we gave him an exit plan. Interestingly, this is the prevalent view in Southeast Asia, a region not lacking a large and assertive neighbor of its own. In Singapore last week, several prominent figures told me Southeast Asia is managing better the challenge of a resurgent China than Europe is a re-assertive Russia. But this is a misleading comparison. China and Russia present entirely different propositions to their neighbors. President Xi Jinping recognizes the logic of win-win international politics. Whilst tightening his political control, he has overseen what is perhaps China's most ambitious strategy for market-led socio-economic reform since the Deng Xiaoping era, and launched an all-out assault on the rampant levels of corruption in the Chinese Communist Party. In focusing on growth and modernization, Xi is aware of the importance of a stable and prosperous regional environment, and has sought to manage the growing anxiety and resentment that China's rise is causing among its Southeast Asian neighbors. Relations with Japan have deteriorated to a dangerous level, but in China's southern neighborhood Xi has worked hard to improve relations. Ties with Vietnam and Malaysia have been bolstered, despite competing territorial claims over islands in the South China Sea. China is increasingly active in a range of regional multilateral institutions, and has sustained a constructive political and economic relationship with the United States, despite their competing strategic roles in the region. Most importantly, China is ever more deeply integrated economically with its neighbors across East Asia, serving as an essential engine of regional economic growth. From a Chinese perspective, the rising tide lifts all boats. Neighbors that are economically strong support China's growth. Given its relative size, China's political influence will only grow as a result. 'Law of jungle' The contrast between this approach and that of President Putin could not be starker. Putin appears to see the world through a unique prism of winner takes all and loser loses everything. He represents a 19th century ""law of the jungle"" mentality, in the words of Angela Merkel. This makes Russia an altogether more dangerous neighbor. As tends to be the case with bad neighbors, Russia's belligerence stems from problems at home. Despite recent high global oil prices, Putin presides over an economy in reverse. Russia's current account surplus was already projected to have disappeared this year, before the crisis over Ukraine. Capital outflows amounted to $63 billion last year, a figure at least matched in the first quarter of 2014. In the meantime, growth is projected to fall in 2014 to 0.6% according to Russian figures, after achieving only 1.3% in 2013. Like Xi, Putin has tightened his control over the media and political opposition. But rather than accompanying political tightening with economic reform, his government has side-stepped market-opening commitments made as part of Russia's WTO accession. And rather than tackling ever-deepening corruption, he has continued to hand his close allies the choicest parts of the Russian economy through Kremlin-led corporate mergers and lucrative concessions. Regionally, Putin's notion of national security is to surround Russia with what Karel de Gucht, the EU Trade Commissioner, recently described as a string of economic ""black holes"" (such as Ukraine and Belarus) and ""frozen conflicts"" (including in Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia). These areas remain dependent upon Russia for their economic survival and constitute a further hindrance to Russian economic growth. Where China recognizes the necessity of a stable neighborhood, Putin has manufactured a volatile and vulnerable one. Nor does he show any interest in exiting this spiral. Having failed with economic coercion, he is now also resorting to political and military coercion to prevent Ukraine from escaping Russia's economic stranglehold. No return . Russia will not reform under Putin's watch, as some in the West once hoped. He blames the West for Russia's ills and wallows in victimhood. But he avoids reforming the economic system he created, and perceives steps towards embedding the rule of law, accountable government and more open markets around Russia's neighborhood as threats to his and Russia's power. If the choice now is between trying to bring President Putin gradually in from the cold, or containing his worst instincts towards Russia's European neighbors, the latter is the only rational answer. Europe and the United States should not accept the way Crimea was annexed into Russia, and should be prepared and willing to apply major economic sanctions should Putin raise the stakes again over Ukraine or Transnistria. Over time, Ukraine should be integrated into EU markets through the completion of the Association Agreement along with substantial financial support. There can be no return for Putin to the G8 or business-as-usual in NATO until Russian economic and military threats against its European neighbors are lifted and a mutually acceptable solution is found to Crimea's status. Putin's actions are not a response to European and American provocations. He has painted himself into a corner with a combination of strategic paranoia, dreams of Russian revanche and economic illiteracy. As it seeks to present a strong and united response, the West can ill afford to blame itself. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robin Niblett.","There is a growing view Russia was provoked into annexing Crimea, Robin Niblett says .
This belief is prevalent in Southeast Asia, where China is asserting itself, he says .
But Niblett says China's president recognizes the logic of win-win diplomacy .

"(CNN) -- A Swedish citizen of Rwandan origin was sentenced to life in prison Thursday by a court in Stockholm after he was tried and convicted for his role in the country's genocide nearly 20 years ago. He is 54-year-old Stanislas Mbanenande, an ethnic Hutu. At least 800,000 people in Rwanda were killed in the 1994 genocide, one of the worst mass slaughters in the post-World War II era. Genocide survivor has faith in future of Rwanda . This is the first time that Sweden has tried a case for genocide, and also the first time anyone has been convicted of genocide in a Swedish court. The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis also were killed. Along with a charge of genocide, Mbanenande was convicted in the Stockholm District Court of gross violations of international law, including murder, attempted murder, inciting murder and kidnapping. The case involves several massacres in western Rwanda's Kibuye prefecture, where Mbanenande was born and raised. Mbanenande was accused of having an informal leadership role and using an automatic weapon to shoot at groups of people. He took part in massacres at public buildings such as a church, a school and a sports stadium where people sought shelter. He also is accused of taking part in the hunt for Tutsis in the Ruhiro and Bisesero mountains where people had fled to seek safety. Mbanenande left Kibuye in 1994 when Tutsi-dominated invasion troops were nearing. He then lived in Congo until 1996, and then he moved to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. In 1999 his family moved to Sweden. Mbanenande eventually joined them and became a Swedish citizen in 2008.","The man is tied to several massacres in western Rwanda .

"(CNN) -- With the Russian military having effectively taken control of Crimea, a permanent division of Ukraine is becoming increasingly likely. Russian President Vladimir Putin's request to the Russian Senate to approve military intervention in Ukraine in order to ""protect citizens of Russia"" highlights how once seemingly innocuous ""compatriot policies"" are being used by Moscow to justify military efforts to regain Crimea for Russia. Russia's compatriot policies are officially meant to protect ethnic Russians living in nearby countries, but have served Russia's territorial expansionism in the past. In fact these compatriot policies can be viewed as part of Putin's new military doctrine that seeks territorial gains in the former Soviet republics, particularly where there is a receptive population of Russian speakers. The compatriot policies, outlined in Russia's ""National Security Strategy to 2020,"" were introduced in 2000 during Putin's first presidential term. They call for the political, economic and, potentially, military protection of the rights and interests of Russian citizens and ethnic Russians living abroad. An effective tactic associated with the policies is to give Russian citizenship to ethnic Russians in foreign states so as to better protect their interests. Tellingly, Russia's national security strategy emphasizes that compatriots are an important tool for achieving Russia's foreign policy aims. Map: A divided Ukraine . Looking at Russia's neighborhood, one can already see how compatriot policy has assisted Russia's foreign policy and territorial expansion. Prior to the Georgian-Russian war in 2008, Georgia was seeking closer relations with the West and distancing itself from Russia (in a very similar vein to Ukraine today). Meanwhile Moscow was handing out citizenship to the inhabitants of the separatist Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Thus the ""protection of Russian citizens"" became one of Russia's main motives for going to war with Georgia in 2008 and securing South Ossetia and Abkhazia as Russian protectorates. But Ukraine does not have to look to the Caucasus to see compatriot policy in action. On Ukraine's southwestern border, Transnistria is a separatist territory of Moldova which has also become effectively a Russian military-controlled territory as the Kremlin sought to ""protect"" the Russian speakers and eventually Russian citizens. Opinion: The two Putins . Farther afield, Russia has also taken great pains to cultivate the loyalty of its compatriots in the Baltic states, particularly in Estonia and Latvia. Well aware of Russia's compatriot tactics, Lithuania, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, called an urgent meeting and also invoked the NATO treaty on Ukraine. For Moscow, Crimea is much more important than South Ossetia, Abkhazia or Transnistria. First, Crimea became Ukrainian territory only in 1954 when the Soviet Union's leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to Kiev under the overall authority of the Soviet Union. Its loss after the disintegration of the Soviet Union was a major blow to leaders in Moscow. Second, Sevastopol, one of Crimea's major cities, serves as the naval base for Russia's Black Sea fleet. It is a prized territory that allows the Russian navy direct access to the Mediterranean. Crimea is a particularly soft target for Russia's compatriot policies. Unlike Western Ukraine, where people speak Ukrainian, or even Eastern Ukraine, which is Russian speaking, Crimea is predominantly ethnically Russian. Opinion: Putin's Ukranian endgame . With Crimea's Russians protesting the turn of events in Kiev's Independence Square and expressing their solidarity with Moscow, a secessionist movement is almost inevitable. Already, the Crimean parliament announced that it would hold a referendum to increase the peninsula's autonomy from Ukraine and installed a pro-Russian prime minister. While Crimea's fate seems almost certain to follow those of South Ossetia, Abkhazia or Transnistria, other states near Russia that also have significant populations of Russian speakers should be vigilant. Putin's compatriot doctrine is here to stay. Thus it is no wonder Georgia will likely be urgently seeking integration with NATO and the EU. Ukraine should stabilize its government and consider following suit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnia Grigas.","Agnia Grigas: Vladimir Putin has made effective use of his ""compatriot"" policy .

"(CNN) -- Her popstar boyfriend has written a song about her ""heart of a champion,"" but Victoria Azarenka is struggling to get on court at the moment. The Belorussian is unbeaten in 17 matches this year, but she has now suffered her third withdrawal of the season after a late pullout at the Miami Masters on Friday. She cited the ankle injury that forced her to miss last week's quarterfinal against Caroline Wozniacki at Indian Wells, allowing Maria Sharapova to take the No. 2 ranking spot from her. ""The last two days I tried to practice, which did not get better so it just gives me a very obvious indication that it's not possible for me to play,"" Azarenka told reporters at Key Biscayne, where she was champion in 2009 and 2011 and this year had a first-round bye. ""Today I went on the court and I got more pain. I cannot really move. It makes me very frustrated."" The Australian Open champion has been dating LMFAO's Redfoo, whose new song ""Heart of a Champion"" samples the tennis star's trademark grunting and includes the lines ""You gotta start aggressive, Keep your feet moving, You gotta really want it, With everything you're doing."" It even apparently alludes to her controversial Australian Open semifinal against Sloane Stephens, when the 23-year-old angered fans by taking a lengthy medical break at a crucial point in the match against the U.S. newcomer, citing breathing difficulties. The chorus includes: ""When you're losing your breathing, Your body is sore, To be the last one standing, In the eye of a storm, It takes the heart of a champion."" Redfoo, the son of Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, is a keen tennis player himself and has entered in regional qualifying playoffs for this year's U.S. Open. The 37-year-old rapper will try to get through in both singles and doubles, in which he will partner Ayaka Okuno, 17, who he has been coaching. ""It's always been a dream of mine to play professional tennis,"" he said in a statement last week. Azarenka's withdrawal allowed 19-year-old Lauren Davis into the main draw, and she took her chance -- saving three match points against Madison Keys before beating her fellow American 6-1 5-7 7-6 (9-7) in the second-round match. There was also a walkover in the men's event in Miami, as third seed David Ferrer progressed to the third round after Russia's Dmitry Turnsunov pulled out due to illness. The Spaniard will next play Italian 32nd seed Fabio Fognini.","World No. 3 Victoria Azarenka pulls out of Miami tournament due to ankle injury .

"New York (CNN)  -- The announcement that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men accused of the 9/11 attacks will soon be moved to New York to face trial in a federal court will be welcomed by some Americans as finally starting the process of bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice. To date, not one person has been convicted for the attacks. But it also will be a reminder that their boss, the man most responsible for killing 3,000 civilians -- the majority of them Americans but many from all around the world -- is still at large. President Obama has stated that it is vitally important for the country to put some of the controversial policies of the last eight years behind it. While the forthcoming trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and several figures allegedly involved in plotting the 9/11 attacks in New York will be helpful, nothing would help more than if Osama bin Laden were captured, afforded full due process and put on trial. It would be nothing short of a watershed moment, doing much to restore the public's confidence in American institutions and the rule of law after years of being told that they were too quaint for the challenges of a new era. And it would go a long way, too, in restoring the moral high ground for the United States in the court of global opinion. An indictment dating back to 1998 awaits al Qaeda's leader in the Southern District Federal Court of New York, which can be easily updated by a grand jury to include his crimes since. This is where  Mohammed and four others accused of the 9/11 attacks are also expected to be tried. Less than a mile from ground zero, there could be no more appropriate place to try bin Laden. There is virtually no chance that bin Laden would walk free from a U.S. courtroom as there are at least three separate video recordings of him acknowledging responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. What's more, the U.S. government, thanks to cooperation agreements struck at the end of previous trials, already has at least three former al Qaeda insiders lined up, including the former Egyptian al Qaeda operative Ali Mohammed, to provide testimony about bin Laden's hands-on involvement in the 1998 African Embassy Bombings. A trial for bin Laden in federal court would be somewhat less problematic for prosecutors than for some of the high value detainees now being held in Guantanamo. No ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" have been employed on al Qaeda's leader. Capturing bin Laden will, of course, not be easy. There has been no meaningful intelligence on his location since he escaped from Tora Bora in December 2001. And bin Laden, believed now to be somewhere in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan, will likely do everything he can to avoid being taken into custody. ""According to our security arrangements, if enemy forces surrounded Sheikh Osama and there was a possibility that he would escape, I was to kill him before they could catch him alive. ... I constantly stood behind his back around the clock,"" Abu Jandal, bin Laden's chief bodyguard until 2000, later revealed. Despite this, the Obama administration would be well advised to put its emphasis on capturing bin Laden alive, such would be the benefits of a public trial. The Obama administration will feel obliged to target al Qaeda's leader with a Predator strike if there is a narrow window of opportunity -- no other individual inspires and unifies al Qaeda like he does, and few have been as slippery -- but if intelligence suggests bin Laden has been living for some time in a particular location, real consideration should be given to sending in a Special Forces team to take him alive. The Bush administration, while often repeating the mantra of needing to ""capture or kill"" al Qaeda's leader, in practice leaned heavily toward the latter. The leader of the Delta Force team charged with tracking down bin Laden at Tora Bora later recalled, ""We knew the writing on the wall was really to kill him. No one wanted to bring Osama bin Laden back to stand trial in the United States somewhere."" Those in favor of quietly killing al Qaeda's leader have argued that a public trial would be dangerous because it would provide bin Laden with a global platform for his views and unleash a wave of terrorist attacks and kidnappings by his comrades in efforts to release him. These are concerns that cannot be dismissed lightly. In a federal trial, bin Laden would have the right to defend himself and the media frenzy over proceedings would likely dwarf even that of the O.J. Simpson trial. In the past there has been a link to the imprisonment of individuals beloved of al Qaeda and terrorist violence. As CNN analyst Peter Bergen documented in ""The Osama bin Laden I Know,"" the 1993 arrest, trial and imprisonment in the United States of Omar Abdel Rahman (aka the Blind Sheikh), was a central motivating factor for al Qaeda's terrorist campaign thereafter. In deciding to try Mohammed in New York, the Obama administration has clearly decided that the benefits of public trials for high profile terrorism suspects outweigh such dangers. Joshua Dratel, a defense lawyer who has represented clients in several of the most high profile terrorism trials in the United States, says, ""So what if bin Laden were to articulate his views in court?"" Says Dratel, ""He already has a global audience every time he puts out his recordings, but this time the platform would in reality belong to the United States."" Those familiar with those recordings (which have rarely been aired in full by mainstream media outlets) can attest to the fact that bin Laden's rambling speaking style, his shallow knowledge of Islam and his often twisted logic are unlikely to make his courtroom pronouncements resonate with those who are not already fervent admirers. That will particularly be the case if his public defense follows a full documenting by the prosecution of the human suffering he has orchestrated over the years, evidence which should prove devastating to those who still deny bin Laden's culpability. ""The vast majority of people in the Muslim world have rejected bin Laden's calls for attacks on civilians,"" says Yosri Fouda, a leading Egyptian television presenter, ""and nothing bin Laden could say during a trial could change that."" Would bin Laden's capture lead to a spike of attacks against American interests? This is possible to some degree but al Qaeda can hardly be accused of having shown any restraint whatsoever in targeting Americans since it declared global jihad in 1998. Conversely, convicting bin Laden could -- in the medium term -- lead to a steep drop in al Qaeda violence. While martyrdom would seal bin Laden's status in the jihadist movement, capture would seriously deflate it. Abu Jandal, bin Laden's bodyguard put it this way: ""In the case of his death, I think he will be a symbol for all those who follow him.... His death will be a great force for stirring up everybody's emotions and enthusiasm to follow him on the path to martyrdom. In the case of his arrest, the situation might be a bit different. It might lead to a strong psychological defeat for the group's members."" A trial for bin Laden, undertaken with due process, would not only help the United States take back the moral high ground in the court of global opinion, it would also serve as a powerful counterpoint to the indiscriminate barbarism of bin Laden's terrorist campaign. The affording of due process, even of the worst of enemies is line with the best instincts of the American people. A month after 9/11, when emotions were at their most raw, an Ipsos poll showed that nearly as many Americans said they wanted bin Laden tried (42 percent) as said they wanted him instead killed (49 percent). There has been no comparable poll since, but given Americans voted overwhelmingly for a president who vowed to shut down Guantanamo, it would not be farfetched to suggest that the number favoring a trial for bin Laden has substantially increased. At the National Archives in May, President Obama made a keynote speech on national security and detention. ""Wherever feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts --- courts provided for by the United States Constitution. Some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trial of terrorists. They are wrong. Our courts and juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists,"" he said. A trial for bin Laden, if he can be captured, is not just feasible, but at this juncture in American history would be invaluable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Cruickshank.","Alleged 9/11 conspirators are to be put on trial in New York .

"(CNN) -- ""Are y'all alive?"" Andre 3000 probed the first-day Coachella goers as he took the stage with Big Boi in the first of their reunion shows. The duo, who haven't performed together since their 2006 Idlewild album, hooked the crowd as they opened with their Stankonia hit ""B.O.B."" (""Bombs Over Baghdad""), before going into a rapid-fire of ""Gasoline Dreams,"" ""ATLiens,"" ""Skew It on the Bar-B"" and ""Rosa Parks."" Andre 3000 then told the crowd it feels so good to be back, as he talked about the 20-year anniversary of Outkast (they formed when they were in high school in 1992 and released their debut album in 1994). A notable legend was there to witness the first of their many reunion shows. Andre told the crowd that ""one of his idols"" -- the Purple One, Prince -- was backstage watching as they also ran through ""SpottieOttieDopaliscious,"" ""Roses"" and ""Elevators."" In the middle of the set, Big Boi and Andre both took time to showcase some of their solo work from their double album, ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,"" before rapper Future and Janelle Monae also made appearances. ""This is my favorite group in the entire world,"" proclaimed Monae. ""And what we're witnessing tonight is history."" Outkast's run of mainstream hits came at the end of their set as they went from ""Ms. Jackson"" to ""So Fresh, So Clean,"" ""The Way You Move"" and ""Hey Ya!"" They then tried to squeeze in an encore song with Killer Mike, but weren't able to perform it before the festival's 1 a.m. cutoff. Earlier in the day, Grouplove, Ellie Goulding, Chromeo and Girl Talk were among the acts that prepped the main stage before Outkast. Grouplove got the crowd dancing to tracks off their latest album ""Spreading Rumours,"" before Ellie Goulding really got fans fired up with her sunset set, drawing celebrities including Selena Gomez, Kendall and Kylie Jenner and Joe Jonas to the front for the Brit's high-energy performance. The Top-40 mainstay powered through her list of electro-pop hits like ""Lights"" and ""I Need Your Love,"" before getting everyone to their feet with closer ""Burn."" Chromeo got the masses moving with their disco-flavored electro-funk. Although they are Coachella vets, this weekend brought them a few festival firsts -- playing on a Friday and performing on the main stage, which they told CNN they found to be more challenging to connect with the crowd. ""On the big stage, they're 50 feet away, so I could barely hear them,"" said guitarist and lead singer Dave 1 after their set. The duo ran through a mixture of familiar hits, including ""Fancy Footwork"" and ""Momma's Boy,"" as well as tracks from their forthcoming album, ""White Women."" Toro Y Moi made a guest appearance for recent single, ""Come Alive."" Other Day 1 crowd-pleasers included Aloe Blacc, Bastille (who garnered a crowd that waited through their entire set to hear the familiar hit song ""Pompeii""), Broken Bells and HAIM. The sister act performed on the Outdoor Theatre during the peak of the heat in the afternoon. In between her now-notable ""bassface"" expressions, Este Haim told the crowd that she has been coming to Coachella since 2004, but that this is the first year she hasn't had to run through a rose bush or hop a fence to get inside. Meanwhile in the Sahara tent, newcomer Martin Garrix attracted a crowd that extended past the tent walls as he opened his set with his notable track ""Animals."" His mix included samples from other Coachella weekend acts like Kid Cudi and Krewella, which had the crowd yelling along to the lyrics. But the most impressive part of the 17-year-old's hour-set was the striking laser-light show that prompted the majority of the tent to take out their cell phones and capture it on video. Mainstream DJ/producer Zedd continued the fist-pumping/sing-along combination next as he played his radio hits like ""Stay the Night"" and ""Clarity."" The 24-year-old's set got the stamp of approval from Oscar winner Jared Leto who Instagrammed a photo from the stage writing ""My friend @Zedd destroying #coachella."" With two more days ahead in Indio, California, Chromeo's Dave 1 summed up the festival's continued attraction calling it ""the most indie-centric music curation"" with mainstream appeal. ""It's the festival where you have the coolest bands that get the biggest looks,"" he said. ""Coachella's got a sexiness to it that no other festival in the world has.""","Outkast headlined the opening night of the Coachella music festival .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has consistently been linked with a move back to Manchester United -- but Real Madrid star Mesut Ozil insists his club must hold onto the player if it is to challenge at the very top. Ronaldo, who left United for Real in a world record $130 million deal in 2009, has been the subject of much speculation in recent months. The 28-year-old has scored 201 goals in 199 appearances for Real and club president Florentino Perez recently stated that he expected Ronaldo to finish his career in the Spanish capital. But the speculation refuses to disappear -- leaving Ozil hoping his Portuguese teammate stays put. ""Cristiano Ronaldo is very important to the team, just look at all the goals he has scored in the past few seasons,"" he told CNN. ""He's a great person off the field. I hope he can stay here for a long time because he can help us win important titles."" The loss of Ronaldo would be a huge blow to a Real side hoping to snatch the league title back from Barcelona and win its first Champions League crown since 2002. Real has lost out at the semifinal stage in each of the past three seasons with Borussia Dortmund the last team to put paid to the Spanish club's dream of a 10th triumph in the competition. ""We have come very close to winning the Champions League in the past few years and that leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth,"" Ozil revealed. ""What we hope is that we can go further this season. I believe we are good enough to make the final. ""Real is the biggest club in the world and I feel privileged to have the opportunity play here. ""It's like a dream. It's true there's a great deal of pressure to win every game and every title but I actually enjoy that. ""I feel comfortable playing under pressure and thrive in those situations."" Real has been busy in the transfer market ahead of the new season as it looks to challenge both at home and abroad. It has already spent $35 million on talented playmaker Isco and $52 million on defensive midfielder Asier Illarramendi. The club are also reportedly interested in signing Tottenham's Gareth Bale, despite Spurs' determination to hang onto the player. Bale's pace and power lit up the English Premier League last season with the Welshman scoring 21 goals in 33 top-flight appearances. Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas revealed Friday that the club is currently trying to negotiate a new contract with the player. But Real are unlikely to be deterred with Bale exactly the type of player new coach Carlo Ancelotti could utilize as he attempts to increase the tempo of Real's play. ""Ancelotti has his own football philosophy,"" added Ozil of the man Perez chose to succeed Jose Mourinho. ""He wants us to play quicker than before. His system is different to what we're used to but that's why friendly games are important. ""We can get used to a new way of playing. We have quick attacking players so I believe we are equipped to adopt his system successfully."" Ozil will be hoping to guarantee his own place in Ancelotti's side and the 24-year-old has been taking advice from former Real legend Zinedine Zidane. ""Zidane was one of my idols when I was growing up so it was great to have a chance to meet him at Real Madrid,"" Ozil added. ""He has given me some advice but I'll keep that to myself. ""I really appreciate the support he has given me and what he has said to me since I have been here.""","Mesut Ozil believes Cristiano Ronaldo can fire Real Madrid to glory .

"(CNN) -- Two police officers were fatally shot and another two were wounded Thursday in two separate shootings allegedly by the same suspects in West Memphis, Arkansas, police said. The two suspects, who were using an assault weapon, were themselves fatally shot, said Inspector Bert Shelton, who is assigned to city hall for the West Memphis Police Department. The incident began around 11:36 a.m. (12:36 p.m. ET), when West Memphis patrolman Bill Evans made a traffic stop on a white minivan traveling eastbound on I-40 at Airport Road, said Bill Sadler, public information officer for the Arkansas State Police. After the vehicle exited the Interstate onto an off-ramp near College Avenue, Sgt. Brandon Paudert arrived on the scene as backup, Sadler said. ""It is our belief that Officer Evans was shoved to the ground by one of the suspects in the minivan and gunfire was directed at both officers,"" Sadler said. The suspects then fled, driving east in the minivan, leaving one man dead and the other fatally wounded. Within minutes, officers from other agencies -- including the Arkansas State Police and the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission -- began to converge on the area, looking for the suspects, he said. About 90 minutes later, a minivan believed to be the one that had been seen leaving the shooting site was spotted in a parking lot of a nearby Wal-Mart, Sadler said. There, it was approached by Crittenden County Sheriff Dick Busby and Chief Enforcement Officer W.A. Wren, who were traveling in the same vehicle, he said. Both men were wounded in a gunbattle initiated by the suspects, who were using a long rifle and a handgun, Sadler said. The gunbattle ended after ""a very brave, young wildlife officer in his state truck rammed the suspect vehicle, preventing an exit of the suspects,"" who were killed, Sadler said. Both wounded officers were taken to Regional Medical Center at Memphis, where they were in critical condition, said hospital spokeswoman Vivian Crawford. Authorities would not identify the suspects, saying doing so could affect the integrity of the investigation. Paudert was the son of Police Chief Bob Paudert, said West Memphis Police Department Assistant Chief Mike Allen. Both of the dead officers leave widows and young children, he said. Paudert was 39, Evans was 38. The FBI's evidence-response team was among the agencies involved in the investigation. In a statement posted on his website, Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said Paudert and Evans ""died upholding their duty to serve and protect the residents of West Memphis."" He added, ""This is a loss shared by all Arkansans."" A woman who answered the phone at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in West Memphis said the store, which is usually open round the clock, was closed after the incidents, and that store officials hoped to reopen by midnight (1 a.m. ET).","Two West Memphis, Arkansas, officers killed in two shootings .

"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson will take a three-shot lead heading into the final two rounds of the Masters at Augusta National after firing a four-under par 68 on Friday. An incredible run of five straight birdies on Augusta's famously difficult back nine helped put the 2012 champion in pole position heading into the weekend. Watson's initial progress was unremarkable as he reached the turn in even par -- a birdie at the par-four seventh was canceled out two holes later with bogey at nine. But his challenge burst into life at the par-three 12th when he fired his tee shot to two-and-a-half feet to leave a simple tap in for birdie. Another followed at the 13th hole before an astonishing putt at the 14th made it three in a row. Two further birdies saw Watson reach eight-under before his hot streak ended with a par at the 17th followed by a bogey at the last. Together with his opening round 69, Watson is now seven-under par and in control of the tournament. ""It's never easy,"" Watson said. ""It's a great test of golf and I just got some good breaks, some good things that went my way. Guessed the wind right on the stretch of holes on the back nine there."" Watson's string of birdies bettered a run of four he made in the final round when he won two years ago. Full leaderboard: PGA.com . ""That five hole stretch was good. It's one of those where you're not focused on what you're doing, you don't know that you're making all these birdies, you're focused on one shot at a time,"" he said. Watson was one of the early finishers on day two and no one came close to challenging him as the afternoon wore on. Overnight leader Bill Haas stuttered to the turn in one over, before watching the wheels come off his round at Amen Corner completing the three-hole stretch of 11, 12 and 13 in four-over par. The 31-year-old ended the day with a 78 to fall back to two over par. He wasn't the only one to struggle as the wind picked up and the greens dried out. Defending champion Adam Scott toiled on the opening nine dropping three shots before mounting a recovery with birdies at the 12th, 13th and 15th to finish at three under after 36 holes. ""It was so difficult early on, the greens were very dried out and it was hard to make some putts -- it was hard to hit them confidently,"" Scott said. ""I didn't really play well at the start but then made the turn -- you can make it happen if you get through the first couple of holes on the back nine."" The Australian finds himself in a four-way tie for third alongside Dane Thomas Bjorn (68) and Master's rookies Jonas Blixt from Sweden who posted a 71 on Friday and 20-year-old Jordan Spieth from the U.S. who shot a round of 70. Watson's nearest chaser is another Aussie, John Senden, who finished on four-under par after shooting 68 on Friday. Fred Couples, the 1992 champion, is also in the mix after a second consecutive round of 71 left him two-under par and in a tie for seventh with compatriots Jimmy Walker and Jim Furyk. America's Kevin Streelman, Russell Henley and Kevin Stadler are joined at one-under par by Welshman Jamie Donaldson and Scot Stephen Gallacher. Further down the leaderboard, it was a good day for three ex-champions from the 1980s. The 1985 winner Bernhard Langer and Larry Mize, whose sensational chip-in at the second play-off hole won the 1987 Masters, both finished comfortably inside the cut at two-over par. Scot Sandy Lyle, who triumphed in 1988, also squeezed in at four-over par -- the same score as Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy who limped to a 77. Plenty of big names, however, will not be coming back at the weekend including three-time champion Phil Mickelson who ended five-over on Friday following a round of 73. Luke Donald also missed the cut by one stroke as did Spain's Sergio Garcia, South Africa's 2011 champion Charl Schwartzel and 19-year-old English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick.

"(CNN) -- Former Bush adviser Karl Rove said Sunday that Sen. John McCain had gone ""one step too far"" in some of his recent ads attacking Sen. Barack Obama. Karl Rove said both candidates are guilty of going too far in their attacks. Rove has leveled similar criticism against Obama. ""McCain has gone in some of his ads -- similarly gone one step too far,"" he told Fox News, ""and sort of attributing to Obama things that are, you know, beyond the '100 percent truth' test."" The Obama campaign immediately leaped on the quote. ""In case anyone was still wondering whether John McCain is running the sleaziest, most dishonest campaign in history, today Karl Rove -- the man who held the previous record -- said McCain's ads have gone too far,"" said campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor, in a statement sent to reporters minutes after Rove's on-air comments. Rove masterminded both of President Bush's successful White House bids. Rove said both candidates need to ""be careful"" about their attacks on each other. ""They ought to -- there ought to be an adult who says, 'Do we really need to go that far in this ad? Don't we make our point and won't we get broader acceptance and deny the opposition an opportunity to attack us if we don't include that one little last tweak in the ad?' "" he said. Obama on Saturday accused McCain and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin of avoiding the issues to ""distort"" his record. ""They're going to talk about pigs, and they're going to talk about lipstick; they're going to talk about Paris Hilton, they're going to talk about Britney Spears. They will try to distort my record, and they will try to undermine your trust in what the Democrats intend to do,"" he said at a stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds criticized Obama for showing ""zero restraint,"" considering what Gulf Coast residents were facing after Hurricane Ike. Bounds said the ""attacks mark a new low from Barack Obama."" The Obama campaign shot back and accused McCain of ""cynically running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history."" McCain said last week that he thinks the tone of the campaign would be different had Obama agreed to appear with him in town hall meetings across the country. Both McCain and Obama laid low on Sunday. McCain attended a NASCAR race in Loudon, New Hampshire. Obama had no public events scheduled, but Sen. Hillary Clinton hit the trail for him in Akron, Ohio. Clinton repeated her campaign one-liner -- ""No way, no how, no McCain, no Palin."" The New York senator said ""all that McCain and Palin offer is four more years of the same failed policies and wrong direction and disappointment and difficulties that have confronted our country."" ""Barack and I may have started out on two separate paths, but we are on one journey now,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign announced Sunday that it had raised $66 million in August. The new total bests the campaign's previous high of $55 million, which came in February during his tough primary fight with Clinton. The Obama campaign said more than half a million new donors contributed in August, when the Illinois senator accepted the Democratic presidential nomination and named Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as his running mate. The campaign had more than $77 million in cash on hand at the end of August, compared with about $66 million in July. On September 1, McCain's campaign reported raising $47 million in August. That haul also set a monthly record for the Arizona senator, whose campaign says it received a financial shot in the arm after McCain picked Palin to join the ticket. Obama has rejected public financing, calling the system ""broken"" -- a decision that frees him to continue raising money for November. McCain has accepted federal matching funds for his general election campaign, giving him $84 million to spend for November. The money comes with strict spending limits, but the Republican National Committee's victory fund can continue to raise and spend money on his behalf. With Palin on the campaign trail, McCain has been seeing increased numbers and energy at his campaign events. The two will hold joint town hall meetings sometime early this week. A McCain adviser said early plans are to hold the town halls in western Michigan and Wisconsin, although the exact details of where and when they will be held are still being worked out.","Clinton says McCain, Palin offer four more years of ""disappointment""

"(CNN) -- Whether he is predicting the demise of the U.S. ""empire,"" questioning U.S. accounts of the 9/11 attacks or accusing Europe of using the Holocaust as an excuse for supporting Israel, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad knows how to push the West's buttons at the U.N. General Assembly. For the third straight year, U.S. diplomats on Thursday joined envoys from several other nations in walking out during the Iranian president's address at the annual United Nations gathering in New York. That doesn't even count instances before that, when American diplomats conspicuously skipped his speech altogether. This year, Ahmadinejad said European countries ""still use the Holocaust after six decades as the excuse to pay (a) fine or ransom to the Zionists,"" and that the United States killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden instead of investigating ""hidden elements involved in September 11."" Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wasn't impressed. ""We find what Ahmadinejad does and says when he comes to the United Nations absolutely odious, hateful, anti-Semitic, unacceptable, which is why the United States for three consecutive years -- including today -- have led a walkout of his speech,"" Rice told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. ""Inevitably he says something outrageous, dishonest and offensive, and that leads to a walkout."" Here is a look back at Ahmadinejad's other U.N. speeches, and reactions to them: . 2010 . Representatives from the United States, Britain, Spain and other nations walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that the U.S. government either participated in the 9/11 attacks or let them happen as an excuse to wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said most Americans and ""most nations around the world"" believe that ""some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack,"" adding that these people believe the attacks were aimed at reversing ""the declining American economy and its scripts on the Middle East in order to save the Zionist regime."" He also said capitalism and the current world order had reached their demise after 100 years of domination, saying that they were ""unable to provide appropriate solutions to the problems that society faces."" 2009 . In September 2009, Ahmadinejad was critical of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he said ""thousands of innocent people have been killed, injured or displaced, infrastructures have been destroyed and regional security has been seriously jeopardized."" He ripped capitalism, saying it brought about the conditions leading to the world's economic crisis. He also called for a ""return to monotheism and justice,"" calling it ""the greatest hope and opportunity in all ages and generations."" He blasted Israel, accusing it of ""crimes ... against defenseless women and children and destruction of their homes, farms, hospitals and schools."" The next day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Iranian leader at the General Assembly. The delegations that stayed for Ahmadinejad's address gave ""legitimacy to a man who denies the murder of 6 million Jews,"" Netanyahu said, referring to the Holocaust. 2008 . Ahmadinejad told the General Assembly in 2008 that the ""American empire"" was nearing its end, and that Israel ""is on a definite slope to collapse."" While he stopped short of calling for Israel to be politically wiped off the map as he had previously, he called for ""a free referendum in Palestine for determining and establishing the type of state in the entire Palestinian lands."" The U.N. Security Council, he said, ""cannot do anything, and sometimes under pressure from a few bullying powers, even paves the way for supporting these Zionist murders."" He blamed a few world powers for the world's problems, and defended his country's nuclear activities as peaceful. The U.S. and other Western nations had long suspected that Iran had been pursuing nuclear weapons, but Iran said it seeks only a civilian nuclear energy program. He accused the United States of oppressing Iraqis with six years of occupation, saying Americans were ""still seeking to solidify their position in the political geography of the region and to dominate oil resources."" The only person at the United States' table was a note-taker; no U.S. diplomat was present. 2007 . In a 2007 speech that blasted ""selfish and incompetent"" governments that have ""obedience to Satan,"" Ahmadinejad said the U.N. Security Council ""ranks first"" among ineffective international bodies because it is influenced by ""monopolistic powers."" Ahmadinejad invited ""all independent, justice-seeking and peace-loving nations"" to join Iran in a ""coalition for peace."" He also criticized unnamed ""powers"" that he said were responsible for insecurity, division and moral decline across the world. ""Is it not high time for these powers to return from the path of arrogance and obedience to Satan to the path of faith in God?"" he said. He criticized the United States without naming it, offering blunt assessments of the Iraq war and Washington's war on terrorism. ""Setting up secret prisons, abducting (people), trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process, extensive tappings of telephone conversations, intercepting private mail and frequent summons to police and security centers have become commonplace and prevalent."" The American delegation's chairs were unoccupied, except for one woman taking notes. Earlier, he had asked to lay a wreath at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center towers, but New York City officials denied the request, citing safety concerns at what was then a construction site. 2006 . Ahmadinejad said in 2006 that the United States' permanent inclusion on the U.N. Security Council undermines its effectiveness and credibility. He also criticized ""unwarranted support"" for Israel during conflicts in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. On Iraq, Ahmadinejad said the United States, whom he called ""the occupiers,"" is ""incapable of establishing security,"" and scores were dying daily as a result. ""Where can the people of Iraq seek refuge, and from whom can the people of Iraq seek justice?"" he asked. How can the Security Council act ""when the occupiers themselves are permanent members of the council?"" 2005 . Ahmadinejad in 2005 told the General Assembly that Iran had a right to operate a nuclear energy program. He said it was unfair that some nations were allowed to make nuclear fuel while others are condemned for it. ""Today, the most serious challenges is that the culprits are assuming the role of prosecutor,"" he said, accusing the United States of ""bullying the others while through huge media resources portraying themselves as defenders of freedom.""","Sensational remarks are hallmark of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's 7 U.N. addresses .

"(CNN) -- Stretching out across the peaceful waters of the River Tweed in Peeblesshire, Scotland, the Dawyck Estate river crossing is an unlikely record breaker. Measuring 30 meters in length and made entirely out of waste plastic products, the newly completed structure is the world's longest and sturdiest recycled bridge. Utilizing a super-strength composite plastic material -- engineered by researchers at Rutgers University from items as common as plastic bottles and household plastic waste -- the bridge caters for pedestrians, cars and heavy goods vehicles. The river span is one of five such structures now in existence, although all others are smaller and based in the U.S., and can support weights of up to 44 tons. According to Vertech Composites, the British company behind the project, the bridge is a prototype that has the potential to meet future road and bridge requirements in an eco-friendly manner. ""There are currently significant bridge and river crossing needs in rural and countryside areas and there will only be more in years going forward,"" says William Mainwaring, CEO of Vertech Composites. Mainwaring highlights the re-use of obsolete plastics that would otherwise be burned or sent to landfill sites as the primary environmental benefit of the bridge. He also adds that recycled composite plastic provides a more sustainable alternative to existing bridge construction materials and not as likely to degrade as steel, timber and concrete. ""This technology creates enhanced stiffness and strength that is ideal for structures like a bridge,"" says Mainwaring. ""Once the bridge has completed its lifespan, the plastic can then be recycled again and used for other purposes, meaning it will never have to go to landfill,"" he adds. Yet it could be many years before more of us are driving on plastic roads and bridges. ""The bridge in Peeblesshire has been built on private land, so it avoids the safety regulations (which as yet do not account for composite plastics) of the UK transport department,"" says Professor Bob Lark, head of the School of Engineering at Cardiff University, which was involved in helping design the structural aspects of the Dawyck Estate project. Lark believes that overcoming existing legislative hurdles may take time as current building standards have been written around existing materials and do not take into account newly developed ones. However the technology has the potential to be used in other areas of construction sector in the meantime. Such spin-off opportunities have not escaped the attention of Vertech Composites, who are keen to find new and creative ways to use the plastic technology. ""We see the potential for the same recycled plastics to be used in road signage, advertising hoardings, as a replacement for plywood on building sites ... and in agriculture, which currently uses a huge amount of timber on the inside of livestock buildings,"" says Mainwaring. ""These materials generally degrade much more quickly than plastic meaning there is an opportunity to improve efficiencies in a way that spares valuable raw materials and has a positive environmental impact,"" he adds.","A bridge made entirely out of waste plastic has been built over the River Tweed in Scotland .

"(CNN) -- In the heart of London, one of the style capitals of the world, African fashion has found its new home. Based in the UK capital's bustling center, Arise calls itself Africa's first and foremost global style and culture magazine. The bimonthly publication, which has so far been printed 16 issues, first hit the newsstands in 2009 and is now sold in 26 countries across the world. Its illustrious pages are striking a chord with what the magazine calls Afropolitans -- a new generation of young and urban ""Africans of the world"" who breathe fashion and are fascinated by arts and culture. Read related: Congo's designer dandies . Penny McDonald, international managing director at Arise, says there was a gap in the market for a quality offering that would showcase the wide-ranging talents of African designers while breaking stereotypes about the continent's culture. ""There were lovely designers out there who never got a look into the traditional markets and the traditional outlets,"" she says. ""We want to show the other side of the vast continent and that's what this does."" Read related: Why African designers are finally in the fashion spotlight . The large-format magazine, which was initially published every four months, was determined to be competitive amongst other fashion heavy-hitters right from the start. For its first cover back in 2009 it landed some of the fashion world's most glistering stars, including supermodels Alek Wek and Liya Kebede. Since then, a wide array of African and international icons, including Charlize Theron, Alicia Keys and Denzel Washington, have all been featured in Arise. Read related: The Namibian women who dress like Victorians . According to McDonald, convincing readers and advertisers about the magazine's quality was the biggest challenge at the beginning. ""A lot of people in the past thought 'oh, another black publication, oh God, I've seen it all before, it's full of hair and make-up.' And then they suddenly sat back and realized 'my God, actually the content is pretty solid.' ""We have phenomenal journalists, phenomenal models and now they do want to participate. The brands are following us and that journey has been very slow, but the brands are there. The hardest battle of keeping a publication like this alive is to get the commercial viability working and that's what we do and we push everyday to find sponsors, advertisers, just everyone to support us."" Bur apart from highlighting African style and culture through its pages, Arise is also bringing the continent's fashion to catwalks across the world -- over the last few years the magazine has held a series of international fashion events, helping established designers and inspiring young talents to showcase their creations. Read related: Fashion week in Lagos . More recently, Arise hosted its fifth show at Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week. Dubbed African Icons, this year's show featured the glamorous and chic collections of five African designers: Ozwald Boateng, Tsemaye Binite, Folake Folarin-Coker of Tiffany Amber, Amaka Osakwe of Maki Oh and Gavin Rajah. ""Our aim is to create an international audience and platform for the best African fashion talent,"" says Helen Jennings, editor of Arise. ""We always choose different designers who have different aesthetics, so together you get a really nice broad spectrum -- five different voices, five different perspectives of African fashion,"" she adds. ""That's the joy of it,"" she adds. ""We promote Africa, but we break those barriers and those assumptions that people have that it's all going to be wacky, overly colorful wraparound dresses or whatever"".

Binite says international events such as the New York show are crucial in helping the world understand what it really means to be an African fashion designer. ""I hope it will broaden people's expectations of what African fashion is supposed to mean,"" he says. ""We're all very global in the way that we think, the experiences we've had, the things that we do,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- How do two convicted murderers walk out of prison? Too easily, it appears. Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins were free for some time, though this fact didn't become public knowledge until this week. As Florida authorities looked for the two men, they also insisted they aren't to blame -- even if others dropped the ball or were fooled in a big, big way. ""We've had a system failure that resulted in two individuals being erroneously released,"" Orange County, Florida, Sheriff Jerry Demings said. ""...This is very frustrating for all of us who work in the system."" The sheriff said Friday evening the two were thought to be in the Orlando area. In fact, they ended up getting caught Saturday evening about 360 miles to the northwest at a Panama City motel, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced. The two fugitives, both 34, hadn't needed a Hollywood-style jailbreak or even a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" card to spring themselves out of the Franklin Correctional Institution. Instead they used forged documents indicating their life sentences had been modified and they could leave. The legal-looking documents contained bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area state attorney or the assistant state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry. They bore the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. The documents were processed by the state Department of Corrections and the men were released. Processing the paper work is more akin to data entry than high-level analysis or approval, noted veteran Florida criminal defense attorney Mark O'Mara. ""However it was done, it was well-planned and they know the system well enough to place it,"" said O'Mara, a CNN legal analyst known for representing George Zimmerman. As well as those behind the convicts' release might have executed their scheme, some think others in authority could have done better, but the agencies involved are defending their actions. The orders to release Walker and Jenkins looked legitimate, said Ninth Circuit State Attorney Jeffrey L. Ashton. The county clerk of court's office didn't do anything wrong, spokeswoman Leesa Bainbridge said. It acts ""like a post office,"" Bainbridge said, ""Our role is to take orders and send them to the appropriate agency."" That last agency, the state Department of Corrections, is throwing up its hands as well. The court passed along documentation indicating the two murderers' sentences had been changed, and ""it's not our job to question what the court does,"" said Department of Corrections spokeswoman Misty Cash. ""The fault does not lie on us. No one is getting in trouble here for what happened,"" she said. Whoever is to blame, the price is being paid. Law enforcement officials worked overtime to try to find Walker and Jenkins, with a reward of $10,000 apiece being offered for information leading to their capture. The relatives of the men's victims were angry, scared and wanted an explanation. And while Demings said Friday he didn't know of any similar premature releases of inmates, O'Mara said that given how smoothly this plan worked, how readily available court documents are in Florida, and how seemingly simple it was to pull off, it would be naive to think this hasn't happened before, freeing other convicts well before their time was served. ""I doubt it happens very much, because this is very unusual,"" said O'Mara. ""But this could have gone for 10 years or more."" Sentenced to life without parole, then set free . In September 1998, Joseph I. Jenkins killed Roscoe Pugh Jr. during a home-invasion robbery attempt. Six months later, Cedric Slater was gunned down on an Orlando street corner -- shot dead, a jury determined, by Charles B. Walker. Both killers were convicted and sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole within two years of their crime. While it's not known if they knew each other, they were at the same prison in North Carrabelle, in Florida's Panhandle. Jenkins left there on September 27, and Walker left on October 8, according to authorities. They had motions indicating the sentences had been reduced, as well as court orders granting the request. Investigators later discovered these documents were forged. Asked how someone might replicate the documents, O'Mara noted that court filings in Florida cases are available online, so they might be mimicked by ""anybody with a little common sense,"" access to a word processing tool and the gall to replicate signatures seen on those records. There might have been a screw-up, but Cash said there is no ""cover-up"" at the Department of Corrections. That agency's chief, Michael Crews, has promised a ""vigorous and thorough review"" to make sure others weren't also wrongly freed. ""This will be a lesson learned for all involved. We may now look more closely at what the court sends,"" Cash said. ""Our system is being accused, and people are being led to believe that the DOC let these guys walk out the front door, and that's just not the case."" There's good reason to question, and change, the system, O'Mara said. Whereas victims are notified before a defendant's pretrial release, there's no such notice -- even to prosecutors -- before a convict walks free, he pointed out. In fact, the first that prosecutors got wind of what happened was after they were contacted by a member of Walker's family, Ashton said. An October 8 letter from the Department of Corrections to Slater's mother, Evangelina Kearse, notified her a ""court order and amended sentence caused (Walker's) sentence to expire."" ""Please be aware that recent actions causing the release of this offender are beyond our control. Nevertheless, we apologize for the delay in this message,"" it said. It doesn't have to be this way, O'Mara said. ""Let not only the victim's family know well ahead of time, then send it to the state's attorney,"" he said, surmising prosecutors as well as victims won't let mistakes by so easily. ""...That's an easy fix."" Not the first case, perhaps not the last . One irony is that Florida authorities were completely ignorant that such ruses can work. On October 7, charging documents were filed against another inmate, Jeffrey Forbes, for allegedly trying a similar scheme in 2011. Forbes is accused of forgery and attempted escape after a police detective who initially helped convict the man discovered he was scheduled to be released despite being sentenced to life in prison for the attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, according to Ashton's statement. The investigation revealed that someone had forged Ashton's name on a bogus court order reducing the sentence and a circuit court judge's name on the order reducing Forbes' life sentence, the statement said. Nonetheless, Walker was freed thanks to his own forged documents the very next day -- October 8. Both he and Jenkins appeared to play by the rules afterward. They both went to the Orange County jail to register as felons -- Jenkins on September 30, Walker on October 11 -- an audacious ""and really smart move"" by both men, because it bought them time before authorities were tipped off anything was awry, O'Mara said. While their releases may have initially seemed legitimate and innocuous, the two convicts had been classified as escapees by this week. One of the officials whose signature was forged said he wouldn't be surprised if something like this happens again. It may not work exactly the same way, but it would be unwise to assume criminals won't try whatever they can to get out of prison, said Judge Perry. ""People, particularly people with criminal minds, come up with ingenious ways to beat the system,"" Perry said. ""They have nothing but time on their hands to think of things."" CNN's Joseph Netto, Chelsea J. Carter, Eliot McLaughlin, Kevin Conlon, John Zarrella and Kim Segal contributed to this report.","NEW: The 2 fugitives are arrested in a Panama City motel, state agency says .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Four members of the French national soccer team were punished by a disciplinary commission Tuesday following an inquiry into the team's much-criticized performance and behavior at this year's World Cup. The French Football Federation's commission announced that striker Nicolas Anelka -- whose expulsion from the tournament in June sparked a revolt by his teammates -- was suspended for 18 international games. Former team captain Patrice Evra was suspended for five games and his deputy Franck Ribery received a three-game ban, while Jeremy Toulalan was ruled out for one match. The commission said it did not suspend defender Eric Abidal after hearing his explanations for refusing to play in the final group match against South Africa. Manchester United defender Evra, Lyon midfielder Toulalan and Barcelona's Abidal were said to have met with the commission in Paris Tuesday. Ribery and Anelka, who play in Germany and England for clubs Bayern Munich and Chelsea respectively, were not present at the meeting but were represented by lawyers at the session. Anelka's ban could effectively end the 31-year-old's international career. The players have the right to appeal the commission's decision, the FFF said. France, which won the World Cup in 1998 and lost in the final four years ago, was forced out of this year's tournament early on, during the group stage. The team's troubles began after an argument between Anelka and former head coach Raymond Domenech during the game with Mexico. After the FFF expelled Anelka from the tournament, other team members huddled in a bus the next day and refused to train for their next match. The FFF summoned the five players last week along with Domenech, his assistant Alain Boghossian, former FFF President Jean-Pierre Escalettes and former FFF official Jean-Louis Valentin. New France coach Laurent Blanc dropped the entire 23-man World Cup squad for his first match in charge, a 2-1 defeat by Norway in a friendly international ahead of next month's opening Euro 2012 qualifiers against Belarus and Bosnia-Herzegovina .","Four players from France's national soccer team have been punished .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- When studying up for a trip to the Holy Land, you might come across this warning: Whatever you do, don't take a bear to the beach. Feeding pigeons is illegal in Venice, Italy, and could earn you a fine. Americans expect to experience some difference in laws when they travel the world, but some laws we found just sounded insane. In France, it's illegal to name a pig Napoleon. In Florida, single women can't parachute on Sundays. And in England, you may urinate anywhere in public, including inside a policeman's helmet, providing that you're also pregnant. Granted, most of us can rest easy on the plane ride to our destinations knowing that we won't run afoul of such rules. Plus, many reported laws are just urban legends, and in other cases, anomalies on the books that no one has the time or interest to enforce. (""People here don't keep bears!"" an exasperated Israeli spokeswoman told us. ""Why would they take one to the beach?"") But other laws -- such as keeping your headlights on at all times while driving in Denmark -- are in equal parts surprising and real. Get caught, and the resulting fine could run about $100 (and the entire EU may adopt the law). See a Travel + Leisure slideshow of the world's strangest laws . While some laws seem ridiculous at first blush, they often carry their own logic. Pigeon-feeding is not tolerated (and fine-worthy) in Venice, because the winged troublemakers -- and really, their droppings -- wreak havoc on the city's old, vulnerable buildings. Singapore is infamous for its tough laws against chewing gum and graffiti (remember the 18-year-old American who got caned in the 1990s?). In the Singaporeans' defense, the gum laws -- which have relaxed a bit -- were originally enacted to fight what authorities saw as rampant gum-wad littering. Even so, don't even think about leaving a public toilet un-flushed. It could cost you $100. What should you do if you do break a law, crazy or otherwise, while on vacation? Dick Atkins is a Philadelphia attorney who operates an international legal hotline, helping American travelers who have run afoul of the law in other countries. ""It's always best to try to get an attorney involved,"" he says. Ignoring the issue could result in problems if you make a return visit to that country. Atkins says he commonly deals with college kids who have taken too many liberties with other countries' lower drinking ages, or unsuspecting tourists who get arrested for trying to take home souvenirs (such as old rugs) that end up being antiquities. He says such problems raise the argument for buying travel insurance, or even buying travel assistance packages, which can offer legal help abroad. (To price varying packages, check out US Travel Insurance Association.) Of course, most Americans don't bother with travel insurance. In that case, you can contact the American embassy or consulate for a list of local attorneys. Or you can handle the problem on your own. Robert Siciliano recently stayed at a Mexican resort, and when he and his family rented a car, they were almost immediately stopped by police and accused of swerving dangerously on the road. (Siciliano says he was merely driving around fallen palm braches and coconuts following the previous day's Category 2 hurricane.) ""They started to arrest me because they said all tickets were to be paid at the police station,"" Siciliano says. But when he asked if he could pay the ticket on the spot, the cops agreed. Siciliano handed them a $100 bill and they let him go. He immediately returned the car. ""Total rental car time, 20 minutes. Cost, $155,"" he said.

"(CNN)  -- Retired FBI agent Jim Ingram is charged with chasing down stories and shadows more than four decades old. Retired FBI agent Jim Ingram is helping the bureau re-examine civil rights cases from the 1960s. ""I knew these old informants, I knew these old witnesses,"" Ingram said. ""Some of them cannot hear, some of them have really lost their eyesight almost, but you still, most of them had good memories. ""And those are the ones that we called upon to testify."" In the 1960s, as a young FBI agent, Ingram investigated civil rights cases in Mississippi. ""The 1960s were turbulent years in Mississippi. Oh, my goodness,"" Ingram said. ""Oh, we had a lot of action."" In 2005, after he'd been retired for years, the FBI asked him to help re-examine dozens of unsolved civil rights cases that had slipped through history's cracks. ""I never in my wildest dreams thought the FBI would call upon a 75-year-old man to assist them,"" Ingram said of his work in the bureau's cold-case initiative. His tasks include sifting through old evidence, tracking down witnesses and re-interviewing them. Sometimes, he testifies in court. His work helped convict James Ford Seale, a former Mississippi sheriff's deputy, of kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 deaths of black teenagers Henry Dee and Charles Eddie Moore. According to the Jackson (Mississippi) Clarion-Ledger -- citing FBI documents -- Dee and Moore were picked up by two men while hitchhiking on May 2, 1964. The men were members of the Ku Klux Klan, but they told the two teenagers they were law enforcement officials. Instead of giving them a ride, however, the men drove the pair deep into the woods and beat them. Later, they drove them across the Mississippi River, weighed them down with a Jeep motor block and dumped them into the Old River in Louisiana.

Seale and another man were suspected in the case, but authorities had trouble lining up witnesses.

He and another FBI agent retraced the steps of that spring day with federal prosecutors, Ingram said. ""They knew they were going to die because ... [the men] told them what they were going to do."" Seale will be sentenced later this year, Ingram said. Ingram says he does feel a sense of accomplishment for bringing Seale and others to justice. ""There is a feeling of satisfaction because I've been at this thing for years,"" Ingram said.

"(CNN) -- An international football player has been found guilty of making a homophobic gesture during a league game by an English court. Colin Kazim-Richards, who represented Turkey at the 2008 European Championship finals, was convicted following the incident while he was playing for English second division team Blackburn, the UK Press Association reported on Wednesday. It took place during a Championship game away to Brighton on February 12, 2013. The 27-year-old, who now lives in Turkey and plays for Bursaspor, heard prosecutor Simon Allen contend that he had mimicked pulling down his shorts, putting his left arm behind his backside before making a homophobic gesture at Brighton fans. He was fined £750 ($1,256), ordered to pay £620 ($1,039) court costs and a £75 ($125.60) victim surcharge, PA reported. Brighton, a city on the south coast of England around 50 miles from London, has a large gay population and its players and supporters have often been subjected to homophobic abuse. On Tuesday, Sussex Police reported that three people were arrested for homophobic chanting during Brighton's game at Leicester. Kazim-Richards, who had previously played for Brighton between 2005-2006, made the gesture after being taunted by home supporters who claimed he was overweight. Darren Hastings, a witness in the trial, said he noticed Kazim-Richards make the gesture four or five times during the match. ""It was utterly disgusting,"" Hastings told the court, PA reported. ""I understand that football players receive a number of gestures or comments from the crowd but I certainly did not expect to see a football player perform that gesture on the pitch."" A second witness, Daryl Cannon, who was at the stadium working at the game on the day, also voiced his disgust at the gesture, PA reported. He was particularly surprised given Kazim-Richards' work with Kick it Out -- an anti-discriminatory body which aims to eradicate racism and homophobia within football. ""I perceived it as a very wrong thing to do, particularly for someone who's involved with the Kick It Out Campaign,"" Cannon told the court. ""Racism and homophobia are on the same level.""","Colin Kazim-Richards found guilty of making homophobic gesture .

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains and flooding have killed at least 23 people in Tanzania and displaced more than 4,000 others, state-run media reported. Officials fear the death toll could rise. Three consecutive days of rain, the heaviest in 57 years, caused the flooding, reported the state-run newspaper Daily News, citing the regional commissioner. President Jakaya Kikwete visited a camp for flood victims Thursday in Dar es Salaam. The capital has been inundated with murky water. Shops were shuttered and residents scrambled to find higher ground. The United Nations was working to assess what kind of aid the Tanzanian government will need to cope with the crisis. Philippe Poinsot, director of the United Nations Development Programme in Tanzania, told U.N. Radio that the rains combined with high tide led to disaster in the densely populated coastal city. "" A large number of families have been affected,"" he said. Disaster teams are working to evacuate people from flood-prone areas.","More than 4,000 families have been affected .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- A man, struggling to get away, is surrounded by South African police in the middle of a street as a large crowd looks on. The officers pull him over to a police van and handcuff his hands, over his head, to the back of the vehicle as he sits on the ground. Soon, as some in the crowd scream, the van begins to move. It slowly picks up speed. The helpless man in a red T-shirt is dragged along the road. Soon, two officers lift him up by the legs, apparently to avoid dragging -- but the police van seems to speed up, and the man's legs fall to the ground, He is dragged hundreds of feet. South Africa shocked by police shootings at mine . Though injured, the man was never taken to a hospital, police investigators say. He died a few hours after the incident. The suspected cause of death: head wounds. The video, captured by someone in the crowd in Daveyton, near Johannesburg, has sparked fury over police brutality in the country. ""We are shocked by this incident,"" said Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the Police Investigative Directorate, an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police. But such a scene may not be all that rare. The directorate received more than 6,000 complaints accusing police of numerous crimes, including murder and torture, during a one-year period from early 2011 to early 2012. The cases include 648 deaths. The U.S. State Department's human rights report on South Africa for 2011, the latest year available, said the country's ""principal human rights problems included police use of lethal and excessive force, including torture, against suspects and detainees, which resulted in deaths and injuries; vigilante and mob violence; and prison overcrowding and abuse of prisoners, including beatings and rape by prison guards."" But Dlamini was quick to emphasize that in the nation of 50 million people, police who carry out crimes do not reflect the police service as a whole. ""There are many other officers who are dedicated, who uphold the law and arrest criminals all the time,"" he said. While authorities have not confirmed the man's identity, local reports say he was a taxi driver from Mozambique. The man and the police in the video, as well as those in the crowd, are black, so there is no suggestion that the incident is a sign of white vs. black tensions in the country. ""This appalling incident involving excessive force is the latest in an increasingly disturbing pattern of brutal police conduct in South Africa,"" said Noel Kututwa, Amnesty International's southern Africa director. Johan Burger, a senior researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, said some police officers think they ""are above the law"" and that there won't be consequences for their actions. South Africa's history of violence ""is part and parcel of daily life,"" he said. Some think ""the best way to deal with this is to act in a brutal way."" CNN's Nkepile Mabuse reported from Johannesburg; CNN's Josh Levs reported from Atlanta.","Video shows a man handcuffed to a police van and dragged .

"(CNN) -- As flu season rages across the United States, federal regulators say they have approved a new kind of vaccine for the virus. The new product, Flublok, which is available in limited supplies for the current season, is different from other flu vaccines, because it isn't made using eggs or an influenza virus, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. Instead, Flublok's production involves programming insect cells grown in steel tanks to produce large amounts of a particular flu virus protein, known as hemagglutinin, according to Protein Sciences, the vaccine's manufacturer. Most human antibodies that fight flu infection are directed against hemagglutinin, the FDA said. Flu vaccine attitudes abroad differ from U.S. This method allows for more rapid production, making more of the vaccine available more quickly in the event of a pandemic, the FDA said. ""This approval represents a technological advance in the manufacturing of an influenza vaccine,"" said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. It has already been used in vaccines approved for other infectious diseases. Flublok is approved only for adults ages 18 - 49. Flu activity is ""elevated"" in most of the United States, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week. Manufacturers said there was plenty of vaccine for those who want to get a flu shot. But there have been reports of spot shortages, Frieden said. Flublok will be available in limited supply this winter and widely available during the next flu season, said Protein Sciences, which is based in Meriden, Connecticut. Flublok contains the elements necessary to help fend off three different flu strains, including H1N1 and H3N2, the regulator said. And it proved 44.6% effective against all influenza strains in circulation, not just those that matched the strains included in the vaccine, according to the FDA. Flu vaccine poses no risk to unborn .","Unlike other flu vaccines, Flublok doesn't rely on eggs or the influenza virus .

"Editor's Note: David M. Walker served as comptroller general of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008. He is now president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. David Walker says the federal debt could double, forcing huge increases in your taxes. (CNN) -- Even under the best of economic circumstances, tax season is a tense time for American households. The number of hours we collectively spend working on our returns is probably a lot more than government agencies claim. The burden in financial terms is even greater: A recent independent survey found that the average American's total federal, state and local tax bill roughly equals his or her entire earnings from January 1 up until right before tax day. Now imagine that tax bill doubling over time. In recent years, the federal government has spent more money than it takes in at an increasing rate. Total federal debt almost doubled during President George W. Bush's administration and, as much as we needed some stimulus spending to boost the economy, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now estimates total debt levels could almost double again over the next eight years based on the budget recently outlined by President Obama. Regardless of what politicians tell you, any additional accumulations of debt are, absent dramatic reductions in the size and role of government, basically deferred tax increases. Remember the old saw? ""You can pay me now or you can pay me later, with interest."" To help put things in perspective, the Peterson Foundation calculated the federal government accumulated $56.4 trillion in total liabilities and unfunded promises for Medicare and Social Security as of September 30, 2008. The numbers used to calculate this figure come directly from the audited financial statements of the U.S. government. If $56.4 trillion in financial commitments is too big a number to digest, think of it as $483,000 per American household, or $184,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. Even broken down, the numbers can be tough to swallow. Yes, you've paid your taxes, but you still bear a significant share of the government's own financial burden. To help this news go down with a smile, the Peterson Foundation is supporting a campaign designed to help Americans understand what Washington is doing to us, rather than for us. Meet Owen & Payne (www.owenandpayne.com), partners in a fictional accounting firm that specializes in helping Americans fill out the ""new"" Form 483000, which spells out how our elected officials are putting our nation into more and more debt and how that bill eventually will have to be paid: By doubling your taxes. The campaign is all in fun, but the intent is very serious. Unless we begin to get our fiscal house in order, there's simply no other way to handle our ever-mounting debt burdens except by doubling taxes over time. Otherwise, our growing commitments for Medicare and Social Security benefits will gradually squeeze out spending on other vital programs such as education, research and development, and infrastructure. Personal savings, while experiencing an uptick lately because of the recession, have been too low for too long. As a result, when our government has to borrow money, it must increasingly turn to lenders overseas. Effectively addressing these issues will require tough choices and comprehensive reforms, including budget controls, changes to our entitlement programs, reductions in health care costs, other spending cuts, and yes, tax increases. But as the old saw goes, paying now, or paying soon, won't be as painful as paying later. So as you file your tax returns this year, bear in mind that no matter how much you're paying now, you'll pay much more in the future because of Washington's failure to get its finances in order. If you don't like the idea, then get informed and get involved. And by listening rather than punishing, help encourage our elected officials to speak the truth about our financial condition, even if it means reforming entitlements, cutting spending, and yes, raising taxes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David M. Walker.","David Walker: If you've survived filing your taxes, you still have to worry .
He says the nation's debt is unsustainable and will require tax increases .
He says people should urge government to get fiscal house in order ."
"(CNN) -- A Norwegian politician said he has nominated WikiLeaks for a Nobel Peace Prize, citing the website's contribution to ""democracy and freedom of speech"" worldwide.

"(CNN) -- In 1993, Romeo Dallaire was full of hope for the future of Rwanda. Romeo Dallaire, now a Canadian senator, says that in Rwanda, he ""shook hands with the devil."" The Canadian lieutenant general and son of a soldier was about to take up the biggest command of his career -- leading United Nations peacekeepers in the central African nation. A year later he left Rwanda a broken man, having watched helplessly as more than 800,000 people perished in Rwanda's genocide despite his pleas for more troops to stop the massacre. ""We could have actually saved hundreds of thousands,"" Dallaire told CNN's Christiane Amanpour for ""Scream Bloody Murder."" ""Nobody was interested."" Dallaire's mission was to monitor a peace deal between two warring ethnic groups, the Hutus and the Tutsis. But the agreement was just a façade. Hutu extremists within the government were stockpiling weapons, and Tutsi refugees had formed a rebel army.  Watch Dallaire describe how he could have stopped the genocide » . The Tutsis were a minority in Rwanda, and their plight was personal for Dallaire. His Dutch mother had watched friends die in the Holocaust, and he had been raised on stories of heroic Canadian soldiers who brought hope to war-torn Europe. A French Canadian raised in Montreal, Dallaire had experienced discrimination first-hand and was determined to protect the Tutsi minority. But he soon found his was a lone voice. On January 20, 1994, Dallaire made a chilling discovery: An informant warned him that Hutu government agents were planning bloodshed. ""They were going to conduct an outright slaughter and elimination of the opposition,"" Dallaire said. Dallaire cabled his bosses in New York, warning that his informant ""has been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali. He suspects it is for their extermination."" The informant described a major weapons cache, which Dallaire said he planned to raid in the next 36 hours.  Watch Dallaire describe the warnings from the informant » . Kofi Annan, then head of the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, was concerned about the safety of Dallaire's limited U.N. force. Annan's office told Dallaire: ""We cannot agree to the operation contemplated ... as it clearly goes beyond the mandate."" Dallaire tried to change Annan's mind, repeatedly exchanging faxes with New York through the rest of January and into February. ""Ultimately I got authority. It took two months, and by then it was far too late,"" Dallaire said. In an interview with CNN, Annan explained his reasoning: . ""When you're operating in that sort of context with limited troops and facilities, you have to be careful what sort of risks they take, where everybody may even have to leave, and place a people at greater risk. And in a way, this is what happened,"" Annan said. ""Dallaire as a soldier, he's a very good man, he's a friend, and I respect his professional acumen. One had to take all these factors into consideration before you take a decision. Do the troops take this risk? Do they have the mandate? Do they have the resources? ""Dallaire himself said, 'If I had had a brigade, which is 5,000, I could have done a lot.' He had a fraction that number."" Asked why a brigade wasn't sent, Annan said: ""The brigade was not available. The [Security] Council did not augment the troops. In fact, they went the other way. ""We would have liked to see a larger force in. I had had situations where I called 82 member states together, trying to get troops. I got zilch."" On April 6, 1994, a plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi was shot down. It was the moment the Hutu plotters had been waiting for -- the spark that ignited the genocide.  Watch as Dallaire describes how the genocide began » . Col. Theoneste Bagosora, a Hutu extremist, immediately declared the army was in charge. Within hours, government troops and civilian death squads began slaughtering Tutsis. ""We saw the extremists, the presidential guard and militias, going to specific houses ... and killing people or hauling people off,"" Dallaire said. He described the horror of getting phone calls from people he knew while they were under attack. ""As they were busting down the door and opening fire,"" he said, ""we would literally hear people dying at the end of the phone as they were trying to get through to us and we had literally nothing to send them."" Dallaire also heard the Hutu government-run radio tell listeners that Tutsis were ""nothing but cockroaches,"" broadcasting names of people to be murdered and instructions on how to mutilate and kill them.  Watch Dallaire describe the radio instructions on mutilation and murder » . It was an echo of past genocides. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge called their victims ""worms."" To the Nazis, Jews were ""vermin."" Dallaire says he and his troops moved through entire villages of dead, sometimes clearing paths through corpses with their bare hands. ""With my own hands I carried them,"" he said. ""We carried them in our arms, we carried kids in our arms, and adults. We were picking the bodies and moving them aside. ...There would be piles of bodies."" Dallaire's troops were also targets: 10 were killed in the first days of the genocide. He was desperate for help, on the phone with New York several times a day, asking when reinforcements were coming. Five days into the killing, some U.S. officials began to fear the worst. A top Pentagon official wrote about the potential for ""hundreds of thousands of deaths."" A day later, a State Department memo warned of ""a bloodbath."" But instead of reinforcements, the United States joined a chorus of countries calling for withdrawal. Washington's taste for foreign intervention had soured. Just months earlier in Somalia, two dozen Pakistani peacekeepers had been murdered. United States commandos on the hunt for the killers had their Black Hawk helicopter shot down. Eighteen U.S. soldiers were killed. Americans were anxious to extricate themselves from Africa -- just as they had been in Southeast Asia decades before. ""The U.S. troops had been killed and dragged through the streets and humiliated,"" Annan said. ""The governments were not prepared to take another risk and go into Rwanda."" After two weeks of debate, Washington compromised and agreed to a token U.N. presence. The result: The U.N. Security Council voted to reduce Dallaire's already small force by 90 percent. ""In essence, they voted to allow the killers to continue,"" said Michael Barnett, a professor who was on a fellowship at the U.N. at the time and studied its response to the genocide. ""The moment that the U.N. votes to withdraw, that's when we see a real spike in the violence,"" Barnett said. ""Because at that point it's clear to the Rwandans ... that there will not be any cavalry over the horizon."" In the fourth week of the killing, then U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Gali concluded that the mission was hopeless. He ordered a pullout of all U.N. troops. Dallaire refused. ""I refused a legal order,"" Dallaire said. ""But it was immoral."" Dallaire and his few hundred peacekeepers could do little except help humanitarian efforts and protect a small number of people, while he repeatedly and futilely attempted to negotiate a cease-fire. As the United States and the United Nations stood by, the rebel Tutsi army fought back against the Hutu government. In mid-July, 100 days of hell came to an end when Tutsi forces declared victory. Weeks later, Dallaire asked to be relieved of his command. The horrors of the genocide had taken its toll. He was guilt-ridden, believing he should have done more to prevent the genocide. In his book, ""Shake Hands With The Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda,"" Dallaire wrote: ""Death became a desired option. I hoped I would hit a mine or run into an ambush and just end it all. I think some part of me wanted to join the legions of the dead, whom I had failed."" Those thoughts of suicide followed him home to Canada.  Watch Dallaire describe how he dealt with thoughts of suicide » . In the preface of his book, Dallaire summed up his Rwanda experience, writing, ""I know there is a God because in Rwanda I shook hands with the devil. I have seen him, I have smelled him and I have touched him. I know the devil exists, and therefore I know there is a God."" Today Dallaire is a senator in the Canadian parliament and dedicates much of his time to an initiative to eradicate the use of child soldiers.","In 1994, Romeo Dallaire was leading a U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda .

"(CNN) -- Earthy, sun-dried structures and startling blue skies provide the vivid backdrop for many an exploration of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The architecture is distinctive, but the natural setting at the base of the southern Rocky Mountains, 7,000 feet above sea level, puts the city in the realm of spectacular. And aesthetics are just a fragment of what draws more than a million visitors a year. Santa Fe's creativity shines in its art and cuisine, and there's a deep spiritual pull.

Here, iReporters share some of their best tips: . Art lover's paradise . Santa Fe's booming museum and gallery scene could keep a visitor busy for weeks. Santa Fe is considered one of the country's largest art markets, based on sales. Just along scenic Canyon Road alone, more than 100 galleries welcome art enthusiasts. ""It is not hard to see why artists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Ansel Adams and the likes were, and still are, drawn to this place full of stunning vistas, cultural richness and alluring spirit,"" writes an iReporter with the handle texdexigner. The city is home to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, which houses more than 3,000 works and is celebrating its 15th anniversary this summer. Cynthia Whitney-Ward, an iReporter who lives in Santa Fe and blogs about her hometown, recommends the Museum of International Folk Art and the International Folk Art Market, ""an incredible gathering of vibrant artisans from around the world"" held in July. Also check out artists from New Mexico pueblos displaying their wares on one side of the Santa Fe Plaza, Whitney-Ward recommends, and try to catch the amazing work at the Santa Fe Indian Market on August 18 and 19.

""Between the Southwestern colors, cowboy boots, turquoise jewelry and products from local artisans, Santa Fe has a lot to offer a shopper in search of unique finds,"" writes iReporter Kristine Celorio, of Sacramento, California. Whitney-Ward heads to The Flea at the Downs, a bit outside of town, every weekend where ""you'll find hundreds of vendors selling nifty vintage stuff."" Or stop at Todos Santos chocolate shop in Sena Plaza to find a delicious gift. A treasure for history buffs . Santa Fe welcomes history fans with a rich blend of cultures. The site of the present town was home to Native Americans from 1200 to the early 1400s, and in 1610 the Spanish founded Santa Fe. Mix those cultures with the sensibilities of the American artists who flocked to town in the early 20th century for a truly distinctive atmosphere. The city's adobe architecture evolved from early dwellings built by the Pueblo Indians. The Spanish adapted the Native American techniques to create Spanish Pueblo style. ""Stay in a pueblo style hotel, like La Posada, for a really unique experience,"" suggests iReporter Marijana Gucunski of New York City. Santa Fe is home to historic churches and more, Celorio points out. ""Don't forget to stop and take in a little history while you are there.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- For the war-beaten orphans of the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, this big old shoe fits. A monument to a shoe thrown at former President Bush is unveiled at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. A huge sculpture of the footwear hurled at President Bush in December during a trip to Iraq has been unveiled in a ceremony at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. Assisted by children at the home, sculptor Laith al-Amiri erected a brown replica of one of the shoes hurled at Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki by journalist Muntadhir al-Zaidi during a press conference in Baghdad. Al-Zaidi was jailed for his actions, and a trial is pending. But his angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He is regarded by many people as a hero. Demonstrators in December took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release. The shoe monument, made of fiberglass and coated with copper, consists of the shoe and a concrete base. The entire monument is 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The shoe is 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) long and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide. The orphans helped al-Amiri build the $5,000 structure -- unveiled Tuesday -- in 15 days, said Faten Abdulqader al-Naseri, the orphanage director. ""Those orphans who helped the sculptor in building this monument were the victims of Bush's war,"" al-Naseri said. ""The shoe monument is a gift to the next generation to remember the heroic action by the journalist."" ""When the next generation sees the shoe monument, they will ask their parents about it,"" al-Naseri said. ""Then their parents will start talking about the hero Muntadhir al-Zaidi, who threw his shoe at George W. Bush during his unannounced farewell visit."" Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader toppled by the United States in 2003, was from the Tikrit region. Al-Zaidi marked his 30th birthday in jail earlier this month. One of his brothers said he is ""in good health and is being treated well."" Al-Zaidi's employer, TV network al-Baghdadia, keeps a picture of him at the top left side of the screen with a calendar showing the number of days he has spent in detention. The network has been calling for his release. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Fiberglass, copper sculpture of shoe thrown at former President Bush unveiled .

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Thursday made clear his view on the membership of women at the Augusta National Golf Club: They should be admitted. The issue of the membership of the club that hosts most prestigious golf tournament is being scrutinized because the top executive at IBM, Ginni Rometty, is a woman. IBM's sponsorship of the Masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers, but the club does not allow women to join. The White House weighed in Thursday. ""The president's answer is yes, he believes women should be admitted,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing. Specifically, Obama believes it is ""up to the club to decide, (but) his personal opinion is that women should be admitted to the club."" The Republican presidential candidates also weighed in. Mitt Romney agreed that it is up to the club to decide on female members when asked about the issue at a campaign event Thursday. ""Of course,"" he said. ""I am not a member of Augusta. I don't know if I would qualify. My golf game is not that good. Certainly if I were a member, if I could run Augusta, which isn't likely to happen, of course I'd have women into Augusta."" Rick Santorum, in a statement e-mailed to reporters, said, ""I encourage Augusta to accept women members, but I recognize their right as a private organization to decide for themselves."" Newt Gingrich said his wife, Callista, a golfer herself, would be a ""great member."" During his annual media session Wednesday, Billy Payne, chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, did not comment specifically on Rometty. ""Well, as has been the case, whenever that question is asked, all issues of membership are now and have historically been subject to the private deliberation of members,"" he said. ""That statement remains accurate; it remains my statement."" IBM spokesman Ed Barbini told CNN on Wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy. Most Augusta patrons seem untroubled by the policy . The question of Rometty's membership has again brought the gender controversy to the forefront. Women's rights activist Martha Burk tried to change the exclusionary policy nine years ago when she showed up at the Augusta entrance to lead a series of protests against men-only membership. Her efforts were in vain. Now, she says, ""the boys"" at Augusta, members and sponsors alike, find themselves in a big bind. ""The 'woman problem' is back,"" she wrote in a column for CNN on Tuesday. Burk says there are only two choices at hand: Augusta can open its doors to women, or IBM can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club. ""Those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public,"" Burk told CNN last week. Augusta's membership -- which includes titans of industry and finance -- has been male-only since the club's opening in 1932. When Burk tried to change things in 2002, Augusta's then-chairman, Hootie Johnson, resisted, saying that gender integration would not come ""at the point of a bayonet."" In 2006, Burk was among a group of Exxon shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the tournament. Nonmembers can play on the course only when hosted by members. Augusta is famously secretive about its membership, and the club declined to comment on the issue, as did IBM spokesman Chris Andrews. ""Augusta is a private club, and their personal membership is an internal matter,"" he said. IBM, however, has played a role in changing policy before. The company pulled television ads from the PGA Championship when it was played at the whites-only Shoal Creek golf club in Alabama. The club admitted its first African-American in 1990 and now claims former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a member. Augusta also did not welcome its first black member until 1990, when Gannett television division president Ron Townsend joined the club. On the eve of the 2012 Masters opening Thursday, speculation surfaced that Payne, known to be more progressive than his predecessor, would offer Rometty a membership, but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down. ""Sorry, but that dog won't hunt,"" Burk wrote. ""Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader."" More and more people are asking Augusta to man up and get rid of what they say is a discriminatory policy from the past. Payne did not announce any sweeping changes from the hot seat Wednesday. That means that Rometty will probably not show up this year in a green jacket. The question is: Will she ever?","Obama believes women should be allowed to join, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Skulls taken by German scientists over a century ago have been returned to Namibia amid jubilant scenes and celebrations. Thousands flocked to Namibia's Hosea Kutako International Airport Tuesday, praying, singing, and chanting as the 20 skulls were returned to their homeland. The skulls, which were transported in caskets draped with the Namibian flag, were removed from the plane with military honors. Among those welcoming the skulls was the country's Prime Minister Nahas Angula who said, ""These mortal remains are testimony to the horrors of colonialism and German cruelty against our people. May the mortal remains of our ancestors proceed into their homeland,"" Namibian media reported. According to historians, the skulls were taken during the bloody 1904 -1908 colonial conflict in former German West-South Africa, when the Herero tribe rebelled against German colonial forces. It's estimated that thousands were killed in the uprising. Once in Berlin, the skulls were used in research in an attempt to prove the supposed racial supremacy of European whites. The skulls were rediscovered at Berlin's Charite University Hospital in 2005 and are believed to belong to Namibia's Nama and Herero ethnic peoples. They consist of 15 males, including a three-year-old boy and four females, said Charite spokeswoman Claudia Peter. A delegation of over 50 Namibians traveled last week to Berlin for a handover ceremony before the skulls were repatriated to Namibia. Members of the delegation read a prayer outside the hospital before the ceremony. The skulls have reignited old political tensions between the two countries. The Namibian government has, for a number of years, demanded Germany acknowledge the war as genocide, calling for an apology as well as reparations. The German government, which gives development aid to Namibia has refused to pay reparations. It has, however, expressed regret for the incident. A statement issued by German Deputy Foreign Minister, Cornelia Pieper last month read, ""We Germans acknowledge and accept this heavy legacy and the ensuing moral and historical responsibility to Namibia. ""The German Government is fulfilling this duty through particularly close bilateral cooperation - and development cooperation - with Namibia,"" it continued. Pieper added, ""I would also like to express my own personal deep regret and shame for what was done to the ancestors of the tribal representatives now in Berlin."" For his part, the CEO of Charite University Hospital, Professor Karl Max Einhaupl, apologized to the Namibian delegation present at the ceremony in Berlin for the role played by German scientists. ""With this step we face up to an inglorious chapter of German history,"" he said. ""As a medical doctor and scientist myself, it is especially painful for me to realize that even physicians worked in the service of this early form of racism."" Peter said historians now agree that much of the research undertaken by these early scientists was a precursor to Nazi ideology and is now universally acknowledged as a ""perverse"" science. Despite years of research little is known about how the 20 people died, said Peter. ""Their cause of death could not be determined. Three skulls showed signs of lack of nutrition, but there was no sign of a violent death,"" she said. But, she stated, this did not rule out the possibility the skulls belonged to victims of the conflict, with many thousands of people dying of starvation and exhaustion in camps set up by German colonial forces.","20 skulls taken by German scientists over a century ago have been returned to Namibia .

"(CNN) -- More than 4.3 million people tuned in to watch the U.S. women's soccer team beat Japan in a 2-1 victory in the gold medal Olympic game. Shannon Boxx was just happy to be on the field. After injuring her hamstring, Boxx was sidelined for the team's earlier game against Colombia. It was heartbreaking for the athlete to sit on the bench after all the health problems she had already battled during her journey to London. Boxx was diagnosed with lupus in 2007 when she was 30 years old. At the time she was playing for the U.S. National Team and had begun feeling extremely fatigued; regular training sessions left her with joint pain and muscle soreness. She went public with her lupus diagnosis in April 2012 and is now working with the Lupus Foundation of America to create awareness about this chronic autoimmune disease that affects 1.5 million people in the U.S. With lupus, Boxx's body produces auto-antibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue because her immune system can't tell the difference. The auto-antibodies cause inflammation that leads to pain. Symptoms can flare up at any time, and although the disease is somewhat controlled with medication, it is a lifelong problem. We caught up with Boxx after the London Games to talk about her diagnosis and how she deals with it as an elite athlete. The following is an edited version of that interview: . You have lupus, in addition to Sjogren's Syndrome -- another autoimmune disease. How do the two conditions affect you? Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects various parts of my body like my skin, my joints and various organs. (One symptom of lupus is the so-called ""butterfly rash,"" across a person's cheeks and nose -- similar to the shape of a butterfly.) Sjogren's Syndrome is an autoimmune in which your body attacks your moisture-producing glands. I deal with fatigue and joint pain just like with lupus, but it also affects my skin, my eyes and my mouth. I have to regularly use eye drops, drink lots of water and get regular checkups for both my eyes and my teeth. Keeping my inflammation down throughout my body is my biggest concern. Lupus attacking my kidneys, Nick Cannon says . How has having an autoimmune disease affected your job? As an elite athlete, it is my job to maintain a high fitness level, as well as sustain a strong mentality. Now add in a disease where my main symptoms are extreme fatigue and joint pain, and that standard becomes a little bit more difficult to maintain. I am very fortunate that I have finally found a medicine that helps control my symptoms, but a few years ago that wasn't the case. I remember in 2010 going to training sessions completely exhausted and my knees throbbing from all my joint pain. I remember willing myself through those training sessions and then getting home and lying on the couch the rest of the day. Mentally, I was exhausted because I was trying to figure out the right medicines to use; I was dealing with side effects from those medicines and I was keeping it a secret from my teammates. On the positive side, it has made me so much stronger as a person and as an athlete. I have the mentality that this disease is not going to beat me. I may have a bad day, but it won't stop me from trying again the next day. How do you control your symptoms? The medicine I am on now helps control the amount of ""flare-ups"" I may have, as well as control the amount of inflammation in my body. To help with joint pain, I wear compression pants to sleep in and I have also been able to tweak our lifting routine so that I don't have to put as much pressure on my joints. I do less Olympic lifts and more body-weight exercises. Fatigue is probably the hardest one to control because you don't know when it's going to hit you. The best solution for me is, if I start to feel more fatigued than normal, I will train lighter that day or even just take it off completely. Learning to live with lupus . What do you eat on a regular basis? I don't have a specific diet. As much as I am training, my goal is to just make sure I'm getting enough food. I do my best to eat a balanced diet, but as of right now it isn't any different than the rest of my teammates. What advice do you have for our readers who are dealing with lupus and/or Sjogrens Syndrome? I understand that people with lupus and/or Sjogren's range from mild to severe and no two people are alike in their struggle with either of these diseases. I believe it's very important to have a support system -- friends, family, the Lupus foundation and the Sjogren's foundation -- that understands what you are going through. I think it's important that you have someone who understands that you can feel good a majority of the time but are there for you when a flare-up happens. I also believe it's important to stay active, whatever level of activity feels comfortable to you. I hope this is where I have inspired people. I haven't let this disease stop me from doing the sport that I love. You've just begun to talk publicly about your battles with autoimmune disease. Why did you decide to start sharing your story? I kept my story a secret for a long time because I didn't want anyone to use it against me in my profession. As I am nearing the tail end of my career, I have realized it is a lot more important to use my voice to help bring awareness to lupus and Sjogren's. It takes people an average of seven years to be diagnosed, and in that time period they could be doing more damage to their body. If I can help spread the word about what lupus or Sjogren's is and what the symptoms are, maybe I can help get people in to visit a doctor sooner. Dealing with an injury during the Olympics is something every athlete fears. How do you weigh the benefits of rest/recovery over pushing through the pain to help your team? Good question. All of these thoughts went through my head when I felt my hamstring go 15 minutes into my first game in the Olympics. In a matter of seconds, I had to weigh both options. Do I push through and maybe do more damage to my leg and maybe hurt the team in the process, 'cause I'm not 100% (and in the worst case scenario, be out for the rest of the tournament): or do I take myself out and give our team the chance with a healthy body in there? I chose the second, and even though it was hard sitting on the bench I knew I put the team first. I worked hard every day to get back as healthy as I could so I could be available if needed during the playoff rounds. It seems everything worked out in the end. My hamstring healed and I was able to start in the final game and help my team to an Olympic gold medal. Not a bad way to the end the tournament. How becoming a patient can make you stronger .","Olympic soccer midfielder Shannon Boxx has lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome .

"(CNN) -- You don't have to be a science major to know that heat rises: Just step into an attic on a hot summer day. But what you might not know is that this basic scientific reality could also help create clean energy for entire cities. For centuries, architects have taken advantage of rising heat to help cool some structures. Solar chimneys allow the rising air to go out of the building, taking the heat with it. Today, Australian entrepreneur Roger Davey wants to take advantage of that phenomenon -- with a twist. He wants to create, capture and control hot air to help power cities. He plans to build a huge solar updraft tower, 2,600 feet tall, in the Arizona desert. As the hot air moves into the tower, it would turn 32 turbines, spinning them fast enough to create mechanical energy, which generators convert to electricity. His company, EnviroMission, says such a tower can create up to 200 megawatts of power, enough to power 100,000 homes. He says they don't intend to put coal or nuclear or alternative power out of business, but want to be a strong, no-carbon emission supplementary source. ""One of the most important things I think that differentiates this from anything else is its ability to produce power as and when required,"" said Davey, chief executive and executive director of EnviroMission, the company behind the solar updraft tower. That sets it apart from solar (not available at night) and wind energy (not available on a calm day), which he referred to as ""spasmodic."" He also touted its ability to produce power without the use of water to generate electricity. Coal-fired and nuclear plants use massive quantities of water, and solar panels need to be washed frequently to keep them working well. On the drawing board . The EnviroMission tower is only a concept right now, but Davey says the technology has been proved by a different company's smaller version that worked for seven years on the plains of Spain. It created 50 kilowatts of electricity, according to that company, the German builders Schlaich, Bergermann and Partner. But the 125-ton iron structure toppled in 1989 after its support cables broke in a lengthy storm, a spokeswoman for Schalich, Bergermann and Partner, said in an e-mail. The tower had already collected all the data to prove it could work, she added. A small tower began operation in China last year, according to the Xinhua news agency. The Chinese company's project reportedly will cost $208 million and will be built in phases. The first section of the plant produces 200 kilowatts per day, Xinhua reported. EnviroMission is the only publicly traded developer working on this technology, a company spokeswoman said. Its model calls for a tower with no support wires and, unlike the other structures, it will be built from cement. The solar tower would be the second-tallest structure in the world, slightly shorter than Dubai's Burj Khalifa skyscraper. EnviroMission says its tower will stand for 80 years, far longer than the average life for a field of solar panels, which some would see as an alternative with a smaller upfront cost. Davey says the Arizona project will cost $750 million to build at its present size and scope (with further refinements the price could rise or fall 10% to 15%, he says). EnviroMission has already raised ""substantial capital"" for its project, according to spokeswoman Kim Forte. The company also recently presold the power that would be created at one of the Arizona facilities to the Southern California Public Power Authority, which comprises 12 utilities. Mohammad Taslim, a professor of mechanical engineering at Northeastern University, says the two important concerns are: Will the plant produce as much energy as EnviroMission predicts and will it be economical and environmentally friendly? ""Fundamentally from an engineering standpoint it is sound,"" he said. ""I believe that the question is not that this will not work at all. It might be the claim of 200 megawatts is not quite reachable at the peak."" Taslim initially said he thought the engineers should consider composite materials like carbon fiber. But, after a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, he concluded, ""an 800-meter structure of composite materials cannot withstand its own weight and a much more complicated structure is required."" According to EnviroMission, the amount of carbon pollution created by the manufacture and shipment of the cement and other materials needed to build the facility will be offset after 2Â½ years of operation. Spinning turbines create electricity . The technology works like this: Unlike normal solar photovoltaic panels that convert the sun's light into energy, the EnviroMission tower would create solar-thermal power, from both the sun and the wind. Like a greenhouse, the sun heats up the air underneath a huge translucent, sloping canopy around the tower that is about as wide as a football field. The air is heated to about 194 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius) and then it flows into the tower, spins the turbines and rises. The higher the tower, the stronger the flow of air. The faster the turbines spin, the more electricity possible. After sundown, the ground continues to release heat and more electricity would be generated. The long road ahead . Davey says the hurdles to getting his solar tower built are a combination of political factors, environmental policies and the cheap cost of fossil fuels. He wanted to build this project in his home country of Australia, but he says the United States has a more acceptable political climate. He also said that for the past 10 years EnviroMission has been doing its ""due diligence"" in designing a better solar tower plant to assure its potential private investors. ""We had to improve the technology from what it was from when the plant in Spain was built to what it is now -- commercially viable,"" he said. The plant should take about two years to build and provide up to 1,500 construction jobs, he says. Then once the site is operating, a 30-person staff will operate the plant, providing maintenance to the canopy and turbines, as well as security and possible tours. Because air is free, operating costs will be minimal, he said. The next step is determining the final capital costs, which will take a few months. ""And then you can work out whether the economics stack up,"" he said. ""We've got to go to the bankers and ensure you can get it banked. We believe it will.""","Hot air will drive turbines to create electricity, then flow out through a tall chimney .

"(CNN) -- What do drug addicts, serial dieters and children from troubled homes have in common? More than you might think. Stress can play a pernicious role in triggering a vicious cycle that leaves these groups overwhelmed by uncontrollable impulses and distracted by negative feelings -- all of which may, in turn, spark subsequent cycles of relapse, bingeing and failure. Through a career that spans almost three decades, Rajita Sinha, psychologist and head of the Yale Stress Center, has sought to understand the processes underlying these stress cycles in hopes they may one day be prevented. The dance of human emotions . For Sinha, it all began with emotions. She was 9 years old and living in her native India when she began training in classical Indian dance, which is heavily focused on experiencing and expressing emotions. Indian dancers use facial expressions and hand gestures to tell the stories of people's sacred lives. ""Dancing tied me to the powerful effects of our emotions,"" she recalls. Psychology plus ballet: Meet 'Dr. Dancer' Sinha practiced the art form through college, growing ever more fascinated by how brain and physiology affect emotions and how emotions motivate behavior. She started her career by working with individual emotions such as anger and sadness, examining how they affect the body and change our response to different stimuli in the environment. What she observed back then was that people don't generally have pure emotions -- that is, they don't feel just angry or fearful -- but that their emotions are often mixed. ""If you asked them how they were feeling, they would say they were stressed or upset,"" she says. She set out to understand how emotions work together, both to protect us and to cause the stress that can wear us down. The habit of addiction . In 1994 Sinha was running the substance abuse treatment unit at Yale. As the clinical director, she was doing research on cognitive behavioral treatments that taught recovering addicts how to identify problems and overcome cravings. Although the research showed that these skills worked, they tended to have only modest effects; a number of people benefited, but that number was not large. ""I would run these groups in my clinic and see the same individuals come back over and over again,"" Sinha recalls. ""They would tell me, 'I know what I'm supposed to do, I have these skills, but when I'm out there and something happens, I just can't help myself.'"" ""The biggest challenge with addiction, of course, is relapse, and I set out to understand what drives relapse; what brings these behaviors back."" It became clear that there was often a threshold moment during which some kind of a challenge or trigger prevented the recovering person from accessing his or her cognitive resources. The way the emotions were flooding the person somehow led to a greater risk of relapse. In each case, Sinha observed that stress played a pivotal role in the loss of control. Clearly Sinha and her colleagues couldn't be out there with each person as he or she was relapsing, but they set out to replicate the behavior in a laboratory setting. ""We began to bring addicted people in recovery into the lab and gave them a series of challenges in controlled experiments. We found that when addicted individuals were under stress, they almost automatically wanted to start using drugs again."" The research began to establish a clear pattern of stress-induced craving for drugs -- both for those early in recovery and those who were actively using. And it wasn't just higher levels of anxiety and negative emotions that were making the recovering addicts seek relief from the stress; there was also a parallel process happening -- the stress was actually escalating the craving for the drug. Replacing addiction with a healthy obsession . Subsequent experiments showed that stress played an important role in the loss of self-control across a spectrum of behaviors, including gambling and the consumption of tobacco, alcohol and food. ""We started to look into the brain to see what was happening and found that during those periods of arousal, the 'habit' regions in the brain were activated,"" Sinha says. She and her colleagues spent a lot of time teasing apart this mechanism in an attempt to figure out how to break the cycle of addiction. ""We have lots of habits that are very important for survival. It's a very evolutionarily hard-wired response that comes from a primitive need to respond very quickly. It's very hard to break that link."" Drugs, food and habitual behaviors all have a direct effect on the biology of stress. It's a feed-forward model, Sinha observes. Her research has shown that stress begets more stress. This is of particular concern because there's a direct link between stress, anxiety, depression and chronic disease. ""We are now studying medications and interventions that both downgrade stress and decrease the promotion of habits,"" she says. ""We are going after stress-induced cravings, thinking that if you target those cravings, you may be able to stop relapse."" Stress and the brain . While we have long known about the connection between addiction and stress, and how stress can increase our susceptibility to chronic diseases, we have only recently begun to understand the biological mechanisms. Stress triggers the evolutionary ""fight or flight"" arousal response, where the whole body gears up to move quickly to get out of danger. As part of this arousal, the body releases the stress hormone cortisol and ramps up by using our energy stores, which release glucose and insulin so that muscles have the energy to deal with the stress. Substances like alcohol, nicotine and cocaine -- and high-fat, high-calorie comfort foods -- can serve as powerful modifiers of the stress system. They change our stress pathways and affect the way we are able to control our response. The brain area most vulnerable to stress, including early childhood stress, is the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for metabolic homeostasis, or stability, as well as for survival and adaptation. Stress we face as children stays with us . ""The prefrontal cortex is also the region important for self-regulatory activities of all kinds, both emotional and cognitive, including impulse control, and regulation of emotion, cognition and desires,"" says Sinha. Constant battering by stress wears down our ability to counteract potentially dangerous desires, such as cravings for addictive substances or foods. Control over impulsive and dangerous behavior may also wane. This is the dynamic that places children from troubled home environments, and people suffering from addictions, most at risk. The buck stops here . The Yale Stress Center's clinical practice offers both behavioral and physical health care that incorporates traditional interventions like medication and therapy, along with alternative ones, such as yoga, mindfulness meditation, acupuncture and biofeedback. ""We are finding that stress reduction interventions like mindfulness-based meditation can be extremely helpful to impact the stress cycle,"" observes Sinha. ""But the difficulty is that meditation on its own may not be enough to help addicted individuals."" And so Sinha and her colleagues are continuing to develop multipronged interventions that may also include coaching, physical therapy and medications. Using downward dogs to treat depression . Sinha's work, which started with the interaction between stress and addictive behavior, eventually expanded to include the gamut of behavioral addictions, from food to gambling to sex. She has also begun contemplating the effects of stress on motivated behaviors, both healthy and unhealthy, such as exercise and proper nutrition. She is particularly interested in food addiction right now; she's concerned about the obesity epidemic and stress-induced eating. She agrees that social and public health interventions are very important. When the cigarette tax was implemented and smoking was banned from public places, there was a dramatic drop in use. However, there are still a substantial number of people smoking. ""And you really can't ban alcohol and high-fat foods. The buck has to stop at the individual level. My interest is in the connection between stress and behavior, and in finding ways to strengthen the mind and body so that we can resist both mental and physical disease."" Sinha is not dancing much these days. ""I am completely engaged with my work,"" she says. ""But I find it interesting that the dancing I did as a child and young person became the cornerstone of my work, that it shaped my career the way that it did."" And as Sinha finds herself in a clinical care practice that includes yoga and mindfulness, she often feels as though she has come full circle, because ""part of classical Indian dance is based on yogic principles."" In its own way, she says, it has been an interesting and unexpected journey back home.

"(CNN) -- A Chicago grandmother pleads for a respite as television cameras roll: ""Y'all out here killing these innocent people, kids, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers: It's got to stop. You need to stop."" Semehca Nunn's grandson, Deonta Howard, was in a hospital after being shot in the head Thursday night. In all, 13 people were. None of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries, but that fact offered little relief. Once again, Chicago is in the spotlight over gun violence; a reminder that it is the city with the highest number of homicides in the country. An assault-style rifle with a high-capacity magazine was used in the shooting, which appears to be gang-related, Chicago Police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy said Friday. The violence ""needs to stop,"" a tearful Nunn said after she came home to find police and television cameras all around. It was only then that she learned that her grandson had been shot in the ear and that the bullet exited through his mouth. Deonta's condition has stabilized, and he is heavily sedated and will have plastic surgery on his face, Nunn said. ""They said he is going to be OK,"" she said. ""That's what Grandma gave him, strong man, 3 years old, strong survivor."" The other victims include two 15-year-olds who were listed in stable condition, said Officer Ron Gaines of the Chicago Police Department. The rest were adults ages 21 to 41. Video from CNN affiliate WLS-TV showed police had taped off an outdoor basketball court at Cornell Square Park. No suspects were in custody as of Friday, and police were focused on interviewing witnesses and victims and gathering any video that may be available. ""We need to keep illegal guns and military-type weapons out of our communities,"" McCarthy said. ""Illegal guns drive violence. Military-type weapons, like the one we believe to have been used in this shooting, belong on a battlefield, not on a street or in a corner or in a park."" The nation needs a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, he said. ""It's a miracle in this instance there have been no fatalities based on the lethality"" of the weapon used Thursday, McCarthy said. There was a basketball game being played when the shooting happened, the police superintendent said. People were enjoying the park as they do on any other day. The shooting prompted Mayor Rahm Emanuel to cancel a trip to Washington. ""Senseless and brazen acts of violence have no place in Chicago and betray all that we stand for,"" the mayor's office said in a statement. ""The perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I encourage everyone in the community to step forward with any information and everyone in Chicago to continue their individual efforts to build stronger communities where violence has no place."" Chicago's record murder rate: Don't blame guns alone . ""It's pretty frustrating, it's very disappointing this is happening in our neighborhood once again,"" said the Rev. Corey Brooks, a spokesman for the 3-year-old's family. On any given day, any child in the park or walking to school can be shot, until the community does something about it, he said. ""The truth is that in Chicago, we are facing murders every single day on the south side and west side,"" Brooks said. ""Blacks and Latinos are facing extreme violence."" Opinion: Treat Chicago gangs as terrorists . Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said he was saddened by what he called ""horrific violence."" ""We pray for the swift recovery of all the shooting victims, and our hearts go out to their families,"" he said in a statement. ""This senseless violence must be stopped."" The January shooting death of another child, 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, brought national attention to Chicago because the band majorette had performed in Washington at events surrounding President Barack Obama's inauguration in January. The president invited Pendleton's parents to his State of the Union address in February. Obama mentioned her in that speech and a few days later when he returned to Chicago, his hometown, for another speech in which he pressed for stricter gun laws. Police charged two men in Pendleton's death. They said the two were gang members seeking revenge and mistook Pendleton for someone else. The FBI's annual crime report this week showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. Chicago officials have said homicides this year are below the 2012 pace. Still, Chicago does not have the highest homicide rate in the United States. That unwanted distinction belongs to Flint, Michigan, with one homicide for every 1,613 residents, according to the FBI data. Detroit is close behind, with one killing for every 1,832 residents. In 2012, the number of violent crimes increased by 0.7%, compared with the previous year, according to the FBI figures. Chicago bans some semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, and restricts handguns. CNN's Katherine Wojtecki contributed to this story from Chicago.

"(CNN) -- To ask what impact Bill Gates has had on computing is, in a way, too small a question. For millions of people in the nearly four decades since he co-founded Microsoft, Gates has defined the entire field. Whether browsing the Web on Internet Explorer on a PC running Windows or working up a PowerPoint presentation with Microsoft Office before taking a break to game on the Xbox, there are many among us whose entire digital experience have been filtered through products Gates helped create. On Tuesday, Gates took what may be his final step away from leadership of Microsoft. With the announcement that  Satya Nadella, a 22-year veteran of the company, will take over as CEO, the company also said Gates is stepping down as chairman of its board of directors. Gates co-founded the company with Paul Allen in 1975 but stepped down as CEO in 2000. He then spent eight years as Microsoft's chairman before stepping away from full-time work there in 2008 to focus on his charitable work through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Rather than exiting the stage at the world's largest computer software company, Gates may actually be getting more active. He'll take on a new role as an adviser to Nadella, putting him back on Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus more often. It will also put him nearer to the heart of innovation the company will need to keep up with rivals like Apple and Google at the top of the consumer-tech industry. If he succeeds in helping Microsoft get back its swagger, particularly in a fast-growing mobile world dominated by Apple and Google and in the increasingly important field of cloud computing, it would be a final contribution to a career that has virtually defined an industry. ""Bill Gates is one of the pioneering giants of the information age,"" said Merv Adrian, a software and hardware analyst at Gartner Research. ""Driven by the belief in a computer in every home, on every desktop, he helped to build one of the largest firms in the world to achieve that goal -- and arguably succeeded."" For starters, Microsoft was the world's first real software company. Although there are hours of bare-knuckle geek brawling to be done over whether Gates and Microsoft or rival Steve Jobs and Apple were the true innovators on early computer interfaces, there's no question as to who succeeded in making software for the masses. The result was something approximating that computer-on-every-desk dream. By making software a money-maker for itself and third-party developers, Microsoft helped retailers sell computers for less, making them accessible to more of the public. Whether it was MS-DOS for early IBM machines or the more seismic release of Windows in 1985, Gates was behind them all. Despite his reputation as an aggressive -- some would say predatory -- businessman, he has never been confused with a numbers guy who leaves the real work up to subordinates. Gates wrote his first computer program, a tic-tac-toe game, at age 14 and formed his first company, again with Allen, at 17. In Microsoft's early years, he wrote every line of code for the company's software while managing its business side. In that way, he set himself apart from rival Steve Jobs, who had a brilliant sense of design but was never much of a software engineer. Gates' exacting product reviews were legendary within Microsoft, a fact that observers say puts him in a select fraternity of two in the computer world. ""The more time Bill spends on product development, the better,"" Geoffrey Moore, author of the technology marketing book ""Crossing the Chasm,"" told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""He and Steve Jobs seem very different on the outside, but at their core, they were very similar. They both see things that others don't see, and they're both very demanding."" As the years went on, Microsoft products continued to become more ubiquitous -- so much so that the company's seeming stranglehold on the computing world led to monopoly claims and antitrust lawsuits in the late '90s and early 2000s. Despite Apple's inroads, Windows continues to have more than 1.3 billion active users worldwide. PowerPoint, part of the massively popular Microsoft Office suite of productivity tools, has joined the likes of Kleenex, Xerox and Coke in the pantheon of brand names used synonymously with an entire category of products. Many PC users have probably never created a document without Microsoft Word, and number-crunchers everywhere would be lost without Excel's spreadsheets. Microsoft's Hotmail, despite becoming seen as unfashionable by younger users, remained the world's most popular free e-mail service until 2012, when it was passed by Gmail before Microsoft merged it with Outlook. And of course there's the Xbox, which became one of the gaming industry's ""Big Three"" consoles, along with Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation, upon its release in 2001. Thirteen years later, the new Xbox One continues to do battle with the PlayStation 4 for the hearts and wallets of gamers. All were delivered under the guidance of Gates. ""The pervasiveness of information technology was by no means clear when he began driving to it,"" Adrian said. ""And today it is a fact of life, embedded into everyone's life to a degree that only science-fiction writers imagined when he was building his first software."" Will Gates' new role mean a batch of new products that we'll still be talking about 10 or 20 years from now? That may be a stretch. But in a video message posted online Tuesday, Gates said he'll be ""substantially increasing"" the time he spends at Microsoft. And he sounds up to the challenge. ""Microsoft has a long history of innovation, going back to the beginning, where the vision of the personal computer was something that Microsoft helped bring to life,"" he said. ""Our vision of the platform ... really initiated the entire software industry. ""As the industry changes, we have to innovate to move forward,"" he said. ""It'll be fun to define this next round of products working together.""","Bill Gates is stepping down as chairman of Microsoft's board .

"(CNN) -- Rebekah Brooks testified in the United Kingdom phone hacking trial that she knowingly sanctioned payments to a public official while editor of Britain's Sun newspaper. The payment was for a story about a plot by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to bring anthrax into the United Kingdom in the 1990s. Brooks testified a public official called the Sun news desk claiming government and security services were covering up the plot. ""They were asking for money in return for the information,"" said Brooks, who was acting deputy editor of the Sun at the time. ""I did authorize the journalist to enter into a negotiation to pay money if the story turned out to be correct."" Brooks justified the payment by saying the story was of ""overwhelming public interest."" Brooks and six others face phone hacking charges, including conspiracy to intercept the voice mails of high-profile figures in Britain. All deny wrongdoing. One of the defendants is Andy Coulson, another former newspaper editor and former Downing Street communications director. Brooks told the court she was called to a meeting at Downing Street with security service officials while the Sun team was working on the anthrax story. She said the meeting confirmed the story was true and she authorized payment to the official, later identified as a chief petty officer who was prosecuted for breach of the Official Secrets Act. Brooks said she considered paying an official for information in another story, about expenses to members of Parliament, but procrastinated and lost the story to the Daily Telegraph. The former News International chief executive spent most of the week being questioned about stories sourced over eight years from an official who worked at the Ministry of Defence. Brooks denied knowing the source worked for that department, but said it ""should have been brought to my attention so I could take responsibility."" The former newspaper chief said she approved payments on ""a handful"" of occasions between 1998 and 2009, when she edited the News of the World and later the Sun. Brooks said she never suspected the journalist was using a public official as the source. ""I wasn't looking for corrupt payments to public officials. I was looking for public interest,"" she said in explaining why she approved paying around Â£1000 per story. The court adjourned early Friday because Brooks was exhausted after spending six days on the witness stand. She'll testify again Monday.","Editor Rebekah Brooks testifies all week in phone hacking trial .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Conservative leader Mariano Rajoy was sworn in Wednesday as Spain¹s new prime minister, to begin work on what he lists as his top priority -- pulling the nation out of its deep economic crisis. In a brief ceremony at the Zarzuela Palace presided by King Juan Carlos, the head of state, Rajoy stepped forward and read aloud the oath. He then left for the prime minister¹s compound to prepare for the public announcement of his Cabinet ministers, a closely-guarded secret, later in the day. They will be sworn in on Thursday. Rajoy won a landslide election victory in parliamentary elections November 20. On Tuesday, he won the investiture vote in Parliament, and he then got a call from U.S. President Barack Obama. A White House statement said Obama spoke with Rajoy to congratulate him and ""to underscore U.S. support for his economic reform."" ""The two leaders agreed on the vitality of the alliance"" between Spain and the United States, the statement added. The Obama administration previously offered its support for the economic reforms of the outgoing Socialist government, but that government's unpopular austerity measures and the economic crisis led to its defeat at the polls. About 5 million people in the country are jobless. Spain has an overall unemployment rate of 21.5%, but it youth unemployment rate is a staggering 45%. In a speech to Parliament on Monday, Rajoy reiterated his campaign theme that fixing the broken economy, including growth and job creation, will be his top priority. He said 16.5 billion euros (about $21.5 billion) will be cut from the budget next year to meet Spain's deficit reduction target. Critics say he has yet to explain where the deep cuts will be made, but Rajoy said he can't make the 2012 budget until his government takes power. In the parliamentary speech, Rajoy promised to update pension payments, which were frozen under the Socialists amid much public outcry. But he said that would be the only spending increase in his new budget. He said there would soon be labor market reforms to make Spain's workforce more flexible and competitive, and that there would be mergers and takeovers in Spain's troubled banking sector -- which holds a lot of bad debt from 750,000 unsold new homes that went up during the real estate boom but before the financial crisis and credit crunch set in. Rajoy said most of Spain's national holidays that fall on weekdays would be observed on the closest Monday to improve productivity. Earlier this month, two national holidays fell on a Tuesday and a Thursday in the same week, and employers complained it was a lost week for worker productivity. In an effort to help cash-strapped professionals and small businesses, Rajoy said they would not need to pay value-added tax on their goods and services until they collect back payments. Many of those debts are owed by government administrations at all levels, which are months in arrears in paying their suppliers due to the crisis. Rajoy¹s first cabinet meeting is scheduled for Friday.","Conservative leader Mariano Rajoy was sworn in as prime minister Wednesday .

"LONDON, England -- A new tool that allows doctors to use laser surgery in complex operations has been hailed as a breakthrough in minimally invasive laser technology. This fiber optic tool is made from the perfect mirror, making it possible to reflect CO2 lasers for the first time. Originally designed as a military tool for the United States Department of Defense (DOD), the fiber-optic invention is revolutionizing the ways surgeons carry out brain surgeries. The ""Omni directional dielectric mirror"" was created by Professor Yoel Fink, a then-29-year-old student in Material Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1995. ""I was asked to participate in a project funded by the DOD to create the perfect mirror,"" Fink told CNN. ""The perfect mirror reflects light from all angles and does not absorb any of it. It could have been used, for example, to reflect back enemy laser beams,"" he continued . DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a subsection of the DOD, specialize in technologies they believe are about 25 years away from being realized and try to make them happen in five years' time. But they didn't have a long wait before they found their perfect mirror. ""To my own surprise, I found the answer during the very first meeting. I thought everyone would laugh at my suggestion, so I waited until the last two minutes to talk and after I did, the room just fell silent,"" Fink, a former commander in the Israeli army, told CNN. He found that by taking two materials with different optical properties (one being a semi-conducting glass and one being a polymer) and stacking these two up in very tight and ultra thin layers, around 1 micron each (1/1000 of a millimeter), they create an omni-reflector. The most important part of his discovery, however, was that by changing only the thickness and distance of the layers, the ""perfect mirror"" could reflect any type of electromagnetic energy in any wavelength. This meant Fink's invention was useful not only in the military and telecommunications field, but could also be used in minimally invasive laser surgery -- the use of lasers rather than scalpels to operate on everything from tumors, deafness and spine injuries. This type of surgery is known to reduce recovery time, the likelihood of complications and incision size. In many cases, patients also spend less time ""under the knife."" Fink then set about creating a pen-shaped fiber-optic tool that could allow surgeons to easily manipulate the laser and bend it to reach almost any tissue in the body. The results, according to some surgeons who have used it, are astonishing. Dr. Stanley Shapshay, a renowned American Ear Nose and Throat surgeon and former president of the Triological Society told CNN: ""When Yoel first called me to show me his fiber-optic tool made out of this perfect mirror, I was very skeptical as I had seen many unsuccessful trials."" ""But as soon as we did the first tests, I was simply blown away,"" he added. Dr. Shapshay has now performed over 100 operations with the ""perfect mirror laser"" and says he finds it almost easier to use than a scalpel. Dr. Bendok, a senior neurosurgeon at Northwestern University in the United States, along with his partner, otolaryngologist Dr Andrew Fishman, also rave about the benefit of the fiber optic tool in minimally invasive surgery. In a recent case, Dr. Bendok's patient had a tumor at the base of the brain, a tumor that could have been more difficult and dangerous to remove without Fink's device. ""Using the scalpel could have caused a stroke,"" Dr. Fishman told CNN. ""Instead we used CO2 laser to melt the tumor and then shave it off."" The whole operation took less than an hour and the patient recovered in only three days. According to Dr. Shapshay, the perfect mirror is also an important development because, for years, doctors were able to treat patients with lasers in only limited circumstances and with many complications. Until the ""perfect mirror"" came along there were no fibers that could transport the safer CO2 lasers. Surgeons had to shoot the laser beam directly from its large generator and could do so only at a straight angle, rendering it impossible to reach deeper tissues. ""At the time, CO2 lasers were like the perfect weapon for soldiers, but one that also happened to weigh five tons. They were very cumbersome,"" says Dr. Shapshay. The surgeons believe laser technology will now become more widespread with the avenue of this tool that is ""easy and intuitive to use."" Next on Fink's to-do list is to take his fibers worldwide, especially in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. His company, Omni Guide, aims to expand the tool globally: most clinics using it are currently in the United States. ""I hope it can help patients around the world,"" he said.","Perfect Mirror is used to simplify and expand use of minimally invasive laser surgery .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday defeated an impassioned legislative push to reduce the growing problem of sex assault in the armed forces by overhauling the way the military prosecutes serious crimes. By a vote of 55 to 45, a bill championed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand failed to get the 60 votes needed for passage. The measure would have removed military commanders from deciding whether most serious allegations of wrongdoing by their subordinates should be prosecuted. The responsibility would have been shifted to prosecutors outside the chain of command. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said the change was needed because bias can creep into the decisions of commanders and that has led to many sex assaults not being prosecuted. ""It's time to move the sole decision-making power over whether serious crimes akin to a felony go to trial from the chain of command into the hands of non-biased, professionally trained military prosecutors where it belongs,"" Gillibrand argued. She pointed to a Pentagon report as evidence. The recent study showed that there were estimated to be 26,000 incidents of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012 and just over 10 percent of those were reported. Officer who trains sex crimes prosecutors accused of groping lawyer . While Gillibrand's reforms had significant support in the Senate, they were opposed by the bipartisan leaders of the Armed Services Committee and the Pentagon. Opponents cited concerns it would undermine the critical military principle of command authority. ""The strongest most effective approach we can take to reduce sexual assault is to hold commanders accountable for establishing and maintaining a command climate that does not tolerate sexual assault,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the armed services panel. ""The evidence shows that removing this authority from our commanders would weaken not strengthen our response to this urgent problem,"" he said. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, led the effort to defeat Gillibrand's bill. The former prosecutor pointed to several significant reforms that became law last year she said would increase prosecutions of sex assault. They include: removing the authority of commanders to overturn convictions; providing attorneys to victims; making it a crime to retaliate against a victim; and requiring a dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault. McCaskill warned that removing commanders from the process could leave victims more vulnerable to retaliation. Gillibrand and McCaskill, two rising Democratic senators, have battled intensely for months over how best to reform the prosecution process. On a separate vote Thursday, a bill authored by McCaskill to make additional reforms to those adopted last year cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, clearing the way for expected final passage. It would largely disallow the so-called ""good soldier"" defense, which permits defendants to enter evidence of their good military character at trial to mitigate the charges against them. It moved ahead easily with the support of Gillibrand.","Senate bill was championed by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand .

"(CNN) -- Niger has extradited Moammar Gadhafi's son Saadi, who has been transferred to a jail in Tripoli, Libya, the Libyan government said Thursday. The North African country had been seeking the handover of Saadi Gadhafi, who fled across the border to Niger when rebel forces toppled his father in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011. ""He was handed to Libya and is now in the custody of the Libyan judicial police,"" the Libyan government said on its Facebook page. It thanked the leader of its southern neighbor for his cooperation. Saadi, one of Gadhafi's seven sons, was a professional soccer player and businessman before his father's downfall. Unlike his brother, Saif al-Islam, Gadhafi's heir apparent, he is not wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on charges of war crimes. In late 2011, rebel forces captured Saif al-Islam, who remains in a militia hands in the small western mountain town of Zintan, Libya. Niger handed over Saadi Gadhafi after Libyan authorities provided evidence of ""communications and practices targeting Libya's security and aimed at destabilizing Libya,"" Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan told Libyan television. In February 2012, the younger Gadhafi made a televised phone call warning of an imminent uprising in Libya, saying he was in regular contact with people in the country who were unhappy with the new authorities. Authorities in Niger had warned him after that incident. He had been staying under tight regulation, including house arrest. Pictures of Saadi Gadhafi, 40, wearing a blue uniform as his head was shaved circulated widely on social media. Niger had previously refused to hand him over, with some officials saying he could face the death penalty in Libya. He reportedly resided in a secured guesthouse in Niger's capital, Niamey, after fleeing across the Sahara desert. A leading human rights group questioned why he had been handed over. ""The authorities in Niger should explain why they were convinced that Saadi Gaddafi would not be mistreated and would get a fair trial,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. She called for Libyan officials to bring him quickly to trial and protect him from inhumane treatment. Seeking Gadhafi supporters . Since the end of the conflict that came with Moammar Gadhafi's capture and killing in October 2011, Libya's government has sought the extradition of family members and ex-officials. Several of Gadhafi's other sons were killed during the rebellion. Saif al-Arab died in a NATO airstrike in spring 2011, and Khamis, who led the elite and widely feared Khamis brigade, was reported killed during the fighting. He died in a battle in northwestern Libya that August. Around the time of his death, troops commanded by Khamis Gadhafi killed an estimated 150 captive civilians during a retreat, hurling grenades and spraying bullets into a building full of men they had promised to release, a survivor said. Another son, once national security adviser, Mutassim, was killed near the Libyan leader's last stronghold of Sirte in October 2011. The former dictator's wife, Safia, fled with sons Mohammed, Hannibal and daughter Aisha to neighboring Algeria in late August 2011, along with extended family members. They reportedly left there for Oman, where they were granted asylum. 2012: Gadhafi's son seeks travel ban waiver, lawyer says . 2011: Saadi Gadhafi arrives in Niger as Libyan troops seek to strangle Sirte .

Bieber asked after a dozen deputies woke him up at 8 a.m. on January 14, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson told CNN Friday. He detected ""a little sense of entitlement"" from the 19-year-old pop star, although he said Bieber was cooperative. Bieber didn't use foul language,Thompson said, as he allegedly did with police in Miami when he was arrested there early Wednesday. Deputies had a search warrant to look for evidence connected to an egg assault on a neighboring mansion five days earlier, which caused damage that will cost at least $20,000 to repair, Thompson said. ""The house does operate much like a fraternity house and much of the same stuff that's done there is going to be done across the country,"" Thompson said. ""But the house next door is usually another fraternity house. It's not usually a mansion that can sustain this damage."" Bieber has decorated the living room of his $6.5 million home with ping pong and pool tables, a Ms. PacMan video game and a basketball free-throw machine, Thompson said. The main feature of his back yard is a skateboard ramp covered with spray-painted graffiti. ""It was kind of like a fraternity house, but no signs of drugs,"" Thompson said, contradicting some media reports that deputies overlook evidence of illegal drug use. ""I walked through every room of the house. I was the third person through the door. So, it's not hearsay. I didn't see any of that."" A deputy did find suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of Bieber house guest Lil Za -- real name Xavier Smith. Lab tests returned to investigators Friday confirmed one of the drugs in the 20-year-old rapper's possession was MDMA -- also known as Molly or Ecstasy, Thompson said. Lil Za has been charged with a felony drug charge. ""If there's other things, such as drugs, that are right there in plain view, then we're going to deal with that as well, which we did,"" he said. ""But our goal in going in there was the security video."" Detectives seized the computer that controls the extensive security video system protecting Bieber's sprawling estate. What it recorded the night of the alleged egging will be shown to prosecutors next week as they decide if Bieber should be charged with felony vandalism, he said. ""I believe there was some things captured on the video,"" Thompson said Friday. ""We're going over that right now. We will probably be done with that, I'm assuming, today. We will then have a dialogue with the district attorney."" It will be up to the prosecutor to decide if the egg attack evidence justifies a felony vandalism charge against the singer. Bieber's 'wake up call' The knock on Bieber's door last week was ""quite a wake-up call,"" Thompson said. ""And he needs a wake-up call."" Deputies have responded ""numerous times"" to complaints by Bieber's neighbors about loud parties, fast driving and even an incident in which Bieber allegedly spat on a neighbor. But no charges have ever resulted. ""We don't do search warrants to send messages, but make no mistake, we hope that messages are received,"" Lt. Thompson said. ""We do search warrants to collect evidence, but this is a person who's been wreaking havoc on the neighborhood, who's been operating, basically, with impunity because he hasn't spoken to us in the past about anything that went on."" Bieber apparently didn't take the warning to heart, based on the druken driving arrest in Miami Wednesday, Thompson said. The exclusive Oaks community in Calabasas is home to the rich and famous, including Michael Jackson's mother and children. Britney Spears previously lived on the same street that Bieber moved to nearly two years ago. ""People move to that neighborhood -- which is a gated community -- for the peace, quiet, and tranquility that it provides,"" Thompson said. ""So, Mr. Bieber's past actions of loud parties, driving too fast, large numbers of people there, egging and what not are way out of character for anyone that lives in that neighborhood."" The sheriff's department's goal is ""to try to improve the quality of the neighborhood and make sure people get the help that they need,"" he said. ""In some cases, that help is jail time. In some cases, that help is a wake-up call.""","""Why you in my house, bro?""Justin Bieber asks deputy with a warrant .

"(CNN) -- Despite a miracle shot to join a four-man playoff, Rory McIlroy ultimately was left to rue his failure to negotiate the notorious Bear Trap at PGA National as Russell Henley claimed the Honda Classic title Sunday. Looking to lead from start to finish, McIlroy endured a wayward final round 74 but after brilliantly scrambling a par three on the 15th still held the lead at 10-under-par. An ugly double bogey at the 16th after he found the water and a bogey four on the par-3 17th then all but ended his chances. The former world number one appeared to need an eagle three on the par-5 to rekindle his victory hopes and from 245 yards hit an approach of laser-like accuracy over the water and to within 10 feet of the flag. Playing partner Henley fluffed his chance to make a birdie four to get to nine under and McIlroy saw his eagle putt slide agonizingly wide. It left the pair tied at eight-under 272 with earlier finishers Russel Knox of Scotland and American Ryan Palmer, who had missed a short par putt on the 18th, which would have given him outright victory. Four-man playoff . Playing the 18th again as the first extra hole, McIlroy attempted to repeat his earlier approach shot but his effort went long and into the back bunker. He failed to get down in two shots and with Knox and Palmer also having to settle for par fives, it left Henley a short putt to seal his second PGA Tour victory with a birdie four. McIlroy, searching for his first win of the year after near misses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, held a two-shot lead over Henley after starting the day on 12-under. Wayward play saw shots dribble away before he hit the three-hole Bear Trap from 15th to the 17th, designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus. Henley, who had chipped in to join McIlroy at 10-under on the 14th, made a hash of the short 15th himself, finding the water with his tee shot to make a double bogey. But he kept his nerve the better in the final analysis to land the $6 million PGA Tour event. ""I was fortunate that I was in the playoff,"" McIlroy said. ""I didn't play well enough at all down the stretch to win this tournament."" ""It's going to take a long time for this to sink in,"" admitted Henley. Woods injury scare . Earlier, world number one Tiger Woods was forced to withdraw during the final round with a back injury. Woods, who has endured a difficult start to the year, shot a third round 65, but was five-over through 13 holes when he left the course. Woods is scheduled to begin his defense of the WGC Cadillac Championship Thursday and it is only six weeks to the first major of the season at Augusta. A statement released by Woods said that his back had spasmed while warming up Sunday, similar to the problem he suffered at The Barclays last year, but was still able to finish runner-up.","Russell Henley wins four-man playoff for Honda Classic .

"(CNN) -- Multiple sclerosis robbed Christine Rathbun's mother, Coleen, of the ability to ride a bike or walk around the block. And still, she thanks God each day for being able to step out of bed on her own two feet. Coleen went from using a cane in her early 40s to a walker at 50. When they were out in public, Christine watched as her mother endured stares and whispers behind her back: . Why does such a young woman need a cane or walker? Is that woman drunk in the middle of the day? And even though Coleen couldn't participate in lots of typical mom things, like going shopping for a prom dress, teaching her daughter to ride a bike, or moving her into her dorm on the first day of college, ""she never failed to reiterate how proud she was of me,"" Christine Rathbun said. ""There is still not a day that passes where she does not say that to me, when really I'm the one who is proud of her."" In honor of Women's History Month and International Women's Day, we invited readers to tell the world about the extraordinary women in their lives. We asked you to share a photo on Instagram and complete this sentence: ""This is _______. She taught me _______."" Many chose to honor their mom or another maternal figure who met life's challenges with love and optimism. Meetra Javed's grandmother had cancer, a stroke and now diabetes, but she still paints henna on her fingernails and takes time to look at the sun each day in Karachi, Pakistan. The 23-year-old New York artist visited her grandmother, Afsari Begum, in Pakistan four months ago. ""She had one breast removed, and was bedridden. She often sat on a wheelchair staring at the sun outside of her balcony grasping holy beads, reciting prayers. Diabetic, suffering from the aftermath of a stroke, and previously fighting breast cancer, she had held onto the true nature of faith,"" Javed said. ""While all but two of her children have been hundreds of miles away, she still managed to somehow smile, and see the value of the sun."" Javed remembers her ""Nano"" in healthier times, when the woman visited the United States and while ""she would never understand English television, somehow watching WWE wrestling made her laugh uncontrollably."" She chose to honor Begum because ""I want her to know that just because I am (seemingly) millions of miles away in a country she doesn't understand, I have not forgotten her."" International Women's Day 2014: What kind of world do YOU want to build? Christine Rathbun was 2 years old when her mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 35. When the autoimmune disease took away her ability to work, Coleen dedicated herself to being the best stay-at-home mother. ""She made my lunch every day, embarrassingly enough, all the way up through high school, and made sure that when I got home from school, she spent quality time with me before her fatigue and leg pain set in,"" said Rathbun, a graduate student in social work. ""She made sure no matter what limitations she was facing that I was able to experience the most 'normal' childhood possible."" Nursing student Noell Persells also chose to honor her mother, who lost her soul mate -- and taught her that ""a princess can save herself."" Persells, 26, said there was never a couple more in love than her parents, Linda and Richard. Her dad died of cancer four years ago, and her mother ""has looked at each day with a positive attitude."" ""Mom always taught me that what makes a princess ... is not looks, but how she conducts herself when facing hardship -- how she leads herself, her people, her family through that hardship,"" said Persells, who lives in Atlanta. ""It's about putting on a brave face, dealing with what you're dealt in life, and finding peace and happiness in what you are given because there are other people who have so much less."" Karen Putz chose to honor an older woman who is not her mother, but who helped her give birth to a more courageous version of herself. More than 20 years ago, as a teenager, Putz lost her hearing while barefoot water skiing. In 2009, Putz was overweight, out of shape and scared to get on the water again. Her husband sent her a clip of 66-year-old Judy Myers, a heavyset woman who had picked up the sport in her 50s. The two women connected on Facebook and Myers encouraged Putz to return to the sport she once loved. ""She taught me that you're never too old to unwrap your passions,"" wrote Putz, who lives in Bolingbrook, Illinois. ""Today, we barefoot water ski together and she is an awesome friend.

"(CNN) -- Richard Branson has never been one to shy away from sharing his ostentatious exploits with the wider world. Over the years, the billionaire entrepreneur has invited us to follow his attempts to hot-air balloon around the globe, delve the deepest recesses of the oceans and cross the Atlantic on a speedboat. Now the founder of the Virgin Group has provided access to his very own private Caribbean resort, Necker Island, for a new book by Australian fashion and celebrity photographer Russell James. Featuring more than 150 deluxe images, ""A Virgin Island"" reveals Necker's idyllic beaches and spectacular tropical wildlife as well as dipping inside Branson's luxury residences. Branson purchased the British Virgin Island retreat in 1978 for a knockdown price of $180,000, setting up a home in which he still stays for at least two months of every year. In 1984, he opened a luxury resort on Necker that has since welcomed a long line of rich and famous guests. Those reported to have spent their vacation time there include the late Diana Princess of Wales, Hollywood stars Kate Winslet, Eddie Murphy, Geena Davis, Kate Moss and Robert De Niro as well as statesmen such as Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. Google co-founder Larry Page, meanwhile, married his girlfriend on the island in an elaborate 2007 ceremony. Today, a stay on Necker is possible for anyone with the means, although prices rise to a prohibitive $60,000 a night to rent out the entire island. If you're short a buck or two, we suggest clicking through a selection of James' best photos in the gallery above as a more fiscally prudent way of attaining the Necker experience.","Richard Branson has opened up his Caribbean Island home for a new book .

"(CNN) -- The family of stricken Formula One star Michael Schumacher ""strongly believe"" he will make a recovery from the life-threatening injuries he sustained in a skiing accident. Schumacher has been in a medically-induced coma in a Grenoble hospital since December 29 and a statement on behalf of the family Thursday said he was ""still in a waking up process."" It was released a day after a published report in Germany's best-selling newspaper Bild -- which claimed the seven-time world champion had contracted pneumonia. Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has refused to comment on what she termed ""speculation"" and there is no specific reference to the report in the latest update. ""Michael's family would like to again express their sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the world,"" it read. ""The good wishes they receive help the family and, we are convinced they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process. ""As often in such situation no day is like the next. The family is thankful for one's understanding that they would not wish to disclose medical details in order to protect Michael's privacy. ""As assured from the beginning we will continue to communicate any decisive new information on Michael's health state. We are aware that the wake up phase can take a long time. ""The family continues to strongly believe in Michael's recovery and place all their trust in the doctors', nurses' and nursing auxiliaries' team. ""The important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that Michael's heal process progresses in a continuous and controlled way.

He has undergone two emergency operations to remove blood clots on his brain and reduce swelling and kept asleep to aid his recovery. Schumacher's wife Corinna has kept a constant vigil at the hospital since the accident. He retired for the second and final time from F1 in 2012 after a glittering career with the Benetton, Ferrari and Mercedes teams, bringing him 91 victories in grand prix racing.

"(CNN) -- Singapore's escalating dispute with its neighbor Indonesia over the naming of a warship has led to a series of tit-for-tat snubs involving the city's airshow, which is being held this week. Lieutenant-General (Retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Indonesia's deputy defense minister, alongside the chiefs of the country's three main military branches, will not be attending the Singapore Airshow, which begins Tuesday, in a form of diplomatic protest. Sjafrie also canceled other engagements in the city. The withdrawal comes after Singapore rescinded the invitations of around 100 members of Indonesia's military hierarchy. The snub was a response to Indonesia's decision to name a warship after two marines who were tried and convicted of blowing up a bank in Singapore in 1965 during the conflict known as the Konfrontasi, between Indonesia and Malaysia, of which Singapore was a part at the time. The attack killed three and injured 33. The decision to name a naval frigate the KRI Usman Harun, after Sergeants Usman Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun Said, has angered the city-state, which says that it reflects a lack of sensitivity and respect for mutual ties. The marines were executed in Singapore. Their remains were repatriated and, the pair were lauded as heroes, as they were buried with full honors. The matter was thought to be put to bed when Singapore's then-President Lee Kuan Yew scattered petals on the Indonesian soldiers' graves in 1973. ""I am disappointed with the Indonesian decision to name their new warship after the two convicted ex-marines,"" said Chan Chun Sing, Singapore's Second Minister for Defence, said in an official Ministry release. ""I am also disappointed with the reactions of the Indonesian leaders who have spoken on this issue thus far. ""The [Indonesian leaders'] statements reflected either a lack of sensitivity, a lack of care for the bilateral ties, or both."" Indonesia has stuck by its naming decisions, with officials saying that the practice of naming naval vessels after heroes is commonplace. Chan added, ""I hope the Indonesian leaders will not sacrifice our bilateral relations, so carefully built up, to domestic politics or through carelessness."" Indonesia's defense ministry confirmed the officials' non-attendance on Sunday, Defense News reported. ""The visit by senior TNI [Indonesian National Armed Forces] officers, military chiefs of staff and TNI commander to Singapore has been canceled,"" the ministry said a statement. The journal added that an Indonesian aerobatic team would still perform at the show. Despite differences, including protests against an annual forest burn conducted by the larger country, which affects air quality in Singapore, the two countries enjoy a full diplomatic relationship and have strong commercial ties. Indonesia is Singapore's third-largest individual trading partner. The Singapore Airshow, set to be the biggest to date officially opened on Monday evening and events will run from February 11 to 16.","Indonesia's top military brass confirm absence from Singapore Airshow .

"(CNN) -- Simona Halep confirmed her reputation as one of the rising young stars of the WTA Tour by romping to the Qatar Open title Sunday. Halep was winning her third title, but victory from a draw which included Australian Open champion Li Na, was by far the biggest of her career. The 22-year-old thrashed sixth seed Angelique Kerber of Germany 6-2 6-3 in just 66 minutes in the final and will rise to ninth in the new world rankings this week. It followed her defeats of second and fourth seeds Agnieszka Radwanska and Sara Errani on the way to the title match. Despite her impressive recent form, Halep did not think she would win the tournament at the start of week. It's amazing for me, because when I came here I didn't think I could reach the final, certainly not win,"" she told the official WTA website. ""I had been competing indoors, but mentally I am very strong and I got the feel of the balls and the court here very well. I have to enjoy this now as the best moment of my life."" Halep was on top from the start as she immediately broke Kerber's serve and only at 2-1 down in the second set did she trail before taking control again. On the ATP Tour, Czech Tomas Berdych claimed his first title for 16 months with a 6-4 6-2 victory over Marin Cilic of Croatia in the final. Cilic had gone into the title match off the back of nine straight wins, but third seed Berdych swept him aside. ""It feels so amazing, it's been so long, To win the title here is a real bonus. I'm extremely happy with how I handled things throughout the week,"" he told AFP . The Buenos Aires title went to clay court specialist David Ferrer as he beat Fabio Fognini of Italy 6-3 6-4 in the final. Ferrer was beaten by Rafael Nadal in the final of last year's French Open and easily accounted for the second seed in Argentina. Nadal was due to compete but pulled out citing ""lack of preparation"" as he battles back from the injury which struck him in the final of the Australian Open against Stanislas Wawrinka.","Simona Halep wins Qatar Open .

"(CNN) -- Japanese teenager Yuzuku Hanyu survived two falls to emerge on top of a tense and error-ridden finale to the men's figure skating competition at the Winter Olympics in Sochi Friday. The 19-year-old had set a world-record score in the short program, but under pressure of expectation in the concluding free routine appeared to have blown his chances as he failed to land two jumps. However, there was drama still to come on day seven of the Games as three-time world champion Patrick Chan of Canada once again saw his dreams of Olympic gold crumble. A lackluster display littered with mistakes saw Chan fail to overhaul Hanyu, who was left as a relieved winner -- Japan's first in the event as the country opened its gold-medal account in Sochi. He is the youngest winner of the figure skating competition at a Winter Games for 66 years. ""I'm so proud of this feat as a Japanese,"" he said. ""The Olympics is so wild and unpredictable. I've never been this nervous for a competition in my entire life. I'm upset with the performance I had, but I left everything I had out there."" The 101.45 points Hanyu accrued in such incredible style Thursday gave him sufficient buffer to take the gold with a total of 280.09. Chan took silver on 275.62 points, but it will be little consolation with ultimate triumph within his grasp. Denis Ten of Kazakhstan won the bronze. Chan admitted he had felt the pressure in bidding for Canada's first gold of the Games. ""We're all human. Even (snowboard star) Shaun White makes mistakes. Unfortunately, I made one too many,"" the 23-year-old said. Russia's main hope, Yevgeny Plushenko, had to pull out before the start of the short program after damaging his back in the warmup. Swiss upsets the odds . Earlier Friday, the upsets continued in the alpine skiing competition as Switzerland's Sandro Viletta took the men's super-combined title. The 28-year-old had never won a medal in a major championship and had won just a single World Cup event. But his combined time of two minutes 45.20 seconds over the downhill and slalom runs gave him gold. ""This is amazing -- it's perfect, it's more than a dream come true. It's also a big shock. I didn't think I would come first,"" he said. Croatian veteran Ivica Kostelic finished second, 0.34 seconds behind Viletta, to claim his fourth Olympic silver and third in the combined. He was competing on a slalom course set by his father, who also coaches him. All the coaches of the top-15 ranked skiers go into a lottery to decide who will can lay out the course and Ante Kostelic won the draw. Italy's Christof Innerhofer followed his silver in Sunday's downhill by claiming the bronze medal. He had only praise for the course designer, despite finishing behind his son. ""I thank Ante Kostelic for setting a good course,"" he said. But defending champion Bode Miller never recovered after a disappointing downhill run and finished sixth while world champion and U.S. compatriot Ted Ligety trailed home 12th. The variable ski conditions may have worked against the favorites, as Ligety suggested after his disappointing performance. ""They really make for funky results. You can see the results sheet so far. It's far from the World Cup result sheets,"" he said. ""But we all have to ski and deal with it. There are no excuses."" French hope Alexis Pinturault, like Ligety a dominant force on the World Cup, also finished outside the top 10. More Swiss success . Double gold was also a strong theme on day seven of competition, with Dario Cologna making it a great day for Switzerland by winning the 15 km classic in the cross-country nordic skiing discipline. It was a successful defense of the title he won in Vancouver and followed his earlier triumph in the 30 km skiathlon in Sochi. Cologna came into the Games off the back of injury problems, and his performances have taken him by surprise. ""It's amazing. I couldn't believe the first gold medal, after being injured, and now the second. It was the perfect race. I knew it would be hard and I was prepared for it,"" he said. Belarus gold double . Darya Domracheva from Belarus made it two golds in three days with victory in the women's 15 km individual biathlon race. She took the bronze in Vancouver but stepped up to the top of the podium in Sochi, beating Switzerland's Selina Gasparin into second place, with compatriot Nadezhda Skardino in third. Domracheva took the women's pursuit title Tuesday on Tuesday and was in unbeatable form again, particularly in the shooting section of the competition. Belarus later picked up its second gold of the day as 34-year-old Alla Tsuper, competing in her fifth Winter Games, finally found her way to the top of the podium in the women's freestyle aerials competition. Tsuper had never finished higher than fifth in her previous attempts but with a total score of 98.01 she was flying high. Mengtao Xu of China took the silver, while defending champion Lydia Lassila of Australia won bronze. Tsuper took two years out to start a family but came back to competition better than ever. ""I had a break for two years. I returned to the sport to have one more chance to have a medal. That was a dream,"" she said. Yarnold the new skeleton queen . Britain continued its domination of women's skeleton as Lizzy Yarnold took the title won by compatriot Amy Williams four years ago. Former track and field athlete Yarnold held the lead from the first run Thursday at the Slanki Sliding Center and finished nearly a second clear of Noelle Pikus-Pace of the United States over four sessions. Elena Nikitina took the bronze for host nation Russia. ""I don't think it's going to sink in for a long time,"" said Yarnold, who had to endure some nervous moments at the start of her final run. ""It was a messy fourth run but I just relaxed and enjoyed it. I wanted to do myself justice and show the world what I could do.""","Yuzuru Hanyu wins men's free skating gold despite making errors .

"(CNN) -- Atletico Madrid paid emotional tribute to former player and coach Luis Aragones Sunday before sweeping to the top of La Liga with a style of football which would have made him proud. Following the 4-0 win over Real Sociedad at the Vicente Calderon stadium, the club's official website simply posted: Leaders: This if for you Luis. The victory saw them overtake Barcelona at the top of the standings -- the first time they had achieved the feat since the double-winning season of 1995-96. But it was all about Aragones, who died aged 75 Saturday. He spent the majority of his football career with Atletico and is still the club's leading scorer, claiming La Liga titles both as a player and coach. Aragones capped his achievements by coaching Spain to the 2008 European Championship, the start of their domination of world football. Giant banners were unfurled in the Atletico stadium in his honor and tributes were observed before all the matches in the La Liga program. Aragones donned the number eight shirt for the team and home fans waited until the eighth minute of the match before chanting his name. It was entirely fitting that it was David Villa, the competition's top scorer when Aragones led Spain to Euro 2008 glory, who opened the scoring against Basque side Sociedad when he swept home Diego Costa's low cross. The sought after Costa doubled Atletico's advantage with a typical finish before Miranda headed home the third. Diego Ribas rounded off a glorious evening for Atletico -- who are also into the last 16 of the Champions League -- with a shot into the roof of the visiting net. Sociedad were playing their first match since Thursday's bizarre Copa del Rey clash with Racing Santander, whose players staged on an on-pitch strike in protest at unpaid wages. They held their own for much of the match after Villa's 12th of the season just before the break, but a late flurry by Atletico sealed the win to take them three points clear of Barca, who suffered a shock 3-2 home defeat to Valencia Saturday. Atletico manager Diego Simeone said he was proud of his team and their fans. ""When someone like Luis leaves us there is pain and sadness, but today the fans, the game and that silence for the first eight minutes before they sang his name moved me,"" he told AFP. ""From above he would be wearing red and white and happy with the bravery we showed."" Real Madrid missed the chance to move within a point of their city rivals when held to a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao later Sunday and suffered an even bigger setback as Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off. Ronaldo set up Jese for Real's second half opener before Ibai Gomez equalized for the impressive hosts. Ronaldo was then dismissed after a tussle with home defender Carlos Gurpegi to leave his depleted team to hold on a for a point in the final few minutes.","Atletico Madrid top La Liga after 4-0 home win over Real Sociedad .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Friday rejected a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution -- a setback to GOP leaders and conservative activists who claim the measure is necessary to end the federal government's spiraling deficit spending. A total of 261 members voted for the measure --- 23 votes shy of the two-thirds majority required for passage -- while 165 members opposed it. Most Republicans supported the measure; most Democrats voted no. The vote on the amendment was agreed to by both parties over the summer as part of the agreement raising Washington's debt ceiling. Democratic leaders, however, are vehemently opposed to the idea, arguing that it would force the government into an economically destructive cycle of massive spending cuts. Sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, the measure would have required three-fifths of both chambers of Congress to sign off on any future deficit spending. The amendment's requirements could have been waived in the event of a declaration of war. ""The American people are demanding action,"" Goodlatte said earlier this month. ""They know that it is crucial we rein in the skyrocketing deficit spending that is discouraging investment and threatening to bankrupt our nation."" Shortly before the vote, Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, called Congress ""hopelessly addicted to excessive spending and budget deficits"" and said opponents of the amendment ""are hopelessly in denial, just like a drug addict is in denial about their addiction."" Fleming's comments prompted a retort from Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Illinois, who said, ""I am addicted to saving lives. I am addicted to making sure that Social Security is not violently cut by the balanced budget amendment."" Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, also blasted the proposal on the House floor, accusing Republicans of engaging in political posturing by pushing measures like the balanced budget amendment while failing to support spending plans that would actually bring the government's finances under control. ""Don't talk about it. Just do it,"" Hoyer said Thursday. ""Don't cut taxes and increase spending. Don't just preach fiscal responsibility. Practice it. It will take no courage to vote for this amendment, but it will take courage to balance our budget by paying for what we buy."" Despite the proposal's defeat, it remains heavily favored by the public. Nearly three in four Americans favored passage of the amendment in a July 18-20 CNN/ORC International Poll, while only 24% were opposed. Sixty percent of Americans believe a balanced budget amendment is necessary to get the deficit under control, according to the poll. The House passed a balanced budget amendment in 1995, but the measure fell one vote short in the Senate in both 1995 and 1997.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods led the world's elite in their fightback against the 'Blue Monster' Saturday as a six-under 66 left the 14-time major winner in touching distance of an unlikely victory in the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Florida. Woods, who almost did not start the tournament after suffering back spasms at the Honda Classic last week, opened with a four-over 76 Thursday and his chances of defending the title looked slim. They improved in the second round where high winds caused carnage on the 7,400 yard course, which has been toughened up by designer Gil Hanse. A total of 113 balls found the water on the Trump National at Doral, but Woods moved up the field with a one-over 73, including a miraculous 91-foot birdie putt. In lighter winds of around 10 mph (16 kph) the scoring was better Saturday and Woods took full advantage with eight birdies and just two bogeys. It left him three adrift of fellow American Patrick Reed, who carded a three-under 69 for four-under 212 going into the final round. Hunter Mahan and Jason Dufner, who shot the next best round of 68, were tied second on two-under. ""It was nice to get back in the tournament again,"" Woods told the official PGA Tour website as he gave his verdict on his performance. ""As far as most complete round, absolutely. I hit the ball a lot better than I did at Honda last Saturday. This was certainly a lot better round."" Woods shot a 65 in the third round of the Honda before suffering his injury problems in the final round. He believed that putting was the key to his fine scoring in the third round of the WGC. ""I got my speed right,"" said Woods, who finished with just 25 putts. ""And I felt like I hit the ball a little better and left myself in good spots."" He will be seeking his fifth win on one of his favorite courses Sunday and 18th WGC victory of his storied career. Others did not fare so well in the third round, with Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy slipping off the pace with a three-over 75 after being well-placed at the start of the round. Australia's Adam Scott, who could have displaced Woods as the world's top ranked golfer, was on four-over after a level par 72.","Tiger Woods shoots six-under 66 at WGC-Cadillac Championship .

"(CNN)  -- Female suicide bombers detonated explosions that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow during rush hour on Monday morning, killing dozens of people, officials said. A Web site associated with Chechen separatists, who have long fought for independence from Russia, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Immediately after the explosions, officials had cast suspicion on the separatists. Chechnya is a southwestern Russian republic, in the Caucasus Mountains region. Years of conflict have been devastating for its infrastructure. Chechnya's population of 600,000 to 800,000 is primarily made up of Sunni Muslims and Russian Orthodox Christians. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced in their conflict with Moscow. Below is a timeline of the conflict. August 2009 - The head of a humanitarian agency in Chechnya and her husband are found dead, their bodies stuffed in the trunk of their car. July 2009 - A leading human rights activist is abducted and killed near her home in Grozny. Natalya Estemirova, of the Russian human rights group Memorial, had openly criticized Chechnya's authoritarian president, Ramzan Kadyrov, and his methods. April 2009 - Russia declares an end Thursday to its 10-year anti-terror ""operation"" in Chechnya with the rebel movement largely quashed. The end to the offensive could see the withdrawal of thousands of troops from the Muslim-majority region. April 2007 - Eighteen people are killed when a Russian-made Mi-8 military transport helicopter crashes in Chechnya. Local media reports said the helicopter was shot down by Chechen rebels during a Russian operation. September 17, 2004 - In an e-mail message posted on the Chechen rebel Web site, Kavkazcenter.com, Chechen terrorist leader Samil Basayev claims responsibility for several recent terrorist attacks in Russia, including the Moscow metro bombing, explosions aboard two passenger jets and the taking of hostages at a school in Beslan. September 5, 2004 - The Russian government has one suspect in custody. The death count stands at 335 hostages, including 156 children, along with 26 hostage-takers and 10 Russian special forces soldiers. September 3, 2004 - Russian troops end a standoff at Beslan, a Russia school in which Chechen rebels had taken several hundred students, teachers, and parents hostage. September 2, 2004 - Some Beslan hostages are released. September 1, 2004 - Armed attackers storm a school and herd at least 100 children, parents and teachers -- possibly as many as 400, later revealed to be 1,200 -- into a school in southern Russia where they threatened to kill the children. The hostage takers reportedly demanded the release of more than two dozen prisoners picked up during raids on Chechens in southern Russia in June and a Russian withdrawal all of its forces from Chechnya. Some of the hostage-takers were reportedly wearing explosives belts used in suicide bombings. August 31, 2004 - A female suicide bomber kills nine people and herself, and wounds 51 others when she detonates a bomb outside a subway station in northeastern Moscow. August 24, 2004 - Two Russian passenger planes are blown up almost simultaneously, killing 89. Federal Security Service are focusing on whether acts of terrorism brought down the jets after traces of Hexogen are found in wreckage of planes. Hexogen, a powerful military explosive, has been used by Chechen rebels in other bombings. May 2004 - Akhmad Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya, is assassinated. Kadyrov was elected Chechen president with very strong backing from the Kremlin. February 2004 - 40 are killed and 100 injured when a suicide bomber detonates a bomb on a Moscow metro train. June 2003 - A suicide attack kills 15 people at a concert in Moscow. May 2003 - 59 people are killed when two suicide bombers drive a truck full of explosives into a government complex in northern Chechnya. March 2003 - A referendum upholds the new constitution for Chechnya. October 2002 - Chechen rebels seize a theater in Moscow, and hold over 700 people hostage. Russian forces use gas to neutralize resistance; most of the rebels and 120 hostages are killed. July 2000 - Guerrillas launch five suicide bomb attacks on Russian security bases. The deadliest attack kills 54 people. February 2000 - Russian forces take control of Grozny, and the conflict begins to wind down. September 1999 - Apartment buildings in Moscow, Buynaksk and Volgodonsk are bombed, resulting in the deaths of nearly 300 people. All of the bombs used were found to contain hexogen. August 1999 - Islamist rebels launch incursions into neighboring Dagestan. Russian forces respond by moving into Chechnya in September. August 31, 1996 - A peace accord is signed and Russian troops soon withdraw. May 1996 - A cease-fire is declared, but fighting continues. Chechen rebels seize key government sites. June 1995 - Chechen rebels kill over 100 hostages in a Russian town. February 1995 - Grozny falls to Russian forces. 1994 - Russia sends 35,000-40,000 troops in to Chechnya to stop the rebellion. 1991 - Chechnya begins fighting for independence from Russia. Moscow sends troops in, but withdraws them after a few days.","Chechen separatists claim responsibility for Moscow subway attacks .

"Canberra, Australia (CNN) -- After six years of a Labor administration, including three tumultuous years of a hung parliament, Australian voters have returned to a conservative government and majority rule. Kevin Rudd, reinstalled as prime minister by his party at the 11th hour, managed to contain the size of the loss, likely to have been a wipeout under former PM Julia Gillard. New Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a long ministerial career in the former Howard Coalition government. But many questions remain about how he will handle the top job. He has been able to cruise into power primarily on Labor's infighting plus his promises to scrap the carbon tax, stop the asylum seeker boats and put the budget into better shape. Tony Abbott pledges 'competent, trustworthy' government . He inherits an electorate that is disillusioned with and disengaged from politics, after continuous campaigning since 2010 because the parliament was on a knife edge. Labor's breaking of its promise not to bring in a carbon tax and the Coalition's years of negativity have left people jaded and cynical about all politicians. Abbott had a clear ascendancy over Gillard, but the dynamics suddenly changed when Rudd - deposed by Gillard in 2010 - mounted his successful counter-coup in late June. With his popularity and some policy changes, Rudd appeared to put Labor in a very competitive. perhaps even winning, position. But during the five week campaign, the dynamics altered again. It became clear Rudd (who didn't campaign well) would not be able to overcome voters' entrenched scepticism about a government that, despite earlier successfully navigating Australia through the global financial crisis and making some worthy policy changes, had become riven with leadership division. The campaign was dominated by debate over which side was better to manage the economy; Labor's claims that Abbott had a $70 billion funding hole and would hack into health and education, and the ALP's record. The media's coverage became an issue, with Rudd trenchantly attacking Rupert Murdoch, whose empire owns 14 of Australia's 21 metro daily and Sunday newspapers. The Murdoch tabloids were quite feral, with Sydney's Daily Telegraph beginning the campaign with the headline ""Kick This Mob Out"" and one front page having a mocked up Rudd and his deputy Anthony Albanese as the bumbling Nazis from Hogan's Heroes. The new PM, while a conservative, is likely to be centrist and pragmatic. In the Howard cabinet he opposed the extreme industrial relations policy, WorkChoices, which contributed to that government's 2007 defeat. He has promised to be in the ""sensible centre"" on industrial relations. A committed Catholic, he is anti-gay marriage (despite having a gay sister) but will leave it up to his party room as to whether there should be a conscience vote for Coalition MPs on any private member's bill on the subject. Abbott says he will run a ''no surprises'' government. He has also promised not to break any election promises. This may be an impossible undertaking, but the backlash against Gillard after she -- under the pressure of minority government -- breached her ''no carbon tax'' pledge has been a lesson to all political leaders. In Saturday night's victory speech Abbott said: ''From today, I declare that Australia is under new management and that Australia is once more open for business.'' The Australian economy is growing slightly under trend and unemployment is rising. The economy remains strong, but the outlook is uncertain, with much depending on China and commodity prices. The mining investment boom is ending and the challenge now is for Australia to manage the transition to increased reliance on other sectors. One of Abbott's main difficulties will be dealing with the parliament's powerful upper house which, when the new senators take their places in July, will have a diverse collection of independent and micro party crossbenchers determining the fate of legislation. On foreign policy, Abbott is a strong U.S. alliance man. He is also a believer in the ""anglosphere,"" and was one of the leaders of the monarchist cause when in 1999 Australia had its failed republic referendum. But Abbott's focus will be heavily on Asia. He has said policy should emphasize ""Jakarta rather than Geneva"" -- a comment not only on the importance to be placed on the region, but also reflecting the Coalition's lack of faith in multilateralism. Abbott has promised an early visit to Jakarta, where he will try to persuade the reluctant Indonesians to accept his policy of turning back asylum seeker boats. Opinion: Australian parties in 'race to bottom' on asylum seeker policy . During the election campaign Abbott took a more restrained approach towards a possible strike against Syria than did Rudd, a former foreign minister and diplomat. As Abbott prepare his ministry, Labor is grappling with who is to be its new leader. Rudd will not contest. Favorite, if he decides to put his hand up, is outgoing deputy prime minister Anthony Albanese, with the other contender, outgoing education minister Bill Shorten saying he will only run as a consensus candidate. It won't be a great job to have any time soon. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- We are the most narcissistic generation in American history. And when I say ""generation"" -- I'm not pointing my finger at millennials, gen X/Yers, or baby boomers. The generation I speak of is defined by people who use social media to incessantly share information about their favorite topic: themselves. I, too, am part of this ""selfie generation."" (And if you don't know what ""selfie"" means, you're not.) We knew ""selfie"" had become emblematic of who we are when the Oxford Dictionary recently named it as 2013's word of the year. ""Narcissistic?"" you say. ""What can you mean?"" Well, the new craze of ""funeral selfies"" is a clue: People snap a self-portrait in front of the body at a wake and share it on social media. For some, these selfies may actually be a way of grieving, but for others, it's clearly about drawing attention to themselvesâ€”even away from the recently deceased. Selfies are but the tip of the iceberg for my ""selfie-centered"" generation. We have already seen how Twitter has allowed so many, including myself, to tweet their most inane thoughts: a shared delusion that everything we say is so interesting/compelling/funny that it must be immediately offered to the world. And, of course, Facebook, the granddaddy of social media, is a great way to share every mundane event in your life. We've all read Facebook status updates like: ""I'm eating potato chips"" or ""Have to use bathroom, be back soon."" Now there's also photobombing, where people sneak into the background of a photo being taken of someone else right before it's snapped. Even celebrities are photobombing. Just last week, actor Zach Braff (allegedly) photobombed a couple taking wedding photos. He promptly tweeted this, causing the photo to go viral. And I say Braff ""allegedly"" photobombed the couple because there are now apps that enable you to photobomb yourself into any picture. Some of these pictures can truly be funny, but there's no denying that many photobomb because they want to upstage the photo's intended subjects --another example of our desperate, never-ending need for attention. To be clear, I'm in no way judging others in in my ""selfie generation,"" although funeral selfies are kinda creepy. Sharing our thoughts and experiences on social media is now part of our DNA, a reflex action without a second thought. Most of us are aware of our collective self-centeredness. In fact, when I was contemplating writing this article, I tweeted out the question: ""Are we the most self-absorbed generation?"" The response was overwhelmingly: ""Yes."" But I did hear this defense often: If the generations before us had access to the same technology we do, they would have acted just like us. Hard to argue with that. Why wouldn't Neil Armstrong have taken a selfie after he stepped onto the moon with the Earth positioned behind him? (Which would've been one of the greatest selfies ever.) Are you saying no one would have photobombed pictures taken at Woodstock or at anti-Vietnam war rallies? Or that Elvis wouldn't have tweeted photos of himself wearing a new sequin-studded jumpsuit that would have quickly gone viral? This is who we are and there's no chance of going back. In fact, future technological advancements will undoubtedly make it even easier for us to share information about ourselves in ways we can't imagine now. But the legacy of our ""selfie generation"" must be more than just photobombing a friend's picture or gloating when one of our tweets is retweeted to infinity. Our generation has an opportunity with these social media platforms to raise awareness about issues we personally believe need to be addressed. It can be as simple as taking a selfie as you walk past a soup kitchenâ€”or better yet, help out in one-- and sharing it on social media. Maybe that will inspire others to volunteer at one or at least make a donation. Why not use a photobomb app to insert yourself into an image of an impoverished child to bring attention to the 16 million children in the United States who live below the poverty line? Or tweet a photo of a U.S. military veteran to raise awareness about the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day or the wounded veterans who still need our support. The list of issues, from countering domestic violence to the bloodshed in Syria, goes on and on. Let's use our love for sharing information about ourselves to also share information about the issues for which we feel passionate concern, especially during this holiday season. OK, be self-absorbed, but be self-absorbed for a cause. To me, that's the good kind of self-centered.

"Editor's Note: William Frist, the former Republican majority leader of the U.S. Senate, is a physician. He was elected to represent Tennessee in the Senate in 1994 and served two terms before deciding not to run for re-election in 2006. Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist says it's good that Obama and Biden are members of the Senate. NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- Now is the time for a new beginning. And how it is approached may well turn on the often overlooked fact that both the president-elect and the vice president-elect are products of the U. S. Senate. America shines at her best in times of challenge, and never in my adult life have we seen more challenge coming from more dimensions. I encourage Republicans to rally behind this president-elect and openly express support for the call for change throughout our legislative and executive branches. I encourage Democrats not to repeat the missteps made by Republicans by excluding thoughtful debate. And I encourage the American people to stay involved with the intensity manifested by heightened participation in the democratic process. My teaching on the Princeton campus last year revealed to me an explosion of energizing interest in ""the system"" and how to make it better from within -- very different from when I was there 38 years ago and the same activism was channeled toward tearing it down. The wounds of the campaign are not as deep or angry as the media portray. For many, there is disappointment, and this must be consoled with time and discussion; for more, there is a sense of hope and quiet optimism that fresh ideas and new faces and commitment to collaboration can, if handled with care and grace, nurture a new prosperity. Having served in the U.S. Senate, I am proud that that body, historically avoided as a source of presidential leadership, produced three of the four candidates and now the president and vice president. The Senate is a strange animal. Unlike the House, it is weighted to give the minority party exceptional power. And that's why we have these super-majority (and, to the public, usually hard to fathom!) thresholds like cloture and the filibuster. Both of our new leaders are creatures of this body, a body that our founding fathers deliberately elevated to one of deliberation and discussion and unlimited debate and enhanced minority power. That unique Senate legislative experience of the president- and vice-president-elect -- with the understanding it brings both to lead on principle but govern with compromise and to respect uniquely the minority's participation -- stations them ideally for a time when the American people expect their government to work together to aggressively attack the problems that face us. My former colleague John McCain returns to the Senate to participate with a style that fits the time. What made my life tough at times as leader -- his working on his own agenda, working almost obsessively across the aisle, putting principle before party and defending through passionate debate his conservative views -- is what can make him an effective force in shaping the change that these elections spoke so loudly to. And to the president-elect, what an opportunity! Times are tough, but the people have rallied to your call. You have the followers; you have the believers; even your loudest critics recognize that you are endowed with leadership talents that are precious. To move the nation forward, keep listening to the American people. Be straight with them, and don't over-promise. Fill the gaps where you lack experience with the brightest minds with the highest values. iReport.com: Share your message for Obama . And finally, though this may appear a bit self-serving, the doctor in me is shouting out not to forget an issue that has been driven to the background by the credit markets, job losses and threats overseas: health care. Ever-rising health costs drive people to the ranks of uninsured. The 15 million hard-core uninsured need your immediate attention. There is nothing more intimate or more personal to any of us than the health of our loved ones. Don't let it slip to the back burner. So, even in these tough and depressing times defined by an economic crisis that will -- yes, will -- have an end, I am pretty excited about the future. Let's all play our part as citizens of the greatest and freest country in the world.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A famous composer celebrated as a ""Japanese Beethoven"" for creating hit symphonies despite his deafness has been exposed as a fraud, after confessing another musician wrote his most acclaimed works. And in a surprise twist, the man who says he was the ghost-writer of the works, Takashi Niigaki, claimed in a press conference Thursday that he did not believe the composer was deaf at all. ""I've never felt he was deaf ever since we met,"" said Niigaki. ""We carry on normal conversations."" Niigaki told reporters in Tokyo that over the past 18 years he had been paid about 7 million yen (about $69,000) to write more than 20 pieces to order for popular classical composer Mamoru Samuragochi. Niigaki, a teacher at the prestigious Toho Gakuen School of Music, said that at no stage did he believe Samuragochi was deaf, as the composer conversed with him normally, and provided critiques on the music he contracted him to write over the years. ""At first he acted to me also as if he had suffered hearing loss, but he stopped doing so eventually,"" said Niigaki. ""Later I found out that he cannot even write musical scores."" Samuragochi is hailed as an inspirational genius in Japan for having created immensely popular classical symphonies and video game scores, despite reportedly having been completely deaf for 15 years. He claimed to rely on his perfect pitch to compose after losing his hearing, telling TIME magazine in a 2001 profile that ""if you trust your inner sense of sound, you create something that is truer. It is like communicating from the heart. Losing my hearing was a gift from God."" Niigaki said he had entered into the arrangement with Samuragochi lightheartedly, but subsequently grew concerned about the deception, and told Samuragochi he wanted out. But he said Samuragochi told him he would commit suicide if he stopped composing for him. Niigaki said he considered himself guilty of duping the public and wanted to come clean. ""I am an accomplice of Samuragochi because I continued composing just as he demanded, although I knew he was deceiving people,"" he said. ""I can't fool the people any more."" The office for Samuragochi's lawyers, Kazushi Orimoto and Mizuki Wakamatsu, told CNN they were unable to respond to Niigaki's claims. But when approached by a reporter for Nippon Television, Orimoto said that the firm believed Samuragochi was indeed deaf, and had a government-issued certificate which confirmed his hearing impairment. Earlier, they had issued a statement on behalf of Samuragochi, in which he apologized for having ""betrayed fans"" by having commissioned another composer to write his scores for years. The confession is understood to have been prompted by Niigaki's impending exposure of the fraud in a tell-all interview with a Japanese news magazine. In the statement, Samuragochi claimed he provided the broader ideas for the works, while the collaborator had produced the finished scores. WATCH: Iconic Japanese composer admits to hoax . The collaborator had his own reasons for not identifying himself as a creator of the work, read the statement, so Samuragochi presented the work as a solo creation. The lawyers' statement said that while their client ""should offer a direct apology to his fans,"" he was too ""mentally disturbed"" by the revelations to express himself properly. The 50-year-old composer, who also spells his name Samuragoch, came to prominence for his ambitious symphonic soundtracks for popular video games, including ""Resident Evil."" His most popular work, ""Symphony No 1, Hiroshima,"" dedicated to the victims of the 1945 atomic blast, became an anthem of Japanese resilience in the wake of the 2011 tsunami, after it was featured in documentary showing the composer traveling to the disaster zone. His confession prompted apologies from NHK, the public broadcaster which aired the documentary, and his record label. ""We were shocked by the news and deeply infuriated,"" said a statement from Nippon Columbia Co., Samuragochi's label, adding that the composer had previously assured the company that he was the creator of the works. Daisuke Takahashi, an Olympic bronze medalist figure skater who is planning to skate to one of the works in Sochi, has also become drawn in to the saga. He issued a statement saying he had been unaware that Samuragochi was not the composer of the work, but intended to use the composition regardless. Niigaki acknowledged he had wavered over the timing of his revelations due to the impact it may have on Takahashi's Olympic preparations, but decided to proceed anyway. The potential disturbance to Takahashi's Sochi ambitions was a major talking point on social media, with many users complaining about the timing. Others noted that Samuragochi had built an irresistible ""modern Beethoven"" myth around himself that the public had lapped up. ""I wonder how many people truly love his music?"" asked Twitter user @kenichiromogi.","Japanese composer Mamoru Samuragochi says another person wrote his music .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Government officials should depict terrorists ""as the dangerous cult leaders they are"" and avoid words that aggrandize them, like ""jihadists,"" ""Islamic terrorists,"" ""Islamists"" and ""holy warriors,"" the Department of Homeland Security says in a paper released Friday. A study says Muslims in America prefer the designation ""mainstream"" over ""moderate."" ""Words matter,"" the agency says in the paper, which also suggests avoiding the term ""moderate Muslims,"" a characterization that annoys many Muslims because it implies that they are tepid in the practice of their faith. ""Mainstream,"" ""ordinary"" and ""traditional"" better reflect the broader Muslim American community, it says. Dan Sutherland, head of the agency's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and author of the paper, said the paper is a recognition that words can help the government achieve its strategic goals. Sutherland said he is starting to see results, with government officials using the term ""mainstream Muslims"" in meetings. Sutherland's nine-page paper says the government should be careful not to demonize all Muslims or the Islamic faith or depict the United States as being at war with Islam. ""The terminology the [government] uses should convey the magnitude of the threat we face, but also avoid inflating the religious bases and glamorous appeal of the extremists' ideology,"" the paper says. The paper emphasizes that the recommendations do not constitute official government policy. Instead, they represent guidance from influential Muslim leaders who met with Homeland Secretary Michael Chertoff in May 2007 to discuss ways that the Muslim community can help the department prevent the violent radicalization of Muslims. The paper suggests that government officials may want to avoid using theological terminology altogether. ""Islamic law and terms come with a particular context, which may not always be apparent,"" the paper says. ""It is one thing for a Muslim leader to use a particular term; an American official may simply not have the religious authority to be taken seriously, even when using terms appropriately."" The paper, titled ""Terminology to Define the Terrorists: Recommendations from American Muslims,"" was designated ""For Official Use Only"" and distributed internally in January. Sutherland said the paper was not released publicly because the Department of Homeland Security did not want Muslim leaders to believe their meeting was an attempt to garner publicity. But the document was widely distributed in government and was published in late April by The Associated Press, ""The Investigative Project on Terrorism"" and others. A story about the terminology concerns on the ""Jihad Watch"" Web site was followed by dozens of comments, most critical of the suggestions. ""Every day, I read another story which angers me. This whitewash of Islam, by our highest-ranking officials is unacceptable!"" one commenter said. The paper is silent on one term frequently used by some people at the highest level of U.S. government but scorned by others: ""War on Terror."" Sutherland said there is not a consensus on the term. Some argue that ""war"" is too grandiose and adds legitimacy to the other side, because there are two legitimate sides to wars. ""We really face a legitimate threat and we need to guard against complacency,"" Sutherland said, explaining the rationale supporting the use of the term.","Department of Homeland Security advises against words that aggrandize terrorists .

"Washington (CNN) -- The news that Abu Yahya al-Libi, the No.2 leader of al Qaeda, is now confirmed to have been killed in a CIA drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region along the border with Afghanistan further underlines that the terrorist group that launched the 9/11 attacks is now more or less out of business. Under President Barack Obama, CIA drone strikes have killed 15 of the most important players in al Qaeda, according to a count maintained by the New America Foundation (a nonpartisan think tank where I am a director). Similarly, President George W. Bush also authorized drone strikes that killed 16 important al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan while he was in office. As a result, according to senior U.S. counterterrorism officials, there now remains only one leader of any consequence in al Qaeda and that is Ayman al-Zawahiri, the tetchy Egyptian surgeon who became the head of the group following the death of its founder, Osama bin Laden, in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan in May 2011. Zawahiri, presumably, is keenly aware of the fate of so many of his longtime colleagues in al Qaeda. He will be expending considerable energy not to end up on the business end of a missile fired by a CIA drone if he, too, is hiding in the Pakistani tribal regions where the drone strikes have been concentrated. Meanwhile, Zawahiri faces an almost impossible task to follow through on al Qaeda's main mission: attacking the United States, or failing that, one of its close allies. Al Qaeda hasn't conducted a successful attack in the West since the bombings on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005, and of course, the group hasn't succeeded in attacking the United States for more than a decade. There are, however, al Qaeda's regional affiliates still to contend with. The most virulent of those is the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It was AQAP that tried to bring down Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 using a Nigerian recruit who had secreted a hard-to-detect bomb in his underwear, and it was AQAP that smuggled bombs in printer cartridges onto cargo planes bound for the U.S. in October 2010. Last month came news that a spy had penetrated AQAP and had retrieved a new generation of underwear bomb that the group's bomb maker had apparently recently designed to bring down a commercial jet. But all of AQAP's plots to bring down planes have had one thing in common: They failed. Some might say that that while al Qaeda the organization may be basically dead, its ideology continues to thrive and to inspire ""lone wolves"" to attack the United States. In fact, lone wolves inspired by jihadist ideology have managed to kill a total of 17 Americans in the United States since 9/11, according to a tally maintained by the New America Foundation. Meanwhile, 54 Americans are reported to be killed every year by lightning, according to the National Weather Service.

"(CNN) -- Is Whitney Houston a hero? New Jersey citizens -- and Whitney fans and haters alike -- have been debating this question since Gov. Chris Christie announced he would fly the state's flags at half-staff for the singer Saturday as mourners attend her funeral in Newark, New Jersey. Christie's decision has been widely criticized -- 77% of USA Today readers called it ""inappropriate"" in one informal and unscientific poll. But he has strongly defended the order, hailing Houston as ""a daughter of New Jersey"" who should be honored for her ""cultural contributions."" For decisions like this, there is a federal ""Flag Code,"" which stipulates only that the flag be flown at half-staff to honor deaths of certain public officials, adding that governors can honor members of the government or military from their state. Opinion: Whitney Houston's glorious voice . But regardless of what the official code says, the standards around flag-flying have been fuzzy for years. Most of Christie's prior orders to lower the flag have honored service members killed in combat, yet he issued the same order after the death of Clarence Clemons, the saxophonist for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. Frank Sinatra received the honor years earlier. So there's some precedent here for musicians, and Houston's astronomical album sales certainly make the case for her cultural influence. Her ascent from humble Garden State roots to pop superstardom offers a source of pride for Christie and other New Jerseyites. And flying a flag at half-staff could provide a form of collective mourning, a way to rally a community around things they share -- like a hometown hero whose music touched countless people throughout the state and around the world. Is all that enough to merit an honor usually reserved for people who've performed tremendous services -- and made incomparable sacrifices -- for their country? True, Houston's rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is by far the most acclaimed (and best-selling) recording of the national anthem by a pop singer. But should that enter her into the ranks of American heroes? Indeed, giving this honor to Houston seems to illustrate what psychologists Zeno Franco and Philip Zimbardo have called our increasingly ""watered-down"" view of heroism. Franco and Zimbardo argue that we pay a cultural price when we praise athletes and celebrities as ""heroes"": We lose sight of the strong moral qualities that should define heroism, and we lose touch with what it takes to nurture more demanding forms of heroism. ""By diminishing the ideal of heroism,"" they write, ""we keep ourselves from confronting the older, more demanding forms of this ideal. We do not have to challenge ourselves to see if, when faced with a situation that called for courage, we would meet that test."" Through their research, Franco and Zimbardo have come up with their own criteria for what constitutes a hero. For one thing, heroism entails some type of quest, for example to save a life or to uphold a principle. It also involves real sacrifice or risk, including a risk of one's own life. Who meets these standards? The 30 service members for whom Christie has lowered the flag clearly do. Whitney Houston clearly does not. In fact, the sad truth is that for more than a decade, Whitney Houston sat on the end of the moral spectrum opposite from presidents and war heroes. Her struggles with drug addiction and her troubled marriage to Bobby Brown tarnished her public image. She became an object of scorn and derision. And, ultimately, I suspect that this is part of the reason we're seeing such effusive tributes to her now. Yes, some critics of Christie's half-staff decision say it sends the wrong message to give this level of recognition to someone with a history of substance abuse. But I can't shake the feeling that the official, government-sanctioned respect Houston is getting in her death is on some level a reaction to all the insults she endured in her life. When Houston's life and voice fell apart, many of her onetime fans and longtime critics showed little sympathy. The flag flying at half-staff feels like a way not just to honor her virtues as an artist, but to show remorse for how she was treated as a person. ""What I would say to everybody is, 'There but for the grace of God go I,'"" Christie said. But I don't remember any politician embracing her as ""New Jersey's daughter"" after she did her embarrassing ""crack is wack"" interview with Diane Sawyer, after she checked into rehab, or after Brown was charged with physically abusing her. In that light, a flag flying at half-staff seems more like an apology than an honor -- an act of contrition for spurning a women who suffered addiction and abuse. Behind the tributes lies guilt and, too late, some compassion. Christie says he believes people are questioning his decision because of Houston's drug problems. But maybe it's partly because of her troubles, not in spite of them, that she's being honored. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A prison inmate who murdered a Maryland teen was killed Sunday after he shot three guards inside an Israeli prison, officials said. Samuel Sheinbein, who fled the United States for Israel after the 1997 killing, was shot Sunday evening by police special forces and guards at Rimonim Prison, Israel Prison Service spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said. Sheinbein, 34, shot at the guards from inside the prison's restrooms, Weizman said. Two of them were seriously wounded, and the third sustained minor injuries, she said. It was unclear how he got the weapon. Sheinbein, a citizen of Israel and the United States, pleaded guilty to murder in 1999 in the gruesome killing of Alfredo Tello Jr. Prosecutors accused Sheinbein and accomplice Aaron Needle of picking up Tello from work in Silver Spring, Maryland, and deciding to kill him. They strangled him with a rope, struck him on the head with a blunt object and slashed him. Two days later, prosecutors said, they dismembered the victim and burned his body. After fleeing to Israel, Sheinbein admitted to the dismemberment and burning of the victim. He said Needle, who was arrested in the murder but hanged himself in jail, was the killer. The Israeli Supreme Court had ruled that Sheinbein could not be extradited to the United States.","Convicted murderer Samuel Sheinbein is killed in a prison shooting .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Relegation"" is a word that is laced with horror for many football fans in European and Asian nations -- yet for others it remains a complete mystery. West Bromwich-Albion fans show their support as the club was relegated from the Premier League on Sunday . The latest victim of the relegation sword is English Premier League team West Bromwich-Albion. After a 2-0 loss to Liverpool on Sunday, West Brom faces a drop to the division below. Promotion/relegation systems similar to the English Premier League's model work in many football leagues around the world, and have allowed dreams to come true for many aspirants, while they have also crushed the hopes and futures of others on the decline. While these systems have been long-running in Europe; in the U.S. -- the home of the meritocracy -- there is still no promotion or relegation to or from the top-flight Major League Soccer (MLS) competition. This is the case for the many sports in the U.S., as well as competitions in Canada and Australia. For those who have not experienced promotion/relegation systems, they can appear slightly confusing. For people who do know of the concept, you may be unaware there are multiple different models operating in the world's top leagues. The basic principle of the system is to transfer teams between divisions based on merit -- in order to allow fluidity between the amateur leagues and the very top of the professional game. Do you think promotion/relegation systems are a good or bad idea? Share your thoughts in the Sound Off box below. In England's Premier League, for example, at the end of each season when competition points have been accrued, the three bottom-ranked teams will be relegated (demoted) to the level below (in England's case the second-tier Championship). Meanwhile, the top teams from the Championship will be promoted up to the Premier League to fill the places of the relegated sides. This promotion system has two aspects. The top two teams are automatically promoted, while the third-to-sixth placed sides play-off for the third promotion spot. In Spain's La Liga and Ligue 1 in France the system is simpler with the bottom three and top three teams automatically relegated and promoted respectively. Germany's Bundesliga has two teams going up and down, with a play-off match between the third-bottom and third-top team from the first and second divisions. Italy's Serie A has a similar structure to England, however, if the third-placed team in the second-tier has a ten point or greater gap on their nearest rival, then they automatically go up. So, why don't the U.S. have such a system? According to MLS Commissioner Don Garber the competition currently lacks the size and power to take on promotion/relegation. ""Unfortunately our country does not have the infrastructure to support promotion/relegation at this time. We'll continue to monitor this, but it will likely be at least 10 years before promotion/relegation could be considered,"" Garber said in a response to the question on the MLS web site. Many of the clubs in the United Soccer Leagues (which is the next competition below the MLS), lack the same fan-base and infrastructure that MLS clubs possess. For the relegated West Brom side which faces next season in the second-tier competition, their plight doesn't necessarily mean complete club failure. Dan Jones, partner in the Sport Business group at accountancy firm Deloitte, told CNN that relegated Premier League clubs received a ""parachute payment"" of $18 million (£12m) for each of the next two seasons -- which in many cases was enough to help them bounce back up to the top-tier. Jones said the relegation certainly didn't condemn them to financial failure either. ""West Brom consistently post one of the healthiest operating profits in English football,"" he said.","Promotion/relegation systems are used in football leagues around the globe .
The method transfers teams between divisions depending on performance .
The U.S. and Australia are two major countries that don't use relegation ."
"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean investigator said Friday that an ""external explosion"" was the most likely cause of the mysterious sinking of a naval ship in which 46 South Korean sailors were lost in tense waters off the North Korean coast. ""There is a higher possibility of an external rather than an internal explosion,"" Yoon Duk-yong, the co-head of a government-appointed team to investigate the March 26 sinking of the corvette Cheonan, said Friday in a televised press conference. The Cheonan's stern section, where the missing sailors were believed to have been trapped, was raised from the Yellow Sea bottom Thursday after a salvage operation that was made both risky and difficult by low underwater visibility and strong currents. The bow section is expected to be salvaged next week. Of the Cheonan's 104-man crew, 58 men were rescued from the sea on the night of the explosion. Thirty-eight bodies have so far been recovered; eight remain missing. Yoon's comment was based on a preliminary investigation of the stern wreckage. He added, however, that it was necessary ""to make a detailed analysis, leaving all possibilities open."" President Lee Myung-bak has demanded a transparent probe into the sinking, which Defense Minister Kim Tae-young on Friday called ""a grave national security incident."" While Seoul has avoided blaming North Korea, Kim has said that a sea mine or torpedo appear the most likely causes. The media has been rife with speculation -- theories aired range from an internal boiler explosion to a North Korean naval special forces attack. On Thursday, Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based radio station that maintains covert contacts north of the border, announced that Northern authorities are calling the Cheonan sinking ""self-inflicted."" North Korea's state-run media have been silent on the issue, and both South Korean and U.S. forces in South Korea say they have not detected any unusual moves by the armed forces of the hard-line state. However, the Cheonan went down close to the disputed inter-Korean sea border, off which fatal naval skirmishes took place in 1999 and 2002. If forensic evidence does point to North Korean involvement, it is unclear what moves South Korea could take against a country that has artillery ranged in on Seoul, and which is believed to possess at least six nuclear devices.. The United States declined to strike militarily against North Korea when the spyship USS Pueblo was seized in international waters off North Korea in 1968. Nor did South Korea retaliate in 2002, when three Southern sailors were killed and their patrol boat sunk in a North Korean attack on the same day that South Korea was playing its last match of the World Cup.","South Korean investigators say naval ship was sunk by external blast .

"(CNN) -- After spending a total of seven months in custody, the Tennessee woman who fatally shot her preacher husband in the back was released on Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN. Holding baby Breanna, Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew. In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia. Mary Winkler, a 33-year-old mother of three girls, was freed from a Tennessee mental health facility where she was treated for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, lawyer Steve Farese said. ""She is out,"" Farese said. Farese said his client will not talk to the news media because she continues to wage a legal battle to win custody of her girls and faces a $2 million civil suit filed by the parents of her slain husband, Matthew Winkler. Except for her oldest daughter's brief testimony at her trial, Winkler hasn't seen her children in a year, the lawyer said. Winkler will return to work at the dry cleaners in McMinnville, Tennessee, where she worked before the trial, Farese said. She is living with friends. Winkler served about five months in county jail as she awaited trial, then spent two months undergoing therapy at the mental health facility following her conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Winkler never denied shooting her husband, Matthew, the popular new preacher at the Fourth Street Church of Christ in Selmer, a town of 4,500 people about 80 miles east of Memphis. On March 22, 2006, church elders found his body -- with a shotgun wound to the back -- in the bedroom of the parsonage after he failed to show up for an evening service. His wife was arrested the next day with the couple's three young daughters in Orange Beach, Alabama, on the Gulf coast. Mary Winkler was charged with murder, which could have sent her to prison for up to 60 years, but a jury found her guilty of voluntary manslaughter following an emotional trial in which she testified about suffering years of verbal and physical abuse. In a statement to police after her arrest, Winkler said she didn't recall pulling the trigger .She said she apologized and wiped the blood that bubbled from her dying husband's lips as he asked,  ""Why?"" Prosecutors and Matthew Winkler's family members said he was a good husband and father. But on the stand, Mary Winkler described a hellish 10-year marriage during which, she said, her husband struck her, screamed at her, criticized her and blamed her when things went wrong. She said he made her watch pornography and wear ""slutty"" costumes for sex, and that he forced her to submit to sex acts that made her uncomfortable. She testified she pointed the shotgun at her husband during an argument to force him to talk through their problems, and ""something went off."" A defense psychologist testified that she was depressed and showed classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Mary Winkler initially received a three-year sentence in June. But Circuit Court Judge J. Weber McCraw required that she serve only 210 days, and allowed her to serve the rest of the time on probation. She also received credit for five months she spent behind bars awaiting trial, which left only about 60 days to her sentence. McCraw ruled she could serve the time in a mental health facility. Since Mary Winkler's arrest, the couple's three children have been cared for by Matthew Winkler's parents, who have filed court papers seeking to terminate her parental rights.

"(CNN) -- The January monthly jobs report numbers released by the federal government could at best be described as tepid, adding to an already gloomy picture of the state of the economy for America's workers. And that's just the latest cloud in an increasingly dark forecast for the middle class. In New York, the reliably middle-class retailer Loehmann's is shutting its doors and will be replaced by the high-end store Barneys. Middle-class restaurants such as Red Lobster are struggling while the high-end, artisanal foodie scene is still going strong. General Electric reports that sales for its most expensive appliances are increasing while sales for midrange models are plummeting. Taken as a whole, these developments are about more than our consumption, reflecting the profound economic inequality in America today. Our new economic reality is a final nail in the coffin of conservative economics. Supply-side economics was developed in the 1970s as a direct response to the Keynesian analysis dominant in the decades since the Great Depression. The organizing principle for conservative fiscal policy in the 40 years since, supply-side economics holds that the best way to stimulate economic growth is by lessening obstacles that inhibit people or companies from supplying goods or services. Conservatives supply-siders argue that if we cut taxes and reduce regulations for business and those who own businesses (i.e., the rich), they'll invest more in producing goods and therefore increase employment. Also more supply means lower prices, which conservatives also believe is good for growth. But if it wasn't bad enough that decades of supply-side deregulation and tax cuts had created levels of economic inequality not seen in America since the 1920s, as a New York Times report now suggests, not only did supply-side economics fail to spur demand but it reduced and stratified demand to match patterns of inequality more broadly. The top marginal tax rate, which was raised to 79% at the time of the New Deal and was 91% under Eisenhower, was cut to 70% under Nixon, then 50% under Reagan, then an abysmally low 35% under George W. Bush. According to supply-side theory, these and other extreme tax cuts for big business and the rich should have led to an extreme flourishing of investment in business, including creating more jobs that would, metaphorically speaking, lift all boats. Instead the rich pocketed much of those tax cuts, adding to their net worth and spending more heavily on luxury goods. The good news is that The New York Times article confirms that consumer demand -- not business-side supply -- is the essential driving force in our economy, with that demand directing how businesses invest in producing goods and services. The bad news is that, thanks to failed supply-side economics, we increasingly have only two kinds of demand in America -- for cheap mass-market goods and for incredibly pricey high-end commodities. Conservative economics did not lift all boats. Middle-class jobs lost in the recession have been disproportionately replaced with low-wage jobs in the recovery. Poverty is on the rise. And yet yacht sales are buoyant. The number and cost of luxury yachts sold in America is steadily rising. And don't expect those yachts to ""trickle-down"" magically and create housing for the millions of Americans who faced foreclosures in the last several years. According to conservative economic theory, increased corporate profits and income for the top 1% should have translated directly into higher wages for everyone else. But the fact is even though worker productivity is up in America, wages for most people have either stagnated or declined. Ask any conservative thinker or leader to explain this discrepancy. They simply can't. Because their entire economic worldview has backfired and hurt the middle class. One might think in the face of overwhelming evidence that their economic theories simply don't work, conservatives would try something new. Like supporting an increase in the federal minimum wage or temporarily expanding unemployment benefits or investing federal dollars (at currently ridiculously low borrowing rates) to rebuild infrastructure while creating jobs -- all of which puts money in folks' pockets and spurs demand. Which, in turn, drives up economic growth and increases tax revenue. But no. Leading Republicans still insist that the answer to America's economic problems is more tax cuts and fewer regulations on business -- in other words, precisely more of what created extreme inequality and stifled economic demand in the first place. Incidentally, consumption as a whole isn't down. In fact, even though average incomes are flat, consumption in general has risen. And yet to the extent that ordinary Americans continue to fuel their consumption with more debt and reduced rates of savings -- and to the extent that structural inequalities in the economy remain unaddressed -- their spending is unsustainable. Meanwhile, a dollar in the hand of a billionaire doesn't create the same economic demand as a dollar in the hand of someone else -- because the rich are more likely to save, not spend, their money. So behind the sad, immediate tale of disappointing job growth and the disappearing middle-class market for goods and services is the profoundly unsettling reality that the pursuit of supply-side economics was not only wrong but may have fundamentally broken our economy -- and undermined any potential for diversely driven demand and broadly shared prosperity. Congratulations, conservatives. This may not be the economy you wanted, but it's the economy your policies have definitely created. No refunds. No exchanges.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- It's big, bold and oh so Abu Dhabi -- a city far from unfamiliar with ostentatious developments. Rising up from the turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf, Saadiyat Island is arguably one of the grandest residential and cultural projects in the works anywhere in the world today. The idyllic resort will be home to three major museums, a performing arts center as well as hold space for 150,000 residents when it is completed by 2020. Construction on the Louvre Abu Dhabi -- named as the Rain of Light by architect Jean Nouvel -- is going on around the clock with the aim of being open by December 2015. The Guggenheim and the Zayed National Museum will soon follow. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties? For the new residents of Saadiyat, many of whom are from outside the UAE, this ambitious development and its cultural accoutrements is like little they have experienced before. ""It was so nice coming from England where everything has been going backwards to be part of something that was sort of up and coming and forward thinking,"" said early resident, Sue Bell. As to be expected, however, living amidst such refined institutions and luxurious facilities doesn't come cheap. Saadiyat is being positioned by developers TDIC as a luxury destination for those with deep pockets. A seven bedroom property comes in at a cool $7.5 million while the entry point for a villa is about $1.25 million. The St Regis villas and apartments, part of a vast hotel complex, are already fully occupied. TDIC says other completed zones are at 90% capacity with most buyers choosing to take up residence in their new accommodation rather than snapping up the property as an investment and basing themselves elsewhere. See also: Take a look at London's insane luxury basements . ""The thing about the people who buy in Saadiyat, or if you want to call them investors, I can tell you that more than 80% of the people who bought on Saadiyat are end users,"" said Carlos-Antonio Wakim chief development officer at TDIC. To further entice families, TDIC is setting up a full range of educational options including offshoots of the renowned Cranleigh boarding school and a New York University campus. The headmaster at Cranleigh, Brendan Law, believes even though the island is a greenfield project, it squares with the century and a half old history of the English school. ""A motto was created for Cranleigh called 'escuto rubu' which is Latin for from culture comes strength,"" Law said. ""We are standing on the edge of the cultural district here in fact on the gateway of the cultural district. I don't think a school and a district could be better suited for one another than that."" But while every effort has been made to make new arrivals in the neighborhood welcome, the treatment of construction workers on the project has received unwanted scrutiny.

Saadiyat remains on the radar of human rights groups who contend there are still sizable gaps in fair in labor practices at the estimated $27 billion project.

TDIC however point to an independent report by Price Waterhouse Coopers which acknowledges some flaws by contractors, but cited progress at the same time. ""Wherever we can improve we will not be late in improving,"" said Wakim. ""This is the TDIC's position.""","Saadiyat Island is a giant residential and cultural resort project in Abu Dhabi .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Southern California motorists honked their horns cheerfully as authorities reopened 10 miles of the nation's busiest highway ahead of schedule late Sunday night. The latest phase in a massive project that led to the weekend closure of a large swath of Interstate 405 ended hours ahead of the Monday morning commute. Southern California officials had dubbed the project ""Carmageddon II."" But the nightmare traffic tie-ups that prompted the fittingly Hollywood-worthy name did not materialize as motorists either stayed home or chose alternate routes. California Highway Patrol said it cited three people who tried to enter the closed section of the freeway early Sunday. But overall, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared the project a ""resounding success.""

Violations listed in the initial health inspection included no hand-washing facility or soap in the food-prep area, hot and cold items held at improper temperatures, eating or drinking in the food-prep area and tobacco use, all of which qualify as ""critical"" violations, according to the records.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Pixies have just played their signature anthem, ""Where is My Mind."" As the crowd begs for an encore, Black Francis stands alone at center stage, an uncharacteristic grin spread across his usually enigmatic features. Guitarist Joey Santiago and drummer David Lovering are already heading for the wings, while their new touring bassist, Kim Shattuck, slips into the crowd, eager to shake hands with rabid fans. The Pixies are in the midst of headlining a series of sold-out club dates and festival appearances in support of ""EP-1,"" their first collection of new music in 22 years. It's also their first tour without original bassist Kim Deal, whose departure from the quartet was announced in June. Despite some tensions in the past, her decision blindsided her bandmates. Photos: A short history of punk . ""She just said, 'I'm leaving on the next flight tomorrow,' "" recalls Charles Thompson IV, aka Black Francis. ""And so there was nothing really to say. We just said, 'OK.' It was just as simple and as basic as that."" And so America's beloved indie rock band embarked on a new chapter of its storied career. Bursting out of the Boston underground in the late '80s with an irresistible yin-yang of brash guitars and dreamy popscapes, the Pixies imploded before they could hit the big time -- but not before laying the sonic groundwork for such alternative acts as Nirvana and Radiohead. With great fanfare, the Pixies reunited in 2004 for a world tour -- a triumphant victory lap that somehow stretched into a whopping seven-year run. Aging hipsters and musically precocious twentysomethings welcomed the return of ""Debaser,"" ""Here Comes Your Man"" and other favorites, but it also left them yearning for fresh material. They got it with ""Bagboy,"" a surprise single that bombarded unsuspecting inboxes as a free download in late June. In early September, four additional songs hit the Web, this time in a package generically titled ""EP-1."" And there's more on the way. CNN gets the backstory in a rooftop conversation with Thompson, Santiago and Lovering before a recent show in Los Angeles. They share how they turned Santiago's hotel room into a secret recording studio, open up about the departure of Kim Deal and give a progress report on her replacement, Kim Shattuck (from the Los Angeles pop-punk trio The Muffs). CNN: Ever since your 2004 reunion, fans were hoping for some new music. Rumor has it that was kicked into gear when the Pixies were in Canada headlining at a casino, and didn't want to be thought of as an oldies act. David Lovering: In Canada, those are the venues. It's not that we became a casino band, but it was almost equating us to that. Blue Oyster Cult, oh no! So that was just a good impetus to think, ""OK, we've got to do something."" CNN: When the new music came out on your website, did you read the comments? Charles Thompson (aka ""Black Francis""): I think I read the comments. Our Twitter feed is probably where I get most of my online satisfaction, as far as people blogging or commenting about things. Joey Santiago: I look at the comments. I like the negative ones. It's like when I'm buying Amazon stuff. I look at the negative reviews. But they're just judging a book by its cover, really -- that a member is gone, and what's that got to do with ""Bagboy?"" CNN: Was Kim Deal's leaving unexpected? Lovering: It was a shock, because she was along on the journey with us. Santiago: She was enthusiastic, and then that bomb hit one day. CNN: Did she tell you in person? Thompson: Yeah. We used to go to get a coffee in the village, the little town that we were recording near. Everyone would go there looking for their coffee, so inevitably, one, or two, or three or four band members would be there. We were there, and she just said, ""I'm leaving on the next flight tomorrow."" And so, you know, there was nothing really to say. We just said, ""OK."" It was just as simple and as basic as that. CNN: Did she give a reason, or indicate that she might be back at some point? Thompson: I think when someone makes a big decision like that, it takes a lot of guts to kind of tell the people that you have to tell face-to-face, which is what she did. I know that when the band broke up the first time around, I sort of broke up the band, but I didn't have the guts to do that. I had to send a message and hope for the best, because it feels like a confrontation, or you feel embarrassed, or you don't want to let people down, you know what I mean? You know they're going to be disappointed, so I think it probably took a lot of guts for her to personally go, ""I'm out,"" and not just do it in an email. CNN: Has she heard the new music? Lovering: I don't know. CNN: Having a female presence in the band has been an important part of the Pixies. Thompson: It's a nice thing to have a yin and a yang in certain situations. It's always been a part of the way we present our music, and I think people like it. It puts a lot of things into perspective having both sexes represented on stage. It's just a totally different dynamic -- not only in terms of what the band is doing, but the way people receive it. CNN: ""Indie Cindy"" is a song on the new EP. Is it an ode to the indie fans out there, or anxiety over whether they'll accept the new material? Thompson: There's that little punk rock girl that's out there. She's very representative of a music fan, especially if you're a boy. If you're a guy, that punk rock girl is kind of like, ""Aww, the little cute punk rock girl with all her make-up, and all her stuff on, going to the show."" There's something about it that is very adorable. You fall in love with those people. CNN: Charles, you and Joey went back to the old neighborhood and set up a recording studio in Joey's hotel in Massachusetts. Thompson: In western Massachusetts, in the Northampton-Amherst area where Joey and I first met in college. CNN: Was there some residual magic in the old neighborhood? Thompson: Probably. It's probably not magic, but there are a lot of real things that affect life, whether it's a full moon, or whether it's what the air is like, or what the soil is like somewhere, what the people are like in a particular area. There are a lot of things that you kind of don't notice that probably actually have an effect. It was by coincidence that we were there. We didn't plan it -- not consciously, anyway. The vocals for ""Indie Cindy"" are from Joey's hotel room there. CNN: How's it working out with Kim Shattuck doing the live shows? Thompson: Every musician brings their thing to the table. I personally like working with her. She has a really good work ethic. She likes to rock out, she likes to hit hard, she likes to play. I enjoy working with her because she has a good attitude. CNN: If there's an ""EP-1,"" does that mean there's also an ""EP-2"" and an ""EP-3?"" Thompson: It's all one big album, you know. CNN: Will you be spending another seven years on the road? Santiago: You know, I don't want to sound corny, but it's up to Cindy. Thompson: True. I mean, she's the greatest gatekeeper of all.","The Pixies return with ""EP-1,"" their first new music in decades .

"(CNN) -- As saber rattling grows over the Syrian president's alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people, Bashar al-Assad's once high-profile wife, Asma, has kept a low profile. ""She's just hunkered down in Damascus,"" said Andrew Tabler, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of ""In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle with Syria."" ""She's standing by her man."" That's where she can be seen in photographs of the al-Assads posted this week on Instagram. No images of bloody battle fields mar the view of the president caught in the middle of the civil war. Instead, photo after photo of the couple show a picture of caring. In one, the first lady -- who majored in computer science and French literature at King's College London -- wipes away a boy's tear. In another, she is listening intently to a group of women. The photos appeared after the president announced this month that he was adding Instagram to his social media blitz. He also has his own Facebook page and a YouTube channel. A brutal war? Not to hear al-Assad's Instagram tell it . And, judging from the comments, he has fans in Syria, Russia and Turkey. ""God bless you,"" ""We love you,"" and ""We want you to win this war"" are common comments posted on the images. But not all the remarks are positive. ""This is not the real Syria,"" one writer posts. ""Show as the actual Syria, please."" The only reference to the war that has killed more than 100,000 Syrians, according to the United Nations, comes in captions beneath photos of the president shaking hands with soldiers ""protecting civilians"" and ""regaining security and stability"" in Darraya. The rest of August, according to the account, has been packed with diplomatic functions, awards ceremonies and Asma tossing salad, stirring pots and filling bowls as Muslims broke fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Some of the president's almost 34,000 Instagram followers seem to sense spin in the postings, with one asking of the fashion-conscious first lady, ""So she managed to find time to stop shopping for shoes?"" and another demanding photos of her Christian Louboutins, the brand of French shoes that can command $1,000 a pair. Almost as common as the comments asserting, ""What a load of BS this account is"" are followers offering warm wishes of ""God bless you,"" ""We love you"" and ""We want you to win this war."" Some supporters used a ""#LongLiveBasharAlAssad"" hashtag. Western intervention looms in Syria . The president, who also has a Facebook page and a YouTube channel, began posting the photos July 24. ""They're pretty standard,"" Tabler said Wednesday in a telephone interview about the propaganda tools. ""I don't think there are any surprises there."" But Tabler, who once lived in Syria and interacted with the first family, said he had little insight into her current doings. ""We broke relations a long time ago,"" he said about the 38-year-old former investment banker with J.P. Morgan, who was born in Britain to a family of Syrian descent. When Asma al-Akhras met Bashar al-Assad during the 1990s, he was studying in London to be an eye doctor. After the death of her beau's father, Syrian President Hafez Assad, in June 2000, the ophthalmologist became president and, that December, the couple married. Since then, they have had at least three children. She was reported last spring to be pregnant with a fourth. Before the outbreak of the civil war in Syria in March 2011, the first lady had projected an image of a reformer. Local merchants routinely praised the secular ""modern image"" of al-Assad and his wife, particularly in contrast to Turkey's pious Sunni prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose wife wears an Islamic headscarf. A 2011 Vogue magazine article described her as ""a rose in the desert."" The story, which was published after the uprising had begun, was ridiculed for being tone-deaf to suffering in the country. Though the European Union placed Asma al-Assad and members of her family under sanctions shortly after the article was published, the story presented her as she had worked to be perceived -- as an exceptionally modern woman in the Arab world, Tabler and other experts have said. Unlike other first ladies in the region, she seemed intent on speaking from a position of power and influence. Her focus, she said, was protecting children. Afterward, the writer of the Vogue article told CNN she felt duped by the first lady when she learned that the Syrian president's forces had killed children. ""I wondered how this English woman I had met who so believed in the youth of Syria could stand by and not do anything,"" said Joan Juliet Buck. ""I fell for the line this woman fed me."" Throughout her years as first lady, Asma al-Assad has focused on children. In a 2009 CNN interview, she spoke about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, saying that she would not tolerate an oppressive and violent regime. She spoke at length about how it broke her heart that children on either side would be caught in the crossfire. That led many observers to expect her to condemn the attacks on civilians, many of them children. But no such response has emerged. Getting to know Syria's first family . In February 2012, an article published in The Times of London said Asma al-Assad appeared to support her husband, while also seeking dialogue and comfort for the bereaved in the country. According to an e-mail sent through an intermediary from Asma al-Assad's office, ""The president is the president of Syria, not a faction of Syrians, and the first lady supports him in that role,"" The Times reported. Meanwhile, the little that has emerged about her life has contrasted sharply with the brutality of the civil war that has engulfed the country: Leaked e-mails between the president and the first lady showed that she was shopping online for jewelry, art and furniture. On the day of a massive anti-Assad rally in Hama, Asma al-Assad e-mailed a London art dealer about buying tens of thousands of dollars' worth of art.

"CNN's new series i-List takes you to a different country each month. In May, we visit Macedonia focusing on changes shaping the country's economy, culture and its social fabric. Demir Kapija, Macedonia -- Jordan Trajkov was a successful banker studying for an MBA when he visited Napa Valley in California. The visit inspired him to go back to his roots and start a winery in his native Macedonia. Trajkov's father had owned a vineyard, but when Macedonia was part of socialist Yugoslavia he was not allowed to produce his own wine. ""There were just a few big wineries and my father had to sell his grapes to them."" Trajkov told CNN. ""But my grandfather had his own winery before socialism and that inspired me. ""From an early age I had worked on my father's vineyard, but I had never had the opportunity to make my own wine."" Trajkov, now 41, worked in banking for seven years in Macedonia, London and New York. He was studying for an MBA in Phoenix, Arizona, when he took the holiday in Napa Valley that was to change his career. Trajkov returned to Macedonia and in 2003 bought some land close to where he had grown up. He planted his first grapes in 2005 and began selling wine from his Popova Kula winery the following year. ""Bringing together the concept of wine tourism with grape growing and wine making was fascinating for me,"" Trajkov told CNN. Popova Kula produces 23 varieties of wine, but Trajkov's favorites are those native to Macedonia. He is keen to give a future to the ancient vines denied when Macedonia was part of Yugoslavia. Then, production was all about bulk export of more common grapes, such as cabernets and sauvignons. Alongside his better-known grapes, Trajkov produces Vranec and Stanushina, and has won international medals for several of his wines. ""I describe our philosophy as 'glocalization', promoting the local varieties globally. We are really traditionalists. We think that there are some wonderful domestic varieties."" Trajkov put all his own money into the winery, and his father sold his own nearby vineyards to invest too. Trajkov's former career as a banker has helped, and he became the first Macedonian company to be floated on its stock exchange. ""I knew how to do that because of my background. We have strong equity,"" he said. ""I cannot say our sales are as we originally predicted in our business plan, but I can say we hope to get there because our sales are increasing year to year. That's because we have highest quality wine."" To increase sales further, Trajkov knows he must work hard on promoting his wines more widely. He has even built a hotel to accommodate tourists, with each room themed on a wine. Alongside the hiking, bird-watching, fishing and skiing on offer locally, the Napa Valley influence becomes clear.

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania parents are suing their son's school, alleging it watched him through his laptop's webcam while he was at home and unaware he was being observed. Michael and Holly Robbins of Penn Valley are suing the Lower Merion School District, its board of directors and the superintendent. The parents allege the district unlawfully used its ability to access a webcam remotely on their son's district-issued laptop computer. The lawsuit seeking class-action status was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The suit said that on November 11, an assistant principal at Harriton High School told the plaintiffs' son that he was caught engaging in ""improper behavior"" in his home and it was captured in an image via the webcam. According to the Robbinses' complaint, neither they nor their son, Blake, were informed of the school's ability to access the webcam remotely at any time. It is unclear what the boy was doing in his room when the webcam was activated or if any punishment was given out. Doug Young, a spokesman for the Lower Merion School District, said the district would only remotely access a laptop if it were reported to be lost, stolen or missing. Young said if there were such a report, the district first would have to request access from its technology and security department and receive authorization. Then it would use the built-in security feature to take over the laptop and see whatever was in the webcam's field of vision, potentially allowing it to track down the missing computer. Young said parents and students were not explicitly told about this built-in security feature. To receive the laptop, the family had to sign an ""acceptable-use"" agreement. To take the laptop home, the family also would have to buy insurance for the computer. In an ""acceptable-use"" agreement, the families are made aware of the school's ability to ""monitor"" the hardware, he said, but it stops short of explicitly explaining the security feature. He termed that a mistake. Young added that mistakes might be made when combining technology and education in a cutting-edge way. All 2,300 students at the district's two high schools were offered laptops to ""enhance opportunities for ongoing collaboration and ensure that all students have 24/7 access to school-based resources,"" according to a message on the superintendent's Web site, which the suit quoted. Young said the district is proud of the laptop program and the ability to close the technology gap between students who have computers at home and those who don't. But he acknowledged schools will have to take a step back to re-evaluate the policies and procedures surrounding the program. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania isn't involved in the litigation, but its director, Vic Walczak, criticized the school district's action. ""Neither police nor school officials can enter a private home, physically or electronically, without an invitation or a warrant. The school district's clandestine electronic eavesdropping violates constitutional privacy rights, intrudes on parents' right to raise their children and may even be criminal under state and federal wiretapping laws,"" Walczak said ""... George Orwell's '1984' is an overused metaphor, but it applies here in spades. Part of the school officials' punishment should be to retake ninth-grade civics class."" Kevin Bankston, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation who specializes in electronic privacy, also said the school may have broken federal wire-tapping laws. He called the school district's action ""foolish and dangerous,"" saying the matter could prove to be a warning to other districts. Multiple requests for further comment from the Robbinses' attorney, Mark Haltzman of Lamm Rubenstone LLC, went unanswered.","Pennsylvania parents sue school district, school chief, board over son's laptop .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- There is one thing to be said about Attorney General Eric Holder. He has a way with words that makes conservatives furious -- especially when he starts talking about race and the law. There are many examples. Early in the Obama administration, Holder said that we are ""a nation of cowards"" when it comes to issues of race. The conservative chattering class erupted. Holder is at it again. He has fired up the right with his comments about the Trayvon Martin case, blaming ""mistaken beliefs and stereotypes"" for the shooting of the Florida teenager. And now he is going after Texas' voting laws. At the annual conference of the National Urban League in Philadelphia on Thursday, Holder renewed his attack on a recent Supreme Court ruling that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ""Despite the court's decision, I believe we must regard this setback not as a defeat but as a historic opportunity for Congress to restore, and even to strengthen, modern voting protections,"" Holder said. Feds want Texas to clear voting-rights changes with them . He then announced the Justice Department will ""ask a federal court in Texas to subject the state of Texas ... to obtain 'pre-approval' from either the department or a federal court before implementing future voting changes,"" similar to a provision in the Voting Rights Act. His remarks are the Justice Department's first significant response to last month's court ruling and seeks to address Texas' controversial redistricting law that Holder filed suit against in 2012. Holder said the state had a ""history of pervasive voting-related discrimination against racial minorities that the Supreme Court itself has recognized."" The attorney general previously has been accused by the conservative press of ""abuse of power"" and of ""exploiting tragedies"" by the National Rifle Association. Former U.S. Rep. Allen West attacked Holder for what he called ""race-baiting"" and ""exploiting the law."" Civil rights organizations have called on Holder and the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against George Zimmerman after he was found not guilty in the Martin shooting. Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, who mentions Holder several times in his book about racial profiling, ""The Presumption of Guilt,"" said the attorney general ""has no fear or reticence to talk about race wherever he thinks it needs to be discussed and that leads to a host of reactions, usually negative, from people."" ""I think he is being very straightforward, and some people take it as being provocative. He is very honest about his views about race and justice,"" Ogletree said. Provocative, or not, Holder has attracted little public criticism for his language from the one person who matters most -- his boss, President Barack Obama. The relative silence has created speculation that Holder is saying things the country's first African-American president might like to say but cannot. Jonathan Gould, an American University justice, law and society professor, said it's almost certain the White House approved Holder's recent remarks on race though Obama still had some deniability about them. ""Attorney General Eric Holder is speaking for the president, but there's enough distance for Obama to say it's not the view of the president."" Ogletree, who taught Obama in law school, said he isn't so sure. ""He certainly isn't speaking for President Obama; sometimes he is speaking before the president has a chance,"" Ogletree said. Still, Holder is ""saying some candid things about race that you don't expect the president to be able to say without being divisive. And I think Eric's view is that I'm an experienced lawyer, I'm a former judge, I'm a former prosecutor. ... I know all these areas, and I'm just going to be candid. He is older than President Obama, he's been around,"" Ogletree added. Just the same, Matt Miller, former director of public affairs for the Justice Department, said Holder is ""a proxy for attacking the president."" ""In other words when Mr. Obama's political enemies go after Holder, they are taking a swipe at the White House as well, which makes Holder pretty useful to the administration. He's out there taking the heat on guns, voting rights and some other issues."" And in many ways, that is what the job of attorney general has become, said the former public affairs director. Anyone who holds the office is expected to take tremendous political heat. ""The Department of Justice and the attorney general deal with so many controversial issues that split the parties in half, and Holder, as the head of DOJ, has not shied away from fights that he believes in, that drives Republicans crazy,"" Miller said.","NEW: Eric Holder says Justice Department will go after Texas voting law after high court ruling .

"(CNN) -- There was a time when Italian teams dominated European football's second-tier competition, winning the UEFA Cup in six of seven seasons starting in the late 1980s. But the last Italian outfit to win the event, now the Europa League, was Parma in 1999. No one would bet against Juventus ending the drought this campaign and how sweet it would be for the Turin giant since the final will be held at Juventus' own stadium. The runaway leader in Serie A, Juventus reached the semifinals Thursday after beating Lyon 2-1 in Turin and 3-1 on aggregate. For the 'Old Lady' of Italian football, it marked a first European semifinal since the club lost the Champions League final to AC Milan in 2003 -- before the 'Calciopoli' match-fixing scandal that resulted in Juventus being stripped of two Serie A titles and demoted. Juventus was joined in the last four by Valencia -- which made history in overturning a 3-0 first-leg deficit against Basel -- Sevilla and 2013 finalist Benfica. ""This season, even though the competition is different, we are still having an important journey in Europe,"" Juve manager Antonio Conte, whose men were ousted in the Champions League last fall, was quoted as saying by the Football Italia website. ""Juventus hadn't reached this phase in Europe for 10 years. ""We've got to keep our feet on the ground and not forget three years ago this team wasn't even in the Europa League. ""We have won a great deal over the last two years and are protagonists this season, too. The fans must stay close to the team for 90 minutes and I hope this can happen, so we never forget the past. We cared about reaching this objective and hope all of Italy can be happy with it."" Andrea Pirlo struck early for Juventus before Jimmy Briand leveled in the first half as the visitor enjoyed a good spell. Samuel Umtiti's own goal settled the affair in the 68th minute. ""It's not that just because we are called Juventus we are greeted by a red carpet ushering us through to certain victory,"" said Conte. ""Anyone who thinks everything is easy just because we are Juventus is deeply wrong."" Iberian teams have been the ones doing well lately in the Europa League, lifting the trophy in three of the four previous years, and Thursday's results ensured at least one more Iberian side would feature in the May 14 finale. No club had ever rallied from 3-0 down in a tie to advance since the Europa League was introduced but Paco Alcacer's hat-trick inspired Valencia in its 5-0 extra-time victory. Basel had two men sent off in extra time. Sevilla, the two-time UEFA Cup winner, trailed FC Porto 1-0 after the first leg but three goals in the first 30 minutes at home were enough to see off the 2011 champion. Even a red card to Coke Andujar in the 54th minute wasn't enough to help Porto, which fell 4-1 on the night. Benfica, beaten by Chelsea last year in the final, got a double from Rodrigo to defeat AZ Alkmaar 2-0 Thursday and 3-0 on aggregate. The semifinal draw takes place Friday.","Juventus completes a two-leg victory over Lyon in the Europa League quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Marc Marquez took an early stranglehold on this year's MotoGP title race by leading a Honda one-two at the Circuit of Americas in Texas Sunday. Marquez, who won the season-opener in Qatar, dominated practice and qualifying and was untroubled in the race proper, winning by nearly five seconds. Teammate Dani Pedrosa finished second, nearly five seconds adrift, with Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso completing the podium. Marquez, who broke his leg in an accident a month before the season, has a maximum 50 points from two races with Pedrosa on 36 points. MotoGP legend Valentino Rossi, who claimed a promising second in Qatar, could only manage eighth in America on his Yamaha, struggling with grip on his front tires. Rossi's teammate, two-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo of Spain, had to make a jump start from fifth on the grid and he finished 10th after a ride through penalty. Stefan Bradl finished fourth on his Honda with rookie Bradley Smith in a fine fifth ahead of Yamaha teammate Aleix Espargaro.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- Ted Nugent should be arrested. Not because he doesn't like Barack Obama but because he got up in front of a group of people and insinuated he would attempt to assassinate Obama if he's re-elected. Or let's put it this way: A man with a truckload of guns has threatened the life of our president while the country's at war. Nugent's words were: ""If Barack Obama is elected, I'll either be dead or in jail this time next year,"" which sounds to me like he's open to directing his disapproval of Obama in a way that is violent and unlawful. When you see that statement next to Nugent comparing Obama and his colleagues to coyotes that needed to be shot, as well as the need to ""ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November,"" I don't see how that rant cannot be looked upon as a threat on the president's life. iReport: Opinion - ""I want to live in a world where you can speak your mind"" I don't care how you feel about Nugent's music or Obama's policies, it seems that if there were a First Amendment line to cross, that would be it. And yet, the reality is the Secret Service will spend a little time investigating Nugent, determine he's not a true threat, and move on. If the Supreme Court can rule in favor of an 18-year-old man who, in voicing his opposition to being drafted for the Vietnam War, said: ""If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is LBJ,"" then it's doubtful anything is going to happen to Nugent. At least anything involving jail time. People are still free to organize boycotts and express disapproval. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech but it cannot insulate folks against the social and cultural repercussions that come from saying something offensive. Nugent should be in jail. But he's just a piece of low-hanging fruit. We already know he's a wild man who makes inflammatory remarks to stay relevant. We also know he's not the only media figure who shocks for a living. The bigger question is why is it OK to say you're going to kill the president, and by OK, I mean legal? True, because President Obama is black he has attracted a unique breed of critics, such as Walter Bagdasarian, who in 2008 was arrested but later set free after posting ""Re: Obama fk the n****r, he will a .50 cal in the head soon"" on a Yahoo message board. He also posted ""Shoot the n*g."" Obama is hardly the only president to have a U.S. citizen publicly threaten his life. And yet, like Bagdasarian, the people issuing the threats are protected under a law that yanks the teeth out of another law, one that makes it a felony to threaten a president or major presidential candidate with death or bodily harm. In order to get a jail sentence to stick, prosecutors must prove the individual has made plans to carry out such a threat. So even though law enforcement found a .50 caliber muzzle-loading rifle in Bagdasarian's home -- the kind of bullet he said would soon be in Obama's head -- that wasn't enough to keep him in jail. I don't know about you, but I find that to be a bit unsettling, especially nowadays, when we have almost as many guns in the U.S. as we do people -- the highest rate of any country in the world of civilian gun ownership. Forty-nine states allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons outside of their home for protection, including in some cases, bars. Who needs a plan when you can be ticked off, get liquored up and then go attend a rally? I'm not anti-gun. I'm pro- America. Allowing people to threaten the life of a president, particularly during time of war, is not protecting free speech as much as it is dangerously close to treason as it is defined in Article III of the Constitution. We have an agreed-upon system to replace elected officials we don't like. It's called democracy. If people don't like the president, they can say that. They can vote against them. They can run. They can leave. But they shouldn't be allowed to go on the Internet or radio and threaten his or her life. I felt that way about George W. Bush, I feel that way about President Obama, and I will feel that way if Mitt Romney gets elected. That's because this conversation isn't about them or the parties they represent. It's about maintaining some level of respect for the office. How can we begin to talk seriously about ""restoring America""-- whatever that means -- when we openly threaten the life of our chief ambassador? U.S. Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy were all assassinated. Six U.S. presidents survived assassination attempts. I'm not surprised to hear such comments from Nugent. But I am surprised that in a country with 106 million handguns, 105 million rifles, 83 million shotguns and four assassinated presidents, we don't take such talk more seriously. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Ted Nugent should be tried and go to jail for insinuating he'd kill Obama .

"(CNN) -- Industrialized countries have been enabling corruption in Africa by providing crooked officials with a haven for their money, according to Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz. The former World Bank chief economist, one of the few economists to foresee the global financial crisis, was among the speakers at this year's Global Poverty Summit, held in Johannesburg. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow, Stiglitz expressed optimism about Africa's economic prospects, but he said there should be more discussion about undisclosed bank accounts in the West that are used to facilitate high-level fraud in Africa. ""The advanced industrial countries have some responsibility,"" said Stiglitz. ""One of the things that's on a standard form is for corrupt dictators to steal money and put it in a bank account in an advanced industrial country. ""There's been a lot of discussion in the G-20 about secret bank accounts as tax agents -- there hasn't been enough discussion of secret bank accounts as corruption facilitators."" Stiglitz said corruption could be reduced by increasing scrutiny of corrupt governments, using mechanisms such as freedom of information acts and a free press. But he added that the West also had a role to play. ""One of the countries that hosted the G-20 and talked all the time about tax corruption, that same country is a haven for corrupt money and refuses to repatriate money that has been stolen from Africa,"" he said. ""Now, this seems to me something that ought to be on the agenda. There's a relationship, there are people making money off of it, and we ought to stop that. ""We shouldn't enable that corruption and we're doing that in the West when we allow them to have their secret bank accounts."" Stiglitz added that there was reason for optimism about economic growth in Africa, with changes to economic policies in recent years starting to bear fruit. ""There is an enormous amount of dynamism in Africa, so I think it's a moment of real opportunity,"" he said. But he stressed the need for Africa to reverse what he called its ""process of de-industrialization over the last 25 years."" ""One of the things that Africa has to do is realize it cannot just be a source of natural resources, that it has to start industrializing, producing agriculture services -- it's not just the old industry,"" he said. ""I think it's actually a very good time. Wages are rising in Asia and people are asking, 'Where can we start producing in a competitive way?' I think Africa provides an example of one of the important areas.""","Joseph Stiglitz is a Nobel economics laureate and a former World Bank chief economist .

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian court Monday ordered a ban on activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, according to state-run news website EgyNews. The move is the latest in an anti-Muslim Brotherhood crackdown that began when the military ousted President Mohamed Morsy, who was backed by the Brotherhood, in early July. The country's Ministry of Social Solidarity said earlier this month that it was considering punishing the group, accusing it of violating a law regulating non-governmental groups, EgyNews reported. The law prohibits such groups from operating as political organizations and forming militias. The Brotherhood has a political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, and the current government has accused the Brotherhood of inciting violence. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman, in response to a question at a briefing in Washington, said the department is looking for more information about the court's ruling. ""A transparent and inclusive political process that preserves the rights of all Egyptians to participate and leads back to a civilian-led government is critical to the success of Egypt's political and economic future,"" said Jen Psaki. She added that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy had discussed the matter when they met Sunday in New York. Opinion: Why the Muslim Brotherhood can't back down . Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's ouster, with the military and Morsy opponents battling Muslim Brotherhood members and others. In August, hundreds of people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo. Violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations a few days later. Read more: What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The Brotherhood was underground during the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, who had banned the group. But after Mubarak's ouster in 2011, the group's Freedom and Justice Party got into gear and fielded parliamentary candidates. The Freedom and Justice Party won about half the seats up for election in December 2011, and its presidential candidate, Morsy, won in 2012. Egyptian security forces lately have rounded up high-profile members of the group. Last week, they arrested a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, Gehad El-Haddad, who was a frequent guest on Western media. He was arrested at an apartment in a Cairo suburb, Egypt's state-run newspaper Al-Ahram reported. He was accused of inciting violence and murder. El-Haddad was active on social media, notifying supporters of rallies. Egyptian police official killed in clashes on outskirts of Cairo .","Government: The Muslim Brotherhood was violating the law .

"(CNN) -- I spent a recent Saturday morning at a field house in Juneau, Alaska, where girls with pink hair and stars and rainbows drawn on their cheeks run 27 laps around a gymnasium track. That may not seem like international news, but it should be. Their race was part of the international ""Girls on the Run"" program, which is amazingly effective at empowering young women. I watched most of the race from the sidelines with Andrew, a grandpa wearing a driver's cap, and Jennifer, the mother of one of the young runners. ""Good job! Keep going! Love you! You're awesome!"" ""Remember to breathe!"" Encouragement is the hallmark of the program, which pairs girls with adult mentors who help train them to run a 5K -- and, more importantly, talk to them about what it means to be women in modern America. ""You have to set a goal to become a powerful girl on the run,"" Ati Nasiah, the local organizer, with a feather stuck in her hair, told the girls before the race. ""Each of us is unique, and that is what makes us so powerful. With every heartbeat and every breath, we are changing the world."" These girls are changing the world and Alaska, the state FBI crime estimates rank as having the highest rate of reported rape in the country. Teaching young women that they can be whoever and whatever they want to be is an important part of preventing rape and abuse. I visited Alaska in December because you voted for me to cover rape in the United States as part of CNN's Change the List project, which focuses on bottom-of-the-list places like Alaska. Jennifer, the mom I watched the race with, and whose last name I'm not using to protect her privacy, was a victim of domestic violence. Her husband beat her, she told me, and she got together with him when she was 13 and he 22. One reason Jennifer brought her daughter to Girls on the Run, with the help of a scholarship and free sneakers, is that she doesn't want her daughter to accept violence against women. ""Instead of me just sitting back and taking it, (my kids) see me standing up,"" she said. ""And that's what they need. Otherwise, they will grow up and think it's OK."" That's hugely important. But the largely unspoken reality also remains: Victims aren't to blame for rape and domestic violence; offenders are. So, while they are essential, programs like Girls on the Run aren't enough to end what Alaska's governor has termed its ""epidemic"" of rape and violence against women. To stop the violence, men have to stop raping and battering. That seems like common sense. But it's still controversial. For evidence, look no further than Zerlina Maxwell, an attorney and rape survivor who went on Fox News last year to make that very point. Other pundits argued that women should carry weapons to protect themselves. No, Maxwell said. Men should stop raping, and that would solve it. For those remarks, she received death threats. On Twitter, one person wrote, according to a news report, ""I hope you get raped and your throat slit."" This same pro-gun sentiment came up in the comments sections of other Change the List stories published earlier this month about rape in Alaska. ""Time to arm and train the women to defend themselves,"" one person wrote on my op-ed about a lawless village at the far edge of the state, where troopers fly in by plane. That's wrong-headed. Instead of putting the burden on women to defend themselves, the state should continue to expand its Village Public Safety Officer program. I hope it soon will include that village. ""What we have been doing for the past 100 years hasn't been working,"" Maxwell told me by phone from New York. ""Focusing on women's behavior isn't working."" Andrew, the adoptive grandpa who I spoke with during the race in Juneau, gets it, too. ""They need a program for boys, that's for sure,"" he told me. ""They've got this program to rebuild the confidence and self esteem in the girls, and keep them going. But where is the support structure to stop it in the boys? You know, break the cycle."" Alaska has more of a jump-start on that than some states. It was encouraging to see members of a local men's high school basketball team acting as cheerleaders for the Girls on the Run event. Those players, from Juneau's Thunder Mountain High School, are participating in a program called Coaching Boys into Men. It's designed to teach young men about safe relationships and respect for women. Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, has requested $12.4 million to fund his ""Choose Respect"" initiative, which also is aimed at preventing violence and helping survivors. That's progress. But such programs should be expanded. We have to keep encouraging girls, but always remember offenders are to blame. Some of that should happen through formal training and programs. It's also on all of us to call out inappropriate behavior when we see it. The family I sat with as we watched the girls sprint by understood this. When Jennifer's son reached out to give his sister a whopping high-five, his mom told him that he had to remember to be gentle -- to support her, not hit her. ""Hands are for high-fives and hugs, not hitting,"" she said. The next time his 9-year-old sister came around, he gave her the softest of bear hugs. ""Good job!"" The young runner seemed grateful for his support. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Alaska has the highest rate of reported rape in the nation .

"(EW.com) -- Everything is awesome for the team behind ""The LEGO Movie."" The 3-D animated extravaganza is estimated to have earned a spectacular $69.11 million this weekend — the biggest opening of the still young year, and the second largest February opening ever (the top spot belongs to 2004′s ""Passion of the Christ""). The Phil Lord and Christopher Miller movie blew past studio and analyst predictions, which had the pic in the $40 to $55 million range. Playing in 3,775 theaters, most of which were in 3-D, ""LEGO"" scored an incredible $18,307 per location average, and, including overseas profits ($18.1 million from 34 territories), ""The LEGO Movie"" has already stacked up $87.2 million. 'The Lego Movie': Did it make you cry? ""The LEGO Movie"" is Warner Bros.' first animated release in three years. Village Roadshow co-financed the pic. Featuring the vocal talents of Chris Pratt as Emmet the construction worker, Will Ferrell as the evil Lord Business, Elizabeth Banks as the brilliant Wyldstyle, Liam Neeson as Bad Cop, and Will Arnett as Batman, ""LEGO"" resonated with both adults and children — 60 percent of the audience was over 18 years old. A sequel is reportedly already in the works. But it wasn't just families and kids who headed out to the theaters this weekend. George Clooney's $70 million WWII pic ""The Monuments Men"" (CinemaScore: B+) exceeded expectations and took in an estimated $22.7 million from 3,083 locations. Based on a true story, ""The Monuments Men"" follows a team tasked with recovering art from the Nazis and returning it to their rightful owners and stars Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett. The audience was divided fairly evenly (48 percent male), and 75 percent of attendees were over 35 years old. The Sony release, from Columbia Pictures and Fox 2000 Pictures, boasted a $7,363 per screen average, which put it solidly in between ""Argo's"" ($19.5 million) and ""Captain Phillips'"" ($25.7 million) opening weekends. After all the fuss around the delayed release, it seems that pushing ""Monuments Men"" out of the holidays (and awards season) was the best thing it could have done in terms of earnings and mustering up an undistracted audience. It's also an all-time high opener for Clooney as a director -- ""The Ides of March"" opened at $10.5 million and ""Leatherheads"" at $12.7 million. Jennifer Aniston gets in line for 'Cake' The Kevin Hart/Ice Cube comedy ""Ride Along"" fell 21.9 percent from last weekend and snagged the third place spot after three weekends at No. 1 with $9.4 million. This places the PG-13 rated $25 million Universal pic at a $105.2 million domestic total. Universal had success opening 2013′s ""Identity Thief"" in the early part of the year. That film went on to net about $134.5 million after 17 weeks in theaters (11 on over 1,000 screens). ""Ride Along"" could definitely beat that. For Hart's starring roles, crossing $100 million is a career high, too. ""Think Like a Man"" topped out at $91.5 million in 2012. Hart has three more releases slated for this year, including next weekend's ""About Last Night."" Disney's ""Frozen"" picked up throughout the weekend to take the fourth place spot with an estimated $6.91 million, bringing its domestic total to a mind-blowing $368.7 million. The animated musical dropped 22.6 percent from last weekend — which is still incredibly impressive considering the stiff competition from the ""LEGO"" opening. Globally, ""Frozen"" passed the $900 million mark this past weekend, making it the 28th highest grossing film of all time and the fourth highest grossing animated release. John Green's favorite fan reactions to 'The Fault in Our Stars' trailer . Finally, ""That Awkward Moment"" continues to have modest success in its second weekend in theaters, dropping 36.6 percent from its disappointing Super Bowl weekend opening. In fifth place, the Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan bromantic comedy earned about $5.54 million, for a $16.85 million domestic total. 1. ""The Lego Movie"" — $69.11 million . 2. ""The Monuments Men"" — $22.7 million . 3. ""Ride Along"" — $9.4 million . 4. ""Frozen"" — $6.91 million . 5. ""That Awkward Moment"" — $5.54 million . Outside of the top five, poor ""Vampire Academy"" (CinemaScore: B) opened to a dismal $4.1 million this weekend on 2,767 screens. The Weinstein Company needed at least double-digit earnings to consider franchise potential, but it looks like Richelle Mead's series will go the way of recent big screen YA disappointments such as ""Beautiful Creatures"" and ""The Mortal Instruments.""

"(CNN) -- Bad luck, or just another step in Manchester United's fall from dominance? The club's share price may have recovered a little since last month's $61 million marquee signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea, but qualification for the lucrative European Champions League is looking further away than ever for beleaguered manager David Moyes. Mata helped United win on his debut against lowly Cardiff in midweek, but the Spaniard could not stop his new team crashing to a 2-1 defeat at unfancied Stoke. It means fourth-placed Liverpool can move nine points clear of United in the Premier League on Sunday with a win at struggling West Brom. Table-topping Manchester City, meanwhile, will go 16 points ahead of United with victory over second-placed Chelsea on Monday. Moyes has had a tough time since replacing Alex Ferguson, the most successful manager in the history of English football, and he was left bemoaning his fortunes after losing two players to injury and conceding a wickedly-deflected free-kick. However, while Charlie Adam's first goal may have been fortuitous, his second -- which made Robin van Persie's equalizer redundant -- was a moment of magic as the Scottish midfielder smashed in a 25-yard thunderbolt. It was United's eighth league defeat in 24 matches, compared to just five in 38 in Ferguson's championship-winning farewell. This is the club's worst run in the top flight since the 1989-90 season. ""We played well today,"" a defiant Moyes told MUTV. ""We're definitely not getting a lot of good fortune going our way, but we've got ourselves to blame for the opportunities we missed. ""I think the free-kick summed it up. That went in after we'd controlled the majority of the game. I think it was going wide, but it took a wicked deflection and went in. That's when you know that your luck isn't in. It's just not going for us. ""It was a difficult day, the conditions were tough. We had opportunities to get at least a draw and they scored a world-class second goal which was hard to defend against."" While United's attack has been bolstered by the arrival of Mata and the return from injury of last season's top scorer Van Persie and England striker Wayne Rooney, Moyes' defensive options are looking thinner after Phil Jones was stretchered off before halftime and fellow center-back Jonny Evans suffered a calf injury. ""Phil is okay. He was unconscious for a period during the game, but he's had a head scan and the hospital has checked him and there were no problems,"" Moyes said. It was Stoke's first league win against United since 1984, when manager Mark Hughes was a 20-year-old striker playing for the Manchester side. His team leaped out of the bottom three up to 11th in the table after winning just its sixth game. ""That tells you how crazy the league is at the moment,"" said Hughes, whose side are just six points above bottom club Fulham. Moyes' former team Everton, meanwhile, moved up to fifth place -- which would secure a spot in the second-tier Europa League next season -- with a 2-1 win over Aston Villa. Belgium forward Kevin Mirallas fired in a superb 85th-minute free-kick as Everton bounced back from last week's 4-0 drubbing by Merseyside rivals Liverpool, with substitute Steven Naismith equalizing Leandro Bacuna's first-half opener for the 10th-placed visitors. Tottenham, beaten 5-1 by Manchester City in midweek, dropped to sixth after being held 1-1 at Hull. Brazil midfielder Paulinho, returning after a month sidelined by injury, canceled out new signing Shane Long's opener for the home side. Newcastle failed to join seventh-placed Manchester United on 40 points after losing 3-0 at home to northeast rivals Sunderland, who completed a derby double and continued a resurgence under manager Gus Poyet by moving up to 14th. Southampton consolidated ninth place with a 3-0 win at Fulham, who dropped to the foot of the table despite fielding two new loan signings, Denmark midfielder William Kvist and Tottenham's Germany international Lewis Holtby. West Ham's relegation battle was boosted by a 2-0 win at Swansea that left the London team third from bottom, but star striker Andy Carroll was sent off after setting up both goals for Kevin Nolan. Former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solkskjaer enjoyed his first win in charge of Cardiff, beating Norwich 2-1, but the Welsh club was still left second from bottom.","David Moyes suffers eight defeat in 24 league matches in charge of Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- She lives in Monaco, and she honed her skills in Marbella and Arizona -- but world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka was most definitely made in Minsk. Hurting from a slow start to her 2011 season, Azarenka wondered if professional tennis was really the career for her. A trip back home to Belarus and a chat with her beloved grandmother soon put her back on track. ""She never really talked to me about tennis or anything specific, she just was explaining to me about when she was growing up,"" Azarenka told CNN's Open Court. ""You just look at different perspective of things and I just realize, you know what, I'm so lucky to have an opportunity to do something that I really love and I'm here sitting and complaining about how hard my life is because I lost a tennis match when some people are really suffering with big troubles and they have a smile on their face."" Since that conversation, Azarenka has won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open, thrashing the far more experienced Maria Sharapova in January's final to become the first player from Belarus to win a major singles crown. The 22-year-old has also claimed the No. 1 ranking, sparked by a 26-match winning start to this season that only ended in Miami last month. While she wants to avoid coming across, as she puts it, as a ""Cinderella story,"" Belarus was hardly a hotbed of tennis talent when Azarenka was growing up, and her future was never mapped out. When she started working in a local tennis center, Azarenka's mother Alla needed a distraction for the young ""Vika"" so she could get on with her job. In desperation, Alla gave her daughter a racket and ball. ""It was just fun for me to hit against the wall and one of the coaches saw me and asked me if I wanted to join the group and I was like, 'I don't know, I'm scared,' but I picked it up right away,"" Azarenka said. ""We didn't even step on the court for the first year and a half. We played in a hall ... and there was 40 kids and we were so happy when we would hit one ball and wait five minutes for another one."" When she wasn't part of the coaching group, Azarenka was hitting against a wall at the center. When she wasn't at the center, she would play against her grandfather at home with a soft ball and badminton rackets, using the sofa and bookshelves to make the tennis court. Azarenka eventually outgrew her surroundings. She trained in Spain briefly before eventually completing her tennis education in Scottsdale, Arizona. Moving away from home at the age of 15 was difficult, but Azarenka said: ""I saw my goal in the tunnel and I just wanted to do absolutely everything to reach it."" And she isn't done yet. With the top ranking and a major title in the bag, Azarenka has already moved on to new targets. With the French Open and Wimbledon approaching, she has recruited two-time grand slam champion and former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo to her coaching team. ""I felt that she could help me in the way that my team probably never experienced before,"" Azarenka said of Mauresmo, who retired at the end of 2009. ""She's been through everything all ready, so those extra details or something could help, that's what we always look for, something to be better."" The Olympics also loom large. At the last Games in Beijing, Azarenka was ""so hyper and so excited just to be there that I wasn't worried about playing, I was just worried about being there and collecting pins."" She tried and failed to hunt down the autographs of record-breaking swimmer Michael Phelps and basketball's golden boy Kobe Bryant, but come August and the London Games, Azarenka will be one of the star attractions. Her trips home to Belarus, where she is an idol for thousands of children, have prepared her for the attention. ""I do some kids clinics, and the last one I actually did in Minsk, kids came from outside the cities, it was like almost 300 kids on one tennis court and they all start pushing each other because they all wanted to play and I was supposed to play for only one hour,"" Azarenka said. ""And I saw these kids, they were just like pushing each other and fighting and I said, 'Guys please stop fighting because I'll play with each one of you until everyone is done, I won't go home before that.' I was exhausted after that, but you have so much positive energy that it is just priceless."" So while Azarenka might live in glamorous Monaco with neighbors like Caroline Wozniacki and Novak Djokovic, there is only one home. ""My real home will always be Belarus where I'm from, and it can honestly never change.""","Victoria Azarenka is the first player from Belarus to win a grand slam singles title .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has pulled out of next week's ATP tournament in Buenos Aires, posting an online video in which he apologized to both fans and organizers as he did so. The world No. 1 said he has yet to train following the back injury that hindered his performance in last month's Australian Open final, which he lost to Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka. The Copa Claro tournament starts on 10 February. ""I want to make an announcement that really fills me with sadness -- I will not be able to play in the tournament in Buenos Aires,"" he said in a video posted on his official YouTube page. The news comes just two days after his team said that he was recovering well from the back problem, following a series of tests in Barcelona. The 27-year-old, who passed up the chance to draw level with American Pete Sampras on 14 grand slam titles when losing in Melbourne, had hoped to train for the first time on Thursday. His failure to do so prompted his online apology. ""Since I came back from the Australian Open with my back injury I have not been able to train,"" he said in Thursday's video, which came against a backdrop of several trophies. ""I had hoped to train this morning but could not because of a stomach virus. ""We are four days away from the tournament and without training and given what happened in Australia, it is impossible for me to prepare adequately for a competition as important as the one in Buenos Aires."" ""I'm sorry to all my supporters and organizers, and am sad personally to be unable to return to Argentina, but I hope to come back stronger soon."" There was no word from the Spaniard on whether he believes he will be able to play in the future tournaments in Rio de Janeiro, Indian Wells and Miami. Nadal played through the pain barrier in the final in Melbourne, saying afterwards that he would never want to quit a grand slam final. Despite rallying to win the third set, the Spaniard was beaten 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3.","Rafael Nadal pulls out of next week's event in Buenos Aires .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal extinguished any doubts over his long-term fitness after being forced to play two matches in less than 24 hours at the Barcelona Open. The 26-year-old recorded a 37th consecutive victory at Barcelona with a 6-3 6-0 quarterfinal win over fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos just hours after finishing off his rain-delayed third round match. After returning from a seven-month injury enforced absence with a knee problem in February, Nadal has reached six finals in six tournaments this year. Bad weather in Barcelona Thursday forced the World No.5 to complete his match against Frenchman Benoit Paire on Friday morning. A 7-6 6-2 win set up a last eight clash with Ramos, who Nadal swept aside in just 66 minutes following a commanding display. ""I played much better this afternoon than in the morning,"" Nadal told the ATP website. ""I'm very happy to be in the semifinals another time in a very important tournament. ""I'm enjoying the week playing here. I love the tournament. I know everybody well. It feels like home, always."" Nadal, who lost out in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters to Novak Djokovic last week, is hoping to secure an eighth French Open title next month. The Spaniard had hoped to win a ninth consecutive title at Monte Carlo before suffering his first defeat at the clay court tournament since 2003. He will now hope to bounce back with Canada's Milos Raonic standing in between him and a place in Sunday's final. Raonic, who has lost both of his previous encounters with Nadal, overcame Tommy Robredo 6-7 6-3 7-6. In the other semifinal, Spain's Nicolas Almagro will face Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber. Almagro, ranked 12th in the world, defeated compatriot Juan Monaco 6-3 7-5 in a contest where he saved 10 break points. ""He had many break points and played really good, but I can rest now for a little bit and we'll see what comes tomorrow in the semi-finals,"" Almagro told the official ATP website. ""I played really good today and that's the most important thing. I've felt great during this week and I'm going to fight to reach my first final here in Barcelona."" Kohlschreiber, seeded eighth, saw off Slovakia's Martin Klizan in three sets before his quarterfinal opponent, Thomaz Bellucci, withdrew injured. Meanwhile, Juan Martin del Potro has withdrawn from next week's Lisbon Open. According to the tournament's organizers, the Argentine, ranked seventh in the world, has been suffering with a stomach virus. In Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova overcame Serbia's Ana Ivanovic in 7-5 4-6 6-4 to ensure her place in the last four. ""It's good to face different styles of playing from different opponents,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""Ana is a bit more aggressive, while Lucie Safarova had a bit more variety in her game yesterday. ""I am happy to get through, but I had to push myself. ""It was a tough battle, it was hard to get my body going again after the last game, but it was good to get another three sets under the belt."" The World No.2 will face Germany's Angelique Kerber on Saturday after the home favorite saw off Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova 6-3 7-6. ""We both played well,"" Kerber told the WTA website. ""I was fully concentrated right from the first point and tried to make her move around and not let her get into the match -- luckily enough my tactics worked well today. ""It was extremely important for me to play as well as possible at my home tournament. ""Reaching the semifinals is a big achievement for me. But I'm not going to put myself under any pressure. ""I'm naturally going to have the crowd behind me - they've been supporting me so fantastically all week."" In the other semifinal, U.S qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands will take on China's Li Na. Mattek-Sands, ranked 104th in the world, overcame Germany's Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-2, while Li defeated fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-3 7-5. The World No.5 was beaten in three sets by Mattek-Sands in their previous meeting at the quarterfinal stage of the 2011 Madrid Open and is expecting another tough test.

"(CNN) -- Newcastle wasn't the opposition but there was another seven-goal classic at Anfield. Jordan Henderson scored deep in the second half to give Liverpool a 4-3 win over Swansea City, rekindling memories of the Reds' victories over Newcastle by the same score in 1996 and 1997. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wasn't afraid to say this month that his men were title contenders and with the offense flowing, his team trails Chelsea by a mere four points atop the standings. Daniel Sturridge -- second behind only teammate Luis Suarez in league scoring -- netted for an eighth straight Premier League outing to close in on Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of 10. ""It was an important win for us,"" Rodgers told Sky Sports. ""We certainly weren't at our best today but the offensive part of our game, which is very strong, came out on top again. ""It's an outstanding result for us and the game typified the character of this team."" Liverpool looked set to cruise when Henderson and Sturridge gave Liverpool a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes. But Swansea, under newish boss Garry Monk, didn't cave in. Jonjo Shelvey began a comeback against his former club and Wilfried Bony made it 2-2 in the 27th minute. After Sturridge and Bony traded goals -- the latter's second came via the penalty spot -- Henderson settled the affair in the 74th minute when he scored on his own rebound. A rejuvenated Henderson has been another bright spot for Rodgers this season but the defense is a worry. Defender Martin Skrtel particularly struggled Sunday, giving away the penalty when he clashed with Bony. Liverpool has conceded 35 goals, the most of any team in the top seven. ""As always as a coach, you'll analyze where you can be better, and we're looking to improve (on defense) for next week,"" said Rodgers. The top four all won this weekend but fifth-place Tottenham suffered a blow in its chase for a Champions League spot, losing 1-0 at relegation threatened Norwich City. Loic Remy scored in second-half injury time to give Newcastle a 1-0 win against Aston Villa at home, leaving Villa, like Norwich, four points above the relegation zone.","Liverpool defeats Swansea 4-3 at Anfield thanks to a strike from Jordan Henderson .

"(CNN) -- Newcastle United has fined their manager Alan Pardew £100,000 ($168,000) for head-butting an opposition player during an English Premier League match on Saturday. The 52-year-old clashed with Hull City midfielder David Meyler during Newcastle's 4-1 win at the KC Stadium. The incident happened in the 72nd minute as Meyler was retrieving a ball for a throw in. Pardew was sent to the stands by the referee and later apologized. ""I apologize to everyone. I should not have got involved in it,"" Pardew said. In a statement published on the club's official website, Saturday, Newcastle said that Pardew's actions were ""disappointing"" and ""unacceptable"" and took away from a positive performance on the pitch. ""Alan unreservedly apologized immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United,"" the NUFC statement said. ""We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behavior today and also a Club fine of £100,000."" Pardew, who has been manager of Newcastle since December 2010, will also be investigated by the English Football Association about the incident.

"(CNN) -- The former teacher of a schoolboy diagnosed with autism, who is accused by the child's father of mistreating the student, has called the allegations ""disingenuous,"" saying she wasn't there when the alleged classroom incident took place. The father, Stuart Chaifetz, said he put a recording device on his 10-year-old son, Akian, and recorded school staff in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, making what he described as inappropriate comments during class. Teacher Kelly Altenburg said through her attorney Friday that she ""does not condone any such remarks."" ""This language was not used at her direction, in her presence or with her knowledge,"" according to the statement. Chaifetz launched a website and a YouTube video on Monday to publicize portions of more than six hours of recordings of what he says are teachers and aides talking about alcohol and sex in front of the class, punctuated by yelling at his son to ""shut your mouth."" School authorities said in a statement Friday that they are ""continuing to investigate what occurred in the classroom in question."" ""Since the evidence presented is audio only, it is imperative that the improper conduct identified on the recording is correctly identified to the person(s) who committed the conduct,"" the statement said. Altenburg said she had been attending an hour-long meeting when the recordings were made and was not in the room when Akian was allegedly told to ""shut up,"" among other comments. ""There is no basis, either legal or truthful, for Mrs. Altenburg to be held accountable for the language or alleged words and actions of others, which may have taken place within her classroom, but which occurred outside of her presence and without her knowledge,"" her statement said. Chaifetz responded by saying Altenburg is culpable because the incident occurred in her class. ""This was an all-day situation and it was not limited to the first hour,"" he added. Chaifetz said he put the wire on Akian in an attempt to find out why staffers at his son's school had reported that the boy had been acting out and hitting his teachers. It was unlike his son to misbehave and hit his teachers, he said, though he had difficulty getting answers from Akian because he struggles with speaking. ""He wasn't able to come home and say, 'Dad, they called me a name today.'"" At one point in the recording, an adult female voice can be heard saying, ""I had a bottle of wine with my girlfriend last night."" The second female voice asks if she spent the morning ""heaving."" ""Oh my God, so bad,"" the first woman responds. ""The wine won."" Chaifetz also said his son can be heard screaming and crying in the recording. He said he reached out to school officials to report the alleged actions of the teachers shortly after he heard them. ""The school district was as horrified as I was,"" he said. In an online statement, Cherry Hill Public Schools Superintendent Maureen Reusche said that the district investigated the recordings and ""responded swiftly and appropriately."" ""I want to assure our parents that the individuals who are heard on the recording raising their voices and inappropriately addressing children no longer work in the district and have not since shortly after we received the copy of the recording,"" she said. Chaifetz says he wants an apology from the teachers and claims that one of them apparently has been transferred to a local high school in the same district. Altenburg's attorney, Matthew B Wieliczko, said that his client was initially transferred to another school in the district. She is currently on leave, he said. School officials declined to comment on personnel issues. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","NEW: The teacher at the center of the scandal is currently on leave, her attorney says .

"(CNN) -- German authorities have indicted 10 people in connection with a stampede at a music festival that killed 21 people in July 2010. The deadly crush happened at the Love Parade festival in Duisburg. Six city workers and four who worked for the event organizers were charged with involuntary manslaughter and bodily injury caused by negligence, a senior prosecutor said Wednesday. The deadly crush took place between the main event site and an expansion area in an underpass that became a fateful bottleneck. A stampede . Faulty crowd flow planning led people both entering and exiting the festival to cram into the underpass from both ends, Michael Schwarz said in a prepared statement. In addition, barriers that were installed without approval hemmed the crowd in, further increasing the congestion. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that the underpass became dangerously overcrowded, and some people who were crushed against the walls and each other lost consciousness. That triggered a panic in the crowd, unleashing a stampede. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 652 people were injured. Of them, 283 had to be treated in hospitals. Mass festival . Masses of people attended the annual electronica and techno music festival, but there is much disagreement on the size of the crowd. NTV said about 1.4 million people showed up at the Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people, they opened an additional event site. But the numbers are disputed by police, who said that the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 people and that it was not filled to capacity. At the time, NTV said 1,400 police officers were on hand to monitor the event; Detlef von Schmeling of the Duisburg police said more than 4,000 police officers provided security. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure. Immediately after the calamity, the Love Parade's organizers dissolved the festival, vowing never to put it on again. CNN's Diana Magnay and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: Prosecutor says faulty planning contributed to deadly bottleneck .

"Washington (CNN) -- Thurgood Marshall, Hattie McDaniel, the Tuskegee Airmen and Walter Morris -- all African-Americans who made history breaking the color barrier. But while America's first black Supreme Court justice, the first African-American Oscar winner and the U.S. military's first African-American pilots are well known, you may never have heard of Walter Morris or his role in American history. The War Department, as the Defense Department used to be called, wanted it that way. In March, a ceremony at the Pentagon sought to undo that. When Walter Morris first joined the Army just before World War II, he wasn't a ""black"" or ""Negro"" or ""African-American"" soldier -- he was ""colored.""  And he was treated like all the other ""colored"" men who wanted to fight for their country. ""We were servants, we were not soldiers,"" Morris said. ""Most of us had an inferiority complex and it was a result of what they had assigned us to do."" In the Deep South in the 1940s, racism was out in the open, including in the Army. ""You could walk down the street in the main post exchange area and in the summer the door would be open and you could look in and see white soldiers and prisoners of war from Germany sitting at the same table drinking, smoking,"" Morris said. ""That in itself gave you this inferiority complex. You are in uniform and you couldn't go in, but the prisoners could go in and have coffee and cigarettes."" But by the time he left the Army, Morris would become the first ""colored"" man ever to earn the U.S. Army Airborne Parachutist Badge. It's all because he wanted to overcome that ""inferiority complex."" Morris was the sergeant for a unit of black soldiers at Fort Benning, Georgia. That's where the Army was training white soldiers to be Airborne parachutists. So after watching the white soldiers training, he would gather up black soldiers who had finished their jobs as cooks, guards or drivers, and they would duplicate the training the white trainees had just gone through. ""We went to the calisthenics field and we knew the routine because we had watched them. ... We started with the five-foot platform where they jumped into the pit,"" Morris said. ""The most interesting thing of that was the replica of a C47 plane -- the body of it -- and the students went in there and sat down and they pretended to be paratroopers,"" Morris said. While Morris was trying to build his men's self-esteem, the War Department was quietly considering creating an all-black paratrooper unit. Morris soon found himself with a new job as the top noncommissioned officer for the new unit dedicated to training America's first ""colored"" parachutists, the 555th Parachute Infantry Company, or the Triple Nickle. They decided to spell it differently from ""nickel"" to make sure people knew they were unique. The unit had plenty of doubters. ""They didn't think colored soldiers had the intestinal fortitude to jump out of a plane in flight,"" Morris remembered. But the men proved the doubters wrong. Twenty soldiers started the training and on February 18, 1944, 17 soldiers graduated and earned the Parachutist Badge. As the unit's first sergeant, Morris was the first man of the 555th to be pinned with the coveted ""wings."" ""That was the happiest day of my life, because now I was a combat paratrooper,"" Morris said. But happiness was soon replaced by reality. D-Day was approaching and the Triple Nickle wanted badly to jump into Europe to fight the Nazis. But the white officers who supported the Triple Nickle couldn't convince the generals in charge in the European theater to put the unit to use. ""The Army had no place for us,"" Morris recalls. ""None of the commanding generals wanted the extra problem of integrating colored soldiers with the white soldiers, so they refused."" But soon the Japanese military created a need for the Triple Nickle's special skills -- and this is why Walter Morris is not as well known as Thurgood Marshall or Hattie McDaniel. The only military attack to hit the U.S. mainland during World War II involved incendiary balloons. The Japanese released bomb-laden balloons into the winds that carried across the North Pacific towards the U.S. West Coast. The intent was to set fires in cities such as Seattle, Washington, or San Francisco, California. More often than not the balloons simply started huge forest fires. But the Japanese didn't know what the balloons were accomplishing. The War Department wanted the fires put out and wanted to make sure the news didn't get out. The U.S. Forest Service needed help putting the fires out. Morris and the members of the Triple Nickle packed up and flew west. Even they didn't know where they were going. ""It was a secret mission called Operation Firefly. We thought we were going overseas to [Gen. Douglas] MacArthur's theater,"" Morris said. It wasn't until they arrived in Oregon that they learned they'd be fighting the Japanese on the fire line in the Western United States. With some quick training, the Triple Nickle became the ""Smoke Jumpers"" -- firefighters who parachuted into rugged mountain terrain with nothing but shovels, axes and basic supplies. Their mission meant they had to get the fire under control or out before they could return to base. After 1,200 jumps, the fire season and the war were over. But because Operation Firefly started out as a secret, the Triple Nickle's contribution to protecting the home front and to history was all but lost. Now the Pentagon wants to change that, honoring the Triple Nickle. Of those first 17 graduates, three are still alive -- Walter Morris, Roger Walden and Clarence Beavers. They were the guests of honor at a ceremony recently at the Pentagon. They may not be as well known as other trailblazers in African-American history, but they were every bit the pioneers they trained to be.","Walter Morris joined Army just before World War II when segregation still ruled .

"(EW.com) -- In ""About Last Night,"" two couples who are polar opposites — one sweet, restrained, and devoted; the other raunchy, angry, and uncommitted — form together out of two sets of best friends in Los Angeles. Danny (Michael Ealy) and Debbie (Joy Bryant) are the nice ones. Back in the day when this movie (or at least a version of it) starred Rob Lowe and Demi Moore, they would have been called ''yuppies,'' and by that I mean less their status than their style: the intimate meals consumed with wine under mood lighting at the kitchen island, the way the two hold their feelings in. Anna Kendrick dives into 'The Last Five Years' with Jeremy Jordan . Of course, yuppie style in the movies is often code for People Who Live Too Much On the Surface to Have a Good Relationship, but it's clear early on that Danny and Debbie really are meant for each other. Their lovey-dovey moments are genuine and, on occasion, touching — like when he takes her to a Dodgers game with lousy bleachers season tickets that have been in his family for decades, and she loves him for holding on to them. The plot of most romantic comedies consists of the things that get in the way of two people getting together. That's what happens in ""About Last Night,"" too, except that the only thing getting in the way of Danny and Debbie getting together is their own relationship. They hold everything up to a microscope and become convinced that their foibles are fatal. They also fall apart with a little help from their friends. As soon as Bernie (Kevin Hart) and Joan (Regina Hall) meet, they know how to do exactly three things: drink, fight, and go to bed in lusty, nasty ways. But it's not just that they like ragging on each other and then making up by doing things like having sex with one of them wearing a chicken mask. Bernie, a devoted bachelor, isn't so much scared of commitment as he is blithely, belligerently contemptuous of it, and Joan, a dental hygienist, treats love as if it were plaque — as something to be removed. The two spread their toxic belief that love is a second-rate emotion into the hearts of their two (wiser) pals, who start, almost in spite of themselves, to listen to them. Casting Net: Zach Galifianakis may team up with Julianne Moore . When ""About Last Night"" is funny, which is every so often, it's because of Kevin Hart. He now owns the fastest mouth in movie comedy, and he knows how to employ his whole high-pitched Chris Tucker street-fury style so that it expresses something more humane than it did when Tucker was ruling the screen with it. In ""About Last Night,"" Hart blows up, to hilariously oversize proportions, the eternal male desire for freedom. He's raunch on wheels. On paper, ""About Last Night"" is a third-generation copy of David Mamet's 1974 stage play ""Sexual Perversity"" in Chicago — but if anything, the way the material has now been rewritten again, it comes closer to Mamet's rancorous vision of dueling hormones than the '80s screen version did. That said, the play itself was just a trifle (though it once seemed novel, much more than it does 40 years later, for the vital vulgarity of Mamet's voice). The 1986 ""About Last Night"" was watchable but mediocre, and the new version is watchable ... and a bit less mediocre. You always know, in essence, where it's going, and I wish that Ealy and Bryant seemed less like a truly nice couple and more like movie stars. By the end, however, the movie has captured something undeniably genuine about contemporary relationships: all the ways that they can, and will, get in their own way. Grade: B .
