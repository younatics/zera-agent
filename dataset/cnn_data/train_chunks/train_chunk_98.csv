"Van, Turkey (CNN) -- The death toll from Wednesday's 5.6-magnitude earthquake in eastern Turkey has risen to 40, the government said Sunday. A much deadlier 7.2 magnitude quake that tore through Van last month left 604 people dead, officials said. Twenty-six people have been rescued as a result of Wednesday's quake. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the Van region Saturday, as a heavy snowstorm hampered rescue efforts. The sleet, snow and plunging temperatures also worsened conditions for hundreds of thousands of earthquake survivors living outdoors. Freezing temperatures were expected to continue Sunday, with a bit of warming ahead Monday and Tuesday. ""It's not possible for us to survive the winter here. The Van winter is very cold and there's a lot of snow. Living in these shelters is impossible,"" Cezmi Fazla said. He stood outside a small hut his family constructed out of Styrofoam and plywood. The hut was on the road outside Fazla's house, which was still standing but badly damaged after the earthquakes. Ten to 15 family members slept in the hut every night, including his wife and youngest child, as well as his father and brother. Fazla said he sent his three oldest children to relatives in the western Turkish city of Izmir after the first earthquake . ""We haven't gotten any aid,"" he said. ""We got a lot of support from the people of Turkey, packages with everything from clothes to toothpaste. But the elected officials, the nongovernmental organizations are not making good use of it and were not good at coordinating those efforts. So people feel very panicked. That's made a lot of people uncomfortable."" Frustration from earthquake survivors is palpable on the streets of Van, where almost all of the shops are closed after the earthquakes. ""I condemn Tayyip Erdogan,"" yelled Muhsin Tarhan, referring to Turkey's prime minister. He was walking down the street with his wife and six children looking to scavenge plastic and wood to build a shelter. ""We have been buried in the rain, and snow and cold and Recep Tayyip Erdogan does nothing. He only helps those who are supporters of his political party."" There is a deep distrust of the Turkish state among many of Van's ethnic Kurdish residents. In interviews with CNN, many residents even challenged the government's 5.6 magnitude rating of Wednesday's earthquake, claiming it was secretly downgraded, even though the U.S. Geological Survey reported an identical 5.6 magnitude. Southeastern Turkey lies along turbulent geological and ethnic fault lines. For decades, the region has been the main battlefield of a long-running guerrilla war between Kurdish separatist rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Turkish security forces. On Thursday, tensions boiled over just yards from the rescue operation near the rubble of the Bayram Hotel, when a small crowd of protesters confronted Turkish government officials, demanding the resignation of the Van governor. Turkish riot police armed with clubs and shields later attacked the demonstrators. In remarks to journalists on Friday, Erdogan denounced the demonstrators, calling them saboteurs who were hampering the recovery effort. Journalists were assembled awaiting a press conference with the prime minister. But after Erdogan met with disaster relief officials for more than an hour, the press conference was canceled, without explanation. Two Turkish journalists were among the dead from Wednesday's quake. Sebahattin Yilmaz and Cem Emir with the DHA news agency had been covering the aftermath of the 7.2 magnitude quake. They were buried in the rubble of the five-story Bayram Hotel, which collapsed on Wednesday. A Japanese volunteer who had traveled to Turkey to assist with recovery operations was among other casualties of the demolished hotel.","26 people have been rescued from Wednesday's quake .

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks threw open the doors Friday to its archive of more than a quarter million secret U.S. diplomatic cables, unfiltered and unedited, exposing and possibly endangering confidential diplomatic sources. The website made the controversial decision after losing control of the documents in a series of blunders. WikiLeaks supporters posted the entire encrypted archive on the internet late last year. Separately, David Leigh, the investigative editor of the Guardian newspaper, formerly one of Wikileaks media partners, published the password to unlock the archive in his book ""Inside WikiLeaks: Julian Assange's War on Secrecy"". Together, both pieces of information, unlocked the full trove of U.S. diplomatic cables, accessible to anyone on the web. But WikiLeaks' decision to open its archive is likely to bring the cables to a much wider audience -- and has already sparked criticism that it will put people at risk. A brief search through the cables shows that documents have not been redacted in any way. The names and other details of confidential diplomatic sources are on full display, despite being labelled with the instruction ""strictly protect"", including cables classified as ""secret"" or ""confidential."" The Guardian, the New York Times, Der Spiegel and El Pais, four of WikiLeaks' former media partners, condemned the release. In a joint statement they said: ""We deplore the decision of WikiLeaks to publish the unredacted State Department cables, which may put sources at risk. ""Our previous dealings with WikiLeaks were on the clear basis that we would only publish cables which had been subjected to a thorough editing and clearance process. ""We will continue to defend our collaborative publishing endeavour. We cannot defend the needless publication of the complete data -- indeed, we are united in condemning it. Today's decision to publish by Julian Assange was his, and his alone."" Reporters Without Borders announced late Thursday it was suspending a WikiLeaks ""mirror site"" because of concerns over potential risks to sources. In an editorial, it wrote that on launching the mirror site late last year, Reporters Without Borders ""said it defended 'the free flow of information online and the principle of the protection of sources, without which investigative journalism cannot exist.' ""As the protection of sources is now in question, Reporters Without Borders has decided to suspend the site pending further clarification."" WikiLeaks posted Friday on Twitter: ""Shining a light on 45 years of U.S. 'diplomacy', it is time to open the archives forever."" The organization also gave full instructions on how to download all 251,287 cables. WikiLeaks appealed for members of the public to ""crowdsource"" the cables and publish their findings on Twitter under the hashtag #wlfind. Crowdsourcing is the act of outsourcing tasks to an undefined, large group through an public call -- in this case to publish parts of the cables. The reason, according to a statement posted by WikiLeaks on Twitter: ""The entire world press does not have enough resources and there are substantial biases."" U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told CNN Thursday: ""WikiLeaks did advise us of the impending release of information and of its intention to continue to release classified documents. ""We have made clear our views and concerns about illegally disclosed classified information and the continuing risk to individuals and national security that such releases cause. ""WikiLeaks has, however, ignored our requests not to release or disseminate any U.S. documents it may possess and has continued its well-established pattern of irresponsible, reckless, and frankly dangerous actions. We are not cooperating with them.""","NEW: Reporters Without Borders suspends a WikiLeaks ""mirror site"" over concerns .

"Kirkuk, Iraq (CNN) -- Three U.S. soldiers detailed the shooting death of their platoon leader for an Iraqi judge Sunday in an effort to preserve a case that will be tried months after U.S. troops have left the country. It is one of a number of cases in recent months where a U.S. military attorney and an Iraqi prosecutor have worked together to bring charges against those accused of targeting American troops, though it is one of the first murder cases to be brought before a judge just weeks ahead of the U.S. pullout from Iraq. ""Today, we came to court to preserve the testimony of soldiers in a pending criminal case that will be tried in an Iraqi court, and we bring the testimony today because the American forces are going to be gone soon,"" Army Maj. Franklin D. Rosenblatt, an attorney working on the case, told CNN. The U.S. military took the step of having American soldiers provide testimony because ""we are no longer going to be able to show up here in the court,"" Rosenblatt said. The November 3 shooting of 1st Lt. Dustin D. Vincent -- one of the last U.S. casualties in the more-than-eight-year Iraq war -- was chronicled by insurgents who captured the sniper shooting on video and posted it online. Inside a crowded courthouse, one of the soldiers who was with the 25-year-old Vincent the day he was killed told the investigative judge that a ""few days later a video was posted that claimed the killing of the 1st lieutenant, and it shows the same location we were that day."" The video, which was played for the judge, was set to music and showed what appeared to be a soldier on the top of an armored vehicle, at a distance from the camera. On his back, which was to the camera, was a superimposed sniper's crosshair cursor. Then there is the sound of a gunshot, and the soldier drops from view. His comrades testified that Vincent, of Mesquite, Texas, was killed when his convoy stopped in Kirkuk's volatile al-Wasiti district, a mixed Sunni-Turkomen neighborhood in the northern Iraqi city. The convoy stopped to fix an electrical cable on the top of one of Vincent's armored vehicles -- ""Then we heard a shot,"" one of the soldiers told the judge. Two of the soldiers testified they got out of their armored vehicle to aid Vincent, who was shot in the upper right portion of his chest. ""He was wearing a vest, but it hit the upper side of the vest,"" the same soldier said. Later, the soldiers said, they were told Iraqi police apprehended a suspect. The American soldiers who testified are still carrying out missions in Iraq and are not being identified at the request of the U.S. military. Rosenblatt asked to submit the case to the court on behalf of the U.S. Army. The Iraqi prosecutor, who also asked not to be identified as a security precaution, said the case against the suspected sniper could take up to seven months before it is decided by the court. In addition to the testimony of the soldiers and the video, the prosecutor told CNN other evidence was presented to the judge. ""We told the judge that we have witnesses and a secret witness, and we will try to bring him to court as soon as possible,"" the prosecutor said. It was not clear who the additional witnesses were, and the prosecutor did not identify them out of a concern for their safety. The U.S. military has successfully pressed for the prosecution of four people who have been convicted in recent months of targeting U.S. personnel at Contingency Operating Site, the American base on the outskirts of Kirkuk, with rockets or roadside bombs. ""I think in Kirkuk, it's a big step that at least they allow us to come here to the courthouse, and here we have seen some real results lately,"" Rosenblatt said. ""They have been willing to take on the cases of the terrorists who have attacked the U.S. troops, and I think that is a real good sign."" Vincent is the second American soldier to be killed in Kirkuk in a little more than a month. A rocket attack in late September killed Spc. Adrian Mills, 23, of Newnan, Georgia, and wounded at least four others. While violence has fallen off across much of Iraq, bombings and shootings are a near-daily occurrence in the disputed city, which is home to nearly a third of the country's oil reserves. Kirkuk is populated by ethnic Kurds, Arabs and Turkomen. Tensions among the groups run high in the city, to which the Iraqi government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region have both laid claim.","A sniper killed 1st Lt.

"(CNN) -- Larry Flynt, porn publisher and erstwhile snoop into the sex lives of politicians, has offered a job to disgraced former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner. Flynt, founder of Hustler Magazine, made the job offer in a letter that was published in The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""This offer is not made in jest,"" wrote Flynt. ""Just as we do not undertake insincere political crusades, we do not make insincere job offers."" Weiner could not be immediately reached for comment. Where does Weiner go from here? Flynt's job offer came within hours of the congressman's resignation on Thursday over a sexting scandal. In the letter, Flynt offered to give Weiner a 20% raise above the salary he earned in the U.S. House of Representatives, ensuring the former congressman's medical benefits would match what he had received in office. Flynt also offered to pay Weiner's moving expenses to Beverly Hills, California. ""While this employment opportunity is being offered in large part due to your qualifications and clear passion for making a change,"" Flynt wrote, ""I feel that your unfortunate resignation is a prime example of unfounded political pressure and the hypocrisy that has invaded democracy in Washington, D.C."" The job offer was the second made by Flynt to a politician within the past year. Recent political sex scandals . In October, he offered to hire Republican Carl Paladino after the socially conservative gubernatorial candidate garnered headlines over pornographic images circulated to friends and colleagues. The tone of Flynt's purported job offer to Paladino was markedly different than Weiner's. ""It's clear that 'values purporting' Carl Paladino has a keen instinct for kinky sex,"" Flynt said in a news release at the time. ""He is a natural pornographer who has a skilled eye for unusual views and acrobatics ... It's clear he's better suited to join our team than be the governor of the state of New York."" Paladino lost the election to Democrat Andrew Cuomo. In 1998, during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair, Flynt offered $1 million to anyone with evidence of sexual misconduct against Republican lawmakers leading the effort against Clinton. He published some of the evidence he obtained.","Flynt offers Anthony Weiner a 20% raise .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Dramatic video posted to YouTube purports to show the initial moments of an attack against Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Maria Corina Machado and her supporters. The video begins with the candidate addressing residents and reporters shortly after she threw the first pitch in a softball game. Thirty seconds into the roughly 50-second clip, several gunshots ring out; people scatter. Some board a bus while a voice in the video shouts: ""Go, go, go!"" CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video, allegedly taken on Saturday in a neighborhood on the east side of the capital, Caracas. Separately, El Nacional newspaper published a photo of what it said was the shooting, showing two people on a motorcycle. Wearing a red T-shirt, the man on the back is pointing a gun at a bus. It was not clear from the video whether Machado boarded the bus, nor whether the bus in the video was the same as the one in the photograph. However, a campaign spokesman told CNN en EspaÃ±ol a pair of people on a motorcycle fired shots into a bus carrying Machado and her supporters. Machado, who was not injured in the incident, also said that shots were fired in the open, and at her vehicle. Machado is one of several presidential candidates who will participate in a primary election next year. The winner will be the unity opposition candidate to run against President Hugo Chavez. She spoke to CNN en EspaÃ±ol shortly after the attack, which Machado said left one person injured. She blamed ""criminal gangs"" for the shooting and faulted the national government for ceding control. ""The government has absolutely lost control and, in many cases, has been complicit with the criminal gangs,"" she said. Machado accused the government of providing some groups with weapons. CNN contacted the Interior and Justice Ministry and the Venezuelan Ministry of Communication and Information for comment on the incident, but did not receive a response. Journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","Shots are fired at presidential candidate Maria Corina Machado .

"(CNN) -- ""You are obviously, to me, always going to be The Dude,"" Piers Morgan said to Jeff Bridges, referring to the actor's title role in the 1998 Coen brothers movie, ""The Big Lebowski."" The Oscar-winning actor is a guest on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Bridges, who took a year off from movies to focus on his music career, will release his self-titled album August 16. ""You're The Dude,"" continued Morgan. ""To millions of people around the world, Jeff Bridges, you will always be The Dude. I can't pretend anything else."" The CNN host proudly stated that he ""ritually"" watches ""Lebowski"" annually. Bridges said from the moment he read the script, he knew the film was destined to be a classic. ""I read that thing and I, you know, it made me laugh -- all the way through it,"" said Bridges. ""John Goodman came out with a great quote about your performance,"" said Morgan. ""He said, 'It's like watching a diamond cutter. When you look at the diamond, you don't think of the work, you just notice there are no flaws.' "" Bridges, whose Hollywood career has spanned some 40 years and 60 films, openly admitted that he owes his great success to his veteran actor dad, Lloyd Bridges. ""I'm a product of nepotism,"" said Bridges. ""My dad, you know... the hardest thing about acting as a profession is getting the break."" When Morgan pointed out Bridges' reputation as ""the nicest guy in show business,"" the younger Bridges again credited his father's guidance. ""You know, I take my lead from my old man,"" said Bridges, ""Who loved showbiz so much and, yes, I got to work with him as a kid on 'Sea Hunt.' You know, whenever there was a role for the little kid, he'd say, 'Come on, get out of school and come and play with Dad.'"" Bridges, who also worked alongside his father as an adult, told Morgan, ""I saw, when he came on the set, how much fun he was having and how that fun was kind of contagious."" Bridges also admitted that when he won the best actor Oscar for ""Crazy Heart,"" all he could think about was his parents. ""I felt my folks,"" said Bridges. ""I feel like I'm an extension of them, really."" Bridges' parents met in the UCLA drama department. Bridges also recalled working with his brother, Beau, on the 1989 film, ""The Fabulous Baker Boys."" ""What a dream that was,"" said Bridges. ""Beau, music and Michelle (Pfeiffer), my God -- a dream come true!"" Bridges and his wife of 34 years, Susan, have three daughters and recently became grandparents for the first time. The couple originally met on a movie set in Montana. Morgan asked Bridges, who at one point had considered forgoing acting in favor of music, where his musical inspiration came from. ""Well, Beau, my big brother, you know, he's eight years older than I am,"" said Bridges. ""So my early memories are Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Buddy Holly and those guys. I remember he had a white Danelectro guitar that I really coveted and finally stole from him."" When Morgan asked Bridges about the struggle he underwent when deciding between film and music, Bridges said ""the movie thing took off, and it was like I, you know, a path of least resistance kind of thing. And I, like I said, I enjoyed it."" During his Hollywood hiatus, aside from recording the album, Bridges also took the time to focus on his work as a spokesman for the No Kid Hungry Campaign. ""It's about ending childhood hunger here in America,"" said Bridges. ""And we're doing that by going state by state, working with governors and mayors and heads of food pantries and so forth, finding out what is the -- where's the bottleneck? ""Because here in America, we have enough food; we have programs that we know can end hunger. But it's the access to those programs that's really a huge problem.""

"(Financial Times) -- Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, has called for a generational change in the country's gerontocratic leadership, and urged the government to move faster to implement reforms that would help meet its young population's economic ambitions. ""We've had a mystery [in India] where we think that [important] jobs can only be done by 60-yearr-old plus [people]. . . I think we're now fast moving to say that our 40-year-olds can take more responsibility and can perform better,"" Mr Ambani, 54, told business leaders and policymakers at the World Economic Forum's India Economic Summit in Mumbai. He added that moving towards ""leadership [that] reflects our demographics"", should be a top priority for the country. The tycoon's call for younger leadership comes as 41-year-old Rahul Gandhi prepares to take greater responsibility in India's ruling Congress party from his ailing mother Sonia, the party president, and as the country's economy recedes from much-wanted double-digit growth. Many political analysts are expecting an imminent transition of power in which Mr Gandhi -- the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty -- takes a more visible role following the treatment of his 64-year-old mother for an unknown illness in the US over the summer. Some expect him to take the party's presidency before crucial elections in Uttar Pradesh next year. About 70 per cent of India's 1.2bn people are under 35. Mr Ambani's call to ""align leadership with demographics"" is an appeal for greater dynamism in Asia's third largest economy at a time when the administration of Manmohan Singh, the 79-year-old prime minister, is flagging. The opposition Bharatiya Janata party is led by the 83-year old L.K. Advani. Likewise, some of its leading businesses, such as the Tata Group, are led by septuagenarians. One of the top complaints of Mumbai industrialists, alongside high domestic borrowing costs, is paralysis in India's parliament and bureaucracy following a slew of embarrassing high-profile corruption scandals. Mr Singh and his top economic team were absent from the WEF, viewed as a key investment showcase held this year for the first time in India's financial capital. Previously, Mr Singh has used the event to sell his country's prospects to foreign investors. Janmejaya Sinha, the chairman of the Boston Consulting Group in the Asia-Pacific region, said: ""The government's record in addressing the big issues is abysmal."" ""The issues are ethical not economic, but we keep saying it is an economic problem,"" he said about New Delhi's failure to push through improvements in education, healthcare and power. Mr Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, India's largest family-controlled conglomerate by market capitalisation, emphasised that it was essential for the government to speed up reform to meet the demands of the fast growing private sector. ""The reality is that India is a land of a billion opportunities and not of a billion problems,"" he said. Room at the top . Oldies .

"(CNN) -- The young Afghan girl sits in the center of the room, weeping. Using her hand and her blue scarf to hide her face, she recounts how she was brutally raped by five gunmen. The 12-year-old girl, gang-raped in Afghanistan, weeps as her family demands justice. The girl's tragic case is one of many in war-torn Afghanistan, activists say. The 12-year-old girl's family members say they'll take their own lives unless justice is served. ""We will all commit suicide; this is not living,"" cries the mother of the girl, whose gang-rape occurred in Northern Afghanistan. The girl's adolescent voice pleads for help from Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan. The girl's elderly and immobilized father trembles and can only raise a quivering hand as he sobs. He is rendered helpless in a country where a man's dignity and honor is protecting his family. Her little brother sits in the back, far too young to understand the situation but still traumatized by the devastated cries around him. He wipes away his tears. The children's mother sobs. ""We've been violated. We can't live our lives. We can't sit. We can't sleep at night,"" she says. Video of the crushed family aired on the privately owned Ariana TV two weeks ago before it was posted on the Internet by an activist group, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. In a country riddled with corruption, despair and lawlessness, the family has risked their lives by coming forward. They have since met with Karzai, according to an aide who said the president wept with the family and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Karzai has fired the police chief from the city where the attack occurred, the aide said. The family lives in a government-provided safe house in Kabul, Afghanistan. ""This is just an example among thousands of other cases,"" says Shaima, a member of RAWA. ""The rest go unnoticed by the media."" Shaima is not her real name; she uses it to protect her identity. RAWA members themselves have often been targeted for raising taboo issues in a culture in which women and children are often treated as second-class citizens. ""Women and girls, especially young girls, are the most unprotected people of Afghanistan. They are raped, kidnapped and murdered,"" Shaima says. Just last week, a 3-year-old girl was kidnapped and raped by unidentified men, a government official confirms. The toddler was later released and, the official says, is recovering. ""Rapists are roaming around with impunity,"" Shaima says, turning her attention to a man -- said to be the son of a powerful official -- who is accused of raping 22 girls in the northern province of Sar-I-Pul. Sayed Nurallah says his 14-year-old daughter was one of the aforementioned victims. Nurallah says that coming forward with his daughter's story makes him a target, which he firmly accepts. He says that seeking justice for his daughter is a matter of integrity. ""She wakes up in the middle of the night screaming,"" Nurallah says of his daughter. ""Her arms, legs, her body -- she is always tense and frightened."" Nurallah also pleads for justice. ""I have one question for Mr. Karzai: If this was your little girl, what would you do?"" His firm tone changes to one of grief. He breaks into quiet sobs. ""I just want justice for my child,"" he says. Shaima says justice is hard to find. ""These criminals are never brought to justice, because police and government authorities are either involved or they can't handle the crimes,"" she explains. ""With criminals and warlords in the political scene, we cannot expect justice to be served."" Another factor that impedes victims from coming forward is some interpretations of Sharia, or Islamic law. Some authorities rule for a rape to be validated, victims must have four witnesses to the crime. If not, the victims can be charged with fornication or adultery. Statistics quantifying crimes against children are hard to come by in Afghanistan, an impoverished nation ravaged by three decades of war. In March, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said that deteriorating security in large parts of the country, a growing culture of criminal impunity, weak law enforcement institutions, poverty and other factors had contributed to increasing violence against women, such as rape and torture. The commission also said that Afghan girls are often forced into marriages against their will. Radhika Coomaraswamy, the U.N. special representative for children in armed conflict, plans to release a report in October on the state of Afghan children. Coomaraswamy went to Afghanistan this summer to establish a monitoring and reporting system on what is deemed as grave violations committed against children. ""In many cases of violence against children, there is a sense of impunity. People continue to violate children's rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable,"" Coomaraswamy said. She found that sexual violence against young boys is also a problem. In what is known as ""bacha-bazi,"" or ""child's play,"" boys are forced to dress in female attire, dance and perform sexual acts. ""I can't think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in Afghanistan,"" Coomaraswamy says. ""In all our meetings with children, it takes a lot of time to make them smile. That to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts."" She hopes that the monitoring program will deter people from taking advantage of the vulnerability of children in the combat zone. Coomaraswamy does concede that the Afghan government alone cannot do much right now. ""War has completely destroyed that administrative infrastructure,"" Coomaraswamy says, ""even if they had the laws, it is impossible to implement.""","Young rape victim's family vows to commit suicide unless justice is served .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. Motherboard.tv is Vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- From a quiet swath of English countryside, some one and a half hours outside of London, researchers are receiving radio messages from the farthest reaches of the universe. To do it, they're relying on one of astronomy's newest and largest gadgets -- the Low Frequency Radio Array radio telescope. The new, clever Dutch and EU-wide installation uses 15,000 low-tech receivers, supercomputer data processing and high-speed internet to form a mega-telescope capable of absorbing cosmic radio waves from the full sky at higher resolutions than ever before. When the British section of the telescope opened late last year, Motherboard attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony and met some of the scientists involved. For centuries, astronomy centered around what could be observed with our most wonderful and yet meager visual tool -- the eye. But in the last 50 years, the ability to receive radio waves, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, and X- and gamma rays -- all of them at different wavelengths than visible light -- has provided new and completely unexpected information about the nature and history of the universe. The resulting data and images from radio astronomy (despite the ""radio"" part, you can't listen to these radio signals) have yielded a cosmic zoo of strange and exotic objects, including radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, masers, and cosmic microwave background radiation, which has provided compelling evidence for the Big Bang. But we have yet to deeply explore the low radio frequencies, the lowest energy extreme of the spectrum accessible from Earth. The wider the distance between the antennae, the higher the resolution of the ""picture"" that a radio telescope can make. Hence the large footprint of most radio telescope projects, from the Giant Meter-wavelength Radio Telescope in India to the Very Large Array in New Mexico. LOFAR is capable of producing even more accurate ""images"" than its predecessors. With more resolution than any other telescope, the 1500 km-wide LOFAR array is opening this frontier to a broad range of astrophysical studies, including transient sources, ultra high energy cosmic rays, cosmic magnetism, and the wonderfully-named Epoch of Reionization, when the first stars and black holes made the universe hot. This research will only accelerate over the next decades, as scientists build LOFAR's successor, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Watch the rest of ""The Biggest Telescope on Earth"" at Motherboard.tv . In the first research to emerge from LOFAR, to be published this month, scientists say that the telescope will lead to a tenfold leap in new discoveries of pulsars -- the peculiar stars whose highly-regular spin can be used as a kind of clock, and effectively, as a test of Einstein's theory of general relativity. By observing pulsars as they beam toward Earth from different directions, astronomers are able to detect minute differences as the signals arrive, caused by the gravity waves that Einstein predicted would distort space-time in different directions. If gravity waves are real, one of these ""clocks"" would seem to be running slowly. Also announced this week by an international team of astronomers -- LOFAR has made the deepest wide-field images of the sky in the relatively unexplored part of the radio spectrum around 150 MHz. To process data from across the network, the Chilbolton telescope and the supercomputer in the Netherlands require an internet speed of 10 gigabits per second -- more than 1000 times faster than your typical home broadband speed. That's just the kind of bandwidth you need when you're downloading the far reaches of the cosmos.","Low Frequency Radio Array telescope, or LOFAR, is the largest telescope on Earth .

"(CNN) -- A New Zealand rugby star has apologized for his reported alcohol-fueled incident last week, when the 2011 World Cup winner is said to have entered a Cook Islands bar naked and wet before assaulting two patrons. According to the New Zealand Herald newspaper, Zac Guildford -- who has a history of drinking problems -- embarked on the rampage on the island of Rarotonga. ""Firstly, I would like to apologize for my behavior here in Rarotonga on Thursday night,"" the 22-year-old said in a statement on the All Blacks' official website. ""I have no clear recollection of the events of that night but there is no doubt that my behavior was unacceptable and I am hugely embarrassed by what happened. ""I want to apologize to the people who I was involved with and offended that night, the patrons and staff who witnessed my behavior, and the Cook Island people. I am truly sorry for what I did."" It is not the first time Guildford has found himself in hot water as a result of his off-field antics. He was reprimanded by team management for a similar binge following the All Blacks' Tri-Nations defeat to Australia in August. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) revealed that the winger -- who scored four tries against Canada in his only game of the recent World Cup -- has been called in front of the disciplinary board on three occasions in the last 18 months. Guildford, who plays for Christchurch-based franchise Crusaders in the Super Rugby competition, expressed his regret for the embarrassment he had caused his family. ""I don't want any sympathy for the situation I have ended up in, but I am thankful for the support I have received so far from so many people,"" he said. ""It's obvious that I need help and I want to get home and to get that help as soon as I can. I need to sort myself out."" NZRU general manager Neil Sorensen defended Guildford, saying he was a good person who is struggling to come to terms with the loss of his father in 2009. Rob Guildford died from a suspected heart attack after seeing his son score two tries for New Zealand in the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Japan. ""The first thing we'll do is find out the facts,"" Sorensen told the Dominion Post newspaper. ""The second thing we will do is help the guy if he is in trouble. ""He lost his dad a couple of years ago. He's also had some alcohol-related issues in the past. He's a good young man."" Crusaders coach Todd Blackadder echoed Sorensen's sentiments, claiming Guildford would benefit from the backing of his friends and family. ""One thing that I do think he needs is to have rugby back in his life,"" Blackadder said. ""He needs the support of all his family and his friends, and he needs to be in a good supportive environment. ""There's no point in taking him through the judiciary process right here and now when he needs more than that. This is more of an issue than a one-night drinking binge."" Guildford made his All Blacks debut against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in November 2009 and has represented New Zealand on eight occasions.","New Zealand's Zac Guildford has apologized for an incident in the Cook Islands last week .

"(CNN) -- Striker Asamoah Gyan has told CNN the pressure will be on Ghana to win the African Cup of Nations (CAN) when the tournament gets underway in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon in January. The Black Stars are four-time winners of the continent's biennial football tournament, but have not lifted the trophy since emerging victorious in Libya 29 years ago. With traditional African football giants such as seven-time CAN winners Egypt and Cameroon, champions on four occasions, failing to qualify for next year's competition, Gyan admits the pressure will be on Ghana to perform. ""A team like Ghana, people are wondering why we don't win the African Cup of Nations and it's a big worry to our fans,"" the 25-year-old said. 2012 African Cup of Nations draw . ""You can see that there are many giants who are out of the competition. You're talking about Cameroon, you're talking about Nigeria (double CAN winners), Egypt as well. So now the pressure is going to be on us, because we did so well in the World Cup."" Last year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa saw Ghana reach the quarterfinals in only their second appearance in football's premier competition, eventually losing on penalties to Oscar Tabarez's Uruguay. Gyan, who is currently on a season-long loan at United Arab Emirates (UAE) team Al-Ain from English Premier League outfit Sunderland, warned against coach Goran Stevanovic's team becoming complacent during the tournament. ""The other countries, we have to know that they are coming to win,"" he said. ""That's what we have to watch out for, we can't be swollen headed. ""We have to stick to our game plan. I think we have quality players who are capable of winning the CAN as well, so we have to see what is going to happen."" Toure: Man City can be like Barcelona . Gyan surprised many when he chose to leave England to join Al-Ain in September, but the forward, who has also played for French club Rennes, explained how he hopes his transfer will boost the club's profile in Africa. ""People move there at the end of their careers,"" he said. ""Why do they move there? People might say because of money, because they want to finish their career there. ""I moved there while I'm on top of my game. That means I'm going to play good football and I want to bring exposure there ... As an African, people look up to me. ""There are a lot of people watching on the television. It's the big games like Manchester United playing Chelsea, but now even if United is playing, people don't watch it, they watch Sunderland. ""So do you see the difference? When I moved to Sunderland, I brought more exposure to the league in Africa."" Gyan's transfer to Al-Ain is temporary, with the one-time Udinese striker still contracted to Steve Bruce's Sunderland. The Accra native is unsure what the future holds and has not ruled out a move back to Europe or England. ""I'm going to decide at the end of the season whether to move back to Europe or wherever I want to go. It depends on me the player, and my happiness. ""Everyone wants to play in England. I really enjoyed myself last season and I had many fans. Everyone was happy with my performance and I really, really enjoyed myself.""

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Citing security concerns, the U.S. State Department has revoked the visas it recently issued to three Gaza students who were awarded Fulbright scholarships to study in the United States. Sari Bashi, who advocates freedom of movement for Palestinians, says their access to education is restricted. It marks the second time in two months that the United States has gone back on its offer to the Palestinian students to take part in the American government-sponsored scholarship program. The three students who had their visas revoked were sent a letter from the American Consulate in Jerusalem, dated August 4. ""The Department of State has revoked your nonimmigrant visa"" because ""information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the United States and ineligible to receive a visa under Section 212 (A) (3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits issuance of a visa to aliens for security and related grounds,"" the letter said. The letter did not elaborate on what the security concerns were. A State Department official told CNN that the agency could not disclose any information about the reason for the visa revocation, but that the students would be allowed to reapply for a visa at some point in the future. The three students are among seven Gaza-based Fulbright scholars who made headlines when in May the State Department sent them e-mail notifications saying their scholarships could not be completed because the Israeli government would not issue them exit visas from Gaza. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack admitted that the U.S. authorities had not taken up the matter with Israel until after the matter became public. The scholarships were only reinstated after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed her unhappiness with the situation and the State Department spokesman admitted that a ""faulty decision-making process"" led to the communication. According to Sari Bashi, the executive-director of Gisha, an Israeli non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of movement for Palestinians and has been working closely with the students, four of the seven Fulbright students were cleared for travel out of Gaza by Israel, but the remaining three were prevented from leaving Gaza by the Israeli government, citing security concerns. In an unusual move, the American Consulate in Jerusalem processed the remaining three students' visa applications with mobile fingerprinting equipment at the Israel- Gaza border and granted the visas three weeks later at the end of July. Bashi said on Tuesday that one of the three students, Fidaa Abed, had already left Gaza for the United States and upon arrival at the airport in Washington was informed that his visa had been revoked and was sent back to Amman, Jordan, with instructions to return to Gaza. The other two Fulbright students remain in Gaza. Bashi said that while the situation of the three students is one of ""tremendous concern,"" it only underscores what she says is the larger problem of lack of access to higher education for hundreds of Gaza students who have been accepted into universities outside of Gaza but are prevented from leaving due to Israeli restrictions. Bashi said that ""alongside the few students denied visas for procedural, technical, or undisclosed security reasons, there are hundreds of students with valid visas in danger of losing their places at foreign universities because Israel refuses to even consider their requests to leave Gaza. ""Denying talented young people their right to access education does not contribute to building a better future in the region,"" Bashi said. Israeli government officials have long maintained that its restrictions on allowing students to travel outside of Gaza are based only on security considerations. ""We do act to facilitate students wishing to study at Western universities where they are exposed to liberal and democratic values,"" an Israeli government official said on Tuesday. But, the official said, Israel distinguishes between students wanting to study in the West and those wanting to study in places like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Syria or the West Bank. In the case of the West Bank, the official said Hamas could use this as a way of strengthening its activist base in the West Bank, which would be detrimental to Israel's security. ""There is no reason why we should do that,"" the Israeli official said. On the matter of the three students, the official said: ""The process of Israeli-American contacts on the matter did not cease, and more specific information was provided.""","U.S. State Department cites security concerns as reason visas were withdrawn .

"New York (CNN) -- This weekend's Iraqi election is testing the strength of the nation's young democracy and could be a turning point in the history of the Middle East, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In the March 7 election, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition in the Iraqi parliament is seeking to win enough votes to keep him in office for another term. On Thursday, a series of insurgent attacks led to the deaths of 29 people in the city of Baquba. Zakaria said the election could have a lasting impact: ""It might be the turning point in the rise of Iraq in the Middle East. Iraq is one of the largest, most important countries in the Arab world. It has the third or fourth largest petroleum reserves in the world. Even now it has $40 billion in oil revenues every year; it has a well-trained army thanks to the Americans. ""It is perhaps the beginning of a return to prominence in the Middle East. It is possible that 10 years from now we'll look back and say, while everyone was obsessing about the rise of Iran, the real story in the Middle East in these years was the rise of Iraq."" The Obama administration plans to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq by the end of August, leaving 50,000 Americans in advisory roles, who will leave by the end of 2011. Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" spoke to CNN on Thursday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What's at stake in the election? Fareed Zakaria: This is really the first genuine election Iraq will have since the American invasion. It is only the second time that Iraq is having an election for the full parliamentary term. And the first one had limited Sunni participation. There was a lot of violence surrounding it, and so it had a kind of air of abnormality to it. This is coming after a pretty stable period both politically and economically and also a period of very spirited campaigning, and so it has the potential to really consolidate Iraqi democracy and Iraqi political stability. But a lot will depend on what happens, not in the election itself, but right after. CNN: Why should Americans pay particular attention to what's happening with this election? Zakaria: Two reasons: First if Iraq is able to achieve some degree of consolidation in terms of its democracy, it will add dramatically to its political stability, which is of course the most important condition that will allow American forces to continue their withdrawal down to zero combat forces or close to zero combat forces, as President Obama has hoped. And the second is, if Iraq is able to consolidate as a democracy, it will mean there will have been some success in Iraq that we can point to for the vast investment and the vast expenditure of blood and treasure that the United States has put in. I'm not saying that you can make an easy statement that this justifies the invasion, I'm simply saying that there will be a very strong positive outcome in Iraq that will at least be set against the cost. And that positive outcome is that Iraq will be the first Arab country to have a genuine functioning democratic system with a free press, open economy and that is something of a revolution in the Middle East. CNN: How is the election shaping up? Zakaria: The most important part is what happens after the election. What you really have to watch is not how the winners are treated, but how the losers are treated, because Iraq has yet to demonstrate that it can handle the issue of minority rights properly. The Sunnis who were once the ruling elite are now somewhat marginalized. The Kurds have their own difficulties with the Baghdad government. The Christians have been very substantially persecuted in many different ways and often, very sadly, killed. So what Iraq has to demonstrate is that the majority, which will inevitably be largely Shia, has the capacity to give some form of representation to the various minorities within Iraq. Iraq has to show that it understands that democracy is not just majority rule but pluralism and inclusion for the various minority groups.. That's a very important point because while the Sunnis are the minority in Iraq, they are the majority everywhere else in the Arab world. So when Arabs look at Iraq, right now what they see is a kind of majority tyranny. CNN: Are you seeing any signs that the Shia majority is fully open to the kind of embrace of minority rights you're talking about? Zakaria: The most important sign is that the Shias have not consolidated as one bloc, so there are now various Shia groups, some of which are inclined to this kind of inclusion. Others are not. But at least it gives the voters choices, and the group that seems to be doing second best in the polls after Prime Minister Maliki's group is headed by Ayad Allawi, a former prime minister. He is a very secular-minded guy who has a lot of appeal to Sunnis, has Sunni partners in his coalition at very high levels and represents a very different kind of Shia politics, much more secular, much more inclusive. It's also worth saying that the Sunnis are not trying to resort to violence as a routine matter the way they were four or five years ago. They seem to understand that their path to rehabilitation lies in politics, not in civil war. Somebody once said to me, you will know the Iraqi insurgency is over once the Shia understand that they have won and the Sunnis understand that they have lost. And I think both those conditions have now been fulfilled. CNN: What's the impact of the violence we have seen so far? Zakaria: Minimal, because the violence has not been particularly dramatic. Look, Iraq is now an open society. It's very difficult to protect every café and every bus station, but most importantly it is not having much effect in deterring people from voting. When all is said and done, violence in Iraq is down 95 percent from 2006. While it's unfortunate, it is not debilitating. CNN: What's the potential impact of the elections on relations with Iran? Zakaria: One of the things that I've noticed is reports that are coming out that Iranian agents who used to spend a lot of time in Iraq are actually less present there than they had been in the past. That is perhaps in large measure because they're back in Iran trying to quell and counteract the green movement there. A consolidated government in Iraq with new legitimacy is going to be an Iraq that is less amenable to pressures from Iran. CNN: Based on where we are right now, how do you think history is going to judge the American invasion? Zakaria: We spent about a trillion dollars in Iraq, not to mention the loss of blood, which is tragic of course. Not just the Americans but many more Iraqis. So in the long arc of history was this worth it? You probably do need a little more time and perspective, and you do need to see how it turns out. But I think we could be heartened by the fact there are things we can place on the positive side of the ledger to balance the enormous costs that both the Iraqis and the Americans have paid. CNN: What impact do you think the election will have on the Obama administration's plan to withdraw troops from Iraq? Zakaria: The greater the political stability in Iraq, the easier it will be for the withdrawal to proceed apace. Right now I don't see a major obstacle to continuing the withdrawal. But on my Sunday program, David Petraeus hinted for the first time that there could be an arrangement reached with the Iraqi government under which a small contingent of American troops stay in Iraq for a longer period of time.","Iraq holds a key parliamentary election March 7 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Working on your weekend isn't always fun, but it was for me this past Saturday and Sunday. CNN's John King demonstrates the magic board. We had a lot of viewers ask about how we cover the elections, where our information comes from and what sort of gadgets we've got planned. And so what's BackStory for, if not to answer precisely those kinds of questions? So it was off to New York City and our election HQ at the Time Warner Center. If you're a coffee drinker (who isn't?) the first thing you notice is that my colleagues in the NYC newsroom have a view worth the national debt from...yes...the coffee room. Straight across Columbus Circle to Central Park in the fall/autumn. Here in Atlanta, the view is of, well, the coffee machine. But I digress. After meeting up with producer Terence Burke (a friend and colleague with whom I've shared experiences in Baghdad and had cleansing ales in multiple cities) we hit the newsroom. Now, I've been in the business more than 30 years (I started young, very young, ok?) and I've never seen such a scene. Dozens of technicians, producers, reporters, anchors et al in what seemed to be a scrum, but was in fact a ballet of sorts. Everyone knew their task and did it with a minimum of fuss. Tonight's coverage involves not one, but two packed control rooms, several hundred people across the US and indeed the world, and some high tech gadgets I wanted to take home and play with. They wouldn't let me. There's the John King Magic Wall-- and yes, you can see your house from there. What a machine! The data stored in there is simply staggering -- you can compare county results from four elections back. How county populations can swing a State. How the primary result in one State stacks up against polling data from yesterday. I got the feeling only John King REALLY knows all the cool stuff it can do. And it's all done with taps and finger moves on the screen.  Watch King zoom in on voters' homes » . And you really can see your house. The ""virtual Capitol"" is newer, and so perhaps cooler. I'm standing in the studio looking at an empty desk, and glance up at a monitor and see how a full model of the Capitol building has somehow been dropped on top of that desk (which is still empty). Then you can open the top of the Capitol (don't try this at home) and see how the seats are being won and lost as the night goes on. But for technology on steroids, wait till you see the hologram. Correspondents and guests in Chicago and Phoenix will magically appear in the New York studio, in a very Star Wars-ish manner. It takes dozens of cameras (yes, dozens), infra-red thingies (I'm not very technical) and a bunch of computers to make this happen. We haven't been allowed to show the images yet -- they're being saved for tonight's coverage. But I can tell you it seems to work pretty darn well. An intern subbing for a correspondent in Chicago magically appeared on the screen in front of me, just a few feet from Wolf Blitzer in New York. Wolf can't see it, but fakes it admirably. I'm not easily impressed these days, but my little visit to the Election Center was quite the eye opener.","CNN using prototype technology to bring election stats to life .

"(CNN) -- The president of The Citadel military college apologized on Monday for not reporting to law enforcement an allegation against a camp counselor involving sexual activity and a child. Asked by a reporter what he would tell victims and their families about the college's admitted lack of action, Lt. Gen. John Rosa responded: ""I'd say we're profoundly sorry. ""We're sorry that we didn't pursue it more. We acted on what we thought was our best information ... We did not pursue it enough."" Over the weekend, the nationally known South Carolina college detailed an abuse allegation against one if its alumni, Louis Neal ""Skip"" ReVille, 32, who was arrested late last month. He faces at least six charges, including three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of lewd act on a minor, according to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, police. Although police did not provide specifics of the charges, CNN affiliate WCBD-TV reported that ReVille is accused of molesting at least five boys. He has admitted guilt in at least three cases committed between November 2010 and October 2011, according to an affidavit filed in Charleston County court. The story has attracted national attention in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, which led to the ouster of that university's president and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno. Penn State suspect admits ""horsing around,"" denies abuse . In 2007, The Citadel received an allegation from a former camper that five years earlier, ReVille had invited the boy into his room at The Citadel Summer Camp to watch pornography. Another camper was also present. They did not touch each other, but engaged in sexual activity, the college said. ""Though the general counsel was unable to corroborate the accusation, the college continued its investigation with the camper's family, who made it clear they were very concerned about maintaining their privacy and not having their names publicized,"" Rosa and Doug Snyder, chairman of The Citadel Board of Visitors, said in a Saturday statement, referring to the camper who made the initial accusation. On Monday, Rosa went further. ""When the family did not pursue the matter, we did not either. We should have,"" he said. ""Regardless of whether the law said we were supposed to report or not, we should have reported this. We should have taken more action,"" said Rosa. An attorney representing the camper who originally reported the alleged abuse to The Citadel told reporters on Monday that the victim's family had asked the college to make sure no other children would be harmed. ""Had The Citadel come forward in 2007 ... what we're seeing now as a community may never have happened,"" said attorney Mullins McLeod. The victim's family had thought the college would report the incident and are ""grief-stricken"" with the knowledge that subsequent kids could have been abused, he said. The Citadel, in Charleston, South Carolina, has said a review of ReVille's records in 2007 revealed no other complaints, and his file included a clean background check. He was a highly respected cadet and denied the accusation, the college said. ""At the time, we took what we thought were the necessary steps. It's now clear we should have done more,"" said Rosa. He encouraged anyone with information regarding inappropriate behavior involving ReVille to contact police. ReVille's attorney, Craig Jones Jr., has said his client is sorry for what he did, according to WCBD. WCBD also reported that ReVille was the upper school principal at Coastal Christian Prep in Mount Pleasant, and had held a number of positions over the years working with area children. ""Hopefully the way he's cooperated, that's one way he can hopefully show ... do what he can to help the victims to whatever extent he can,"" Jones said, according to WCBD. ""There's no way that, obviously, he can repair the damage that's been done.""","""We should have done more,"" says Citadel President Lt. Gen. John Rosa .

"(CNN) -- The search for a 2-year old boy who went missing in suburban Seattle more than a week ago continued Monday with no new suspects or information in the case, Bellevue, Washington, police said. Maj. Mike Johnson said his department had received 900 tips in the boy's disappearance, but none ""have led to any high-priority actionable evidence."" Though none of those leads has led to a breakthrough in the investigation, Johnson urged the public to continue providing information in the case. He said the case could eventually become a ""criminal investigation,"" but ""we're not there."" ""All theories are viable, "" Johnson said. ""We have not ruled anything out as a possibility in this case. ... The thing that we're lacking is evidence."" Over the weekend, Johnson said police had expanded the search radius at the apartment in Redmond where toddler Sky Metalwala lived with his mother, Julia Biryukova, and the wooded area where she told police she last saw her son nine days ago. The brown-eyed boy with short, dark hair was last seen wearing a dark-green hooded sweatshirt and blue-and-gray-striped pants. On Friday, Johnson said the police were ""frustrated by the lack of information we're getting"" from the boy's mother. According to Johnson, Biryukova initially reported that she'd run out of gas early November 6 in Bellevue, just east of Seattle, leaving the toddler in the car while she took her 4-year-old with her to get help. Police later determined that the car had gas and was working. ""I'll let the evidence speak for itself, which is: There was gas in the car; the car was able to drive and operate,"" Johnson said. ""That's not what Julia told us."" But on Monday, Johnson told reporters that he was ""not comfortable calling her a person of interest or a suspect."" He said the boy's mother ""continues to cooperate,"" though she has not responded to requests issued through her attorney ""to come and talk to us at length."" ""It's something we're going to keep trying to do,"" the police major said of the outreach efforts to Biryukova. Other than the boy's mother and his 4-year-old sister, no one has reported seeing the toddler in the past two weeks, police spokeswoman Carla Lafrate said last week. Attorneys for Biryukova have declined to comment to CNN about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. Repeated attempts to reach Biryukova by CNN affiliates in the Bellevue and Redmond area have been unsuccessful. The father, Solomon Metalwala, who is separated from Biryukova, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Monday that he'd taken two polygraph tests in recent weeks, declining to offer details on whether he'd passed them or what questions he answered. ""He's always ready to assist law enforcement in any way,"" added his attorney, Leslie Clay Terry III. Solomon Metalwala said he hadn't seen the children since December, having lost custody of them. He added that he was getting ready for church the Sunday morning of November 6 when Biryukova reportedly woke the children up earlier to take his young son, Sky, for treatment at an area hospital. ""We've tried since January to get the children out of (Biryukova's) custody,"" Terry told HLN. Court records indicate Sky's parents have had a tumultuous relationship. Biryukova has said she feared for her safety and that of her children around the elder Metalwala, according to records. ""I am told by my husband Solomon (and) his family that if I take any action towards custody of our children he will take them out of the country (and) I will never see them again,"" she wrote in court papers. Metalwala responded in court filings that his wife suffered from mental health problems and was unable to care for the children on her own. Both parents were charged in 2009 with reckless endangerment for leaving then-3-month-old Sky alone in their parked car. Court records show they completed court-ordered parenting courses following the incident.","NEW: The missing boy's father takes polygraphs and is ""ready to assist"" authorities .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic produced her best form in almost two years to reach the semifinals of the Italian Open on Thursday, but hopes of an all-Williams last-four showdown ended when Venus suffered a humiliating defeat on the red clay. Ivanovic literally had the tennis world at her feet after winning the French Open in 2008, but she has since slumped to 58th in the rankings after a dismal past two seasons. However, the Serbian now has the chance to reach her first WTA Tour final since March 2009 after defeating 14th seed Nadia Petrova 6-2 7-5 to set up a clash with unseeded Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. The 22-year-old Ivanovic had not won back-to-back matches since January, but began her Rome campaign with a win over Russia's Elena Vesnina, then upset ninth seed Victoria Azarenka and registered her first-ever victory against Olympic champion Elena Dementieva on Wednesday. If she can beat Martinez Sanchez, she will face a final against either world No. 1 Serena Williams or the formerly top-ranked Jelena Jankovic. ""I think every player in one way or another goes through a tough time, and I think it is not how many times you fall but how many times you get back up,"" Ivanovic, who this year has been working with Steffi Graf's former coach Heinz Gunthardt, told reporters. ""This tournament and these victories that I have had this week mean a lot to me because I have put in so much work, not only in the last months but also the last year and it was just not happening. Now I am just so happy to be back on track."" Jankovic, who unlike her compatriot Ivanovic has never won a Grand Slam tournament, is also enjoying a career resurgence. The seventh seed followed up her demolition of No. 11 Yanina Wickmayer by crushing Venus Williams 6-0 6-1 in Thursday's late match, inflicting the fourth seed's worst defeat of her distinguished career. The 25-year-old Jankovic won at Indian Wells in March and then reached the quarterfinals at another U.S. event in Charleston and also in Stuttgart, Germany. Serena Williams, playing her first tournament since winning the year's opening Grand Slam, the Australian Open in late January, had her easiest win of the week as she dispatched Russia's Maria Kirilenko 6-1 6-4. The American, who lost in her first match last year, won 10 of the first 11 games before a series of errors let world No. 37 Kirilenko back into the match. Martinez Sanchez, who knocked out world No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday, progressed into the last four by defeating unseeded Czech Lucie Safarova 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.","Former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic reaches the semifinals of the Italian Open .

"Canberra, Australia (CNN) -- President Barack Obama traveled to Indonesia on Thursday after spending two days in Australia, where he declared that the United States will increase its military presence and expand its role in shaping the Asia Pacific region. ""Our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region,"" Obama told the Australian Parliament. ""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay."" He announced an agreement with Australia on Wednesday that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost America's presence in the region. In a speech a day later, Obama made it clear that the military expansion is a top priority in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, even as the United States faces the need to reduce mounting federal deficits and debt. ""As we end today's wars, I have directed my national security team to make our presence and missions in the Asia Pacific a top priority,"" Obama said. ""As a result, reductions in U.S. defense spending will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia Pacific."" The speech on the second day of his two-day trip to Australia, Obama's first as president, signaled a policy objective to compete head-on with China for influence in the region while also providing security assurances for allies. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that the policy comes in part from nations of the region seeking increased U.S. presence. ""The ability of the United States to help respond to contingencies is something that has been welcomed in recent years, whether, again, it was work that we're doing in the Philippines to counter violent extremism, work that we're doing to counter piracy in the region, the response to the tsunami in Indonesia,"" Rhodes said. ""So in other words, there's a demand signal from the nations of the region, and this is something that we're doing in concert with one of our closest allies. So we believe it's not just entirely appropriate, but an important step to dealing with the challenges of the future of the Asia Pacific region."" Under the military agreement announced Wednesday, up to 250 U.S. Marines will be sent to Darwin and the northern region of Australia for military exercises and training. Over the next several years their numbers are expected to climb to 2,500 -- a full Marine ground task force. U.S. quietly builds military capabilities in Pacific . In addition, Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Keltz, director of strategic planning and policy for the U.S. Pacific Command, told journalists in a telephone call Wednesday from Hawaii that the United States has based some of its most sophisticated weapons in the Pacific, including squadrons of F-22 fighters and C-17 transport planes. The F-22s provide leading-edge technology for potential air-to-air combat as well as cyber- and electronic warfare,"" Keltz said. They replaced older F-15s, he added. While U.S. officials cited the need to respond to regional natural disasters as a reason for the agreement, concern over China's military expansion is widely acknowledged as a driving factor. ""What we look at is how does our general force posture allow us to protect U.S. interests, protect our allies, and ... secure the region broadly,"" Rhodes said. ""China is obviously a piece of the Asia Pacific region, an emerging power."" Rhodes later added that the deal is ""part of the U.S. sending a signal that we're going to be present, that we're going to continue to play the role of underpinning security in this part of the region. Part of that context is a rising China."" In China, a foreign ministry spokesman questioned the appropriateness of an increased U.S. military presence in Australia. Analysts note that the deal sends a message to China in a less confrontational way than building up bases closer to Chinese shores. ""The Chinese can squawk about it,"" said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""But it's not like having an aircraft carrier in the Yellow Sea."" Obama said during a Wednesday news conference that ""the notion that we fear China is mistaken."" Before departing Australia, the president, along with some U.S. Marines, visited a military base in Darwin. While speaking to the troops there, Obama thanked them for their service and praised the two nations' alliance, which is now 60 years old, and said he looks forward to a deepening of the alliance. Going forward, our purpose is the same as it was 60 years ago -- ""the preservation of peace and security. And in a larger sense, you're answering the question once posed by the great Banjo Paterson. Of Australia, he wrote, ""Hath she the strength for the burden laid upon her, hath she the power to protect and guard her own?"" The president's Australian visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the Pacific as China expands its military reach and the United States works to reduce its military footprint in Japan. Obama's Australian visit comes on the heels of last weekend's 19-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which highlighted the need for new measures supporting job growth. During the Hawaiian summit, Obama stressed the importance of the Pacific to global economic security, and he pushed China to do more to help strengthen the world economy.

"(CNN) -- Nothing is funnier than sex. In all the fretting over teens having babies and ranting against abortion, we forget about the night the bed broke, or the trouble we had pushing the dog off the couch, or even the laugh we had at age 11 when we stole our big sister's list of words for vagina. (""The Duchess""? Really?) For reasons religious and political, certain Americans have turned what is one of the most natural and silliest of experiences into a sermon. As in, don't do it until you're married. Young people, ages 18 to 29, are simply ignoring this. According to a national survey by the Guttmacher Institute, almost 90% of unmarried young adults have had sex, and most are sexually active. This horse is not only out of the barn, it's down the road and having a long drink of water. And the cowboys and cowgirls trying to rope the horse back in would do better to turn their attention to an issue they might be able to do something about: promoting contraception. Single U.S. women in their 20s have one of the highest unplanned pregnancy rates in the world: seven out of 10, to be exact. Five out of 10 such pregnancies result in births. Consequences for the young parents and their children can be severe: stalled educational opportunities and serious health and school problems, among others. The latest major player to focus attention on pregnancy prevention is the Ad Council, the organization that, 67 years ago, brought us Smokey Bear and fire prevention and later, produced such notables as car crash dummies Vince and Larry and the phrase ""Friends don't let friends drive drunk."" The Ad Council recently began offering 33,000 media outlets -- digital, TV, radio, outdoor and print -- the opportunity to run for free a series of short ads encouraging 20-somethings to use birth control. Humor is key. Of course, unplanned pregnancy is a serious problem in this country, council President Peggy Conlon said in an interview, similar to others the council has tackled, such as such as childhood obesity, gay and lesbian bullying, and dating abuse. ""Frankly, we don't take on many new campaigns,"" Conlon said. ""We get hundreds of requests and take on maybe three to five a year. We felt very strongly that educating young women about birth control is a straightforward proposition. The campaign is exclusively about what options you have if you decide you're going to have sex and don't want to get pregnant. It's really education in prevention, as simple as that."" The public service announcements aren't on a par with comedian Whitney Cummings' risquÃ© material, but they do make any sex jokes we parents make look incredibly lame. In one of them, two partners struggle to remove jeans that are fashionably skinny. In another, the slippery shower stall poses a problem. In yet another, a passionate couple is interrupted by a voyeur: a black and white Great Dane-boxer mix with a disapproving stare. (No worries: I'm not spoiling anything here. The ads, created by the New York agency Euro RSCG, are way funnier than I am.) At the end of each spot, viewers are directed to the website www.bedsider.org, which also uses humor to help visitors compare 15 kinds of contraception, locate the closest place to acquire various methods, set up regular birth control reminders, and watch videos of real women sharing birth control experiences, including women who are not having sex. Animated shorts on the site debunk sex myths. As in, is it possible for a guy to be too big for a condom? One click on a drawing of a dachshund, entitled ""2 big 2 fit,"" brings up the answer. Want advice for better sex? The site has that, too, for example, ""Warming the feet can increase your chance of orgasm by 30%."" Who knew? Bedsider is a project of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit organization that bid last year for the coveted Ad Council support. The project is being funded -- to the tune of several million dollars -- by a private foundation that the campaign says has no connection to the pharmaceutical industry. The teen pregnancy rate has declined nearly 40% over the past two decades, but rates of unplanned pregnancy among young adults have remained stubbornly high. This stagnation compelled Sarah Brown, the National Campaign's CEO, to seek fresh thinking, including help from IDEO, a San Francisco-based design firm whose clients include Converse shoes and the smartphone alternative Peek. ""We need to rebrand contraception as something that promotes self-determination, education and achievement,"" Brown said. Not everyone will agree with Brown, of course. Recently, several conservative Republican lawmakers attempted to rebuke the concept of contraception as an endorsement of ""consequence-free sex"" that will bring about a ""pagan society,"" and said it uses public funding to prevent a generation from being born. (I am not making this up. See NPR correspondent Julie Rovner's broadcast.) The problem is not contraception, dear U.S. Rep. Steve King and others; it's not taking advantage of contraception. Fewer than half of the young adults surveyed by Guttmacher said they used birth control carefully and consistently. I confess I have some difficulty understanding why so many young couples today don't use birth control faithfully. When women of my generation moved into adulthood, we had very few people to talk to about sex and only a couple of choices of birth control. Illegal and dangerous abortions were common. So it's easy for us to mutter something like, ""Don't these young women know how lucky they are?"" Well no, many of them don't. Nor should we expect them to. What we can do is recall what it was like to do a little mattress dancing at their age, and how concerns about school or friends or the possibility of getting pregnant could keep us from really enjoying ourselves. Few things in life feel as good as good sex, especially with a loving partner. And today, just as in the past, young people often have to brush away a bunch of pesky thought-gnats to enjoy it. The fear of pregnancy no longer need be one of those pests, and bravo to the Ad Council for reminding us all of that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp.","Laura Stepp: Sermons against having sex ineffective; almost all young adults have sex .

"(CNN) -- A federal grand jury in Phoenix has indicted the Fiesta Bowl's former chief operating officer on accusations of causing and then covering up illegal political contributions, lying to federal authorities and filing false tax returns. Natalie Wisneski, 47, was forced to resign in March after an internal investigation by the college football's Fiesta Bowl discovered the widespread misuse of bowl money. That probe widened into the brewing scandal. The nine-count indictment against Wisneski says she solicited campaign contributions from Fiesta Bowl employees for elections over several election cycles, and reimbursed the contributors with Fiesta Bowl funds. She then filed false election records and tax returns to hide the contributions, the indictment alleges. It says Wisneski had conspired with others from 2003 through 2011. Among recipients of the contributions were the re-election campaigns of Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl, Gov. Jan Breuer, and Rep. J.D. Hayworth. The contributions also included funds for McCain's presidential election in 2008. In addition, $10,000 was provided and covered up for the second-term inauguration of then-Gov. Janet Napolitano in 2007, the indictment alleges. The acting U.S. attorney for Arizona, Ann Birmingham Scheel, announced the indictment Wednesday in Phoenix. She stressed the investigation is ongoing. Fiesta Bowl CEO John Junker was fired by the bowl's board of directors in March, but the indictment of Wisneski is the first to result from the federal criminal investigation. The state attorney general's office is also investigating the case.","Natalie Wisneski is accused of steering Fiesta Bowl money to political campaigns .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- The parents of Jared Lee Loughner, suspected in the Tucson, Arizona, shootings that left six people dead and U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords critically wounded, said Tuesday they do not know why the incident occurred and that they are ""very sorry"" for the loss felt by victims' families. The brief statement from the suspect's family came as doctors said Giffords is breathing on her own and a picture emerged of her alleged gunman coming heavily armed to Saturday's event with constituents. Loughner, 22, allegedly carried a knapsack to the shopping center, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. He had a semi-automatic handgun, four ammunition magazines and a knife, according to the official. The weapon was a Glock 19, with an extended magazine that held 31 rounds, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. A total of 31 spent rounds were recovered from the scene, it said in a statement Tuesday night. The law enforcement official told CNN authorities are still on the scene of the shooting with a piece of equipment called a total station. It is a type of surveying equipment that takes precise measurements that can be used to reconstruct a crime scene. Loughner has been anecdotally regarded as very troubled and perhaps mentally unbalanced because of his ramblings spotted on the internet and the way he has been described by acquaintances. His family asked for privacy during a ""very difficult time for us."" ""There are no words that can possibly express how we feel. We wish that there were, so we could make you feel better. We don't understand why this happened,"" the family said in its statement. ""It may not make any difference, but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday. We care very deeply about the victims and their families. We are so very sorry for their loss. Thank you. The Loughner Family"" Randy Loughner, the suspect's father, asked a neighbor to tell reporters camped outside the family's Tucson home Monday that he eventually would make the statement. ""Right now he can't talk. He can't get out three words without crying,"" neighbor Wayne Smith told CNN affiliate KGUN. Giffords remained in critical condition Tuesday, three days after she was shot in the head during a gunman's rampage, but she was breathing on her own and doctors backed off on some sedation. Twelve others were wounded. Giffords' office released two photos of husband Mark Kelly, an astronaut, holding her hand Sunday. ""I'm happy to say she's holding her own,"" said Dr. Michael Lemole Jr., chief of neurosurgery at University Medical Center. ""Her status is the same as it was yesterday. She's still following simple commands."" Lemole said Giffords was generating her own breaths. ""The only reason we keep that breathing tube in is to protect her airway so that she doesn't have complications like pneumonia,"" he told reporters. Lemole said he's encouraged by the fact that she's ""done so well"" with an injury where survival and recovery are ""abysmal."" ""We're hopeful, but I do want to underscore the seriousness of this injury and the fact that we all have to be extremely patient,"" Lemole said. Six of the victims in the Saturday shooting remained at University Medical Center, Chief of Emergency Medicine Peter Rhee said. Along with Giffords, three people were in serious condition and two were in fair condition. Daniel Hernandez, a 20-year-old intern on the Giffords staff, visited wounded staffer Ron Barber, 65, at the hospital. Hernandez, who initially used his bare hands to stop blood gushing from Giffords' head after she was shot, asked a bystander to put pressure on Barber's wounds, according to officials. Tuesday night, mourners gathered at a memorial Mass for the six who were killed. The Mass was held at St. Odilia Church in Tucson, where 9-year-old shooting victim Christina Green had her first communion a year ago. A children's choir sang ""Amazing Grace"" during the service. The rosary for Christina Green is scheduled for Wednesday, followed by a funeral Thursday. Services for U.S. Judge John Roll, who was among the six people killed Saturday, are scheduled Thursday and Friday. A friend of Christina's family took the girl to the event Saturday after she had been elected to a student government position. Suzi Hileman, who was holding Christina's hand before the shooting, remains hospitalized for her wounds, her husband, Bill, told reporters Tuesday. According to Hileman, Suzi sometimes calls out, ""Christina, Christina. Let's get out of here! Let's get out of here!"" Suzi Hileman, a social worker, is involved in the community, her husband said, and was impressed with Christina's civic interest. ""They are generations apart, but are very much birds of a feather,"" he said of the woman and girl. Christina's parents are supportive and have shown ""graciousness"" toward the Hilemans, Bill Hileman added. In remarks in Tucson Tuesday, Gov. Jan Brewer remembered the victims. ""Among the lessons that life has taught me is that, sometimes, loss just finds you,"" she said. ""You don't expect it. You don't want to accept it. But, suddenly, you're challenged by something dark and ugly, a pain you can hardly bear."" Among those killed was Dorwan Stoddard, 76. He tried to shield his wife, Mavi, who was wounded in the leg. ""He heard the shots and covered my mom with his own body. He protected her and saved her,"" said daughter Penny Wilson, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, will attend a Wednesday memorial service and visit with victims' families at the University of Arizona in Tucson, according to a statement from the school. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will travel with them. An administration official said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also will attend. The Arizona State Legislature in Phoenix, meanwhile, passed legislation Tuesday that bars protesters at funerals from getting within 300 feet of services. Brewer, who visited the injured Tuesday, later signed the bill. The action, according to House Republican spokesman Daniel Scarpinato, was in direct response to a controversial church's announcement that it will picket Christina Green's funeral. Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, has made its name by staging protests at funerals of people who died of AIDS, gay people, soldiers and even civil rights leader Coretta Scott King. The shooting has sparked horror across the United States and generated much partisan talk about vitriolic political discourse in American life and what Loughner's motivations were. Experts said Tuesday the alleged shooter in the massacre may have difficulty making the case for a successful insanity plea. Paul Callan, a criminal defense attorney and a former prosecutor, and Jeff Gardere, a clinical and forensic psychologist, said on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday they have doubts that an insanity plea would stand. With the ""amount of planning that went into this assassination,"" Callan said he believes ""it's highly unlikely he will meet the legal insanity defense threshold."" ""It's very hard to prove insanity at trial,"" he said. ""You really have to prove that your mental illness is so severe that you don't even understand that you're committing a criminal act. And it's almost impossible to prove that."" Gardere emphasized that ""premeditation will work against him in this one as far as getting an insanity plea."" Judy Clarke, Loughner's defense attorney, has not spoken on that issue. Court documents released Sunday show that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event, similar to Saturday's meet-and-greet. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit states. A law enforcement official said Loughner asked Giffords a question at the 2007 event and was unhappy with her response. ""He never let it go,"" the source said. ""It kept festering."" Loughner bought the Glock semiautomatic pistol used in the shooting back in November. He didn't fit any of the ""prohibited possessor"" categories that would have prevented the purchase and passed an instant federal background check. He tried to buy ammunition at a Walmart store, abruptly left and made the purchase elsewhere. In other developments, U.S. District Judge Raner C. Collins has ruled that all magistrate and district judges in the District of Arizona's Tucson Division must recuse themselves from hearing any cases connected with the shooting. The ruling, dated Monday, cited the need to ""avoid the appearance of impropriety, and because a judge has a duty to disqualify him or herself if his or her impartiality could be reasonably questioned, whether or not such impartiality exists."" Loughner appeared in a Phoenix federal courtroom Monday to formally hear the charges against him -- including two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of attempting to kill a member of Congress.","Thirty-one spent rounds were found at scene .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British government wants to find out what makes people happy. Is it good health, education, income, or job satisfaction? Is it the environment, a lack of crime, or having a say in politics? Those aspects of life can't be measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), long used as a key indicator of a nation's prosperity, British Prime Minister David Cameron says. Thursday, he launched a national survey to ask people which aspects matter most to them, and which they believe should be used to measure the nation's well-being. Though Cameron has championed this initiative since at least 2006, when he was still leader of the opposition -- suggesting a focus on GWB, or ""general well-being"" -- he still defended the idea Thursday against suspicions ""that all this is a bit airy-fairy and impractical."" ""Of course you can't capture happiness on a spreadsheet any more than you can bottle it,"" he said in announcing the program. ""If anyone was trying to reduce the whole spectrum of human emotion into one snapshot statistic, I would be the first to roll my eyes, but that isn't what this is about. ""Just as the GDP figures don't give the full story of our economy's growth, but do give a useful indicator of where we're heading, so this new measure won't give the full story of our nation's well-being, but will give us a general picture of how life is improving."" An online survey for individuals will run until April, when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will send out surveys to large households. The results of both will be collected and analyzed, with results to come out in 2012, the ONS said. Cameron said he knows some think the project is a ""distraction"" from the more urgent economic problems Britain must address, and that some think there is no way the government can hope to improve people's well-being. Getting the economy moving, and creating jobs and spreading opportunity, is still the government's most urgent priority, Cameron said -- but there need to be better ways than just GDP to assess the country's growth and progress. ""When a country is hit by an earthquake, that can increase GDP because of the extra spending on reconstruction afterwards,"" he said. ""When a city is torn apart by crime and disorder, that can increase GDP because of all the extra locks and security people buy. When a person falls seriously ill, that can increase GDP because the cost of buying drugs and paying for care counts as economic activity."" Initiatives regarded as good for growth sometimes have negative effects on the quality of life, he said -- such as loose controls on immigration, which can affect public services, or cheap prices on alcohol that can lead to more incidents of crime. ""It's because of this fundamentally flawed approach that for decades Western societies have seen the line of GDP rising steadily upwards, but at the same time, levels of contentment have remained static or even fallen,"" Cameron said. Cameron said government can't legislate for fulfillment or satisfaction, but it can boost well-being by finding out what will improve lives and then acting on it. ""In time it will lead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line, but on all those things that make life worthwhile,"" he said.","The prime minister launches a national survey to measure well-being .
It asks people what aspects of life matter most to them .
Cameron says the GDP falls short of measuring a nation's well-being ."
"(CNN Student News) -- October 29, 2009 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Peshawar, Pakistan • Washington, D.C. • Kennedy Space Center . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MANDY CARRANZA, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Today marks a milestone for the stock market, one that most people probably don't want to celebrate. We'll explain why in a bit. Hi, everyone. Sitting in for Carl Azuz, I'm Mandy Carranza. First Up: Peshawar Blast . CARRANZA: First up, officials in Pakistan are speaking out against the most violent attack to strike the country this year. It happened yesterday in the city of Peshawar, when a car bomb exploded in a busy marketplace that's popular with women. More than a hundred people were killed by the blast and at least 200 others were injured. The bomb sparked fires that quickly spread through nearby fabric stores. The attack happened just hours after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Pakistan to take part in meetings about the nation's fight against the Taliban. She issued a challenge to the people responsible for yesterday's violence. HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: If the people behind these attacks were so sure of their beliefs, let them join the political process. Let them come forth to the people of Pakistan in this democracy and make their case that they don't want girls to go to school; that they want women to be kept back; that they believe that they have all the answers and that the rest of us who are people of faith have none. Hate Crimes Law . CARRANZA: Back in Washington, President Obama has signed a law that makes it a federal crime to assault someone because of his or her sexual orientation. The new legislation was included in a defense spending bill and it expands on the government's existing hate crimes law. Some critics of the expanded law argue that it's not necessary to specify one particular group. They believe the existing hate crimes law protected people based on their sexual orientation. There's also some concern that the law could be used against people who may say something controversial, although government officials say it will only be used in the case of violent acts. Congressional Gold Medal . CARRANZA: And President Obama took part in another ceremony yesterday, this one honoring Edward Brooke, who you see there on the right. He was the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate by popular vote. And yesterday, Mr. Brooke was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, Congress' highest civilian honor. Brooke served as a Republican Senator from Massachusetts from 1967 to 1979. During yesterday's ceremony, President Obama said Brooke ran for office in order to bring people together who had never been together before. And former Senator Brooke had a similar message yesterday as he urged political leaders to put politics aside and come together. Shoutout . BRENDAN GAGE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's first Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Sherrill's 2nd period journalism class at Riverside High School in Greer, South Carolina. Mars is the Roman god of war. Who is his Greek counterpart? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Ares, B) Athena, C) Apollo or D) Zeus? You've got three seconds -- GO! Ares is the god of war in Greek mythology. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Ares Launch . CARRANZA: And now, Ares might help people reach Mars. Huh? We're talking about NASA and its Constellation program, which includes the new Ares I-X rocket. That's the one. After several days of delays due to bad weather, a test flight of the new Ares rocket launched yesterday, climbing 24 miles above the Earth. According to NASA, this is the largest rocket in the world. The craft is scheduled to replace the space shuttle, and might one day take astronauts to the moon, Mars and beyond. Before yesterday's launch, John Zarrella checked in with a preview of NASA's new program. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On launch pad A, the space shuttle. It is the present and soon to be the past. On pad B, the Ares I-X rocket; the future, maybe. Built to replace the retiring shuttle fleet, Ares would be the first vehicle since the Apollo years to take humans out of low Earth orbit, perhaps to Mars. CHARLIE PRECOURT, VICE PRESIDENT, ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS: It behooves us to build an architecture that can serve a multitude of missions for those next 50-plus years. And that's where this was first envisioned, was to think about space station, lunar, asteroids, beyond. ZARRELLA: The White House has still not decided whether Ares, built with a budget as thin as the rocket itself, should be the shuttle's replacement. NASA and the rocket's developers have pressed ahead. The pressure is enormous. Over the summer, the rocket segments were put together in the vehicle assembly building. The upper part of the rocket is made up of dummy segments designed to mimic the real deal. The lower stage of four segments of solid rocket will burn for two minutes, producing 3 million pounds of thrust. The entire vehicle is filled with a web of 711 sensors. JOE OLIVA, ARES I-X PROGRAM MANAGER: The goal of an early flight test is to get the test off early enough that you can actually use that data to influence and make course corrections, if you will, to the design on the full vehicle. ZARRELLA: But course corrections might cause further delays. The first flight with humans sitting in a capsule on top of the rocket won't take place until 2015, at the earliest. At least five years after the last space shuttle flight. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Booster ignition, liftoff of space shuttle Discovery! (END VIDEO) Shoutout Extra Credit . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit! Wall Street's infamous ""Black Tuesday"" happened in what year? You know what to do. Was it: A) 1929, B) 1953, C) 1987 or D) 2008? Another three seconds on the clock --- GO! October 29, 1929 is referred to as Black Tuesday. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout Extra Credit! Black Tuesday . CARRANZA: Do the math, and that means that today is the 80th anniversary of Black Tuesday. It's called that because on that day in 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gives an idea of how the whole stock market is doing, dropped nearly 13 percent. It became the most famous stock market crash in U.S. history. And many experts point to it as the start of the Great Depression, a global economic slump that would last almost a decade. Richard Roth takes a look back at that fateful day. (BEGIN VIDEO) RICHARD WARSHAUER, WALL STREET AFICIONADO: This is where everything started. And for centuries, this is where everything happened. RICHARD ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Crash. No, not last year's stock market plunge, but the Great Crash. It all went down 80 years ago this week. WARSHAUER: 1929 was the greatest fall in the Dow Jones over a two-day period. In today's terms, it would be like a 2,200-point drop. ROTH: Richard Warshauer and lifelong friend Jim Kaplan give tours every anniversary of the Great Crash. JIM KAPLAN, WALL STREET AFICIONADO: This whole area was filled with people who had come down to see what was going on. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The tremendous crowds which you see gathered outside the stock exchange are due to the greatest crash in the history of the New York Stock Exchange in market prices. ROTH: Quite a shock, especially because the Friday before, following a large drop, newspapers proclaimed the stock market crisis was over. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But in October 1929, the Wall Street bubble burst. ROTH: The historic collapse was just starting, eventually leading, many believe, to the Great Depression. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And then it actually loses 89 percent of that value in the stock market crash in 1929. ROTH: At the Museum of Finance on Wall Street, a ticker-tape machine from the crash days. The end of a mania for stocks based on easy credit. RICHARD SYLLA, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AND HISTORIAN: It's leverage. I mean, we learned in the latest financial crisis that firms and individuals can take on too much leverage. That's exactly what they did in the 1920s. ROTH: A familiar replay to someone born during the crash years. HILDA HEIN, MUSEUM VISITOR: It did have the smell of the same thing happening again. ROTH: The crash experts say a famous story is true. At the market's peak, tycoon Joseph Kennedy, patriarch of the Kennedy clan, hearing stock tips from a shoeshine man and selling stocks short, making a fortune. Do you give out stock tips to anyone, like the famous shoeshine man of 1929? LINWOOD HARRIS, SHOESHINE MAN: No, I don't. No, I don't. ROTH: But he did shine the shoes of Kennedy's grandson, John Kennedy Jr. Linwood says he is the last shoeshine man left on Wall Street.

"(CNN) -- A flag that was nearly destroyed in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, was raised outside of the funeral service Thursday for 9-year-old Christina Green, who was born on that fateful day. The banner, which measures 20 feet high and 30 feet wide, was draped between the extended ladders of two fire trucks outside the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson, Arizona, forming an arch under which Christina's family passed as they arrived ahead of the 1 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) service. John and Roxanna Green, Christina's parents; and her 11-year-old brother, Dallas, paused for a few moments to look up at the flag as it rippled against the clear blue sky. A few minutes later, more relatives emerged from the same black SUV limousine that brought her immediate family, also craning their necks to take in the huge banner. The young girl was killed Saturday when a gunman fired on a crowd at a congresswoman's meet-and-greet event in Tucson. Five others also died, and 13 -- including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona -- were wounded. The flag topped a building near the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York, and was heavily damaged by falling debris when the tower crumbled after hijacked airliners crashed into it and its twin. Many remember the images of the tattered banner, fluttering heroically above the debris and smoke in the days after the towers' collapse. Soon after, the shredded flag was removed and put in storage until 2008, when a member of the New York Says Thank You Foundation recovered it and took it to Greensburg, Kansas. Foundation volunteers were there to help residents of the small town complete some rebuilding projects more than a year after a strong tornado devastated the region. According to Jeff Parness, the founder and chairman of the foundation, it was a way to say ""thank you"" to some of the townspeople who had come to New York in the aftermath of the terror attacks to help there. According to the group's website, while foundation members worked to rebuild the town, residents began to repair what is now called the National 9/11 Flag by patching it with flags recovered from the tornado rubble. Since then, the banner has traveled across the country, gathering flags from other disasters that are stitched on by survivors and other groups. It even includes part of a flag upon which a dying Abraham Lincoln was laid, the foundation said. Parness said the idea to display the flag at Christina's funeral came to him when he heard an interview with her mother, Roxanna, who spoke about how her daughter always looked for the positives that came out of the 9/11 attacks. ""She would refer to her birthday as a holiday,"" Parness quoted Roxanna Green as saying. ""When I heard more about her sense of service and volunteerism and the community spirit, her love of government, we just realized we had to have this flag at Christina's funeral,"" he told CNN. Parness contacted the family's pastor, who conveyed the offer, and the Greens accepted. ""We both let out a gasp of emotion, because, you know, that meant a lot to us,"" Christina's father, John Green, told CNN. ""And for them to extend that courtesy to our daughter ... again, it's just another one of those things that will help for us. We feel like the country won't forget her."" Parness says the flag is really more of a symbol of 9/12, instead of 9/11. It shows ""what it looks like when Americans come together and help each other recover from tragedy and disaster,"" he explained. ""When you look at this beautiful flag, it shows what it's like when you connect all these people. We had a father on December 7 in Hawaii, Pearl Harbor Day, who stitched the flag in Pearl Harbor. He lost his son in Afghanistan,"" Parness said. He said newly naturalized citizens would help with the stitching on Friday at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta, Georgia. ""It's about bringing people together and showing what's possible out of a tragedy like this."" Citing Christina's love of helping other people, Parness said ""kids get it."" ""They understand when people are in need, what can you do to help. After the funeral and as the community in Tucson and the country starts to heal after this, we're going to look back and say, what could we do, the simplest thing every day, to make Christina smile on us? Just to be kind to your neighbor, volunteer."" ""In a bizarre way, this is a tremendous gift that Christina is giving to us, to show the country this flag, to ... let people in local communities nominate service heroes to place a stitch in this flag so we can heal it and make this flag whole again by the 10-year anniversary"" this September, Parness said.

"London (CNN) -- Some samples of designer Marc Jacobs' fashions for next year disappeared on the way from Paris to London by train this week, forcing the company to cancel Thursday's press day in London, the company said. ""The Marc Jacobs PR team is sorry to inform you that our press day tomorrow in the Marc Jacobs store is canceled, due to the theft of the spring/summer 2012 collections during its transfer from Paris,"" the company said in an e-mail sent Wednesday to fashion publications. Fashion editors attend the press days to see samples they'll use for photo shoots as part of their coverage of what's coming to stores in the future. A highly placed source in the Jacobs company, who asked not to be identified, said the apparent theft was not unusual for the fashion business. Contrary to some reports, only a part of the collection is missing, the source said. Paris police said they have not been contacted to investigate.

"(CNN) -- Villagers and police clashed outside a small town in southeastern China on Saturday, one week to the day after a popular local leader there died under contested circumstances, an eyewitness said. The eyewitness, who asked not to be identified because of safety concerns, said villagers threw rocks at police at a major intersection on a road between the towns of Hongqiao and Puqi, outside of the city of Wenzhou. Authorities chased protesters, the eyewitness said. They beat some and arrested others, the person said. CNN was not immediately able to independently verify the account of the protest. The incident was not reported in China's official state media, and the Chinese government had not released an official statement on the clash as of late Saturday. The eyewitness sent CNN amateur video of the event, which showed police and groups of villagers clustered around a busy intersection. At one point, what looks to be a rock is thrown into the crowd. People scurry away. Earlier, activists and journalists in the area had announced on Twitter that local villagers were planning a protest march in response to Qian Yunhui's death and its aftermath. The march was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Saturday in the town of Hongqiao. At 9 a.m., anti-riot and traffic police appeared at major intersections in the area to prevent the protest, the eyewitness said. Blocked by police, the crowd began to head away from the town and toward the village of Zhaiqiao, the hometown of Qian, said the eyewitness. Zhaiqiao is located in Yueqing city. Qian was killed in Yueqing city on December 25, and photos of his corpse underneath the wheel of a large truck went viral in the Chinese blogosphere. The photograph was unmistakably graphic: a lifeless man under the large tire of a truck -- his eyes shut, mouth half-open with blood streaming out and his head detached from his crushed body. The circumstances surrounding the death of 53-year-old Qian last Saturday, however, almost resemble the plot of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Rashomon"" -- with differing versions of the event and flip-flopping witnesses. The government initially said Qian died in an ordinary traffic accident and detained the truck driver. But as shocking images from the scene in Yueqing city began to appear on a popular Chinese online forum last Sunday, some posts suggested he was murdered by local officials for advocating villagers' rights in a land dispute. Word quickly spread online and mainstream Chinese news media picked up the story. Many people were appalled by the gruesome details described by two people who claimed to have witnessed the death. Qian was held down to the ground by three masked men as a heavy truck slowly drove over his neck, the Southern Daily newspaper quoted one of them as saying, adding that police had detained another witness. Qian's life story also struck a chord with the public. When the Yueqing government in 2004 approved the construction of a power plant in Qian's village, the farmers were tricked into signing their land away for free, according to a report in the 21st Century Economic Herald newspaper. Qian, then the village chief, led his fellow villagers in protesting the land grab and demanding proper compensation. He was arrested and sentenced to prison twice but continued the fight after his release -- even traveling to Beijing to petition the central government, the Herald report said. Amid rising national outrage over the alleged murder of a local hero, authorities in Wenzhou city in Zhejiang province, which oversees Yueqing, launched a criminal investigation Tuesday -- and drew their conclusions less than 48 hours later. In a late-night press conference Wednesday, officials reiterated that Qian was a victim of a traffic accident, not a murder. Police assigned blame to the inexperienced trucker driving without a license, the severely overloaded vehicle with faulty brakes, the slippery road on a rainy day -- and even Qian himself for not being careful when crossing the road. ""We thoroughly investigated the life and work as well as social connections of the suspect (driver), and eliminated the possibility of him intentionally killing (Qian),"" said Shen Qiang, deputy police chief of Wenzhou. ""There were obvious skid marks, drag marks of the body and collision marks on the scene, all of which contradicted the scenario of someone being held down and crushed,"" he added. State-run China Central Television later aired interviews of the two eyewitnesses, including a man detained for assaulting police. Contrary to earlier reports quoting them, they both denied seeing Qian's brutal murder. ""Several men told me if I said these things, they would help me treat my daughter's illness,"" Huang Diyan told CCTV. The police conclusions and CCTV interviews have not satisfied many online, however, especially as state censors quietly erased earlier news reports, personal posts and comments on the topic on the internet. With mainstream media's independent reporting on Qian's death coming a screeching halt, grassroots activists continue chasing the case, digging up new information on the land dispute and traveling to Yueqing to talk to villagers. Wu Gan, a rights activist, has obtained a lengthy police video that showed the chaotic scene after the truck crushed Qian. He posted it online for the public to view and analyze before heading to the village Thursday evening to offer legal assistance to anyone in need. ""I don't prejudge -- I just want to restore the truth,"" he told CNN. ""The way the authorities dealt with this incident was just not open or fair -- they have lost all credibility."" Wu said the Internet provides ordinary Chinese with an outlet to express their anger over injustice resulting from a storyline common in the country -- poor farmers losing land to corrupt officials working with businesses, and then losing even more in failed attempts to petition to higher authorities. ""This death really shows the bottom line of what is intolerable keeps getting lower,"" he said. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","Police beat and arrest villagers, an eyewitness says .

"(CNN) -- A nondescript white warehouse building in southern California hid a sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel that traffickers used to transport tons of marijuana from Mexico into the United States, authorities said. Investigators on both sides of the border seized more than 14.5 tons of marijuana in connection with the tunnel's discovery this week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Wednesday. Authorities said the drugs had a street value of more than $25 million, CNN affiliate KGTV reported. ""I'm confident that if these cartels want to continue to try to smuggle their drugs into the United States in this fashion, we're going to find them, and we're going to find them faster than they can build them,"" said William R. Sherman, acting special agent in charge for the Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego. From the floor of the San Diego warehouse, authorities found a 3-foot-wide tunnel that stretched the length of four football fields and was equipped with structural supports, electricity and ventilation, ICE's statement said. Highway troopers found 3 tons of marijuana packed into boxes inside a cargo truck that they stopped after it left the San Diego warehouse. That discovery allowed agents to obtain a warrant to enter the warehouse, the statement said, where they recovered 6.5 additional tons of marijuana. Mexican authorities later seized at least 5 tons of marijuana from a warehouse in Tijuana, Mexico, on the other end of the tunnel. Sherman said it was the third sophisticated cross-border tunnel found in the area within a year. U.S. federal authorities have found more than 75 cross-border smuggling tunnels in the past four years, most of them in California and Arizona, according to ICE.","A DEA agent says it is the third ""sophisticated"" tunnel found in the past year .

"(CNN) -- The Penn State child sex abuse scandal once again demonstrates how easily organizations, facing bad news that is not yet public, adopt a ""circle the wagons"" strategy to protect the institution, and convince themselves -- contrary to all evidence -- that the problem is not really very serious. It is an unavoidable fact that institutions act this way. It's a rare organization that has the integrity or the confidence to deal openly with embarrassment or scandal. It is much easier for leaders -- and crowds of disillusioned students in the Penn State case -- to flatly say the accusations are untrue. ""I can't believe Jerry would do such a thing,"" they say. ""The media has always wanted to bring down Penn State football."" In the nearly 40 years I have been counseling organizations and their leaders about such incidents, their first reaction is almost always surprise and disbelief. These leaders often believe, naively, that everyone in their organization is ethical. Faced with allegations of wrongdoing among their co-workers or employees, they adopt denial as an institutional and psychological defense. If evidence piles up that the charges are true, too many leaders, recognizing their own failure to create and sustain an ethical environment, conclude there was no way to prevent the events. ""This was an aberration,"" some leaders argue, ""I am certain this person will never do anything like this again."" ""He only did it because he had serious financial troubles at home"" or ""She was going through a divorce."" This can lead to the decision to ignore or sweep this case under the rug. Other leaders conclude that although the misbehavior is true, the media frenzy or the government response will be so overblown that they have a twisted sort of obligation to hide it. ""You can't stop the occasional bad apple,"" one chief executive told me. ""I would not be doing my organization any favors by revealing every one of these. The public would completely overreact."" Once the initial decision is made that it's best not to come clean, it becomes much harder to come clean later. The original charges are compounded by accusations of a cover-up. Many leaders decide they have no alternative but to hunker down and hope the incident never comes to public attention. When it does, of course, the institution and all involved suffer much more damage than they would have by addressing the original charge. Looking back, we ask how they could have had so little regard for the victims of the behavior -- be they children who were raped or the community whose water supply was poisoned. The sad reality is that leaders, swept up in denial and concern about embarrassing themselves and their organizations, don't think first about the victims or the future victims -- they think about how to contain the damage. Penn State is neither the first nor will it be the last organization to demonstrate this pattern. In just the past few months we have at least three other tragic examples of allegations of abuse left unreported by respected organizations: the esteemed Citadel, and the Catholic Archbishops of Philadelphia and Kansas City, Missouri. Stories of businesses that stonewall are too numerous to count. The tobacco industry and its leaders have been pilloried for denying the harmful effects of cigarettes for decades. Chemical companies -- including W.R. Grace, which was portrayed in the book and movie ""A Civil Action"" -- denied and covered up the health effects of chemical spills. Banks today, particularly Bank of America, are assailed for not admitting how badly they handled mortgage modifications. I wish we had more positive examples to cite, but even now we have to reach back 30 years for a role model: Johnson & Johnson's decision in the 1980s to tell the public everything it knew about the poisonings of Tylenol capsules, a case study we still hail and teach today. There are legal and other mechanisms that try to force better reporting: states with ""mandated reporter"" laws; Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd Frank laws for business gatekeepers; even U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, where offending companies get credit for having strong reporting or investigative policies. And we hope that in a few cases at least, enlightened leadership will create a culture where incidents are openly investigated. None of this eliminates the need for individuals in organizations to exercise the basic moral obligation to report abusive behavior. Joe Paterno and Mike McQueary at Penn State have been accused of moral failure in the case of Jerry Sandusky because they allegedly failed to follow up sufficiently to prevent more children from being harmed. Although it may satisfy a legal obligation to report a suspicion to a supervisor, the more fundamental moral duty is to prevent harm to others, even if an institution decides to withhold information. This can take great moral courage and a healthy dose of independent perspective. But we all have a stake in the moral integrity of our organizations, and a sacred duty to protect the vulnerable. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Kirk Hanson.","Kirk Hanson: Institutions initially deny, hush up scandals to protect themselves .
Hanson: Denial, secrecy is an institutional and psychological defense that backfires .
Hiding makes it seem victims come last, he says: Think Catholic Church, The Citadel .
Reporting takes courage, he says, and enlightened leaders foster openness ."
"(CNN)  -- Two goals in three minutes from Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan put the United States into the final of the Women's World Cup with a 3-1 victory over France Wednesday. The teams were tied at 1-1 until Wambach powered home a 79th minute header before young substitute Morgan sealed the victory with a cool finish. The United States will play Japan, who beat Sweden 3-1 in the second semifinal in Frankfurt to continue their superb run in the competition. Lauren Cheney had put the U.S. ahead in the Borussia-Park stadium in Moenchengladbach as early as the ninth minute. But France, who had beaten England on penalties in a dramatic quarterfinal, responded by dominating possession. Their deserved equalizer came in the 55th minute when Sonia Bompastor's dangerous ball into the penalty area eluded U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo without getting a further touch. At this point, France looked the more likely winners, but United States coach Pia Sundhage quickly introduced Morgan and Megan Rapinoe from the bench to change the course of the game. SI.com: 3 keys to the match . Prolific striker Wambach put them ahead with a thumping header from a Cheney corner which left French goalkeeper Berangere Sapowicz with no chance. The excellent Rapinoe then played in Morgan with a neat pass and she chipped Sapowicz to wrap up the victory. But Sundhage ackowledged they had been thoroughly tested by a French side who played with considerable flair. ""I think France played very well. We lost our legs in the second half but then we picked it up,"" she told Eurosport. The reigning Olympic champions are bidding for a record third World Cup title after winning in 1991 and 1999 before hosts Germany claimed the crown in 2003 and 2007. Japan caused the upset of the tournament by stunning the Germans 1-0 in the quarterfinals and they showed their qualities again with a later impressive win over Sweden to make a World Cup final for the first time in their history. Sweden made a fast start as striker Josefine Oqvist thumped the opener past Japan goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori on 10 minutes. But Japan striker Nahomi Kawasumi equalized with a fine individual goal nine minutes later and put them ahead after the break. Captain Homare Sawa wrapped up the Japan win with her fourth goal in five games as her side beat top European opposition for the second straight game. They will return to Frankfurt for Sunday's final against the United States.","United States into final of Women's World Cup in Germany .

Thank you for wrapping up your week with CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: West Bank Settlements . AZUZ: First up, a White House meeting between President Obama and the head of the Palestinian Authority. President Mahmoud Abbas sat down with Obama yesterday, just as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did last week. They're all discussing the same topic: possibilities for a Middle East peace plan. One of the big issues: Israeli settlements in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank. Obama and Abbas want Israel to stop settlement activity, but Netanyahu has pledged to expand it. Ben Wedeman is in the region, and reports on the situation there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're right next to Ma'ale Adumim, which is the biggest Jewish settlement in the West Bank. Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, he's insisted, that he wants natural expansion, or growth, to occur in those settlements Which means that settlements like Ma'ale Adumim are going to get bigger and bigger. And that's something the Palestinians are completely opposed to. Now, what you see on the other side of this valley is the town, the Palestinian town of Eizariya, known from the Bible as Bethany. Now, this town is right up against Jerusalem, in fact many people consider it part of Jerusalem, but it's separated from Jerusalem by the Israeli so-called security barrier, what the Palestinians call the apartheid separation wall. It cannot expand. It cannot have growth in the direction of Jerusalem because of the wall, and because of Ma'ale Adumim, it can't expand in that direction. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from East of Jerusalem on the occupied West Bank. (END VIDEO CLIP) International Highlights . AZUZ: Catching up on a couple other international headlines, beginning with a series of deadly explosions in Pakistan. This took place last night in and around the city of Peshawar. At least eight people were killed in the violence and dozens of others were wounded. The attacks came one day after a suicide bombing in the Pakistani city of Lahore. And parts of Honduras are recovering from a deadly earthquake. Reports yesterday evening indicated that five people had been killed and 17 others injured by the tremor. Officials say the quake, which struck early Thursday morning, registered a magnitude of 7.1. It was followed 30 minutes later by a 4.8-magnitude aftershock. Money Word . GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Here's the deal: Today's Money Word is budget. It's a financial plan that estimates income and expenses. Put that in your word bank! Education Budget Cuts? AZUZ: The state of California is facing a budget crisis. The state is struggling with a multi-billion dollar deficit. In a recent special election, voters cast their ballots against some plans that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger designed to help the state's budget. Now, he says California has to make some severe cuts. Dan Simon explores how one might have a big impact on students. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, SAN FRANCISCO: Romell Moore grew up on the rough-and-tumble streets of Oakland, California. He says a strong grandmother kept him out of trouble. DOROTHY MOORE, ROMELL MOORE'S GRANDMOTHER: I'm strict with him. SIMON: When he graduates from high school next month -- he's number three in his class -- Rommel would be the first person in his family to go to college. He's been accepted at U.C. Santa Cruz. ROMELL MOORE, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: It makes me feel good that I was doing all the right stuff and doing all the hard work to go, and maybe I can be a guidance to my young cousins and nephews that maybe they'll want to go to college, too. SIMON: He wants to become a lawyer, but that dream could be shattered because of California's budget woes. The state facing an unprecedented deficit is looking at ways to save billions, and Governor Schwarzenegger has proposed slashing what are called Cal Grants, money that helps pay tuition for students from low income families. 200,000 students statewide could lose all or part of the Cal Grants they were counting on to pay for college this fall. ROMELL MOORE: The whole way through school, the teachers and all that tell you as long as you get good grades and all that, the state and the system will find a way to send you to school. SIMON: A promise that would have to be taken back if the proposed cuts happen. Without Cal Grants, Romell would lose nearly a third of the money for his $27,000 a year tuition and other expenses. Nancy Roman is the college counselor at Romell's school. She says the ripple effects would be enormous. NANCY ROMAN, COLLEGE COUNSELOR: Our main problem is just getting students to even look at college, because in their head, already, its been ingrained that it's too expensive as well as with parents; they don't want students to apply, because, ""Oh, it's too expensive,"" so we always talk about about Cal Grants. SIMON: Romell has this message for lawmakers making the touch choices. ROMELL MOORE: By helping me go to school they won't have another person on welfare just taking state money to survive. They'll have another person working, making money for the state. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout .

Surely, you've heard the chorus of warnings. The U.S. Commerce Secretary. GARY LOCKE, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: Public awareness and public preparedness are the best defenses against a hurricane. And that defense is more important than ever. ZARRELLA: The New Orleans mayor.

JACK BEVIN, NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER: Plan now. Know what to do, so you'll be ready when the storm threatens. ZARRELLA: With so much drums beating, everyone living in hurricane-prone communities is ready, right? Well, no. Not hardly. A new Mason-Dixon poll sponsored by the National Hurricane Survival Initiative found most people surveyed from Maine to Texas have done little to get ready, despite recent big ones: Katrina, Rita and, last year, Ike. 83% of the 1,100 people surveyed have taken no steps to make their homes stronger. 66% have no hurricane survival kits; basics like food and water for three days. 53% don't know if their insurance policy covers hurricane damage. Every year, surveys find hurricane apathy pretty much unchanged, no matter how bad the season was. Sociologists chalk it up to human nature: procrastinate. Emergency managers say the ""uh oh"" factor will kick in when. CHUCK LANZA, BROWARD COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGER: I saw people really do when the big ones are coming, they get prepared. ZARRELLA: But this year, emergency managers fear because of the economy, many people can't afford to stock up. LANZA: We'd like people to set aside a little bit of money and buy a little bit of the supplies that they need now, and a little bit more every week as they get the money. ZARRELLA: If they just can't, experts say now's the time to come up with a plan to evacuate. (END VIDEO CLIP) Off the Beaten Path .

"(CNN) -- What I first noticed when arriving in Baku, beyond the world's tallest free-standing flag pole, was the oil derricks in the Caspian Sea, visible from western hotels steadily rising along the coast. Where other cities might dress the skyline to lure visitors to the beach, or to take a boat cruise, Azerbaijan is all about its energy wealth. The country of eight million people benefits from having started early in the oil game -- in 1846 the country drilled the first oil well in the world -- but all that is well known, as is the country's push to extract more oil off shore in the Caspian. Country profile: Azerbaijan . What should become more well-known is the country's attempt to diversify away from oil and focus more on natural gas. To the ever expanding gratitude of Western Europe, Azerbaijan is close to tripling the amount of natural gas processed through its BP facility south of Baku. Soon the owners of the Shah Deniz natural gas lease in the Caspian will choose from a host of competing pipeline consortiums to bring more natural gas to Western Europe. Most importantly, it means more gas heating rooms in Romania and Germany that does not come from Russia. As one of the most potent symbols to me of the rising energy wealth, seaside luxury homes are being built directly across the street from the vast BP oil and gas refinery south of Baku. From the front bedroom the new owners will overlook ever more derricks. From the back yard, it is the refinery. Still, I saw more than a dozen of these little palaces under construction. So, what else can Azerbaijan do to move away from oil? Information technology is one of the bigger pushes. If you look at a map of the country, you can see why IT, software and social media companies are reputably looking to set up regional hubs there. Firstly, students are learning English, which is the international language of technology. Secondly, many still speak Russian. The legacy of the former Soviet Union means workers can not only communicate easily with neighboring Russia, but also with potential customers in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan -- two fast growing countries in the region. Add to that two obvious connections: language with Turkey and ethnicity with Iran. If you are setting up a regional company, Baku would be one of the first places you would have to study. Azerbaijan's economy does of course suffer from some of the leftovers of the Communist era. The roads outside Baku are terrible. There are also simmering tensions with neighbor Armenia (not seen on maps whenever I looked at one around the city) and the region is not stable when you add in Georgia, Southern Russia and Chechnya. Azerbaijan is also using its money to reinvigorate the fishing industry, once it has cleaned up the Caspian. It is also building a vast complex, the size of Monaco, of new housing, shops and hotels near the port called White City. It's a tip of the hat to what Baku used to be known as when it produced half the world's oil -- the Black City. One day, Baku might even become a tourist attraction. Thousands of people will be flocking here next year when the country's hosts the European Song Contest finals. Test your knowledge of Azerbaijan . These fans will see a brand new convention center, a new museum in the shape of a rolled up carpet to capture the country's love of making carpets and exporting them around the world, a massive new embankment ringing the Caspian giving people a chance to walk nearly the length of the city, and explore the amazing Old City -- one of the finest in the world and mostly unknown outside the Caucasus. Then, if, and it's a big if, the International Olympic Committee chooses Baku over Istanbul, Doha, Madrid and Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Games, the world will awake to the rise of Azerbaijan. Baku must be seen as a long shot, but it was put to me by several people, that like the Games themselves, it is more important to take part in the process than to necessarily win. Baku wants to be seen on a world stage and is learning what steps to take for its growing economy and wealth to be noticed far and wide.","Baku, capital city of Azerbaijan is reveling in its energy wealth .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A royal chauffeur was suspended Sunday after he allegedly allowed undercover reporters from a British tabloid to enter Buckingham Palace in exchange for cash. Buckingham Palace has been the subject of high-profile security breaches before. Mazher Mahmood, of the London-based News of the World, claimed he was allowed to enter the London residence of Queen Elizabeth II without security checks after paying a man identified as a Buckingham chauffeur £1,000 ($1,591). Footage of the incident filmed undercover showed the chauffeur giving Mahmood, whose face was blurred, a tour of the royal garage and, at one point, allowing him to sit in one of the vehicles. A palace spokesperson told CNN that the chauffeur ""has been suspended pending further investigation."" British media named the chauffeur, but CNN could not independently confirm his identity. Meanwhile, Mahmood's editor, Robert Jobson, told ITN: ""Nobody stopped him, nobody actually challenged him. It actually exposes a serious lapse in security at Buckingham Palace."" Jobson added that even senior members of the royal family and longtime staffers are required to present photo identification cards upon entry to the palace. ""Our investigator is sitting where the queen sits in the royal limo,"" Jobson said, referring to the video. ""And the fact is, we've been told that security has been tightened up, that these things wouldn't happen again, new rules and regulations were brought in -- they simply haven't worked."" A spokesman for Scotland Yard told CNN, ""We are naturally concerned about the issues raised by this story and are liaising with palace officials about their staff security arrangements."" A police statement issued to CNN later Sunday said: ""We are naturally concerned about the issues raised by this story and are liaising with palace officials about their staff security arrangements."" Buckingham Palace has experienced a number of high-profile security lapses in the past. In 2003 an investigation was launched after ""comedy terrorist"" Aaron Barschak gatecrashed Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle, PA reported. Wearing a dress, beard and sunglasses, Barschak climbed on stage as the prince addressed the crowd, and kissed him on both cheeks. That same year, a journalist with the Daily Mirror newspaper spent two months ""working undercover"" as a palace footman.","Reporter claims he entered palace after paying a ""Buckingham chauffeur""

"(CNN) -- What started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. Here is a roundup of some of the movement's recent developments. NEW YORK . Zuccotti Park wore a deserted look early Wednesday morning, a day after police in riot gear cleared out protesters and the state supreme court ruled that demonstrators could return -- but cannot camp out. A smattering of people mingled in the park grounds under the watchful eyes of the New York Police Department, which maintained an overnight presence. The park, police said, is open 24 hours and people can pass through it or sit in it if they wish. But they are prohibited from sleeping there. For nearly two months, the Lower Manhattan property has been a home for the loosely defined group of protesters. The movement that began there spawned similar demonstrations in cities nationwide and around the world. DALLAS . City attorneys will meet with representatives of Occupy Dallas Wednesday to consider next steps after a federal judge denied the group's request to prevent its eviction from City Hall property. U.S. District Judge Jane Boyle's decision meant City Hall was effectively free to forcibly evict the encampment members. But Mayor Mike Rawlings issued a statement saying no action would be taken until Wednesday. Early Wednesday morning, about 200 campers remained at the site, said protester Raymond Sanford. ""We're in good spirits. Most of us believe the First Amendment gives us the right to be here since the Constitution supersedes local ordinances. So I and many others are not leaving here, no matter what,"" Sanford told CNN. SEATTLE . Police used pepper spray and arrested at least six people Tuesday night after confrontations with demonstrators who did not heed officers' calls to clear city streets. The group marched from Seattle Central Community College to downtown Belltown, blocking traffic, CNN affiliate KCPQ said. Police told the protesters to get on the sidewalk. ""At one point, a 17-year-old female suspect swung a stick at an officer but failed to strike him,"" a police statement said, according to KCPQ. ""As officers moved in to arrest the female suspect, the officers were hindered in their efforts. Officers deployed pepper spray to move subjects away from them so they could affect the arrest of the female suspect."" The protesters then staged a sit-in, blocking another intersection during rush hour. Police used pepper spray once again to disperse the demonstrators, CNN affiliate KING said. ""We condemn the outrageous behavior of the SPD in response to civil disobedience, a peaceful and time honored form of political protest,"" Occupy Seattle said in a statement. It said that among those hurt were an 84-year-old woman, a priest and a pregnant woman. SAN FRANCISCO . Thousands of students and protesters gathered on the UC Berkeley campus Tuesday for a day-long general strike involving teach-ins, marches and a general assembly where the Occupy Cal group opted again to put up tents in Sproul Plaza, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Last week, police tore down the tents and arrested 40 people. Tuesday afternoon, UC Berkeley's chancellor said that some tents might be allowed as a form of political expression, the station said. TORONTO . Protesters in Toronto won an injunction against a city eviction notice issued Tuesday, allowing them to stay in St. James Park. Judge David Brown granted the temporary stay, saying he needed more information before he could rule on the city's plans to remove protesters, CNN affiliate CBC said. In Calgary, protesters have until Wednesday to clear out of Olympic Plaza, after police handed out eviction notices. And the City of Victoria has sought an injunction to remove tents from the camp at Centennial Square. The case has been adjourned until Thursday to give demonstrators more time to prepare, CBC said. LONDON . London authorities served notice Wednesday asking protesters to clear tents and belongings off the road that runs beside St. Paul's Cathedral. The activists have 24 hours to obey the notice. If they do not move their belongings, the City of London Corporation, which runs the financial district, says it will then start proceedings in the High Court. The Corporation had called a temporary halt to legal action two weeks ago while it pursued talks with the activists on how to limit the size of the camp and set an end date for the protest. But after those talks ""got nowhere,"" the body now believes legal action is necessary to ensure roadway safety and meet the needs of local businesses, policy chairman Stuart Fraser said Tuesday. ""Sadly, now they have rejected a reasonable offer to let them stay until the New Year, it's got to be the courts,"" he said in a statement, referring to the protesters. Many of the tents set up by the Occupy activists around St Paul's are on what the corporation designates as a public road. St. Paul's suspended its own legal action against the activists after a number of senior cathedral figures resigned over the threat to evict them. St. Paul's said Wednesday it recognized the authorities' right to take action, and that cathedral staff would continue to meet regularly with the protesters.","Zuccotti Park wears a deserted look .

"(CNN) -- For all of our talk of Americans being straight shooters who don't like to mince words and have the freedom of speech to say exactly what's on our minds, we sure punk out when it comes to elected officials speaking the truth. Case in point: President Barack Obama describing American corporations as being ""lazy"" in competing globally. Now, if you hear that word by itself, you would think, ""Man, that's horrible our president said such a thing."" But here is EXACTLY what he said during a conversation with Boeing's CEO as they discussed American businesses selling more products overseas, and attracting foreign investment to the U.S.: . ""You know, we've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We've kind of taken for granted, well, people will want to come here, and we aren't out there hungry selling America, and trying to attract new businesses into America."" That's it. Was he talking about workers turning out cars in Detroit? Nope. Was President Obama dissing manufacturing workers in North Carolina? Not at all. He was talking about Americans being far more aggressive in trying to sell our wares abroad. That's it. Simple. Easy. And on point. Then all of a sudden, Texas Gov. Rick Perry used the word in an ad, not even bothering with the context. Fox anchor Martha MacCallum said Obama was ""scolding"" Americans. Sean Hannity, never one to let facts get in the way of a good lie, said Obama ""attacked"" Americans. And the king of taking anything out of context, Rush Limbaugh, said the president ""insults the people who make this country work."" Seriously, please pass the cup so these folks can take a drug test because they are hallucinating. This is the problem with the stubborn belief in American exceptionalism: It assumes that no matter what the issue, Americans are the best in the world and can't be topped or beaten. There is another word for this: arrogance. Yes, it's true. Americans can be absolutely arrogant when it comes to competing with the rest of the world. A few months ago I read a story where American college students were dismayed that they had to apply for jobs overseas. Well, if that's where multinational corporations are hiring, then we might have to learn to get a passport, hop on the plane, and learn how to Skype in order to talk to family members. Are we so arrogant to think the rest of the world is desperate to come here and we may not have to go to other countries? We can't continue to act like our stuff doesn't stink. There are many areas where Americans are lazy, and in the words of President George W. Bush, we must end ""the soft bigotry of low expectations."" Maybe this comes from our view of sports. It used to be on the national sporting stage, the attitude of America in gymnastics, boxing, track and field, basketball and numerous other sports was that we could just wake up, walk into a stadium with the American flag on our chest, and everyone else would faint, allowing us to win. Well, that ain't gonna cut it. And when we lose, Americans totally freak out, wondering how we got beat. Easy. H-A-R-D W-O-R-K. We need a dose of reality at times to remind us that to to be the best, we must have the right work ethic. According to the Broad Education Foundation: . -- 68% of American eighth graders can't read at grade level and won't catch up . -- American students rank 21st in science compared to students in 30 industrialized countries . -- America's top math students rank 25th out of 30 countries . In 2000, the last time The World Health Organization ranked the top health systems in the world, the U.S. was 37th, behind France (first); Oman (eighth); and Chile (33rd). Maybe part of the problem is the American culture rewards weakness. If America wants to be the absolute best, we must stop telling our children that they are so exceptional when they are not. If your kid can't shoot, pass, dribble or rebound, guess what? They are terrible at basketball and should find a new sport. If it's just about the enjoyment, fine. But if it's about winning, they can't cut it. I was talking to a CNN colleague whose mother is a teacher and she said that her mom can't grade papers in red ink anymore because that is considered too aggressive. Really? Has America become so weak that we can't even handle a school paper graded in red? I'm sick of us giving awards at schools just because we don't want a kid to feel bad. Guess what? Suck it up. First, second and third is fine with me. You finished eighth? Tough. No ribbon for you. No apologies. Notre Dame's Brian Kelly and Nebraska's Bo Pelini had to apologize because folks complained about them yelling and shouting at their players on the sidelines. Thank God Vince Lombardi and Knute Rockne are dead. We would run them out of town! In Walter Isaacson's excellent book, ""Steve Jobs,"" the co-founder of Apple is blasted by some for his treatment of workers and competitors. Was some of Jobs' stuff over the top? Sure. But what was he trying to do? He was trying to create a world-class company that could withstand the test of time and wasn't filled with a bunch of B players. He wanted excellence in every spot, and would rather fire a B or C player on the spot than accept shoddy work. Hey, I'm down with the philosophy of Jobs. Those are the kind of companies I've worked for in the past, and I was taught that if you want to win at something, you better be the best. Heck, even Jobs wasn't above criticizing President Obama, saying that one of the reasons he was on his way to a one-term presidency was because, ""He's having trouble leading because he's reluctant to offend people or piss them off."" ""Yes, that's not a problem I ever had,"" Isaacson quotes Jobs as saying. Now that's some real talk. I'll guarantee you this: Weak and lazy corporate bosses allow weak and lazy employees to stick around. And weak and lazy employees tend to turn out a weak and sorry product that nobody wants. And weak and lazy people accept mediocrity with ease. America, it's time to suck it up. If we love the harsh and in-your-face American Idol/X Factor judging of Simon Cowell, then we should accept it in the real world. This nation needs a swift kick in the butt, and there is nothing wrong when President Obama says it. If House Speaker John Boehner said the same, I would be hollering, ""Amen!"" If America wants to maintain it's position as a great nation, then we are going to have to roll up our sleeves and out-think, out-learn, out-hustle and out-work everyone. So Gov. Perry, instead of spending time taking President Obama out of context in an ad, you need to work harder in debates. Herman Cain, you don't like the president using the word lazy? Then bone up on foreign affairs. Republicans and Democrats unhappy with President Obama challenging our corporate leaders, stop kicking the can down the road on the tough budget stuff and make a principled, not partisan, call. We have been better and can be better. So let's do better. Today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Martin: Critics taking Obama's ""lazy"" comment out of context .
In many areas, Americans are in fact lazy, says Martin .
68% of U.S. 8th graders can't read at grade level, he says .
Some Americans coddle their children in school and sports, he says ."
"Paris (CNN) -- French officials Tuesday condemned an Israeli airstrike on Gaza that wounded its consul, his wife and their daughter, calling on Israel to avoid civilian casualties. ""France strongly deplores the consequences of this air strike,"" a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris announced. ""While France is committed to security in Israel, it reaffirms the imperative need to avoid attacks on civilians. This imperative was reaffirmed to the Israeli authorities."" The consul, Majdi Shakoura, was at home with his family in the northern end of Gaza when the airstrike hit about 200 meters (650 feet) away, the Foreign Ministry said. The strike blew out their windows, and they were struck by shards of flying glass, the ministry said. Capt. Aryeh Shalikar, an Israeli military spokesman, told CNN the airstrike was aimed at Palestinian militants who fired a rocket into southern Israel late Sunday. Shalikar said the Israel Defense Forces ""never received any official statement from any source"" regarding injuries to Shakoura or his relatives. ""The IDF wishes to convey that missiles are being fired at Israeli civilians from terrorists, and it has no intention of harming civilians when it returns fire at terrorists,"" he said. Palestinian security and medical officials said one person died and several others were wounded in the airstrike, which they said struck a Hamas naval building in northern Gaza. A Hamas security official said two Israeli rockets struck the building. France has a consulate and a cultural center in Gaza ""to support the population,"" the Foreign Ministry said. France has helped build water and sewer systems and rebuild hospitals in Gaza, which is ruled by the Islamic movement Hamas. The United States, European Union and Israel classify Hamas as a terrorist organization, and Israel has maintained a controversial blockade of Gaza since Hamas took power in 2007. CNN's Naima Benallal in Paris and Izzy Lemberg in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","NEW: French consul, family hit by flying glass, ministry says .

With your commercial-free source for classroom news, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Japan Election Day . AZUZ: First up, a big shift in political power as Japanese voters weigh in at the ballot box. The Liberal Democratic Party has run Japan's government for decades. Not anymore. Early results from yesterday's parliamentary elections show that the Democratic Party of Japan won in a landslide. The country's current prime minister announced his resignation based on this outcome. That's because the position, which is similar to the U.S. president, is filled by someone from the majority party. Kyung Lah explores some of the reasons behind the transition in Japan's ruling party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAN ON STREET: Bonzai! KYUNG LAH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is the sound of a political earthquake in Japan. A landslide victory for the opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan, booting out the prime minister and his ruling party. Supporters wept as candidates for the Liberal Democratic Party lost seat after seat in the parliament. A crushing defeat for a party that had run Japan's government almost continuously since 1955. Here at the opposition party headquarters, they're watching the final vote tally to come in. At the end of it, the opposition expects to win Japan's parliament by 3 to 1, a mandate by the voters. A change that's long overdue, says longtime Japan watcher Richard Jerram. RICHARD JERRAM, MACQUARIE CAPITAL SECURITIES: It's tremendously exciting. You've got a change of government, probably on a lasting basis, for the first time in 50 years. You've got the prospect of changing how they run the government by reducing the bureaucracy and trying to increase the political influence on policymaking. So politically, it's very exciting. LAH: What led voters to line up at polling places was a sense of frustration over domestic scandals, but more importantly, the economy. Voting for an untested party like the opposition is a sign of how much anger there is about the slowdown in the world's second largest economy. YOSHIKO SHIRAISHI, VOTER [TRANSLATED]: ""I want them to change something,"" says this voter, punching her card for the opposition. MASAYUKI NAKAMURA, VOTER [TRANSLATED]: ""The money's been going the wrong way,"" says this man. ""I hope the money will now go towards jobs and creating a safety net."" LAH: Voters are now counting on sweeping change to match the sweeping political victory of Japan's new ruling party. Kyung Lah, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEO CLIP) Fast Facts . ERIK NIVISON, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some Fast Facts! When a U.S. Senate seat opens up, how is it filled? It depends on the state. In 37 states, the governor picks the senator's replacement. The remaining 13 states can schedule a special election to replace the senator, but when and how those special elections are held can vary by state. Massachusetts, the state that Senator Ted Kennedy represented, has a special election. It's held 145 to 160 days after the Senate seat becomes vacant. Replacing Kennedy . AZUZ: It's a situation that's taking place right now after Senator Kennedy's death last week at the age of 77. Funeral services were held in Boston on Saturday. President Obama and the first lady attended, along with past presidents and many of Kennedy's colleagues in the U.S. Senate. People gathered to honor the late senator, both in the streets of Boston and on the steps of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Senator Kennedy was laid to rest Saturday evening in Arlington National Cemetery. We just mentioned how Massachusetts selects a Senate replacement. But recently, someone asked that the state's law be changed: Ted Kennedy. He wanted his seat to be filled quickly. Jessica Yellin looks at why. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JESSICA YELLIN, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Before he died, Sen. Kennedy sent a letter to his state's top officials writing, ""I believe it is vital for this commonwealth to have two votes in the Senate."" He asked that state law be changed to allow the governor to appoint someone to Kennedy's seat as soon as it became vacant. Massachusetts' new senior senator echoed that request. SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: He's asking simply for a temporary ability to appoint someone who will not run, who will not get in the way of other people who want to run, who will be there for a moment only. YELLIN: Currently, the state is required to hold a special election, which would happen January 19th at the earliest. That's probably too late for a vote on health care reform, the issue Kennedy called ""the cause of my life."" In this climate, Democrats need every vote they can get. The math is not good. With Kennedy's death, Democrats are one vote shy of a 60 vote super majority. They could try to pass reform using a special tactic called ""reconciliation,"" that requires only 51 votes. But Senator Robert Byrd is ill and top Democrats worry at least six of their own Senators plus independent Joe Lieberman could vote no, depending on the contents of the bill. If they pick up no Republicans and lose all fence sitters, Democrats have barely enough votes to pass health care reform. Massachusetts' governor is pressing lawmakers to change the law and give Democrats that vote. GOV. DEVAL PATRICK, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: I'm hoping that the legislature will turn to it and turn to it soon, and if they send me a bill, I will sign it. YELLIN: State leaders have not made clear whether they favor a temporary appointment, but top national Democrats tell CNN they believe lawmakers will ultimately support it. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Snidman's current events classes at Ladue Horton Watkins High School in Ladue, Missouri. How many more space shuttle missions has NASA scheduled? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Three, B) Six, C) Twelve or D) Fifteen? You've got three seconds  -- GO! NASA is planning six more shuttle missions, with the last one launching in September 2010. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Shuttle Liftoff . AZUZ: Those six planned trips we mentioned don't include the current mission of the space shuttle Discovery, because it already took off. The shuttle launched just before midnight Friday night, and was scheduled to meet up with the international space station last night. Discovery will be connected to the ISS for eight days, transferring supplies and equipment to the orbiting station. This marks just the second time that thirteen people -- the full crews of Discovery and the ISS -- will be on one spacecraft at the same time. California Wildfires . AZUZ: Coming back down to Earth, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency because of a raging wildfire in Los Angeles country. This move will help free up resources to help fight the blaze. As of yesterday afternoon, no deaths had been reported, although several people had been injured. The flames are threatening more than 12,000 buildings in the area, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. More than 1,800 firefighters were battling the blaze, which Gov. Schwarzenegger says is one of more than half a dozen wildfires burning across the state. Jimena Path . AZUZ: Experts say residents in southern California also need to keep an eye on Hurricane Jimena. Yesterday afternoon, the storm was a Category 4, with winds of 135 miles per hour. It was approaching Baja, California, which is actually part of Mexico, and moving through the Pacific Ocean heading north. Jimena is the 10th named storm of the Pacific hurricane season. That's a totally separate list from the Atlantic season, which so far has seen storms like Bill and Danny. Blog Report . AZUZ: Following up on last Friday's story about schools reducing bus service to save money, here's what some of you guys had to say about it. Katie says ""schools have to do whatever it takes to survive in our economy. If it takes budget cuts and fewer school bus stops, then that's what they have to do."" But Syera disagrees, writing that ""some students might not have rides to school; they should not have to walk. And some students don't own a bike."" Janai felt the same way, noting that ""not all parents had other options -- besides the bus -- on getting their child to and from school."" Thomas wrote this on Facebook: ""Cutting busses... Encouraging students to walk to school... It's helping both the environment and improving your health."" But back on the blog, Austin said, ""You hear about all kinds of money being spent on other somewhat useless things. Can't they give just a little more to the school systems?"" Tell us what you think about all this on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com. And for the blog, please remember, it is first names only. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, trying to set world records can be a slippery slope, especially when it involves an attempt at the world's biggest slip 'n slide. Or slip 'n scoot. Maybe slip 'n crawl. Are you sure you guys know how this is supposed to work? Looks like organizers pulled out all the stops to break the record. They laid out a 575 foot slide, they turned on the water, then they sent 235 people down the hill. Goodbye . AZUZ: It's just too bad that wasn't enough to break the record.

"(CNN) -- Residents are still dealing with the aftermath of Irene -- a massive storm that pummeled the East Coast. The storm killed 43 people from Florida to New England and some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. More than 1.1 million customers were still without power Thursday from North Carolina to Maine, the U.S. Department of Energy said. Relief organizations are working to help victims in Irene's path. There are ways you can help. At least 1,300 people awoke Wednesday morning in Red Cross shelters up and down the East Coast. The Red Cross has provided about 54,000 overnight shelter stays since the storm hit. ""The storm may be over, but our work is far from done,"" said Gail McGovern, Red Cross president. ""We expect this disaster relief operation to be a very large operation that will continue for several weeks."" The organization has served more than 680,000 meals and snacks and has handed out more than 29,000 relief items such as hygiene kits, mops and tarps. To donate to relief efforts, visit the website or text the word ""REDCROSS"" to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Irene has also caused a shortfall of more than 2,700 blood donations over the past few days. To donate blood, go online or call 1-800-REDCROSS. The Salvation Army is helping survivors who are still struggling with the floods and power outages left by Irene. The organization has served nearly 150,000 meals, snacks and drinks to storm victims from the Carolinas to New England. The group has been providing warm meals to evacuees and emergency responders in flood impacted northeastern states including New York and Vermont. To make a donation, go online, call 1-800-SAL-ARMY or text ""STORM"" to 80888 to make a $10 donation. $10 will feed a disaster survivor for one day. Samaritan's Purse teams are working in coastal North Carolina to help victims of Irene. A Disaster Relief Unit has been set up in New Bern, North Carolina. Staff and volunteers began removing downed trees and assisting homeowners on Sunday afternoon. Visit the website to make a donation or to sign up as a volunteer. Teams from Operation Blessing International are in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia clearing debris from homes and providing food to residents whose homes were flooded. The group is accepting volunteers in teams of three or more people to help remove debris, repair homes and serve hot meals. To volunteer, call the organization's office of National Volunteer Management at 1-757-226-3407 or e-mail volunteer@ob.org. Donations can be made on the website.

"(CNN) -- Richard Garriott had more reason than most to dream the Apollo moon landings would rapidly expand space travel. His father was a NASA astronaut, as were many of his neighbors near Texas' Johnson Space Center. This is a rendering of XCOR Aerospace's Lynx, which would be used to send people on suborbital spaceflights. With nearly all of humanity still on Earth nearly four decades later, the computer game developer paid $35 million for a ride aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the international space station. ""Flight to space is an entire series of pinnacle life experiences,"" said Garriott, a 48-year-old board member of Space Adventures, the company that arranged his 12-day trip last year. ""The view of the Earth is life changing."" Garriott believes the United States hasn't fulfilled the promise of the Apollo program yet. ""It was an assumed future that we'd all go to space [by now],""  he said. ""That hasn't come to pass, and it's created this interesting evolution of spaceflight right now."" That evolution involves the privatization of space, and although the prospect of a spacecraft in every garage isn't near, a few private firms are getting close to manned, commercial spaceflight. Some companies, such as Virgin Galactic, aim to sell suborbital flights -- high enough to reach the edges of space and weightlessness -- within the next few years. The flights have varied purposes, including tourism and science experiments. A Nevada company hopes to sell habitable space stations where paying clients would conduct scientific research. Two relatively new U.S. aerospace companies were hired last year by NASA to send unmanned cargo to the international space station. NASA plans to retire the space shuttle at the end of 2010 and wouldn't be able to send crews to the space station for at least several years after that. ""I really view us and the private sector as the spiritual inheritors of Apollo,"" said Mike Gold, director of the Washington office of Bigelow Aerospace, the company developing the commercial space stations. Suborbital flights: Thrills and experiments now, orbit later . One group preparing to sell suborbital flights is Virgin Galactic, whose parent company is partnering with California-based Scaled Composites to develop SpaceShipTwo, the successor to 2004's Ansari X Prize-winning SpaceShipOne. Space tourists will pay Virgin $200,000 each for training and a 2.5-hour flight to the edge of space and back. About 300 people have paid at least the majority of the fee to reserve the first flights, and about 80,000 others have registered interest, said Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic's commercial director. The spaceship, which will carry six passengers and be based in New Mexico, will be hoisted by a carrier craft to 50,000 feet before blasting on its own to suborbit, where passengers will float weightless about the cabin and see space and the Earth through large windows. The craft will land on a runway and be reused. The carrier craft is being flight tested, and SpaceShipTwo's flight tests are expected to begin at the end of this year, Attenborough said. With 20 to 30 test spaceflights expected, it could be 18 months to two years before it's ready commercially, he said. Tourism isn't the only planned use. The craft could be modified to launch microsatellites, and Virgin hopes to sell flights to agencies for microgravity or atmospheric experiments. ""To be able to have something like SpaceCraftTwo to put scientists in space ... at a relatively low cost, it's transforming for science,"" Attenborough said. California's XCOR Aerospace also is developing a reusable vehicle that will take a pilot and a front-seat customer to the edge of space -- for pleasure or to transport scientific payloads that would benefit from microgravity. XCOR's Lynx, roughly the size of a small airplane, will take off and land on a runway and propel itself with liquid-fuel engines. Sales agent RocketShip Tours is selling one-hour Lynx rides plus training for $95,000 a person. Initially launching from Mojave, California, participants will get a view from the edge of space for several minutes and briefly experience weightlessness. Test flights may begin by the end of 2010, and testing would take at least a year, CEO Jeff Greason said. A second, expendable stage may be added to launch nanosatellites, he said. Like other suborbital providers, XCOR eventually wants to develop an orbital vehicle. The Lynx is a technical pathfinder to that -- something that could make money and prove the reliability and safety of the technology. ""There's a market for people in orbit if the price is low enough,"" Greason said. ""There's more work to do [in orbit], including people flying to be a laborer to work on somebody's widget or experiment."" iReport.com: Where were you during the moon landing? Commercial, habitable space stations . Getting people to orbit is exactly what Bigelow Aerospace needs to sell its space stations. Bigelow is developing expandable space habitats with a flexible-fabric shell. They would be compressed in a capsule for launch and expand upon deployment. Bigelow primarily sees the habitats as destinations for research scientists and astronauts -- particularly those from countries that haven't used the international space station as much as they'd like or nations making their first steps into space, Gold said. The space station's own future is in doubt, with a NASA space station program manager recently telling a public hearing that NASA currently plans to de-orbit the station in 2016, according to The Washington Post. Affordable microgravity research can help manufacturers make new material for things such as supercomputers and buildings, Gold said. Bigelow -- founded and financed by hotel chain owner Robert Bigelow -- put two subscale, uninhabited models in orbit in 2006 and 2007 through a Russian/Ukrainian launch provider. It eventually aims to develop a full habitat that can support up to eight people. But it won't launch the habitat without a way to transport people there. Gold, Garriott and others in the private sector say they hope NASA can be persuaded to invest in, and eventually hire, aerospace companies to deliver NASA astronauts to low-Earth orbit instead of using its own spacecraft. In such a scenario, the companies would also get to sell their shuttle services to other private-sector customers. That would increase launch rates and lower costs for NASA and the private sector, they said. NASA did not respond to a request for comment. Putting people into orbit . One company that may wish to help is Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), one of two firms NASA hired to send unmanned cargo to the international space station after the shuttle's planned retirement. SpaceX, founded and financed by PayPal founder Elon Musk, received money from NASA to develop its spacecraft. Last year, the California company was awarded a NASA contract for 12 supply flights from roughly 2011 to 2015. SpaceX will use its Falcon 9 rocket topped by its Dragon capsule, which would carry the cargo. The rocket's first test flight should be later this year, said Larry Williams, SpaceX's vice president for strategic relations. Three demonstration flights with the Dragon would follow, starting perhaps in early 2010, with the Dragon docking with the space station on the third trip. NASA does have an option to fund a version of the Dragon that can transport astronauts, and SpaceX is eager to do that. However, NASA hasn't executed the option, Williams said. With the global economic downturn, one might think developing space products and finding customers would be difficult. But people in the industry -- especially those working for companies founded by businessmen with large fortunes -- say they'll be fine in the long term. ""Our industry is still hiring engineers, whereas most industries are laying people off,"" said John Gedmark, executive director of the industry group Commercial Spaceflight Federation. ""The investors putting money behind these ventures are personally committed.""","Private firms are getting close to manned, commercial spaceflight .

"(CNN) -- As a Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate said she would demand an investigation of a weekend shooting at a campaign event, one ruling party lawmaker had a different take: The candidate should have seen the violence coming. Rep. Freddy Bernal, a former Caracas mayor and close ally of President Hugo Chavez, told El Universal newspaper that Maria Corina Machado and other opposition candidates should steer clear of Chavez strongholds. ""They know that they're not going to have any votes there. They know that nobody votes for them there, that they are not wanted. So what are they going to do there?"" Bernal said, according to the newspaper. The Caracas-based daily published his comments two days after gunshots sent Machado and her supporters scrambling at an event Saturday. Machado's campaign told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Monday that the opposition candidate plans to file a formal complaint with investigators Tuesday. A video purporting to show the shooting on YouTube shows the candidate addressing residents and reporters shortly after she threw the first pitch in a softball game. Thirty seconds into the roughly 50-second clip, several gunshots ring out; people scatter. Some board a bus while a voice in the video shouts: ""Go, go, go!"" Separately, El Nacional newspaper published a photo of what it said was the shooting, showing two people on a motorcycle. Wearing a red T-shirt, the man on the back is pointing a gun at a bus. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the images, which were also posted on the candidate's website. Speaking to CNN en EspaÃ±ol shortly after the attack, Machado blamed ""criminal gangs"" for the shooting and accused the government of providing some groups with weapons. ""The government has absolutely lost control and, in many cases, has been complicit with the criminal gangs,"" she said. Venezuela's information and justice ministries have not responded to CNN's requests for comment on the shooting. Bernal told El Universal that Machado's visit to the neighborhood in eastern Caracas -- a Chavez stronghold and one of the city's most dangerous areas -- was a ""provocation."" But he said the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela has no need to intimidate opponents with violence. ""We have no reason to do that. We are training people, working and educating them, in peace, democracy and tranquility,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We will not resort to provocations, because we are winning this game,"" he added, arguing that Chavez has a clear lead in polls. ""Chaos, provocation, destabilization and violence are convenient for the opposition."" Machado, a 44-year-old representative in Venezuela's National Assembly, is one of several presidential candidates who will participate in a primary election next year. The winner will be the unity opposition candidate to run against Chavez. Roberto Abdul, president of the board of directors of Sumate -- a Venezuela-based pro-democracy organization that Machado helped found -- said Saturday's shooting was a troubling sign of Venezuela's security problems. ""Violence against any citizen is condemnable. Political violence also must be condemned. ... I think that the government, given that (Machado) is a federal lawmaker, should respond,"" he said, noting that Machado had stepped down from her role as a leader of Sumate when she became a lawmaker and is no longer affiliated with the organization. Candidates from all political parties should be able to campaign safely, he said. ""If they think that the opposition doesn't have support, that's even more of a reason that they should be allowed to freely campaign,"" he said. ""We cannot by any means allow the use of violence to be a (campaign) mechanism. ... They don't have control of the violence, or they are controlling it selectively."" Journalist Osmary Hernandez in Caracas contributed to this report.","Lawmaker: Opposition candidate Machado's event provoked gunfire .

"(CNN) -- When Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon, he uttered unforgettable words. But the next visitor to roam the lunar landscape may send back e-mail instead. One of the teams competing in the Google Lunar X Prize is considering this rover concept for the mission. Welcome to a new kind of space race, where the earthly guest will be a machine and the goal is as much exploration as seeking out new business ventures. The quest is part of the Google Lunar X Prize, which will put $20 million into the hands of the first privately funded team that can land a rover on the moon; have it travel on the surface for 500 meters or more; send back data, photos and video; and do it all by December 31, 2012. The prize drops to $15 million after that date and goes away altogether after 2014. One of the main requirements is to have as little government involvement in the project as possible. ""We believe that space should be open to anyone and everyone, especially those people who want to go,"" said Becky Ramsey, the X Prize Foundation's director of communications for space projects. ""The government has accomplished amazing things ... but we think that we can do it less expensively."" The idea grew out of conversations between X Prize Chairman Peter Diamandis and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. ""We thought it would be a good fit,"" said Tiffany Montague, technical program manager at Google and the company's main representative for the Google Lunar X Prize. ""Many of us here are interested in space as a hobby, or we came from space backgrounds."" Google, which is paying the main prize purse -- $30 million total, including bonus prizes -- hopes the competition will result in education, ""interesting new content"" and inspiration, she added. ""What I think this prize is really about is inspiring young minds and inspiring the global population to compete for a dream,"" Montague said. 'Garage bands' of space exploration . There are 13 teams officially competing in the race, but the X Prize Foundation expects that number to grow to about 25. The multinational lineup includes Americans, Italians, Romanians and a ""mystery team,"" which can hide its identity until July 20, 2009, under the rules.  See photos of the teams and their rover concepts » . The competitors include university scientists, business people, engineers, robotics experts and even students. Ramsey said all of the teams are considered serious contenders, but not all of them are expected to be able to complete the task. ""I liken our teams to the garage bands of the space exploration world,"" she said. ""These are the people who have a dream, who have a passion, who have the knowledge and ability and the drive, and they think they can do this. So we're giving them the opportunity."" The teams face a number of daunting tasks, including figuring out how and where to launch, designing a craft that can complete the journey and making sure it can execute a required ""soft landing."" ""The craft has to alight on the moon a little like you'd expect an insect or a bird to land here on Earth, and it means that you can't impact or crash into the surface at high speed,"" said Red Whittaker, chairman and CEO of Astrobotic Technology, one of the teams competing for the prize. Once they land, the rovers must be ready to cope with extreme conditions. Whittaker listed a vacuum environment, radiation, temperature extremes and soft terrain as some of the special challenges of the lunar landscape. Expensive mission . Another big obstacle is the money. Reaching for the moon -- literally -- is an immensely pricey endeavor, and the mission is likely to cost much more than the $20 million first prize, a fact the sponsors freely recognize. ""I think what's important to keep in mind is that this is an incentive prize and is not meant to cover the costs of development,"" Montague said. ""Instead, it is meant to be a catalyst to shake up industry and inspire breakthrough."" To help finance their plans, the teams are seeking out investors, partners and sponsors. Celestis, a company that launches cremated human remains into Earth's orbit, recently announced that it has reached an agreement with two of the teams, Astrobotic and Odyssey Moon, to carry human ashes to the moon. NASA could also be a customer for the teams, whose craft could carry scientific payloads, Ramsey said. The agency believes that there's potential for collaboration, but there's nothing formal in the works, said David Steitz, a spokesman at NASA headquarters in Washington. He added that NASA is giving a thumbs-up to the competition. ""We're excited about anyone who's excited about space. We don't claim to have a monopoly on exploration,"" Steitz said. The business of the moon . Many of the teams regard the race as just the start of a long-term business plan. Astrobotic envisions a dozen lunar missions, scouting sites and offering payload services to businesses and governments, Whittaker said. Odyssey Moon CEO Robert Richards said his team also plans to keep coming back. ""We are absolutely committed to an enduring presence on the moon,"" Richards said.  Watch Richards demonstrate rover designs » . ""If we don't win the prize, we will certainly cheer those who do, and we will continue with our efforts to provide a permanent, established mechanism for humanity to reach the moon in a very frequent and cost-effective way."" But with so much money at stake, would it be possible for anyone to fake the mission in order to win the Google Lunar X Prize? Both Ramsey and Montague insisted that could not happen. ""[The teams] have to file a mission plan with us,"" Ramsey said. ""They have to send back images and video from the moon. I don't think in this day and age that it would be possible to fake this signal coming back.""","Google Lunar X Prize goes to the first team that can land a rover on the moon by 2012 .

"(CNN) -- The cricket player who helped spark apartheid-era South Africa's sporting isolation has died at the age of 80. Basil D'Oliveira, a ""colored"" man of Indian-Portuguese heritage from Cape Town, was barred from playing first-class cricket in his home country. He caused a political storm when he was selected by his adopted nation England for the team's 1968-69 tour of South Africa. Having initially been left out of the squad after the South African government exerted pressure, he was called up when a teammate was injured -- and the tour was subsequently canceled amid international outrage. D'Oliveira, a powerful batsman known as ""Dolly,"" went on to play 44 Tests for England, scoring 2,484 runs at an average of 40 and taking 47 wickets with his right-arm medium-pace bowling. He battled Parkinson's disease in his later years, but passed away ""peacefully"" according to his son -- who like his father played for Worcestershire and is now academy director at the county club. ""It is a sad time for us as a family but, after a long battle against Parkinson's disease, dad passed away peacefully,"" Damian D'Oliveira told the England and Wales Cricket Board's official website on Saturday. ""Although it is difficult, we will celebrate a great life rather than mourn a death."" Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola said D'Oliveira was an ""inspiration."" ""Dolly was a true legend and a son of whom all South Africans can be extremely proud,"" Majola said. ""He was a man of true dignity and a wonderful role model as somebody who overcame the most extreme prejudices and circumstances to take his rightful place on the world stage."" Having captained South Africa's non-white cricket team and played for the national non-white football side, a frustrated D'Oliveira emigrated to England in 1960 at the age of 29 after writing to renowned cricket commentator John Arlott and asking for help. He was well past his prime as a player when he finally made his debut for England six years later. ""One can only imagine what he might have achieved had he made his debut as he should have done at the age of 20 on South Africa's tour of England in 1951,"" Majola said. ""The circumstances surrounding his being prevented from touring the country of his birth with England in 1968 led directly to the intensification of opposition to apartheid around the world and contributed materially to the sports boycott that turned out to be an Achilles heel of the apartheid government. ""Throughout this shameful period in South Africa's sporting history, Basil displayed a human dignity that earned him worldwide respect and admiration. His memory and inspiration will live on among all of us."" D'Oliveira wrote about his arrival in England on his official website. ""April 1st 1960 was probably one of the most astonishing days of my life. The plane landed at Heathrow Airport on a very gloomy and damp spring day. I was filled with misgivings and my inferiority complex was at a very low ebb,"" he said. ""I'd left (my wife) Naomi behind. In a few months I would be a father for the first time, and what kind of future could I guarantee Naomi and my child? However as I left with the assurance that the family and friends would take great care of her, an old aunt pulled me to one side and told me to aim high, there's room for everyone up there -- a motto which has stayed with me always. ""I am proud of my color, of what I've achieved for myself and non-whites all over the world, and I dearly love my fellow citizens of Cape Town. I often think back to those days in South Africa, when I was trying to break out of the social and sporting straitjacket imposed by the color of my skin."" Meanwhile, South Africa ended the third day of the second Test against Australia with a lead of 199 runs after Hashim Amla and A.B. de Villiers took the home side to 229-3 in their second innings in Johannesburg. Amla was unbeaten on 89 and De Villiers was on 70 when bad light and rain ended play early on Saturday, having added 139. Captain Graeme Smith was the second man to fall after making 36, while Australia's 18-year-old fast-bowling debutant Pat Cummins took the wickets of Jacques Rudolph (24) and key batsman Jacques Kallis, who passed 12,000 Test runs with his first-innings 54 but this time could manage only two. South Africa won the first game of the two-match series by eight wickets in Cape Town.","Basil D'Oliveira dies aged 80 after a long battle with Parkinson's Disease .

"(CNN) -- A guaranteed multiple Oscar nominee and the film that cements Alexander Payne as one of the top filmmakers of his generation (as if he weren't already there with ""Election,"" ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways""), ""The Descendants"" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's everything that a great film should be: beautifully acted and directed, funny, touching, heartbreaking and, most of all, true. Not only that, but it's George Clooney's best work to date and further highlights his status as the rarest of Hollywood hybrids: the movie star-actor. In the opening voiceover, Matt King (Clooney) attempts to dispel the idea of Hawaii as a paradise, pointing out that Hawaiians get cancer and deal with heartaches, homelessness and every other modern problem that the rest of the world has. Living in Hawaii doesn't make them hurt any less. It's a lesson to learn, because while the film that follows uses Hawaiian landscapes, people and most of all music to great effect. None of these dulls the emotions and experiences that the film evokes. Matt's wife, Elizabeth, is the victim of a boating accident, rendering her comatose, and he suddenly finds himself in charge of 10-year-old Scotty (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). He considers himself the ""backup parent,"" but it's time for him to step up, something he's clearly not ready for. Despite the dark and not remotely funny subject matter of a family whose wife/mother lies in a coma, ""The Descendants"" manages to be sad without being maudlin, funny in the face of tragedy without being insensitive, and a thoroughly enjoyable film without sacrificing drama, character development, story or honesty. A lesser team than Payne and his cast might have swung too far into melodrama and ended up in a slog through long monologues about emotion and relationships, but screenwriters Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (the film is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings) have created an honest and entertaining portrait of a family in crisis. While he has committed to living modestly (""give your kids enough money so that they can do something but not enough so that they can do nothing"" is one of his mottos), Matt is as close to Hawaiian royalty as a (mostly) white man can get. He can trace his family's lineage to both King Kamehameha and the islands' first white settlers. As part of their Hawaiian legacy, Matt and his extended family of cousins (including Cousin Hugh, Cousin Ralph, Cousin Hal, Cousin Milo, Cousin Stan, Cousin Wink, Cousin Six, Cousin Dave and Cousin Connie) own the largest remaining tract of pristine land on Kauai, which is being held in a trust. However, time is running out on said trust, and Matt must decide what to do with it. Sell to developer A or developer B? Don't sell and bequeath it to the state, even though many of the cousins want the money from a sale? It's a dilemma that adds to his familial stress. To top it all off, Alex clues him in to the fact that before his accident, Elizabeth had been cheating on him. Not only is the wife he loves in a coma, she's been betraying him, and there's no way for him to confront her. The scenes where Clooney vents at his comatose wife are heartbreaking, and he is note-perfect as the cuckolded husband who has to process his anger, grief, love and loss simultaneously. These various storylines and others, including what part Elizabeth's lover (Matthew Lillard) plays in all of this, ebb and flow with natural grace and rhythm, taking us along for a memorable ride. The supporting cast is so loaded with exceptional performances that to sing all their praises might seem like overkill. However, three deserve special praise. Woodley, as troubled but intelligent Alex, gives the most authentic and moving adolescent female performance in years. Away at boarding school when the accident happens, Alex is a girl with a troubled past (drinking, drugs) and present, seeing as she's been keeping her mother's infidelity secret, despite the fact that she hated her mother for betraying her father. Now, while Matt is dealing with the emotions brought on by a dying wife whom he cannot even speak with, Alex is processing her own emotions about her mother while co-parenting her younger sister. Woodley accomplishes this with extraordinary class, grace and natural talent. She's got the ""f*** you!"" attitude familiar to parents of a teenager and the burgeoning parental and caring instincts of an adult. Her rapport with Clooney is one of the things that makes this film go. And then there's Sid. Played by newcomer Nick Krause, Sid is the friend Alexandra calls to help her through the tough times, and well, he's kind of an idiot and kind of not and kind of exactly what the film needs. He's goofy but earnest, clueless and caring and, most important, knows what Alex is going through. He also delivers (and receives) some of the film's best lines. Sid's nemesis, for lack of a better word, is Elizabeth's father, Scott (Robert Forster). Played with steely incorrigibility, Scott has blinders on when it comes to his daughter and blames Matt for her condition, suggesting that the accident was Matt's fault because he didn't buy her her own boat. He's going through something no parent should, the impending death of a child, and he's not afraid to speak his mind. Scott's vocal anger toward Matt and cranky old-man persona (complete with beige support socks) hides a grief that plays itself out entirely behind Forster's squinty eyes. It's a devastating performance and pitch perfect. And that's really the crux of what makes this film so magnificent. Pretty much everyone out there knows, to a certain extent, what these characters are going through. Most of us have lost someone. A parent, more often than not, or a child, sibling or spouse. To be personal for a moment, I lost both of my parents during the past six years, and in its way, like some truly great art can, this film has helped me process their loss a little more. Obviously, everyone's experiences are unique, but there are certain near-universal truths that inhabit these types of situations. ""The Descendants"" presents them in natural, comfortable and, best of all, memorable ways. ""The Descendants"" is rated R. It contains all the colorful language one would expect, given the situations.","Reviewer: Film beautifully acted and directed, funny and touching .

"(CNN) -- ""Do not be afraid,"" Bella tells herself as she prepares to stride naked upon a moon-kissed Brazilian beach and consummate her marriage to Edward. It's been her credo through four films now in the boffo ""Twilight"" saga, and for all the criticism that novelist Stephenie Meyer preaches good old-fashioned abstinence, it's worth pointing out that this gutsy heroine has a habit of making up her own mind and going after what she wants, even if (like everyone in her onscreen life) we can't bring ourselves to wholeheartedly approve of Bella's determination to wed and bed a vampire at the age of 18. ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" marks the beginning of the end for Bella (Kristen Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson) and his arch rival, local wereboy Jacob (Taylor Lautner). But fear not, the fat lady hasn't sung just yet, and there's still some life left in this domesticated gothic romance, even if you can feel it draining out before your eyes, drip by drip. It's a rare series that improves the longer it goes on. ""Breaking Dawn"" is too padded to compete with last year's ""Eclipse,"" but on the other hand, the production values have gone up each time, the actors have grown more comfortable in their roles (yes, even Lautner) and with each new film comes a new, more accomplished director. Bill Condon, taking over from David Slade, was a surprising choice for the job -- he's best known for A-list fare like ""Dreamgirls,"" ""Kinsey"" and producing the Hugh Jackman Oscar telecast a couple of years ago -- until you remember his breakthrough film, ""Gods and Monsters"" (with Ian McKellen as ""Frankenstein"" director James Whale), and before that a long apprenticeship in pulp schlock. Condon immediately makes himself at home, throwing in a sneaky tribute to ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" and milking the wedding sequence as if he means to outdo William and Kate. (More trees!) It's not all about the extravagance though: The cross-cutting as the couple exchange their vows is a lovely, simple touch that crystallizes the emotion of the moment. Then Condon reverts to ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Fatuous,"" with a ridiculously ostentatious and overlong honeymoon getaway. iReport: Fans go crazy for the latest 'Twilight' Unlike Mrs. Frankenstein, Bella isn't freaked by her monstrous other half. But the long-delayed and much-anticipated love scene does have a nasty sting in the tail: In Meyer's world, it seems that sex isn't safe even within the bonds of marriage. It's not the act itself (""Awesome"" -- despite the bruising and considerable property damage) but the after-effects, which I suspect most everyone knows by now include the prospects of a little bloodsucker running amok. Having split the last book into two, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg struggles to parse enough plot to keep this episode on the boil -- or even simmering. The aggressive threats from Washington's wolf pack ring hollow, a lame attempt to inject macho excitement into the movie's self-inflicted prolonged pregnant pause. iReport: A 3 out of 5 for this 'Twilight' A doggy powwow is easily the movie's biggest unintentional howler. But mostly, Condon ladles on the atmosphere effectively enough with the now-customary indie-pop soundtrack (Iron and Wine; Sister Rosetta; Mia Maestro) so up front we're only a whisker away from a full-on musical. And he delivers the grotesquely bloody finale with something approaching operatic gusto. We've come a long way since dads could escape labor pains by putting the kettle on and pacing outside in the hallway; this scene could send birth rates plummeting. iReport: 'Twilight' more a social event than a movie . Critics will scoff, and this isn't a very good movie, but it's been a while since I saw anything so deliciously delirious.","""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" is too padded to compete with last year's ""Eclipse""

"(OPRAH.com) -- There are many practices from biblical times that are best left in the past. Stoning adulterers comes to mind. As does sacrificing oxen. But let me tell you about one dusty Middle Eastern custom that deserves a comeback: tithing. For those who skipped Sunday school, tithing is the practice of giving 10 percent of your annual income to the needy. You donate one out of every ten dollars (or shekels or sheep) to the orphans, the widows, the destitute, or the temple high priests. Granted, some folks in 21st-century America still tithe (devout Mormons, for instance, are expected to cough up 10 percent). But the practice has largely gone the way of pharaohs and women named Bathsheba. Which isn't surprising. Tithing is hard as hell, especially in these lean times. I first learned about tithing a few years ago. At the time, I was trying to follow every rule in the Bible -- a journey I chronicled in a book. The Bible told me to tithe. So I tithed. When I told my wife, Julie, about my plan to tithe, she fretted. In general, she's much more magnanimous than I am. She's a sucker for those charities that send you free sheets of return-address labels with little cartoons of a Rollerblading Ziggy, along with a heartbreaking brochure about lymphoma. I tell her it's emotional blackmail. She ignores me and mails them checks. Oprah.com: How to give smart . But even for Julie 10 percent is high, especially with the ridiculously expensive prospect of raising children in New York City. Julie asked whether I could count my literary agent's fee as a tithe. She was only half-joking. ""Can you at least do 10 percent after taxes?"" she said. That night I called a friend who's a Lutheran pastor. ""You shouldn't get too legalistic,"" he said. ""Give what you can. And then give some more. It should feel like a sacrifice."" A.J. Jacobs challenge to you: Day of Extreme Politeness . I studied my Bible for insight. It seems that in the time of ancient Israel -- before the Romans took over -- no one paid taxes per se. The tithes were the taxes. And the tithing system was as complicated as any 1040 form. The farmers gave to the priests, the temple-keepers, the temple itself, the poor, the widows, and the orphans. So I decided after-tax tithing was probably okay. I calculated 10 percent of my projected salary. It wasn't a huge number -- but that was precisely the problem. If I were making $10 million a year and had to give away $1 million, that would have been easier. Although many modern tithers give to their church, I decided to go directly to the needy. I spent hours browsing the Web site CharityNavigator.org. It's sort of a Michelin guide to aid organizations. (Even this leads to coveting -- they list the salaries of these charity CEOs, and some break half a million.) See more ways you can help at CNN's Impact Your World . I settled on several organizations focusing on children and widows, two groups the Bible says are always in need. One was called Feed the Children, another Save Darfur. Oprah.com: How to give when dollars are tight . The giving was painful. I mean, 10 percent? That would have an impact on our lives. Vacations would need to be scaled back, new furniture would have to wait. It was a huge amount. When I pressed ""send"" on the donations, my palms got wet, my heart rate spiked. But it was a pain mixed with pleasure. When the confirmation e-mails pinged in, I felt good. There's a haunting line from the movie ""Chariots of Fire."" It's spoken by Ian Charleson, who plays a deeply religious sprinter in the 1924 Olympics. He says: ""When I run, I feel His pleasure."" And as I gave away money, I think I might have felt God's pleasure. Which is odd. Because I'm agnostic. I don't know if there's a God or not, but still I felt some higher sense of purpose. It was like a cozy ember that started at the back of my neck and slowly spread its warmth through my skull. I felt like I was doing something I should have done all my life. That feeling of pleasure when giving -- scientists actually call it the warm-glow effect -- isn't strong enough to get most Americans to cough up 10 percent, though. According to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, the average American donates about 3 percent of his or her salary to charity. Low-income workers are the most openhanded set, donating an average of 4.5 percent. (Of course, there are many exceedingly generous high-income people. Angelina Jolie has said she gives away a third of her income. The pastor Rick Warren reverse tithes -- he gives away 90 percent of his profits from his megaselling books.) Oprah.com: 6 ways giving makes you healthy . I must confess that I haven't tithed every year since. I'm a quasi tither. This year I donated about 7 percent of my income. Tithing for me is a goal that I want to meet but sometimes don't. (I will, however, be tithing the writer's fee for this article. How can I not?) I've developed some strategies to help make tithing easier. The key is to make it concrete. Try thinking in terms of time. Every ten minutes of work, you are essentially doing one minute of volunteering for the needy. Six times an hour you're doing a mitzvah! Since I'm a writer, I also tell myself this: One out of every ten words belongs to someone deserving. In that previous sentence, it was the word deserving. I also try to remember what I teach my sons. Sharing is caring, I always tell them. If my son had two lollipops in his pocket, and a friend asked for one, I'd tell him to fish one out of his pocket and hand it over. It's the proper thing to do. I should practice what I preach. Finally, I try to think of tithing as a sort of cosmic 10 percent tip. Scientists say that gratitude is like a psychological wonder drug. And by tithing, I'm saying thank you to the universe -- or to God or to fate or to whatever you believe in -- for allowing me to be alive. I want to acknowledge how lucky I am to have food, a roof, a bed, a warm shower, and a father who didn't sacrifice me on top of a mountain.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Raging clashes between police and protesters in Egypt on Saturday left two people dead and 750 injured, the Health Ministry reported, prompting a call from a prominent grass-roots group for citizens to resist the military-led government. The April 6 Movement, which figured prominently in the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak this year, issued a statement urging its members to descend on Cairo's Tahrir Square ""immediately because resistance is the only solution."" ""Down with military rule,"" the movement said. The fighting erupted earlier in the day when police worked to clear the area of people who remained in the square after Friday's massive protests in Tahrir. Tens of thousands of Egyptians turned out Friday to protest plans for a constitution that would shield the military from public oversight. As evening came Saturday, police blanketed the square and fired tear gas. The security forces soon withdrew and stationed themselves at the Interior Ministry. Warning shots were heard throughout the day. Thousands of protesters remained at the scene. They chanted against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which rules Egypt, and Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the council who is effectively the interim ruler of Egypt. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks and torched a police van. Scuffles broke out on side streets and clouds of smoke rose from burned tires, witnesses said. Clashes between protesters and police also reportedly broke out in the cities of Suez and Alexandria. Two people died after being shot -- one in Cairo, one in Alexandria -- said Adel al-Dawi, a spokesman for the Health Ministry. State media reported that 750 people were injured, citing the Health Ministry. The Interior Ministry also said 20 police officers have been injured and eight people have been arrested. ""We sent hundreds of Central Security Police Forces and forced out the remaining several hundred protesters who refused to go home. We arrested four thieves and thugs who acted aggressively and beefed up security in and around square overnight,"" Interior spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said earlier Saturday. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the recent clashes and warned they could have a dangerous impact on Egypt, state media said. The Friday throng, dominated by Islamist parties but including secular protesters as well, turned out ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28. Mahmoud said the ""Islamists and revolutionaries had left as they promised not to have a sit-in."" But stragglers remained, and he said many of the people who stayed in the square were families of those injured during the upheaval earlier this year that led to Mubarak's departure and the ushering in of the supreme council as interim rulers. Yousri Hamad, the official spokesman of the Al Noor Salafi Muslim political party, said he thinks that the violence could affect election plans. ""The protesters are a bunch of kids that attacked the security forces which is a red line and could delay elections,"" Hamad said. The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president, but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers. But protesters were upset Friday about proposed principles for the constitution, in which the military's budget would not be scrutinized by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state. The outpouring reflected the power of Islamist forces in Egypt, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. A leader of that group called for restraint in the wake of Saturday's clashes, state media reported. The demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of Coptic Christians marching in Cairo were attacked by unknown assailants. At least 32 people, including two police officers, were injured. They were heading to Cairo's Tahrir Square to commemorate the deaths of pro-Coptic protesters killed in clashes in the Egyptian capital last month. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and the Copts have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. Protests also stretched to the United States on Saturday, where demonstrators gathered in the nation's capital in opposition to military rule in Egypt. Protester Amin Mahmoud, a member of a group called the ""Egyptian Organization for Change USA,"" said Egypt's military ""has been taking civilians before military courts, and we are against that. ""They are torturing a lot of young revolutionaries, accusing them of being traitors, and that is not true,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The Wegmans supermarket chain is recalling 5,000 pounds of Turkish pine nuts because of possible salmonella contamination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. At least 43 cases of salmonellosis in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia are linked to the pine nuts, the FDA said Friday, citing the Centers for Disease Control. The agency warned consumers not to eat the nuts, offered for sale in unlabeled plastic bulk containers at Wegmans stories, or any food items, such as pesto or salads, that have been made using them. The pine nuts were ingredients in several prepared foods sold at Wegmans, including Caprese salad and asparagus with pine nuts, the agency said. The pine nuts may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis, which may cause illness. They were sold in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland, the FDA said. The salmonella bacteria can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, the FDA said. While most people recover without treatment, infection may lead to hospitalization and can be fatal. The bacteria is most dangerous to older adults, infants and those with compromised immune systems, the FDA said. Consumers are urged to check their homes for the nuts purchased at Wegmans stores between July 1 and October 18, and either throw them away or return them to Wegmans for a refund, the FDA said. Wegmans said the pine nuts were imported from Turkey and distributed by Sunrise Commodities.","The pine nuts may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis .

"(CNN) -- A former mayor in Rwanda has been convicted of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity over the deaths of 2,000 Tutsis during the country's 1994 genocide, the U.N.-backed International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said Thursday. Former Kivumu mayor Gregoire Ndahimana served as a leading facilitator and commander in the slaughter of Tutsis in Kivumu, where an estimated 4,000 Tutsis were murdered, according to the ICTR's Summary of Judgment. According to the judgment, Ndahimana was present during a massacre at the Nyange Catholic church where 2,000 Tutsis died over 10 days from 6 April 1994 to 16 April 1994, in one of the bloodiest sites of the genocide. His presence ""had an encouraging effect on the principal perpetrators,"" particularly because he was an authority figure, the tribunal found, ruling that he ""aided and abetted genocide."" Ndahimana was also found guilty of ""extermination as a crime against humanity by aiding and abetting as well as by virtue of his command responsibility over communal police in Kivumu,"" the judgment said. Ndahimana was sentenced by a majority of the Trial Chamber's three-judge panel to a single sentence of 15 years imprisonment, the ICTR said, with credit for two years already served. ""The Chamber has considered the gravity of each of the crimes for which Ndahimana has been convicted,"" the judgment said. Gruesome reports by survivors and other witnesses accused Ndahimana of joining local police and a priest in ordering assailants to bulldoze Nyange church, killing 2,000 Tutsi refugees who had sought sanctuary there. A majority of the judges ruled that Ndahimana was present during the demolition of the church, but did not find it proven that he instigated or supervised the attacks. A trained agronomist, Ndahimana served as ""bourgmestre"" of Kivumu, a commune in the prefecture of Kibuye near Lake Kivu. According to a United Nations study, at least 59,050 people, or 12.4% of the Kibuye population, were killed during the genocide, accounting for more than three-quarters of the prefecture's Tutsi population. The Rwandan genocide was triggered by the April 6, 1994, shooting down of a plane carrying the nation's Hutu president. Ethnic violence erupted and Tutsis were killed systematically by Hutus over the course of three months. The United Nations estimates that some 200,000 people participated in the perpetration of the Rwandan genocide. In all, some 800,000 men, women, and children -- mostly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus -- died.","Gregoire Ndahimana was mayor of Kivumu at the time of the 1994 genocide .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Joan Hornig's jewelry comes from the heart. And 100 percent of the profits go to a charity of your choice. When she was in college, Joan Hornig set a big goal: to earn enough money by age 50 to allow her to give back to the world. In 2003 she met that goal, two years ahead of schedule. Because Hornig, 54, came from a modest background, she learned to design her own jewelry, modeling her pieces after the bold, fanciful antiques she admired in luxury boutiques and museums. Six years ago, when a friend casually said, ""I love your necklace,"" Hornig replied, ""Thanks, I made it."" That prompted the friend to call another friend -- who just happened to be a merchandise manager at Bergdorf Goodman -- and say: ""I'm looking at something that should be in your store."" Hornig went back to her New York City apartment, gathered up all the necklaces, bracelets, and earrings she'd made (stored in Tupperware containers in her china cabinet -- ""I didn't even know there was such a thing as a jewelry roll""), and took them into the Fifth Avenue store. ""The Bergdorf people said, 'We like these things, but are you a business?' I said, 'I believe I can be a business.'"" They offered her a trial run, and her first ""collection"" sold out in five days. The secret to her success? ""I think jewelry should do for women what a beauty parlor does,"" Hornig says. ""Enhance them."" Oprah.com: How to get gorgeous this season . But Hornig, who worked in the lucrative field of private equity investing, didn't start designing jewelry to make a profit, so she devised a novel business model: Each piece she sells comes with a card explaining that she will give 100 percent of her profits to the charity of the buyer's choice. ""To my children, Paul Newman wasn't an actor -- he was a philanthropist who made salad dressing,"" she says. ""But he chose the charities that would profit from Newman's Own. I wanted to go one step further and let people choose their own cause."" Through sales of her jewelry, the Joan B. Hornig Foundation has donated close to $750,000 to more than 600 causes, including hospitals, dance companies, schools, and the environment. ""People ask, 'Why wouldn't you want to keep the money?'"" she says. ""They think success is measured by what you put in your pocket. I get to create beautiful things that make a difference for people. There isn't anyone who's been made richer by this experience than me."" Oprah.com: Where to shop for a change . The silver bullet . Liberian refugee Lovetta Conto transforms used munitions into objects of beauty. Even as a small child, Lovetta Conto knew she wanted to be a fashion designer. But when she told people, they'd laugh. ""They said, 'You live in a refugee camp, and you think that's going to happen?'"" she says. ""But I always pictured myself in a higher place, growing up like a beautiful flower out of a mud pit."" Lovetta, now 17, spent a decade in the Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana, home to 47,000 people, mostly Liberians fleeing their country's civil war and its aftermath. ""I often went hungry, and there was no clean drinking water,"" she says. ""Girls were selling themselves to survive, and there was a lot of rape."" But three years ago, Lovetta's talents had a chance to bloom: She was granted a Strongheart Fellowship, under a Liberian program designed to help gifted young people who have been orphaned or uprooted by war create businesses to benefit their communities. Today she designs Akawelle (the name is a combination of aka, for ""also known as,"" and wel'le, the word for ""love"" in Kpelle, Lovetta's tribal language), a line of delicate jewelry made from the spent bullets of her country's war. Half of all profits from the sale of the jewelry goes to the Strongheart House, a home in Robertsport, Liberia, for displaced children and other Strongheart fellows. Lovetta herself was displaced when she was only 8 months old: After rebels attacked, she and her father, Larry, fled their town in central Liberia (her mother was out at the time, and Larry assumed she had been killed). ""We walked for one week,"" he says. ""We crossed rebel territory, slept in the bush. If I saw a breastfeeding mother, I would appeal to her to please give Lovetta milk."" After years of moving to escape the fighting, they settled at Buduburam. Lovetta lived with other families while her father looked for work. Cori Stern, founder of the Strongheart Fellowship, met Lovetta when she was just 12 and remembers how self-assured she was, even then. When officials said there was no need to build a school for disabled students because there were none in the camp, ""Lovetta said, 'No -- my best friend is blind, and they won't let him go to school because he can't see,'"" Stern recalls. ""The men did not like having a little girl go against what they were saying."" Stern brought Lovetta to the United States in 2006 to attend school. In Buduburam, Lovetta's schooling had been sporadic, and she did not learn to read until 2007 (despite the late start, she finished the entire ""Twilight"" series in six weeks). Still, the visit to the United States was bittersweet. Lovetta was shocked to see homeless people in a country of such abundance and thought it unfair that some should have so much while others had so little. She also couldn't understand why Americans did not do more to help her country's refugees: ""It made me angry that this whole world was here when I was in my darkest moment, and no one came to help."" Oprah.com: Meet the one-man international aid organization . By turning bullets into things of beauty, Lovetta is doing her part to help. Since 2007 Akawelle has sold more than 400 necklaces and raised almost $20,000. Lovetta has also spoken at schools across the United States, and her necklaces have attracted fans like Halle Berry and Angelina Jolie. ""I wear one, and my kids have her necklaces, too,"" says Jolie. ""It was an opportunity to teach them about remarkable people like Lovetta, and pass on her message of love and tolerance."" Lovetta also wants her message to be one of hope: ""I believe that whatever you go through, there is always new life, a new beginning. So even a bullet that has killed someone can be the same one to help a new generation."" Oprah.com: One man's record-breaking blood donations .

"(CNN)  -- Rescuers have found the body of a man who was one of six people aboard a small airplane that crashed Sunday evening near the northern shore of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Cessna 206 single-engine aircraft went down about a half mile off the coast of Quebradillas. The man's body was found Monday less than 150 feet from shore, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. The Coast Guard launched two more search missions Tuesday morning for four men and one woman still missing. Authorities have not released their identities, nor the name of the man found Monday. ""The Coast Guard will continue to search as long as there is the possibility of finding any survivors,"" Castrodad said. Eighteen divers will conduct searches Tuesday in the area where the body was found, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Volunteer divers from Arecibo found the body Monday, said Jose Daniel Echeverria, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, which also is involved in the search. As of Tuesday, the Coast Guard will have conducted 12 search operations, eight done by four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Air Station Borinquen and four by the Cutter Matinicus, Castrodad said. The search is complicated, he said, by the roughness of the area. ""It's like a cliff,"" he said. ""The surf is very rough. It's hard to get in that area."" Smaller boats from the emergency management agency and the Puerto Rico Police Joint Forces for Rapid Action are being used because they can reach areas that the Coast Guard cutter cannot, Castrodad said. The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said. The four males and one female onboard were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said. The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said. A 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas. Searchers found a debris field in the area late Sunday. In the Dominican Republic, meanwhile, a man who said he spent the weekend with the missing passengers said he urged them not to leave Sunday night because of severe weather. Retired businessman Manuel ""Manolin"" Lecaroz, 64, told El Nuevo Dia newspaper that the group left because one of them had business to conduct Monday morning. He did not have a premonition, Lecaroz said. ""It's just that you can't fly when the weather is bad."" The winds and heavy rains that were still being felt in Puerto Rico on Monday had ruined the group's chances to spend the weekend fishing and playing golf in the Dominican Republic, which is 79 miles (127 kilometers) away. ""It rained every day,"" Lecaroz told the Puerto Rican newspaper. ""The wind was blowing very hard, so much that we couldn't go out in the boat any day."" As they left Sunday night, group members hugged Lecaroz and talked about returning later this month to fish and golf, he said.","Coast Guard launches search missions for five still missing after plane went down .

"(CNN) -- Walt Hazzard, the dazzling point guard who led UCLA to its first NCAA basketball title and starred in high school, the NBA and the Olympics, died after a long illness, according to the UCLA Bruins' website. The 69-year-old Hazzard died Friday afternoon at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center surrounded by family and friends, according to a statement from his family. He had been recuperating from complications following heart surgery. ""This is a sad day for the UCLA basketball family,"" UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said in a statement. ""Walt was the catalyst for coach John Wooden's first championship team and played the game with a style that excited Bruin basketball fans everywhere. He contributed to his alma mater in numerous ways, including as a student-athlete, coach and honored alum, and he will be greatly missed by all of us who knew him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Jaleesa, and their four sons."" Hazzard starred at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, where he led the school to an 89-3 record. He transferred to UCLA after the 1960-61 season at Santa Monica College and played for Wooden, a fabled coach who mentored excellent teams through the years. the sophomore Hazzard led the team to the Final Four in 1961-62 but it lost to Cincinnati. Two years later, as a senior, he led the Bruins to the NCAA championship in 1964, the first of many championships for what had become a college basketball dynasty. He earned All-America honors at UCLA as a junior and senior and piled up impressive scoring statistics there. He was chosen for the U.S. Olympic team in 1964 and helped the United States win a gold medal at the games in Tokyo. He later joined the NBA, playing with the Los Angeles Lakers and others teams -- Seattle, Atlanta, Buffalo and Golden State -- for a total of 10 seasons. He went into coaching and eventually became head coach for the Bruins for four years during the 1980s. Under Hazzard, the team won a National Invitation Tournament, a PAC-10 title and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament. After coaching, he scouted and consulted for the Lakers. He also got involved with the Young Black Scholars group and started a non-profit for middle school students, the Los Angeles Sports Academy. The 100 Black Men of Los Angeles Inc. in October gave Hazzard a Lifetime Achievement Award. ""He was a great player and an outstanding coach at UCLA.

"(CNN) -- A Portuguese appeals court has ruled against extraditing fugitive American hijacking suspect George Wright to the United States, his attorney said Thursday. ""I am very, very happy,"" said Manuel Luis Ferreira, attorney for Wright, 68, who was found in Portugal in September after more than 40 years in hiding. Wright said he was grateful to the Portuguese justice system. ""They made the right decision and this is correct,"" he told CNN affiliate RTP Portugal. Wright's house arrest was also lifted, and he is free to move around with no restrictions, Ferreira said. A three-judge appeals court in Lisbon agreed with all Wright's arguments to reject the U.S. bid for extradition, including the fact he is now a Portuguese citizen and is in declining health. They also agreed the statute of limitations on the case has expired, according to Portuguese state-run news agency LUSA. The United States can appeal to Portugal's Supreme Court, Ferreira said. He said he could not release the court's ruling as it is secret. The U.S. State Department said it was ""extremely disappointed"" in the ruling. ""George Wright is a convicted murderer guilty of an extremely serious crime which falls squarely within the terms of our bilateral extradition treaty with Portugal,"" the department said in a statement. ""He is a fugitive from justice. We expect Portugal to abide by its treaty obligations in this case. In conjunction with the Department of Justice, we will review the court's decision and consult with Portuguese authorities to determine a path forward that results in Mr. Wright's return to the United States."" Wright escaped from prison in 1970 while serving a 15- to 30-year sentence for murder after he and another man shot and killed a World War II veteran in a 1962 gas station robbery in Farmingdale, New Jersey. On July 31, 1972, Wright and four other members of the Black Liberation Army went to the Detroit airport and boarded Delta Flight 841 for Miami. Wright was dressed as a priest and carrying a hollowed-out Bible. The group then allegedly hijacked the plane. Once it landed in Miami, they allegedly demanded that FBI agents dressed only in bathing suits deliver $1 million in ransom to the plane -- a way of making sure they were not armed. The FBI followed instructions, and the scantily clad agents delivered the money. After allowing the 88 passengers off, the hijackers kept the flight crew on board and ordered the plane to fly to Boston. When it arrived, an extra navigator -- dressed in swim trunks and a shirt -- was brought on board, the DC-8 was refueled, and it flew to Algiers, Algeria. The Algerian government seized the ransom money and returned it to the United States, but Wright and his associates vanished. Some were arrested in Paris in 1976. It's not clear how he wound up in Portugal. U.S. authorities were able to locate Wright near Lisbon by tracking his travel patterns, ending a manhunt spanning three continents. When seeking Wright, authorities matched a fingerprint in a Portuguese national identification database with one that they had on file for Wright from his time in prison, according to two U.S. law enforcement officials. Then they set up a delicate surveillance operation to make sure they had the man who had eluded them for so long, the officials added. Ferreira previously said his client was suffering from heart and blood pressure problems. ""He thinks that if he goes to the U.S. he will die,"" he told CNN earlier. ""He was a member of the Black Panthers group, and he fears that he will be made to serve as an example for everyone if he goes, and that he will die in prison."" He said Wright was a married father of two adult sons who goes by the name Jose Luis Jorge dos Santos in Portugal.","NEW: U.S. expresses disappointment with the decision .

"(CNN)  -- Eugene Terreblanche, one of South Africa's most notorious white supremacists, was killed Saturday in an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm. Terreblanche was the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB) which attempted to resist South Africa's transformation from Apartheid to democracy in the 1990s. Police said the 69-year-old was bludgeoned and stabbed to death with clubs and a machete in an attack at his farm near the town of Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West Province . Two of his farm workers ages 21 and 16 turned themselves in to authorities in connection with the killing and will appear in court on Tuesday, they said. The AWB said Terreblanche had been attacked in his bed while he took an afternoon nap and urged its members and supporters to be calm as they mourn their leader. South African President Jacob Zuma also appealed for calm after news of the killing broke, according to the country's national news agency, SAPA. Terreblanche's death comes amid a time of racial polarization in the country. A South African court last month banned the playing of a political song called ""Kill the Boer,"" most recently sung by radical youth leader Julius Malema. The apartheid-era song's lyrics translate to ""kill the farmer."" South African civil rights group AfriForum condemned the killing and also called for calm in a statement on its Web site. ""These events are a call to all South Africans to come to their senses and to be aware of the extremely polarized and violent circumstances presently prevalent in the country,"" the statement said. The group also said that ""all communities -- white, as well as black -- should refrain from reckless statements and from romanticizing violence."" Terreblanche's AWB used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections. Terreblanche was convicted of the 1996 attempted murder of Paul Motshabi, a black man who worked as a security guard on Terreblanche's farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence. He was also convicted of setting his dog on a black man in an earlier incident. CNN's Robyn Curnow contributed to this report.","Far-right leader Terreblanche was bludgeoned and stabbed to death .

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities don't expect delays on subways, buses and tunnels Friday, a day after Occupy Wall Street demonstrators converged on New York City to mark a nationwide ""mass day of action."" No incidents and additional arrests were reported overnight, authorities said. Scores were arrested Thursday and several police officers were reported injured as protesters fanned out across the city moved toward Foley Square in Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. Many had crossed the bridge -- the same place where more than 700 had been arrested last month -- chanting, ""This is what democracy looks like -- This is what America looks like,"" according to the New York movement's official Twitter feed. This time, they marched in the pedestrian walkway and did not block the roadway. Occupy protesters also took to the streets in all corners of the nation -- from Miami to Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon and Boston -- marking two months since the activist effort aimed at the nation's wealthiest 1% began in Manhattan. ""I think the numbers have increased dramatically,"" New York protester Jo Robin said Thursday. ""Particularly after the raid, our message is being broadcast all over the world."" Police said a total of 245 people had been arrested around the city Thursday. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at least seven police officers were hurt Thursday during exchanges with protesters. Five of those officers were injured when a unidentified liquid was thrown on their faces, Kelly said, adding that they experienced a burning sensation and required hospitalization. It is not clear how many demonstrators have been injured during the clashes. Authorities constructed barricades at Zuccotti Park in front of the New York Stock Exchange and along Fifth Avenue in an apparent attempt to keep demonstrators off the roads and on pedestrian walkways. Residents and workers near the New York Stock Exchange were required to flash identification cards as police cordoned off the area amid concerns that demonstrators would try to disrupt trading. Earlier Thursday, protesters lifted metal barricades around Zuccotti Park, a former home-base for the movement, defying authorities and blocking traffic. Bloomberg said the day's protests had ""caused minimal disruptions to our city,"" but added that some demonstrators had ""deliberately"" pursued violence. The Occupy movement showed no signs of abating elsewhere in the United States. In cities such as St. Louis and Milwaukee, thousands responded to the ""day of action"" plea. In Los Angeles, about 50 people were arrested Thursday, authorities said. In Portland, police reported 48 people arrested in three separate incidents. Another 21 were issued citations for blocking a street in Las Vegas, local police said. And in Atlanta, police arrested eight for blocking a roadway. There were also arrests in other places, including Chicago and Houston. CNN's Marina Landis contributed to this report.","No incidents and additional arrests are reported overnight, authorities say .

"(Financial Times) -- The eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou produces more cigarette lighters and spectacles than anywhere on earth, and has long been seen as an economic trend-setter for the entire country. So reports that dozens of factory owners in the city have absconded in recent weeks, leaving workers unpaid and mountains of debt, are seen by some as an ominous sign for the national economy. Slowing global demand for cheap Chinese exports, rising production costs and unsustainable levels of debt have combined to crush some of the country's most savvy entrepreneurs. In one tragic case, the owner of a Wenzhou shoe factory who owed more than Rmb400m ($63m) committed suicide three weeks ago. More than 90 other bosses have run away, according to state media. Trade fluctuations in China, the world's leading exporter, are often seen as indicators of the health of the global economy -- and for some bearish investors, Wenzhou's problems are a sign that a hard landing is imminent for the nation. This is a dire prospect for the global economy at a time when most of the developed world is facing the likelihood of renewed recession. In fact, the city's troubles are un-likely to trigger a drastic nationwide crash any time soon; most analysts believe China is on track for just a gradual slowdown in coming months. But events in that city do represent a crucial turning point for the nation. ""What's happening in Wenzhou is a reflection of the current Chinese model coming to an end,"" says Huang Yiping of Barclays Capital about the country's export-led, investment-driven growth paradigm. ""China's economic success over the last 30 years has been built on cheap capital, cheap labour, cheap energy and cheap land but this has now produced huge imbalances and inefficiencies that are causing more and more problems."" The change will affect not just inhabitants of the world's most populous nation, where growth averaging 10 per cent a year for the past three decades has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. It also heralds a structural change that will affect western businesses and consumers long used to ever cheaper Chinese goods. In addition, the shift will hit exporters in both developed and emerging economies that are increasingly reliant on China's appetite for raw materials to feed its investment and construction boom, which shows signs of running out of steam. China's economic miracle began in 1978, when the Communist party launched market-oriented reforms granting farmers limited property rights and permission to sell anything they produced in excess of state quotas. This led to soaring agricultural productivity and rural incomes. It was followed by reforms encouraging mass migration, industrialisation and investment in a manufacturing sector that became known as the workshop for the world. In 1990, income per capita was 30 per cent lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Today, at more than $4,000, it is three times greater, according to World Bank data. The unbeatable ""China price"" that attracted investors and buyers from all over the world was predicated on an endless supply of cheap, pliant labour; virtually free land; cheap and easy credit from state-owned banks; and heavily suppressed costs for inputs such as power and water. But having drastically raised the living standards of almost a fifth of humanity, the formula is increasingly seen as defunct, and a contributor to serious problems including environmental degradation and rapidly rising social inequality. ""The drivers of China's meteoric rise are on the wane,"" says Robert Zoellick, World Bank president. ""Resources have largely shifted from agriculture to industry; as the labour force shrinks and the population ages, there are fewer workers to support retirees; and productivity increases are on the decline."" With its world-class infrastructure and existing domestic and international supply chains, China will remain a global manufacturing base for some time to come. But minimum wages are rising more than 20 per cent a year in many areas, and land is increasingly scarce and expensive. In addition, the government is reducing the supply of cheap credit and has moved to liberalise prices for energy and other utilities. Meanwhile, the flood of investment in new factories, roads, airports and housing estates that has been the main driver of growth looks increasingly unsustainable. Back in Wenzhou, Xu Chuan, general manager of Xinhua Soft Packing, says times are tough. The business, which makes products from plastic bottles to zips, has been squeezed by rising costs and a lack of workers willing to take wages considered generous just a couple of years ago. ""We are making much less money than before and in-put price rises are so serious it is hard to find many companies that are making money these days,"" Mr Xu says. His predicament is partly a result of demographics. Many experts believe China's working-age population has already peaked and will decline in coming years, a trend exacerbated by the three-decade-old one-child policy. It is also partly the price of success for the country's meteoric economic rise, which is lifting the prices of almost everything and shrinking the pool of impoverished workers willing to toil in factories or on construction sites for a pittance. The country's leadership is well aware of the distortions that have built up in the economy; and freely acknowledges time is running out for a model that has served it so well. ""China suffers a serious lack of balance, co-ordination and sustainability in its development,"" President Hu Jintao said in a recent speech. ""We must accelerate strategic adjustment of the economic structure, scientific and technological progress and innovation, and the building of a resource-conserving and environmentally friendly society."" Beijing's latest five-year plan, which runs from 2011 until 2015, is packed full of vows to increase domestic consumption and wean the economy off its reliance on exports and particularly investment. But leaders have been talking for more than a decade about achieving these goals, and in fact the reverse has occurred. Consumption fell from about 45 per cent of gross domestic product in the late 1990s to an unusually low 33 per cent last year. Investment has hit a global high of 50 per cent of GDP. ""When reforms began 30 years ago, the investment rate was around 25 per cent of GDP and the economy grew at around 10 per cent a year, but now we are investing half of GDP for the same rate of growth; that tells you something about capital efficiency,"" says Mr Huang of Barclays Capital. An involuntary shift from the old model appeared possible when the global financial crisis erupted in the west in 2008, triggering a collapse in global demand for Chinese exports, which fell by more than a third in the year to March 2009. Thousands of factories closed and more than 23m migrant workers poured out of cities such as Wenzhou. In response, Beijing launched an economic stimulus package described by some economists as the biggest monetary and fiscal easing in history as it sought to cushion the blow to exporters. State-controlled banks were ordered to flood the economy with cash and local officials told to ramp up investment to jump-start growth. The result was a surge in credit-fuelled investment, particularly in residential property. In cities across the country, the results can be seen in forests of half-built apartment blocks, stadiums and convention centres. To the rest of the world, the stimulus appeared an unqualified success, pushing headline GDP growth rates back up into double digits and stoking Chinese demand for imports, especially of natural resources. But the reliance on debt and investment accentuated all the distortions Beijing had already identified in its growth model -- and added the prospect of a serious property bubble. Most analysts agree China's economy, now the second largest, is today less healthy and more imbalanced than before the crisis, and even more reliant on investment, particularly in property and infrastructure. ""It's as if the economy ballooned in weight by eating too much in the way of resources and becoming obese,"" says Derek Scissors of the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think-tank. While the model may be coming to an end, most economists believe China remains on track for a soft landing in coming months as growth moderates. GDP figures for the third quarter, due out on Tuesday, are likely to show annual growth that remains above 9 per cent. Even if a severe slump were to hit, Beijing would still have the option of loosening monetary policy to revive the economy in the short term, and re-versing steps to cool the red-hot property market and rein in credit made available by the stimulus package. But there is unlikely to be a return to the boom years of the previous decade, when inflation remained dormant as GDP rose. Instead, growth will probably be 8 per cent or less, accompanied by persistent price rises -- HSBC predicts average consumer inflation of 5 per cent from 2011 to 2015, compared with 2 per cent from 2001 to 2010. And now that China is the global production capital for so many of the world's manufactured goods, enduring Chinese inflation will mean higher prices for consumers the world over. Beijing has identified the action it needs to take -- but many analysts believe it must do far more to hasten economic rebalancing towards consumption than its current efforts to provide better social services, build subsidised apartment blocks and encourage minimum wage increases. ""China has limited time to effect a radical political and economic shift,"" according to George Magnus of UBS Investment Bank. ""If this shift doesn't start in earnest soon, the Chinese economy will succumb to a credit and investment bust from which significantly slower growth would follow, and this will be especially sensitive in a China where incidents of social unrest are increasing significantly in number, intensity and breadth."" © The Financial Times Limited 2011 .","Manufacturing hurt by slowing demand for cheap Chinese goods, rising costs and debt .

"New York (CNN) -- Just as it has happened for more than a century as the old year ticks toward history, a large crowd will gather Friday night in New York's Times Square to mark the old and the new with the descent of an iconic ball. The dazzling crystal ball will begin its 70-foot descent precisely at 11:59 p.m. ET to the chants of New Year's Eve revelers counting down the final seconds of 2010, according to the event's official website. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sgt. Salvatore A. Giunta will push a button to start the ball toward 2011. Weighing in at 11,875 pounds with a diameter of 12 feet, the sparkling sphere is covered with 2,668 triangular crystals and is powered by 32,256 LED lights. By mixing red, blue, green and white light elements, the ball's lighting system is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million hues and colors, and billions of patterns, the event's website says. Each giant New Year's numeral making up ""2-0-1-1"" will stand 7 feet high and the numerals will use a total 453 9-watt LED bulbs. As in the past three years, the numerals were designed to be more energy efficient, as Duracell set up a lab in which visitors rode stationary bikes to provide the stored battery power that will light the numbers on the ball Friday night. More than one ton of confetti will be released at midnight, with personal individual wishes written in more than 25 languages, a tradition from the past three years. Times Square has served as one of the most popular sites of New Year's festivities since 1904, though the New Year's Eve ball made its inaugural drop down the flagpole at One Times Square in 1907. That first ball, built with iron and wood, featured one hundred light bulbs and was designed by Jacob Starr, a young immigrant metalworker. The New Year's Eve ball has beamed and dropped every year since with the exceptions of 1942 and 1943, when the United States was embroiled in World War II and New York City observed a citywide ""dim-out"" to cut energy costs. According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, this New Year's Eve celebration, like years in the past, is a product of a lot of hard work and planning by many people. ""We don't ever take it for granted,"" Kelly said. ""The situation changes somewhat, we have sort of a core plan but we always add to it or change it -- we don't want to get stuck in a rut where we simply take a plan off the shelf."" iReport: Times Square readies for the crowds . As in previous years, security will be tight. Times Square will be closed to traffic at approximately 3 p.m. on Friday. Backpacks and alcohol are prohibited at the event and party-goers can expect a beefed-up police presence, according to the statement from the New York Police Department. ""It is a big complex operation and you know you always breathe a sigh of relief when it's over,"" Kelly said.","Since 1907, a ball-drop in Times Square has marked the changing of the year .
This year, the ball will have lights that can mix to produce millions of colors .

"(CNN) -- The world of fashion responded to Japan's March earthquake, like many other industries, with the desire to help its victims. Japanese clothing companies and fashion magazines mobilized charity campaigns and donated clothes to people in the stricken area. Lady Gaga even designed a special bracelet that raised over $250,000 for the relief effort. Personal shopping habits and even styles in Japan were also affected by the tragedy, but not necessarily in a negative way. ""It is not our impression that people refrained from buying or wearing colorful clothing (after the earthquake in March),"" said Mitsuko Watanabe, editor of Vogue Japan. ""On the contrary, some deliberately chose bright colors to retain a positive attitude and give themselves and others a lift,"" she added. In cities far from where the tsunami hit, the immediate period after saw fashion stores close their doors to shoppers, adverts pulled from public places and sales of luxury brands drop. However, by May sales for many luxury goods had risen above pre-disaster levels, according to Watanabe, especially for items that transcended fashion, namely engagement and wedding rings. ""In times of crisis, people gain a fresh appreciation of what is really important in their lives. ""These trends are a good indication of how people are seeking peace of mind, stability, and steadiness under the unsettling and uncertain circumstances,"" she said. For those who didn't get the urge to marry, simple retail therapy was another response to the disaster. According to a survey by Asian trend and innovation agency Five by Fifty, 58% of consumers in the big city areas of Osaka and Tokyo continued shopping for clothes and fashion as normal after the earthquake. Of the 40% of people surveyed who admitted to reining in their clothes shopping, the main reason was personal finance rather than self-restraint or a sense of solidarity with the victims in the Tohoku region. ""People did pull back somewhat immediately after (the disaster), but shopping didn't stop and they were buying items that were less obvious, like fragrances,"" said Nicole Fall, director of trends for Five by Fifty. ""The perfume market for Japan is traditionally small compared to Europe, but it spiked after the earthquake. It was something that could be enjoyed without being conspicuous or risk of being seen to come out of store carrying lots of shopping bags."" Japan's annual summer program of ""setsuden"" (energy-saving) was given extra significance this year with the nuclear crisis at Fukushima and reduced power supply. It also meant some fashion brands recast their marketing strategies. Fast fashion label Uniqlo brought out its ""Heattech"" line of insulating clothing at the end of July to tap into people's desire to cut back on heating bills and use less energy. Now, six months since the earthquake, big-city consumer habits are back to normal and representative of a larger trend, suggests Fall. ""People haven't deliberately made a stand (through their shopping habits). If anything the earthquake has just amplified the feelings before it, which were generally representative of post-consumerism. Young people often feel they can't afford things and people look for more from a purchase, as well as being savvy enough to look online."" Watanabe echoes the sentiment that Japanese consumers are more selective in their fashion purchases. ""If there was any change of this nature, it seems to lie ... in a stronger inclination to select articles they will continue to be fond of long into the future,"" she said. Watanabe also hopes that this year's ""Fashion's Night Out"" -- an evening of shopping and events on November 5 -- will give Japan's fashion industry a boost and reinforce the way the fashion can give back to the community. Vogue's editor in chief Anna Wintour and other regional editors of Vogue will attend as a show of solidarity. ""Fashion should make a more important contribution for social and economic good in what is a critical situation,"" said Watanabe.","Sales of wedding rings went up in Japan after the tsunami in March .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's prime minister appealed for calm and asked protesters to return to their homes Tuesday following four days of violence in Cairo and a day after the nation's Cabinet offered to resign. ""We have met the demands of the people and submitted our resignations,"" Prime Minister Essam Sharaf said, according to Egypt's Nile TV. ""Now please put the interests of the country first."" Fresh violence broke out Tuesday near the city's Tahrir Square. For several hours, protesters hurled stones at police and chanted, calling for the downfall of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces. The military-led government began leading the country after protesters ousted President Hosni Mubarak in February. Demonstrators apparently tried to defend Tahrir Square as they faced off with police on a connecting street. The square was once a hub for the movement that led to Mubarak's ouster and is now a center for the protests against Egypt's military rulers. Egyptian police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, forcing protesters to retreat briefly before they returned with renewed intensity. Violence also spread to other parts of Egypt. Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, will address the nation Tuesday, according to Egyptian state broadcaster Al Masriya. The latest report contradicted an earlier one saying he would speak ""shortly."" After Mubarak's fall, military leaders took control with the promise that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. Military leaders still say they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected. However, while parliamentary elections are set to take place Monday, a complex electoral process follows, and the presidential vote could be a year away. Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They say they worry the military would become a state within a state. On the streets of Cairo, some protesters have gone further, shouting that they believe Mubarak is running the military council and, in fact, the entire country from prison. He and his sons Gamal and Alaa face charges of corruption and of killing protesters. Three Americans were arrested Monday outside the Interior Ministry in Cairo. Authorities accuse them of throwing Molotov cocktails, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor. The young men are students at American University in Cairo, according to university spokeswoman Morgan Roth. She identified them as Gregory Porter, 19, of Glenside, Pennsylvania; Luke Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana; and Derrik Sweeney, 19, from Jefferson City, Missouri. Porter attends Drexel University in Pennsylvania, Gates goes to Indiana University and Sweeney studies at Georgetown University, she said. At least two of them were on a semesterlong study abroad program in Cairo. David Lynfield, deputy press officer in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said the ""claims are being currently investigated."" The university is working with the embassy, Roth said. Tuesday's violence marks the fourth day of clashes between security forces and protesters. Twenty-nine protesters have died in the clashes since Saturday, said Hisham Sheeha, spokesman for Egypt's Health Ministry. About 1,785 people have been injured, he said. Earlier, Dr. Adil al-Adawi, another ministry spokesman, said about 200 of those injuries came Monday. Egypt's Interior Ministry said 102 officers and conscripts have been injured, with wounds ranging from gunshots to burns from Molotov cocktails. One officer was shot in the head. Some political factions have vowed to hold a sit-in Tuesday at Tahrir Square, demanding the immediate resignation of the Supreme Council. They also demand the immediate punishment of those who have killed protesters in the past few days. The Alliance of the Revolutionaries of Egypt is calling the event a ""million man sit-in."" The Muslim Brotherhood, one of the largest organizations in the nation, has said that its members will not join that protest. ""We didn't start this mess,"" said engineering student Mahmour Radwan, who traveled to Cairo from Alexandria on Tuesday with two friends to join the protests. He said authorities started it, when they killed people ""and put them in the street."" Radwan and many other protesters were equipped with surgical masks and other items in an attempt to protect themselves from the clouds of tear gas. Young women stood nearby, holding bottles of water and poised to treat those overcome by the tear gas. Violence also spread to Alexandria ahead of a planned ""million man"" protest there. One person was killed and 60 others injured in that city, said al-Adawi, a Health Ministry spokesman. Thousands of people clashed with police Monday night near the city's police headquarters. Rocks were thrown and tear gas used, said activist Huda Al-Sadani. Some people were arrested, Al-Sadani said, and clashes continued throughout the night. Two of the deaths came in the city of Ismalia, said Sheeha, a Health Ministry spokesman. Violence also was reported in the city of Suez. Amid the unrest, Egypt's Cabinet offered to resign Monday night. Justice Minister Mohamed Abdelaziz al-Juindy explained that this move to quit the government was driven by opposition to the security forces' crackdown on demonstrators. ""I resigned because of the events in Tahrir (Square), because of the political responsibility,"" al-Juindy said. The Supreme Council has not said whether the resignations were accepted. As the potential political shuffling played out, animosity and violence continued to simmer in the streets. Saeed, the spokesman for the general prosecutor's office, said 127 demonstrators who had been arrested in Cairo since Saturday have been released. Another five have been ""detained temporarily for further investigation."" The military council has said on its Facebook page it is ""extremely sorry for what the events have led to."" And spokesman Maj. Mohamed Askar said late Monday that the Supreme Council has ordered a fact-finding mission to assess what has happened. Moreover, the Supreme Council also is calling upon ""all political forces to hold dialogue as soon as possible in order to address the escalation"" of unrest, Askar said. However, Amnesty International, in a report issued this month, said the Supreme Council, ""in the name of ensuring security and stability ... (has) committed numerous human rights violations, ignoring the very demands for social justice and fundamental freedoms that triggered the uprising."" ""... Since assuming power in February, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has repeatedly pledged to break the cycle of repression entrenched over the past 30 years. In reality, however, it has resorted to familiar patterns of abuse."" A recent endorsement in full of Egypt's emergency law and its expansion, after it was restricted last year under Mubarak, is considered the largest example of human rights violation, the organization said. However, it alleged demonstrations have been violently dispersed and protesters have been arrested, detained and tortured ""before being tried unfairly before military courts and convicted."" In addition, Amnesty International alleged, the Supreme Council has placed arbitrary restrictions on the media. Some television stations have been raided and ordered closed, while satellite television stations have been frozen. The council has also failed to address discrimination of women, according to the group. ""If the hopes of the uprising are to be realized, urgent action is needed now to ensure that one repressive rule is not simply replaced with another,"" the report said. CNN's Ivan Watson and Michael Pearson and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Three arrested American students identified .

"(CNN) -- Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber blocked the execution of a death row inmate on Tuesday and said no more executions will take place in the state as long as he is governor. He issued a temporary reprieve in the case of Gary Haugen, who was reportedly scheduled to be put to death next month. ""It is time for Oregon to consider a different approach. I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer; and I will not allow further executions while I am governor,"" he said in a statement. Oregon has 37 inmates on death row, some of whom have been there for more than 20 years. Kitzhaber did not commute their sentences, he said, because: ""The policy of this state on capital punishment is not mine alone to decide."" He urged lawmakers to bring potential reforms before the 2013 legislative session. Death penalty's unlikely opponents . The Democratic governor called the state's death penalty system, as it is now, ""expensive and unworkable."" Not counting Oregon, 16 U.S. states do not have the death penalty, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit group. Illinois banned it this year. Oregon voted to reinstate the death penalty in 1984, and since then has put two people to death -- in 1996 and 1997. Both executions were carried out on inmates who had waived their rights to appeal and took place during Kitzhaber's first term. ""They were the most agonizing and difficult decisions I have made as governor, and I have revisited and questioned them over and over again during the past 14 years. I do not believe that those executions made us safer; and certainly they did not make us nobler as a society. And I simply cannot participate once again in something I believe to be morally wrong,"" he said. Haugen, a twice-convicted murder, was scheduled to die on December 6, according to The Oregonian. He had similarly waived his rights to appeal. Results of October 2011 CNN Poll . A 2010 national poll of registered voters conducted by Lake Research Partners showed growing support for alternatives to the death penalty, compared with previous polls. A clear majority of voters (61%) would choose a punishment other than the death penalty for murder, including life with no possibility of parole and with restitution to the victim's family (39%), life with no possibility of parole (13%) or life with the possibility of parole (9%). So far this year, 43 inmates have been executed in the United States, compared with 46 in all of 2010. Nationally, some 3,200 inmates await execution.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- Jay Paterno, Penn State's quarterbacks coach and son of legendary coach Joe Paterno, spoke out after weeks of public and personal challenges for his father. In an interview with ESPN on Friday, Jay Paterno spoke about his father's recent diagnosis of lung cancer and the child rape allegations against an assistant coach that eventually ended Joe Paterno's 46-year head coaching career. The younger Paterno said Friday that while his world has turned ""upside down"" in the past two weeks, ""We've got to make sure we keep focus on the victims of this whole tragedy."" Jay Paterno said he hasn't spoken out publicly because his father's health has been ""the big, main focus the last seven, eight days."" On Friday, his brother Scott said his father has a treatable form of lung cancer. The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit last weekend for a bronchial illness, Scott Paterno said. ""He is currently undergoing treatment, and his doctors are optimistic that he will make a full recovery,"" Scott Paterno said in a statement. ""As everyone can appreciate, this is a deeply personal matter for my parents, and we simply ask that his privacy be respected as he proceeds with treatment."" Penn state's new president, Rod Erickson, issued a statement Saturday, saying, ""This is very unfortunate news and another sad note for our Penn State community. Our thoughts are with him and his family at this difficult time and we certainly pray for his speedy recovery."" Paterno, 84, the all-time winningest football coach in Division I history, was fired last week amid an outcry over the handling of abuse claims involving former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. Jay Paterno told ESPN that many members of the football staff were surprised to learn about the allegations against Sandusky. ""Most of us found out when investigators came and began to ask questions, because most of us knew so little we weren't even called to the grand jury,"" Jay Paterno said. National outrage grew over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex. Paterno said that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations, but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. He said he had done ""what I was supposed to do."" In a later statement, he said ""with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" It was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation. Friday's announcement coincided with news of an NCAA investigation at Penn State. ""This unprecedented situation demands the NCAA evaluate the university's accountability"" and application of NCAA bylaws, NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a letter to the school. CNN contributor Sara Ganim reported from Pennsylvania.","Joe Paterno's son Jay: We must ""keep focus on the victims of this whole tragedy""

"(CNN) -- Three American college students were being held Tuesday, possibly in a Cairo courthouse, accused of lobbing Molotov cocktails during the unrest gripping Tahrir Square, authorities and family members said. The news came as a blow to their families in the United States, especially after seeing a video aired on Egyptian state television showing the three students nervously standing shoulder to shoulder along a wall in front of what appeared to be liquid-filled bottles. ""I can't remember seeing his face look like that,"" said Nicole Sweeney, whose brother Derrik Sweeney is among those detained. ""He looks absolutely terrified."" American University in Cairo identified the three detained students as Sweeney, 19, a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Gregory Porter, 19, from Glenside, Pennsylvania, who attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Luke Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, who goes to Indiana University. They were spending the semester in Cairo as part of a study-abroad program, according to American University. Cairo police have questioned the three, who were detained Monday night, and they will face additional investigation by prosecutors, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor. ""The three boys were throwing Molotov cocktails and had no passports on them when they were picked up,"" Saeed said. Later, he told CNN that the prosecutor was unable to question the students on Tuesday because of ongoing protests. They will be questioned on Wednesday in the presence of legal representatives from the U.S. Embassy, he said. ""They were throwing explosives at security forces -- which is a crime,"" Saeed said. Nicole Sweeney said her family had been told the men were apparently being held in a courthouse. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland did not comment on the men's whereabouts during a briefing with reporters, but said officials believe they know where the three are and that they are safe. ""I don't think we have any information to indicate otherwise,"" she said, adding that she did not believe the men had been formally charged. Social-media posts appear to show Gates and Sweeney in the thick of recent protests in Cairo, with Gates indicating he had been injured in clashes over the weekend. ""Earlier tonight rubber bullets a charge and then a retreat,"" said a message posted Sunday from a Twitter account with Gates' name and a photo resembling one of the men in the police video. The poster added that his knee and elbow were hurt. On Saturday, the writer said that ""we were throwing rocks and one guy accidentally threw his phone."" Another Facebook account shows a man resembling Sweeney during protests in Cairo. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the posts. Gates' father, George William Gates, told CNN that he learned of his son's detention in a call from an American University official. ""It was a hard call to get,"" he said. ""He told us that everything was fine and he was really happy,"" Gates said of an earlier conversation with his son. ""Luke said so many people were friendly to him and that it was easy to make friends there."" Sweeney's mother, Joy Sweeney, said she was worried about her son's safety, but he had assured her he was fine the last time they spoke. ""He has always been somebody who believes in democracy and standing up for what you believe in and I know that he was excited at the opportunity to be in Egypt right now. I also know that he is an extreme pacifist,"" she told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""He would never do anything to inflict violence on somebody else."" News of their detention came on the fourth consecutive day of clashes between protesters and police in and around Tahrir Square, which also was the focal point of a popular uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak as president in February. Demonstrators are calling for the removal of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, the ruling body that took power after Mubarak's ouster. Thirty people have died in the clashes since Saturday, according to Egypt's Health Ministry. About 1,950 have been injured. Georgetown and Drexel officials both released statements saying they are working with American University and U.S. authorities to obtain their students' release. David Lynfield, deputy press officer for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said the Egyptian authorities' ""claims are being currently investigated."" Sweeney interned for U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Missouri, between February and May, press secretary Pat Sloca said. Luetkemeyer has been in touch with the U.S. State Department about Sweeney's detention, said Sloca, who added that the student had been an ""outstanding worker"" during his internship. He is a dual Arabic and psychology major who wanted to get more experience in an Arabic-speaking country, according to his sister. ""The Cairo program was actually the most stable of his options,"" she said. Amin Bonnah, a visiting professor at Georgetown who taught an Arabic class Sweeney took, recalled him as a ""very peaceful, socially peaceful, loving person."" ""I do not believe he is the kind of person who did that,"" Bonnah said. Gates is a junior who is pursuing a double major in political science and Near Eastern languages and culture, said Ryan Piurek, communications director at Indiana University. Gates has been interested in different cultures since childhood and began applying to overseas programs before the Egyptian revolution this year, according to his father. Porter is an international studies major at Drexel, according to university spokeswoman Niki Gianakaris. The American University in Cairo, where the three were studying, describes itself as ""an American liberal arts university in the heart of the Middle East."" The university was founded in 1919 by Americans and says it ""offers a vital bridge between the cultures of East and West."" It is chartered and accredited in both the United States and Egypt. The university boasts nearly 5,000 undergraduates from 113 countries as well as the largest English-language library in Egypt. The AUC Press is the leading publisher of English-language books in the Arab world, the school says.

"London (CNN) -- When Hosni Mubarak's decades-long rule came to an end in February, Cairo's Tahrir Square was a scene of jubilation, as hundreds of thousands of people celebrated the fall of a man many had feared for years. Today the square is once again a focal point for unrest and anger at the Egyptian regime, and the site of a bloody crackdown on demonstrations. So what has happened to change the mood of the country so dramatically? Why are Egyptians no longer satisfied with the revolution they helped bring about? How was Hosni Mubarak ousted? After more than 30 years in power, Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down as president on February 11, 2011 following weeks of rioting and unrest across the country. What had begun as a protest over unemployment, poverty and repression became a widespread popular uprising, with hundreds of thousands of people staging mass demonstrations in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and elsewhere. After resigning and handing control of the country to the military, Mubarak retreated to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where he was subsequently detained by the authorities . Who is running the country now? In the wake of Mubarak's departure, Egypt's military dissolved the country's parliament and suspended the constitution . In its place, a council of generals -- the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) -- led by former defense minister Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, took charge. They promised new elections for the country's houses of parliament and for the presidency. Following the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik in March, Essam Sharaf was named as his replacement at the head of a new caretaker cabinet charged with paving the way for a new civilian government. But for many, the pace of reform in the months since revolution has been too slow. ""The situation has become increasingly tense,"" said Dr Maha Azzam, Egypt expert and associate fellow at London-based international affairs think-tank Chatham House. ""There is a growing perception that the military, the Supreme Council, was the backbone of the previous regime, and that it is, in effect, a continuation of that regime."" What about the cabinet? Prime Minister Essam Sharaf and members of the Cabinet handed in their resignations on Monday night in response to the military's crackdown on demonstrators. ""We have met the demands of the people and submitted our resignations,"" Sharaf said, according to Egypt's Nile TV, before urging the protesters to remain calm and return home. ""Now please put the interests of the country first."" ""I resigned because of the events in Tahrir [Square], because of the political responsibility,"" Culture Minister Imad Edin Abu Ghazi told CNN Arabic. On Tuesday, Tantawi announced that the mass resignation had been accepted, and that another caretaker government would be put in place ahead of the upcoming elections. Why has trouble flared now? More than nine months on from Mubarak's overthrow, many of the things the country's revolutionaries fought against remain: The country is, in effect, a dictatorship, elections have yet to take place, and protesters fear the military will not give up its hold on power easily. ""There has been a build-up of grievances, because of the heavy-handedness of the military regime in dealing with the protesters,"" said Azzam. ""The hope was that with the Mubarak regime gone there would be freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, that the emergency laws would be repealed and that there would be no more human rights abuses. ""But in the last few months we have seen 12,000 people subjected to military trials, protesters have been subject to crackdowns, workers have been denied the right to hold sit-ins."" Many are also angry at proposed changes to the country's constitution, which would protect the military's budget from scrutiny. Azzam says the Supreme Council ""may have gone too far"" with its plans for constitutional change, which she says aim to protect it from accountability, and maintain the ""opaqueness"" surrounding its dealings. Does Mubarak still have influence? Hosni Mubarak is currently on trial for corruption and the deaths of more than 800 people killed during the protests in January, and his influence on the country has waned as a result. But high on the list of protesters' concerns is the fact that many members of the Supreme Council were close allies of the former president: The head of the SCAF, Hussein Tantawi, served as Mubarak's defense minister. ""What we're seeing is a standoff between the population and the opposition, and the military,"" said Azzam. ""The protesters are calling for Tantawi to step down; there is a feeling that if Egypt is to move towards a civilian government, it has to rid itself of the remnants of the old regime."" What is the international community's view? Egypt has long been a vital link between the Arab world and the West, and international leaders -- many of them longtime allies of Hosni Mubarak -- hesitated to back calls for him to step down. However, most were quick to voice their support for the protesters' rights to demonstrate freely and peacefully, and urged restraint on the part of authorities when dealing with the demonstrations. Nine months on, Azzam said such calls for calm needed to be reiterated. ""The international community, particularly the United States, needs to call for restraint, to urge the Supreme Council to control the security forces in their dealings with protesters, to ensure their safety,"" she said. What happens next? Parliamentary elections are due to take place next Monday, November 28, however it remains unclear if they will be postponed, given the unrest in recent days. ""Unless we see an increase in violence in the coming days, I think the elections will go ahead,"" said Azzam. ""But if there is an increase in violence, if the situation deteriorates into riots, it will be very difficult for them to take place. ""So many protesters have already died, there is a fear that if the trouble spreads then the situation will not be conducive to holding elections, and we may see a postponement."" On Tuesday, Tantawi insisted the vote would go ahead as planned, pledging his ""commitment that the parliamentary elections will be held on time."" However, presidential elections are still months away -- Tantawi says they will be held by June 2012 -- and protesters are concerned that the military will remain de facto rulers until a new president is named. Until then, Azzam says, Egypt's is ""an unfinished revolution.""","Nine months after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is once again the scene of protests .
Activists are calling for an end to the military's hold on power .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's spy agency chief said Tuesday a suspected double agent had been arrested who revealed the names of Spanish spies and other state secrets to a foreign nation. Spain's SER Radio reported the recipient nation was Russia. The suspect, Robert Flores Garcia, was arrested Monday morning at his home on Tenerife Island in Spain's Canary Islands. He passed secrets in exchange for hefty payments from December 2001 to February 2004, said the spy chief, Alberto Saiz, head of the National Intelligence Agency (known by its Spanish initials CNI). Saiz, at a news conference, refused to publicly identify the recipient country, but Spain's SER Radio, said it was Russia, citing unnamed sources. Flores, a Spanish Civil Guard assigned to spy agency headquarters for internal matters, had been a suspect under surveillance by Spanish intelligence since July 2005, said Saiz. Flores resigned from his position at the spy agency in January 2004, Saiz said. Saiz insisted that Spain's national security was never threatened, nor, he said, was there a threat to security at NATO and the European Union. Spain is a member country of both organizations. But Saiz said the alleged revelations of the suspected double agent forced Spain to substitute a number of its spies. The suspect allegedly revealed the names of dozens of Spanish spies, possibly including the seven Spanish spies killed in an ambush south of Baghdad in November 2003, Saiz said. An eighth Spanish intelligence agent traveling with them survived. The eight spies, were in Iraq to provide intelligence for Spanish troops who were stationed at the time in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led coalition. The spies were traveling in two vehicles when insurgents launched an ambush with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Flores is suspected of transferring classified material and could face 12 years in prison if convicted, Saiz said. Saiz spoke at a rare news conference in Madrid, which some Spanish media said was the first ever offered by Spain's intelligence chief. Saiz said the alleged betrayal occurred at a time when Spain's spy agency was not fully prepared to deal with an inside mole. E-mail to a friend .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban and the government of North West Frontier Province in Pakistan have agreed to a permanent cease-fire in the nation's volatile Swat Valley, an official said. Girls study this week in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Education for girls is an issue in peace talks there. Syed Mohammad Javed, commissioner for the Malakand region, which includes Swat Valley, told reporters in Mingora that the two parties had agreed to make permanent a 10-day cease-fire declared earlier this week. Javed said the agreement meant boys schools will reopen on Monday and camps will be set up for Swat residents who have fled the fighting or whose homes had been destroyed. The agreement comes as part of ongoing talks between Sufi Mohammad, a pro-Taliban cleric, and his son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah, the Taliban commander in Swat. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan confirmed the cease-fire. However, Fazlullah spoke on the radio Saturday, saying although the commissioner announced a permanent cease-fire, the Taliban will meet again after the 10-day truce expires and decide whether it will be extended. Earlier this week, Pakistani government officials announced they had agreed with the Taliban to allow strict Islamic law, or Sharia, to be implemented in the entire Malakand Division.  Watch what sharia law requires » . It marked a major concession by the Pakistani government in its attempt to hold off Taliban militants who have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings, and the destruction of girls' schools. The fighting has displaced nearly half of Swat's population, according to government sources. Fazlullah said Saturday the implementation of sharia law was very important for peace. Like Javed, he said schools for boys will be opened soon. He said he was not against education of girls, but against the syllabus of their education. The issue of education for girls was still under discussion, Javed said. Nearly 8,000 people died as a result of militant-related violence in Pakistan in 2008, according to the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies. On Saturday, a NATO oil tanker truck was the target of a roadside bombing on its way to Afghanistan. One one person was killed, a local official said. Two other people were wounded in the attack Saturday morning in the Landi Kotal area of Khyber Agency, one of seven semi-autonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border, said the official, with the Khyber Agency political agent's office.","Government, militants agree to make 10-day cease-fire permanent .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan cricket officials want to speak to a member of the national team who left the team camp and reportedly retired after alleged threats to the player and his family. It is the latest twist in a series of allegations that have tarnished the sport which is followed passionately in a number of countries including Pakistan and India. In August, Pakistan's series against England ended amid uproar when three Pakistan players were implicated in a betting scandal. Zakir Khan, the director of cricket operations for the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), told CNN on Tuesday that he was trying to track down Zulqarnain Haider. The 24-year-old wicket-keeper left the national team's hotel in Dubai, where Pakistan was playing a series against South Africa, without notice on Monday and headed for Britain. According to media reports, he retired from international cricket on Tuesday morning having flown to London, where he was pictured arriving at Heathrow airport. Blog: Cricket's authorities need to get a grip . On Tuesday Haider told Pakistan's Geo News channel -- a CNN affiliate -- that his move to London had been prompted by death threats after he refused to help fix matches. ""There were lots of threats to me and my family. Some people offered me money [for match fixing/spot fixing], which I refused ... I have to please God. I did that which was best possible for my country,"" he said. ""I was told to cooperate or I would face lots of problems. This person approached me while I had gone out of the hotel for dinner. He told me cooperate with us and you can make a lot of money. ""He said, 'If you don't cooperate you will no longer be part of the team and we can make life very difficult for you.'"" Pakistan completed the series against South Africa on Monday in the United Arab Emirates, where Haider was allegedly threatened for not helping to fix matches before leaving. ""We are waiting for [confirmation] to come through to us, we have not heard anything from him in person [regarding his retirement] though there is a lot of media-related statements,"" added Khan. ""We have been trying to get through to him, to get hold of his family but nobody can give us satisfactory information about his whereabouts. It's a complete surprise what he has done at the moment."" The PCB confirmed Haider requested his passport on Sunday night and was then nowhere to be found the following morning, after scoring the winning runs to help Pakistan beat South Africa in the fourth match of their series on November 5. He was later fined $140 for breaking a team curfew, along with teammates Shahzaib Hasan and Abdur Rehman. Khan said he was disappointed that Haider did not ask the PCB for help. ""He is a contracted player and recently we went through with him the anti-corruption measures and what needs to be done if he was approached like this, but he has not followed any of these procedures. ""We want to hear from him about what has happened, because there is a big process to go through. We are all shocked [about the allegations] and want to listen to him."" The UK Press Association quoted Rana Faisal, a senior superintendent of police in Lahore, as saying that 12 officials had been sent to Haider's family home ""so that they can be guarded properly if there is any threat."" Khan would also not confirm whether Haider -- who has played one Test match (a long form match that can last up to five days) and four one-day games for his country -- would be welcome to return to the squad if any future talks with the player went well. ""We are going to investigate the matter in detail. It's too difficult to say at the moment [if he could return] as everybody is shocked and surprised at what has happened. Things were going right for Pakistan, we were back in the international arena, with wins against South Africa. Everything was going right and then this happened."" The International Cricket Council, the sport's ruling body, said that it would not be getting involved in the matter unless the player requested its help. ""First and foremost this is a matter for the Pakistan Cricket Board, although the ICC is willing to provide assistance to both Pakistan and the player himself,"" chief executive Haroon Lorgat told CNN. ""We are sympathetic to any player who finds themselves in this position. And we will help any player who is willing to come forward and we hope Zulqarnain Haider decides to do so."" Pakistani journalist Azhar Javaid told CNN that he had talked to Haider and said that the player ""was a little confused."" ""It is my understanding that he's regretting his decision to come to London from Dubai in this manner,"" said Javaid, the UK correspondent for Pakistan Dunya TV. ""He wants to go back to Pakistan. There is tremendous pressure from his family and also Pakistani people over there. I think he has been misguided by some people and he took this decision in this manner."" Javaid said he had also talked to Pakistan's London High Commission, which said Haider had no case to apply for asylum. ""He's not a very big player -- he's just a wicket-keeper and he's struggling for his position,"" added Javaid. ""He has the pressure that Kamran Akmal might come back."" South Africa won Monday's match in Dubai by 57 runs and completed a 3-2 series win over Pakistan.","Pakistan Cricket Board is still trying to locate Zulqarnain Haider, who has fled to London .

"Washington (CNN) -- The military's newest and most powerful ground-penetrating bomb is not intended for Iran's underground nuclear and weapons facilities specifically, a Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday. ""The system's not aimed at any one country,"" said Pentagon spokesman, Capt. John Kirby. ""It's to develop a capability we believe we need."" The new Massive Ordinance Penetrator, known as the MOP, is able to explode 200 feet underground and designed to destroy deeply buried and fortified targets such as the ones Iran is believed to have constructed to protect its nuclear research facilities. ""It gives us a far greater capability to reach and destroy an enemy's weapons of mass destructions that -- weapons of mass destruction that are located in well-protected underground facilities, without getting into specifics, to -- to a magnitude far greater than we have right now,"" Kirby said at a Pentagon briefing. The Air Force has contracted from Boeing for 20 of the bunker-buster bombs. It took the first delivery in September, according to Pentagon official. The official, citing operational security limitations, would not provide details about how many have been delivered. There were three separate orders placed by the Pentagon with the final one placed in August. The bomb is said to be more than 20 feet long and 30 inches in diameter and weighs some 30,000 pounds (13,600 kilos). It is more powerful than its predecessor, the BLU-109, and is a ""relatively simple weapon,"" according to information posted by the military's Defense Threat Reduction Agency. ""The MOP relies on gravity to turn its massive weight into tremendous kinetic energy. Designed to penetrate supposedly untouchable facilities in one piece, the MOP will defeat our adversaries' (weapons of mass destruction) before they leave the ground,"" according to the description on the website. Air Force Lt. Gen.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban have declared a cease-fire in South Waziristan, one of the seven semi-autonomous tribal areas in northwest Pakistan, three Taliban commanders told CNN Tuesday. The cease-fire -- agreed a month ago -- follows back-channel peace talks that have been taking place between intermediaries representing the Pakistani government and the Pakistani Taliban, the commanders said. The commanders, speaking under condition of anonymity, said the talks were preliminary and began in late September, focusing only on South Waziristan. The group has demanded an exchange of prisoners, the withdrawal of Pakistani troops from South Waziristan and compensation for the victims of army operations in the area, which borders Afghanistan, the Taliban commanders told CNN. The Pakistani Taliban has made preliminary contacts with the government through local tribal elders to explore the possibilities of a peace deal, the commanders said. South Waziristan is believed to be the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban leadership. The outcome of the purported back-channel talks is not yet known -- and senior figures in the country's government and military have denied they are going on. The official spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, a group that has not always spoken with one voice, categorically denied the commanders' claims. ""We are not against Pakistan. We are against the U.S. and its allies,"" spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan said. ""Once Pakistan stops acting as an ally of America, only then will we be open to peace talks with the Pakistani government."" Pakistan's interior minister denied the government is actively in talks with any faction of the Pakistani Taliban. ""The Taliban have been trying to contact us; however, we will not engage in peace talks with them until they give up their arms,"" Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN. Malik said the message the Pakistani government has sent to the Taliban is: ""Give up your arms and then we will talk."" The Pakistan military dismissed the reports of ongoing peace talks as ""concocted and baseless."" Commander Asif Yasin Malik, a military spokesman, told reporters in Mingora, in Pakistan's northwestern Swat district: ""We are not talking to the Taliban. This is the government's job, not ours."" Both the Taliban and the Pakistani government would consider any talks highly sensitive because of the risk of being perceived as abandoning their cause and appeasing the enemy. Both sides have set conditions for talks and neither wants to be seen as the side that abandons its conditions. This may explain why the two sides are denying talks are taking place and apparently using go-betweens instead of meeting directly. The Pakistani government faces the added risk of upsetting the United States, since Washington has long pressed Pakistan to get more aggressive with violent extremists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The United States expressed serious concern after Pakistan's short-lived peace deal with the Pakistani Taliban in 2008. Founded by Baitullah Mehsud in 2007, the Pakistani Taliban is a banned Islamist group said to have links with the Afghan Taliban and al Qaeda. Since its inception, the group has focused its attacks on military forces and installations as well as civilian targets in the region. Journalists Saboor Khattak and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistani Taliban commanders say a cease-fire was agreed in South Waziristan .

"(CNN) -- Seventeen years after the release of her breakthrough album, ""My Life,"" Mary J. Blige offers up a sequel -- ""My Life II: ... The Journey Continues (Act 1)."" ""The first 'My Life' album was about healing and helping people get through things,"" the singer told CNN. ""Now there's recession, there's war and there's people really not feeling good about life anymore. So it's time, because people need to feel the hug that comes through music."" In the mid-90s, Blige herself was in a troubled place, spiraling downward with drugs, alcohol and a tumultuous relationship with K-Ci Hailey of the R&B duo K-Ci & JoJo. ""I just knew by maybe 1997, I would be dead or just finished. That's where we were at the time. We were very suicidal, very dark,"" she recalled. Blige admits she reached out to fans for support, because she didn't know where else to turn. ""I spoke up through my lyrics that I needed help, and the spirit that came behind it was that I was sad, you know,"" she said. ""I needed help. Four million people responded to that album, saying, 'Mary, wow. Me, too.' "" ""My Life II"" finds the New York native in a very different place. At 40, she's cemented her place as an R& B icon, with 50 million in worldwide album sales and nine Grammys. In 2003, she married Kendu Isaacs, a man she credits with saving her life. And lately, she's been honing her acting chops, taking on the role of a nightclub owner in the big-screen adaptation of ""Rock of Ages,"" starring Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Russell Brand. She's also set to star as the eclectic jazz great Nina Simone in the biopic, ""Nina."" It's ""The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" playing ""The High Priestess of Soul."" CNN caught up with Blige last week in Los Angeles to talk to her about her music, her acting and Tom Cruise. CNN: A lot has changed in the 17 years between ""My Life"" and ""My Life II."" What precipitated that change? Mary J. Blige: That's an interesting question. I come from pain. I come from poverty. I come from embarrassment, and my mom struggling, and having two jobs and leaving us with the baby sitter -- and coming back and we're outside the baby sitter's house. I've come back from abuse from people. I really wanted out. It started snowballing into this thing that was hurting me, and I was in the public eye. I got to a place where I understood that I needed help, and that was during the ""No More Drama"" album (released in 2001) when I met my husband -- who was my boyfriend at the time. And who knew that he was going to have the information that he had for me, and that I was going to be able to receive it? CNN: We've seen young people like Lindsay Lohan struggling. Why is it that she can't get it together? Blige: Why can't Lindsay and so many other people get it together? I mean, everyone is afraid of the pain. That is a painful walk. Embarrassment is painful. It brings a tear to your eye when you have to walk down the red carpet with so much shame in you, and so you would rather paint something on. But in my case, I never cared about being embarrassed or ashamed to ask for help. I was just ashamed of being ashamed. I was just tired of feeling that way. CNN: You talk about being abused. The Penn State scandal must have hit you pretty hard, as someone who went through an experience that was similar. Blige: Yeah, it hurts when I see stuff like that -- children being molested by grown-ups. But the thing that I have learned is that there is something wrong with that grown-up. It is something wrong with that adult that people are overlooking, and sweeping under the rug and throwing money on. And you have to get to a place where it's just, ""You know what? You did it, but I have got to get out of it. You did it to me, but I can't let you destroy me, and not allow me to have a chance to have what I am supposed to have in life -- which is happiness, which is success, which is life, period.""

It was just recently that I started saying, ""You know what? I AM deserving."" I wouldn't say two years ago, but I'd say maybe five or six years ago I was like, ""Wow, I deserve this"" -- because sometimes when I get so many accolades, I want to bury my head.

I love YOU!"" And Russell Brand is just amazing. And Julianne Hough is my friend, and Adam Shankman (the director) is one of my really good friends. So we were like family -- no joke. CNN: You seem to be in a really good place, and that's reflected on ""My Life II."" Blige: Yeah, I am. The place I'm in with ""My Life II"" is understanding that there WILL be trials.

"(CNN) -- Arizona authorities on Monday arrested the mother of a 5-year-old girl last seen more than a month ago, a police sergeant said. Jerice Hunter was ""placed under arrest for child abuse directly related to her daughter, Jhessye Shockley,"" Glendale Police Sgt. Brent Coombs told reporters. ""Our investigators are still working diligently to locate Jhessye,"" he said. ""This is a step down that path."" None of the leads about the girl's whereabouts has panned out, Coombs said. But he did say that information about her mother, Hunter, proved to ""have substance to the investigation (and) have proven to be accurate, as far as we can tell."" Jhessye allegedly wandered out of her Glendale home on October 11, unnoticed by her 13-, 9- and 6-year-old siblings who were supposed to be watching her. Her mother contacted police, saying she did so after she couldn't find her daughter when she returned home from an errand. The siblings were later interviewed separately by experts and have maintained they do not know what happened to Jhessye, Coombs said previously. Soon after reporting the girl missing, Hunter pleaded for the public's help. ""Please bring my baby back. ... Her safe return is all I want,"" Hunter said last month. ""She belongs to this family. ... She's somebody's child. Mine. Please bring my child home."" Since then, Hunter has ""not been cooperative with respect to a polygraph"" test, which police asked her to take, Coombs said Monday. He described Hunter as the ""lone focus"" in the investigation. Still, he did not rule out that others might be involved. ""We're not so shortsighted to think that there may not have been an additional person or persons who may ... have helped,"" Coombs said. The reward for information leading to Jhessye, as well as to those responsible for her disappearance, has increased to $25,000, Coombs said Monday. Jhessye is described as a black female about 3 feet 5 inches tall, 55 pounds, with black hair in a ponytail and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, blue jean shorts and pink sandals. Given the time that has passed, the police sergeant conceded, ""We do not believe that it will be likely that we will find Jhessye alive.""","Jhessye Shockley was reported missing on October 11 in Glendale, Arizona .

"(CNN) -- A major clean-up operation is underway along the north coast of New Zealand 's North Island as debris and oil leaking from a cargo ship that ran aground on a reef wash ashore, officials say. The Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga, last week. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. The country's environment minister, Nick Smith, has called the spill the country's most significant maritime environmental disaster. As of Wednesday, clean-up teams, comprised of some 500 responders, collected 50 tonnes of solid waste and five tonnes of liquid waste from beaches in the Bay of Plenty, cleaning oil from 17 kilometers of coastline, MNZ said. Pubic access to some waterfront areas has been restricted due to health concerns. MNZ said the coastline between the towns of Whangamata and Whakatane will be assessed today to determine the areas of highest priority for clean-up operations. ""There is a massive effort underway and it is only going to grow,"" said National On Scene Commander Nick Quinn. ""We understand the anger and disbelief we're hearing from people,"" he said. ""Our focus is on recovering oil from wherever we find it and we will go in day by day until this is over."" MNZ said that 200 dead birds have been recovered following the oil spill and that this number is expected to increase ""significantly."" The agency said 36 wildlife rescue teams are scouring the coast for wildlife affected by the spill and 47 oiled animals are being treated at center that has been set up in Tauranga. A team has been established to capture seals and five of the animals are being kept in captivity. Greenpeace has expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits,"" he said. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."" MNZ said that about 70 containers had fallen off the ship, some of which have washed ashore. Due to the hazard the containers pose to shipping, the agency said navigational warnings had been issued and major maritime traffic has been re-routed. The Rena has suffered substantial structural failure and there is a concern that the stern of the vessel may break up, MNZ said. Salvage teams have three tugs mobilized either to hold the stern on the reef while efforts continue to remove oil from the ship, or to tow the stern to shallow water to extract the oil, the agency said. Containers remaining on the vessel continue to move, making it dangerous for salvage crews to work on board. The ship's second officer will appear in Tauranga District Court this morning to face a charge of ""operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk,"" MNZ said. The Rena's captain was yesterday remanded on bail on the same charge, on the condition he surrender his passport. His name has not been released. If convicted, they face a maximum fine of $7,800, or up to 12 months imprisonment. CNN's Karen Smith and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Teams have cleaned oil from 17 kilometers of coastline in Bay of Plenty .

"(CNN) -- If you've ever wondered what happens when you mix a sentient gorilla with a helicopter, look no further! This and many other questions are answered during the course of Rupert Wyatt's compelling and invigorating ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" And if you're looking for a summer popcorn film that won't talk down to you, you've found it. I went into the screening of ""Rise"" with low expectations, and there were many reasons for my trepidation. ""Congo"" would be one of them (""Oh, no! The bad apes have the crystal lasers!"") and pretty much every other misguided reboot or ""intelligent animal"" movie since the original ""Planet of the Apes"" series ended in 1973 would be the others. Thankfully, you don't have to worry, as Fox's restart of the legendary franchise delivers on almost every front. To my surprise and delight, ""Rise"" is what had become a summer movie rarity: fun, engrossing and a way to escape the heat without being treated like a 10-year-old boy. Believe it or not, ""Rise"" is also reasonably intelligent. Well, as intelligent as is possible, given the subject matter. It is, after all, basically a popcorn flick. With several nods and winks to the previous franchise, ""Rise"" clearly knows which side of its bread is buttered, and fan boys and girls will not be disappointed. References are made both verbally and visually to the original, but don't worry if you're not (yet) a fan of the classic. No prior knowledge is required. The film opens with Will Rodman (James Franco) working in a biotech lab at a company called Gen-Sys (get it?) developing what he hopes is a cure for Alzheimer's by experimenting on chimpanzees. You see, Will's father (John Lithgow) has the disease, and Will's hellbent on curing him. As this is an ""animals in a lab"" movie, something is bound to go wrong. In this case, one of Will's subjects, Bright Eyes, seemingly goes berserk, and Will's project is shut down on the eve of its approval for human testing. Not allowing himself to be constrained by anything as trite as rules or ethics, Will not only takes his research home with him (he adopts an infant chimp that has been exposed to the experimental drug), but he also begins treating his father Charles with the serum. Here is where the film takes off, both emotionally and technologically. Unlike the animatronics of old, the special effects of ""Rise"" are astonishing. While the film ostensibly stars Franco, Lithgow, Freida Pinto and several other noted actors, the real star of the show is Caesar, the digitally created chimp brought to life by Weta Digital -- the company that sprang to prominence for its work on Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy -- and by actor Andy Serkis. Serkis (Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings""), who has become the go-to guy for performance capture roles, plays Caesar from infancy to adulthood, growing from a vaguely Curious George-like childhood into your everyday, sullen, teenaged hyper-intelligent ape and eventually into an adult. Caesar is a complex character, a first-of-his-kind artificially created leap in evolution, and as such, has a lot on his mind, all of which Serkis has to portray through movement and facial expressions. It's an extraordinary achievement and is the heart of the film . As with any ""wild animal lives with human"" story, things go off the rails. Will's obnoxious and confrontational neighbor (David Hewlett, playing against type) reacts badly to a young Caesar trying to play with his daughter and later assaults an Alzheimer's-addled Charles when the latter tries to drive the former's car and damages it. Caesar sees Charles as a member of his family and defends him, attacking the neighbor. (How Caesar lived with humans for so long without someone calling the cops is one of a few serious suspensions of disbelief in which one must indulge.) Animal control is called, and the second act begins with Caesar incarcerated in what is supposedly a paradise for wayward simians, but as anyone who's seen a movie knows, is basically a maximum-security prison for apes. Here, Caesar begins to suspect that not all humans are as kind as his ""dad,"" Will, and that maybe it's his job as a super-intelligent chimp to balance the scales a bit. The scenes in the chimp prison (""Esc-Ape From Alcatraz,"" anyone?) are where our empathy with Caesar and his fellow primates turns to full-on ""Get those guys!"" blood lust as the evil jailers -- played by a criminally under-used Brian Cox and his less-than-humane son, played by ""Harry Potter's"" Tom Felton -- routinely abuse their charges, even selling some to Gen-Sys. No one likes to see animals abused -- especially ones with thumbs -- and It's here that Caesar begins his transformation into a chimp Che Guevara. The tension of ""Rise"" increases so gradually through the film's first hour-plus that before you notice it, you're on the edge of your seat, virtually gagging for the the promised ape revolution. And when it comes, you won't be disappointed. Here is where Weta's genius combines with Wyatt's direction, Andrew Lesnie's cinematography and Patrick Doyle's score to deliver a rousing finale with Serkis' Caesar at the forefront. iReporter talks to James Franco . The original ""Planet of the Apes,"" while clearly a sci-fi film, was also a thinly veiled 1960s-style allegory about civil rights and the rising threat of nuclear proliferation. Much of that is lost here, although new ""lessons"" about the dangers of tampering with nature are reasonably constant. That film's stunning revelation at its climax is one of the most famous scenes in movie history, and since we've now been treated to a prequel (and assuming this is the start of a new franchise), the filmmakers are going to have to work pretty hard to find an equally compelling ending to the next film, since we already know the ""surprise."" Here's hoping they manage it. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is rated PG-13, and despite how cute some younger children might think chimps are, this is not the film for them. There's far too much violence for the younger set.","Fox's restart of the legendary franchise delivers on almost every front .

"(CNN) -- Not so long ago, the idea of a Casey Anthony movie seemed like a certainty. How could Hollywood resist the chance to adapt the sensational murder case? After all, producers didn't hesitate to turn the Amanda Knox, Natalee Holloway and Clark Rockefeller sagas into TV movies. And interest in those cases pales compared to Anthony, whose trial became the must-see television event of the summer. But the public outrage over Anthony's acquittal on murder charges is making some in the industry rethink the wisdom of adapting her story to the screen. ""Anyone who pursued a movie based on these events, especially right now, will face some immediate backlash,"" said Matthew Belloni, news director for The Hollywood Reporter. ""The nerve is so raw on this and so many people are so outraged by the verdict that anything that is seen as an attempt to exploit this, especially if the family is involved, will be seen as a negative by most of the people who followed the trial,"" Belloni told CNN. The cable channel Lifetime would seem the logical home for an Anthony movie -- it aired the Knox, Holloway and Rockefeller films, and it's in production on a movie about murder suspect Drew Peterson (with Rob Lowe in the lead). But when CNN asked the network if it was pursuing an Anthony project, Lifetime said it had ""nothing in development."" When we asked if the network had obtained the rights to any of the central players in the case, we got the same response: ""We have nothing in development."" The mere hint of a connection to the Anthonys has sent Hollywood talent agencies diving for cover. When an erroneous report circulated last week that William Morris Endeavor had signed Anthony for representation, the agency was inundated with protest calls. It quickly sent out word denying the report. And Paradigm, another big talent agency, signed Anthony's lead attorney, Jose Baez, for representation, only to ""un-sign"" him several hours later after facing a drumbeat of criticism. Actress Niecy Nash, who told CNN she watched ""every minute"" of the trial, is among those angered about the prospect of Anthony cashing in by selling the rights to her story. ""If that girl [Anthony] makes one dime off of the death of her child, I'm just telling you that I feel like America is going to be like, 'we are so done with you!' "" she told CNN. ""I'm upset because the opportunity to profit from a tragedy is laid out for this girl on a silver platter,"" Nash said. Comedian and social commentator Alycia Cooper told CNN she could imagine a Casey Anthony movie under certain circumstances. ""I do think there should be a movie made"" about the case, Cooper said. ""But I want the person that does the movie to be a neutral person, because that way, we'll get more of a balanced movie, versus Casey Anthony doing the movie, because then it'll slant her way, and it's going to be filled with even more lies."" The possibility of a movie has inevitably spawned water cooler talk in Hollywood about who should play Anthony. Cooper likes Alyssa Milano for the role. ""I think she's got the chops,"" Cooper said. The Hollywood Reporter's Marisa Guthrie picked ""Twilight"" star Kristen Stewart. Nash told us she would cast Katie Holmes or Anne Hathaway. To play Casey Anthony's father, the white-haired George Anthony, we heard suggestions of John O'Hurley of ""Seinfeld"" fame, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Blake. Speculation about casting the movie may be more than just idle chatter. Some people remain convinced there will be a Casey Anthony movie, including The Hollywood Reporter's Matthew Belloni. ""You've got to believe that something this high-profile, something that everyone is talking about ... that eventually, this will become a movie,"" he told CNN. The surprising verdict in the case only makes that more likely, Belloni said. ""Then you have this outcome that many people can't reconcile with the facts,"" he said. ""That conflict presents good fodder for a film.""","Natalee Holloway, Amanda Knox, Clark Rockefeller sagas were turned into TV movies .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A prosecutor in the appeal by American Amanda Knox against her murder conviction urged the jurors to put themselves in the shoes of the parents of the murder victim, as the case entered its final phase Friday in Italy. Prosecutors in the case are presenting their concluding arguments as to why the appeals court in the Italian town of Perugia should uphold the convictions for Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Rafael Sollecito, after a lengthy appellate process. Addressing the jurors, appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola said: ""I hope when you make your decision, you feel a little bit like the parents of Meredith Kercher, a serious, studious girl whose life was taken away by these two kids from good families."" Defense attorneys for Knox and Sollecito are expected to present their final arguments early next week, as they fight to overturn the convictions. Knox and Sollecito were found guilty in 2009 of killing Kercher, Knox's British housemate, two years earlier. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. Summing up the prosecution case Friday, Costagliola focused on evidence given by witnesses. He said defense efforts to discredit the testimony of Antonio Curatolo, a homeless man who testified during the criminal trial that he saw Knox and Sollecito near the crime scene the night of the murder, had failed. Costagliola also sought to pick holes in the testimony of two defense witnesses, convicted child killer Mario Alessi and jailed mafia member Luciano Aviello, who had each given conflicting accounts of who killed Kercher. The prosecutor then reviewed the circumstantial evidence put before the court, including the contradictory statements given by the accused and DNA evidence. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, who investigated the case, spoke Friday of how he would never forget seeing Kercher's face when he first saw the body, as he defended the prosecution case made in the original trial. He urged the jurors to make their decision on the basis of what they had heard in court, not in the overwhelming media coverage. Mignini also questioned why the defense lawyers had not previously raised concerns over the way evidence was collected. ""Why didn't they say anything then? Were they distracted? Or didn't they find anything wrong?"" he asked the court. Attorneys for Knox and Sollecito have in recent weeks sought to undermine their convictions by scrutinizing DNA evidence found on the knife used to kill Kercher and on her bra clasp. Two independent forensic experts argued this summer that the Sollecito DNA allegedly found on the bra clasp should be ""inadmissible"" because the clasp had not been properly handled. Prosecutors rejected that claim. Knox's father, Curt, told CNN earlier this month that prosecutors have ""no case left,"" after a review of evidence, and that he hoped to be able to take his daughter home within weeks. Knox and Sollecito are appealing their convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial. A third defendant, Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate fast-track trial. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","NEW: Prosecutor urges jurors to put themselves in the shoes of the dead girl's parents .

"(CNN) -- Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega can be extradited to his home country, a French appeals court said in an opinion issued Wednesday, according to a court spokeswoman. France ordered Noriega's extradition earlier this year, responding to a Panamanian government request for the former dictator's return to face charges that he had a political rival killed. The extradition was held up by court action, however. It was unclear when French Prime Minister Francois Fillon would sign the extradition order to set in motion Noriega's transfer. Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering. He also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million), the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks. Noriega denied the charges. Panamanian officials want him to face justice there in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora, a doctor and political opponent of Noriega. Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April 2010 after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package. U.S. federal courts ruled against him. When U.S. forces invaded the country, Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He eventually surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly escorted to the United States for a civilian trial. Noriega's U.S. sentence, originally for 30 years, ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior. However, he remained in prison while the French extradition issue was decided. While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne, Tom Cohen and Alanne Orjoux contributed to this report.","NEW: The timing of Noriega's transfer to Panama is unclear .

"(CNN) -- Former FBI Director Louis Freeh will lead an independent inquiry for Penn State University into the school's response to child sex abuse allegations, trustee Kenneth Frazier said Monday. ""No one -- no one -- is above scrutiny, including every member of the administration of the university, every member of our board of trustees, and every employee of the university,"" said Frazier, who was appointed to chair the special investigative committee into the university's response to allegations involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. A grand jury reported this month that university officials allegedly knew of allegations of misconduct on Sandusky's part, but failed to fully act on them. Freeh, who will serve as special investigative counsel, said he extracted pledges of support and non-interference from university officials before taking on the job. ""This assurance is the main condition of my engagement,"" he said. He said will appoint a team of former FBI agents and former federal prosecutors from his law firm to assist. Results of the investigation will be released to trustees and the public at about the same time, he said. It's unclear how effective Freeh will be, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""Louis Freeh is an honorable person, but the question is whether he will have the tools to do a thorough investigation."" Toobin said. With police, the university and even Sandusky's former charity, The Second Mile, conducting their own investigations, it's unclear whether witnesses will want to repeat their stories over and over again, he said. At the heart of the scandal are accusations that Sandusky, the retired defensive coordinator for the Penn State football team, sexually abused a boy at the university football complex, and that law enforcement officials were not notified. According to grand jury documents, a graduate assistant told head football coach Joe Paterno in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in a football complex shower. Paterno told athletic director Tim Curley, who told Gary Schultz, a university vice president. Some information about the allegations eventually reached President Graham Spanier, according to the grand jury. Paterno has said he did ""what I was supposed to do."" But in a later statement, he said ""with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" While it took years for the alleged abuse to become public, school officials moved quickly after prosecutors charged Sandusky, 67, with 40 counts in the alleged sexual abuse of eight young boys over several years. Authorities also charged Curley and Schultz with misleading the grand jury investigating the allegations and failing to report suspected abuse. Curley and Schultz stepped aside within a day of the charges, and before the week was out, trustees had fired both Paterno -- the winningest football coach in Division I history -- and Spanier. The university's special committee, created six days after Sandusky's arrest, empowered Freeh to ""take his team's work to wherever it leads,"" Frazier said. The NCAA and the U.S. Department of Education are also investigating the university's response. Freeh said he did not know how much the investigation will cost, or how long it will take, other than that it will be lengthy. Investigators had already begun work reviewing documents in the case, he said. While he does not have the subpoena power he enjoyed as an FBI official, Freeh said he is counting on the cooperation of law enforcement and the Penn State community, which is eager to restore the university's reputation. ""In my current role, I will encourage everyone to speak to us,"" he said. Frazier said the scandal has caused irreparable harm to the school, but officials are determined to make sure it never happens again. ""Words alone cannot express the heartbreak and sorrow we feel for the victims,"" he said.","NEW: It's unclear that Freeh will have the tools he needs for inquiry, analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after Kamal Ganzouri stepped down as prime minister more than a decade ago, Egypt's state-run al-Ahram newspaper ran a story in which various party and government officials accused him of being arrogant, autocratic and corrupt. Neither those portrayals, however, nor the fact Ganzouri was appointed and served three years under deposed President Hosni Mubarak spelled the end of the economist's political career. In fact, he now appears set to take on his old role at one of the most tumultuous, momentous times in modern Egyptian history. On Thursday, military spokesman Lt. Col. Amr Imam told CNN that Ganzouri, 81, had agreed -- after meeting with Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, field marshal of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Egypt's dominant figure since Mubarak's ouster in February -- to become Egypt's prime minister once again. If he can put together a government, Ganzouri will complete a resurgence that might have seemed unlikely after he left office in 1999. The next April, al-Ahram noted criticisms levied at Ganzouri -- from then-parliamentary speaker Fathi Sorour, Mubarak's chief of staff Zakaria Azmi and several members of parliament -- tied to his handling of financial and other matters during his three years as prime minister. For instance, Sorour claimed that Ganzouri had excessively issued military orders, citing his role as military governor, under emergency law. Sorour called such orders ""a clear infringement of the assembly's legislative mandate,"" according to the al-Ahram report. And Ayman Nour, a member of the then-minority and liberal Wafd party, blasted what he described as Ganzouri's authoritarian actions as a ""flagrant infringement of the constitution and parliament's authority,"" in the same al-Ahram story. Still, the fact that Tantawi apparently approached Ganzouri about the prime minister's job suggests that -- more than 11 years later -- military leaders today have a high opinion of him. He has online supporters as well, including a Facebook page with 653 ""likes"" as of Thursday night and filled with comments suggesting that he is the best person to lead Egypt. Besides his economic background at a time of continued financial crisis in Egypt, Ganzouri would bring a wealth of government experience to the job. Starting in 1987, he served as a deputy prime minister. In 1996, Mubarak appointed Ganzouri as prime minister after Atek Sedki resigned after nine years in that position.","Kamal Ganzouri was an Egyptian deputy prime minister in the late 1980s .

""In the beginning of my career everybody talked a lot that with my style of game it's gonna be very difficult to play very well here,"" he added.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexico's military has seized more than $15.3 million in cash from a vehicle in the border city of Tijuana, authorities said Tuesday. In addition to the money, troops also found jewelry and packages of cocaine in the vehicle, the Attorney General's Office said in a statement. Soldiers found the stash during patrols Friday, the statement said. Authorities believe the vehicle was heading to a home used as a financial hub by the Sinaloa Cartel, the statement said. On Tuesday, officials showed reporters in Mexico City stacks of $100 bills that they said were seized in the operation. The cash is the second largest quantity of money the Mexican military has seized since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006, the statement said. In 2008, soldiers seized more than $26 million in Sinaloa state. Calderon announced a government crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office.","In addition to money, troops find jewelry and packets of cocaine .

"(CNN) -- Seven members of a breakaway Amish group in eastern Ohio were arrested on federal hate crime charges for allegedly shaving the beards and cutting the hair of individuals who refused to support their leader, according to a criminal complaint released Wednesday. One of the seven men is Samuel Mullet Sr., the leader of the breakaway sect and a man that local law enforcement and other Amish in the area consider a cult leader. Mullet ruled the group with an iron fist, in some cases ""forcing members to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop"" and beating those ""who appear to disobey"" him, according to an FBI affidavit. Mullet had been ""counseling"" married women in his sect, ""taking them into his home so that he may cleanse them of the devil with acts of sexual intimacy,"" the sworn statement from an FBI agent said. Law enforcement officials believe he was behind the various beard and hair cutting attacks of the past few months. The men charged are said to have carried out ""a series of assaults against fellow Amish individuals with whom they were having a religiously based dispute,"" according to the Justice Department. The Amish who were attacked are believed to be former members of Mullet's group who left over various disagreements. Mullet wanted to ""seek revenge and punish the departing families,"" the federal documents said. ""In doing so, the defendants forcibly restrained multiple Amish men and cut off their beards and head hair with scissors and battery-powered clippers, causing bodily injury to these men while also injuring others who attempted to stop the attacks,"" the Justice Department said. ""In the Amish religion, a man's beard and head hair are sacred."" Several of the men have confessed their involvement to local investigators, according to a sworn statement by an FBI agent that was attached to the complaint filed in Cleveland. The seven men were arrested as part of a raid on Mullet's 800-acre compound that went down ""without incident"" early Wednesday morning, according to Mike Tobin, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Ohio. A combination of ""about 40"" officials from various agencies, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Jefferson County and Holmes County sheriffs, were involved in the raid, Tobin said. Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla, who was at the raid, said they hit Mullet's home at 6 in the morning. Everyone was asleep at the time. ""Three guys at first didn't want to come out of their rooms, but the FBI got them out of there,"" Abdalla said. Abdulla said he was happy about the arrest. ""I'm elated. And I tell you what, so is the Amish community...I'm happy for the Amish people who are so fearful of that guy."" Abdalla added that what made arrests so difficult in this case is the fact that Amish generally don't believe in dealing with law enforcement, so charges had never been pressed. While he's generally happy the arrests were made, part of him is also worried some of the people who live on the compound under his rule will remain ""brainwashed"" and not have enough will power to move away while Mullet is in custody. He urged them to seize the opportunity. ""Now's the chance if you want to get out. Now's the time to go,"" he said. The defendants appeared in federal court Wednesday afternoon. A magistrate ordered them held until a detention hearing, Tobin said. No date has been set for the hearing. Samuel Mullet's sect is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around the compound in a remote valley outside Bergholz, Ohio, officials say. The alleged religiously motivated physical assaults were a violation of the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Justice Department said Wednesday. If convicted, each man could face up to life in prison, it said. Five of the men were arrested last month on charges of kidnapping and burglary stemming from an incident at the home of Myron and Arlene Miller in early October in which a group of men pulled Myron Miller out of the home by his beard, held him down, and cut off large portions of the beard. The incident at the Millers' home was one of a handful of incidents in several counties in which as many as 30 men and women carried out similar attacks, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred J. Abdalla said. When CNN asked the senior Mullet last month if he was behind the beard incident, he responded by asking rhetorically, ""Beard cutting is a crime, is it?"" He then denied the allegations that he was running a cult. Asked about what was, at the time, the start of a federal investigation, Mullet said, ""We're not guilty, so we have nothing to hide. If they want to come and check us out, we'd be glad to see them here.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The sense of security that South Koreans had enjoyed for almost 60 years was shattered one year ago, when the North launched an attack on the civilian island of Yeonpyeong, killing two marines and two civilians. Grainy images from surveillance cameras that captured the moment when some 170 rounds of artillery pounded the island, causing villagers to run for their lives, were a stark reminder for many that the two Koreas still remain at war. With a sense of normalcy returning to the island as villagers return home, most South Koreans have bounced back from the incident -- which escalated tensions to their highest since the Korean War was halted in 1953 after an armistice treaty was signed. But have South Koreans forgotten about the threat? Many remember the day of the attack. Park Yunee, 30, was a student at the time and received a text message from her friend that read: ""Get your things together. It looks like war is going to break out."" ""I think for most people it was the moment when that sense of fear suddenly kicked in. Not thinking about living in a divided country and all of sudden, you're thinking, war could actually happen,"" says Park. What stunned many South Koreans was not only the fact that Pyongyang could direct its aggression upon civilians, but that they were unprepared. ""There was a lot of talk at the time about the power shift in North Korea and how Kim Jong-il had designated an heir. But in reality what really mattered was the fact that we weren't prepared at all for something that happened in that one moment,"" says Park. The attack was a wake-up call for the South Korean government. It launched the largest civil defense drill in history shortly after the attack and urged people to be more proactive and aware of potential threats from Pyongyang. The island shelling had also come half a year after North Korea torpedoed a naval ship, the Cheonan, killing 46 sailors. Consequently, the past 12 months have seen relations between the two foes deteriorate. North Korean expert Yang Moo-jin calls the past year ""a power struggle"" between the two Koreas. ""What South Koreans want is to not cave in and forgive North Korea for what it did last year, but they also understand in order to prevent such provocations from happening again, there needs to be a sense of dialog and negotiation,"" Yang, a professor at the University of North Korean studies, says. Both North and South Korea have shown signs of concession -- Pyongyang has expressed willingness to engage with countries involved in multilateral talks aimed at North Korea's denuclearization, while Seoul recently sent humanitarian aid through U.N. agencies to help the malnourished population in the North. However, if relations don't improve on the peninsula soon, Seoul could potentially be looking at a prickly neighbor willing to use its long-range missiles next year, according to Yang. ""If the trust level between North and South Korea continue to be as low as it is, there is the possibility that Pyongyang will go for more sensitive and strategically important targets,"" adds the professor. The threat of another attack like Yeonpyeong may unnerve many South Koreans, but some have already recovered the positive sentiment they had before the island attack occurred. ""I think most people believe something like that could never happen in Seoul. There seems to be this vague belief that questions the plausibility of such an act,"" Seoul businessman Michael Cho says. ""No, I don't think that could happen, is what the majority of people think, including myself,"" he adds. ""It's probably because we've always co-existed with North Korea's provocations that we don't really perceive the threats from it,"" says 40-year-old office worker Lee Chul-hee. ""It just doesn't seem relevant to my life.""","The Yeonpyeong attack escalated Korean tensions to their highest since 1953 .

"(CNN) -- Three American college students detained in Cairo since Monday night were released from police custody Friday and were headed to the airport to return to the United States, an attorney for one of the men said. The men will board three separate commercial flights to return home, according to Joy Sweeney, the mother of Derrik Sweeney. Theodore Simon, an attorney for the family of Gregory Porter, told CNN that ""his parents anxiously await his return."" The three -- Porter, Sweeney and Luke Gates -- were arrested after being accused of throwing Molotov cocktails in the unrest that has rattled the country since last week. Their release was ordered Thursday. Joy Sweeney said earlier Friday that the paperwork to release the men had been completed. Derrik Sweeney's father, Kevin Sweeney, told CNN his flight is scheduled to leave Cairo at 10:30 a.m. Saturday (3:30 a.m. ET) and he will arrive in his home state of Missouri on Saturday night. ""He's extremely excited,"" Kevin Sweeney said of his son. The family was planning to hold a belated Thanksgiving meal Sunday. Joy Sweeney said her son told her Wednesday in a telephone call that ""they had done nothing wrong."" All had been attending American University in Cairo on a semester-long, study-abroad program. Sweeney, 19, is a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Porter, 19, is from Glenside, Pennsylvania, and attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, goes to Indiana University. Adel Saeed, the general prosecutor's spokesman, said Wednesday that a bag filled with empty bottles, a bottle of gasoline, a towel and a camera had been found with the three American students. ""They denied the bag belonged to them and said it belonged to two of their friends,"" Saeed said. Kevin Sweeney said Friday that his son had been ""falsely accused."" ""He was there observing something that was definitely a phenomenon of the culture,"" he said, noting that Derrik, with a dual major in Arabic and psychology, had gone to Egypt ""not just to learn the language -- he wanted to learn the culture."" Now, Sweeney said, his son does not plan to return to Egypt. ""This semester is over for him, whether he's able to finish it remotely or writes it off,"" he said. ""He really does not want to be in Egypt right now."" Sweeney declined to discuss any possible injuries his son sustained while in police custody. He was not aware of the conditions of the other two men. Also Friday, an Egyptian-American filmmaker arrested amid ongoing protests in Cairo was released, her lawyer said. There were no immediate details about the release of documentarian Jehane Noujaim, which was confirmed by her lawyer, Ragia Omran. Film producer Karim Amer said Wednesday that Noujaim -- whose works include ""The Control Room,"" about Al-Jazeera and the United States during the early days of the Iraq War -- was arrested while filming near the Interior Ministry building in Cairo.

"Washington (CNN) -- Just a few days before Black Friday signals the beginning of holiday shopping fury, the U.S. Public Interest Group has released its 26th annual ""Trouble in Toyland"" report, alerting consumers to the dangers and toxins that can still be found in children's toys. The biggest concerns are toys containing chemicals that are potentially toxic, or that contain choking, strangulation or noise hazards. While U.S. PIRG -- a non-partisan consumer advocacy group -- does not test every toy sold in stores, it takes random samples and has them laboratory tested to check for acceptable levels of toxic substances or other hazards. Among the key finding in the report is the continued presence of these hazards. According to U.S. PIRG, ""over 400 children died from toy-related injuries"" between 1990 and 2010, and more than half of those choked. ""Choking on small parts, small balls and balloons is still the leading cause of toy-related injury,"" said PIRG's Nasima Hossain, who presented the report Tuesday. Hossain demonstrated the ""toilet paper roll test,"" a way in which parents can easily determine whether a toy is too small for their infant or toddler. If the toy, or pieces from it, can easily pass through the empty roll, the toy can be deemed a potential hazard. Commissioner Robert Adler from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who also spoke at Tuesday's press conference, said it's been a busy year for his government agency, which works closely with U.S. PIRG. Adler says this year the produce safety commission has passed the toughest safety standards for cribs, where babies often spend the most unsupervised time. In March the commission launched a product-safety database that can be found at www.saferproducts.gov. The commission has promulgated rules to reduce the amount of lead in children's products to among the lowest levels in the world, says Adler. ""One of the interesting things about lead and other chemicals we regulate -- they don't show up in injury reports. The problem is, they do affect children, but it's a chronic cumulative hazard that may not evidence itself until children are involved in later development,"" said Adler. He added that lead poisoning can even affect children's IQ levels. There are multiple online resources for parents seeking information about the toys they're purchasing, including www.toysafety.mobi which is an interactive site administered by U.S. PIRG that can be accessed through smart phones. U.S. PIRG doesn't identify which countries are the biggest culprits with using toxic materials in the manufacture of toys. ""We don't think a child or family is all that concerned, if a child chokes on a toy, (whether the toy is) made in China or was made in Kentucky. All toys that are on the store shelves need to be safe,"" the group said. Both the produce safety commission and U.S. PIRG feel, however, that their agencies are under threat from Congress relaxing safety standards, as a result of toy lobbying groups. ""Sadly we're seeing recurring problems, and what we would argue is that we know what the problems are, and we actually need to fix the problems ... Toy manufacturers need to be more vigilant about the products they put out,"" said Gary Kalman, the director of U.S. PIRG's federal legislative office. With the gift-giving season rapidly approaching, Santa --and parentsâ€” will be need to use the same guidelines and common sense approach that have been around for the past two decades, before placing gifts under the tree. The main rule is to make sure toys are age-appropriate. Joan Lawrence, vice president of standards and government affairs for the Toy Industry Association said consumers should feel confident that the toys they purchase are safe. ""So much has been done in the name of toy safety, from government and industry, so consumers should feel quite comforted that what they find, has been found safe,"" said Lawrence.","Choking on small parts is still the leading cause of toy-related injury .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's general prosecutor on Friday ordered a police officer to submit to questioning regarding his suspected role in shooting protesters in the eyes during recent clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square. ""The Ministry of Interior is preoccupied by the latest events, but he will come in for questioning soon,"" Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor, said about the suspect, 1st Lt. Mahmoud Sobhi El Shinawi. The evidence offered against El Shinawi includes videos recorded by protesters and posted on Facebook, Saeed said. At least five demonstrators have been shot in the eye, according to authorities. They are among hundreds of casualties over the past week. Some 41 people have died -- 33 of them in Cairo -- while an additional 3,250 had been wounded as of Friday, Health Ministry spokesman Hisham Shiha has said. Protesters have called El Shinawi, specifically, ""The Eye Hunter"" and have sprayed ""wanted"" stencils featuring his face, name and rank on the walls around Tahrir Square. Fliers with his photograph have also been distributed to people in the square, which is the hub of the activist movement railing against Egypt's military leaders. They include a reward offer of 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($800) for information leading to the suspect, according to the artist who painted the stencil and asked not be named. El Shinawi has been on duty on Cairo's Mohamed Mahmoud street during the recent clashes and is a ""highly trained marksman,"" 1st Lt. Alaa Mahmoud, an Interior Ministry spokesman, told CNN. The spokesman declined to comment on the specific accusations against El Shinawi. One of the suspect's alleged victims is Ahmed Harrara. Harrara, who lost one eye on January 28 during the uprising against then-President Hosni Mubarak, lost his other eye last Sunday on Mahmoud Street. Both he and at least one other victim, Malek Mustapha, said they were blindsided by their shootings -- and, therefore, could not pinpoint the shooter or shooters. Yet they were able to recall the circumstances. Harrara told CNN that he'd arrived in Tahrir Square around 3 p.m. Saturday ""and joined the front lines in (the) street battle."" ""Around 3 a.m. I was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet from about a distance of 7 to 10 meters (23 to 33 feet),"" he said. He lost his second eye, then fell to the ground ""during one of many tear gas attacks."" ""My friend drove me on a motorbike to three hospitals that could not (treat) the injury, until one hospital operated and closed the wound,"" Harrara recalled. The bullet remains lodged in his eye socket, leaving him blind. But the shooting victim said, ""My spirits are high, and I should be traveling to Switzerland within the next 10 days (for) tests and operations."" Harrara said that he had no political affiliations during the initial uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster in February. He is now a member of the People's Socialist Party, which opposes military leaders' interim authority over the Egyptian government. On Friday, his older brother Hatem, and friends helped Harrara navigate around Tahrir Square once again. ""My brother's eye is more important than Egypt, but for Ahmed, Egypt is more important than his eyes,"" Hatem said. ""The policeman who shot my brother must be punished and executed."" Last Saturday, CNN witnessed a similar incident also on Mahmoud Street involving Mustapha, a blogger who was shot in his right eye. ""Doctors say I have a blood clot in the eye and will need several operations soon,"" Mustapha told CNN. Mansour al-Essawy, the interior minister appointed by Egypt's ruling military council, said Friday in a statement that ""no live ammunition, rubber or birdshot (has been) fired at the protesters."" But Shiha, a Health Ministry spokesman, has told CNN that many of those killed and wounded were shot by ""live ammunition, rubber bullets and birdshot.""","At least 5 protesters have been shot in the eye, authorities say .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The 25-year-old pregnant wife of a Syrian TV anchor in Egypt was kidnapped in Cairo on Friday, her husband said. Thaer al-Nashef, who describes himself as a ""political activist against the Syrian regime,"" said he believes the alleged kidnapping is the work of Syrian intelligence operating in the country. There was no immediate response to the allegations from the Syrian government. Egyptian police confirmed that al-Nashef filed a police report about his wife's disappearance. Al-Nashef said he was alerted to the alleged kidnapping by a text message. ""We have kidnapped your wife, you dirty dog, so you don't insult your master again,"" al-Nashef quoted the text as saying. Al-Nashef said he received further text messages from the alleged kidnappers, including one that threatened that his wife would be raped, and another saying his wife would be killed if he went to the media with the story. Mustapha Khalil, the officer who took al-Nashef's report, said police will be contacting his mobile phone provider to investigate the origins of the text messages. Al-Nashef said the messages came from an Egyptian number. Al-Nashef is a freelance journalist in Egypt and serves as a TV anchor for several networks, including January 25 TV, which was launched after the revolution to topple Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. His wife, Mona al-Gharib, is an Egyptian citizen and a student at Azhar University, he said. She is six months pregnant with their second child, according to al-Nashef. Protesters gathered outside offices of the Arab League after news of the alleged kidnapping broke. They later moved to the Syrian Embassy. The Syrian government has been accused of seeking retribution against relatives of Syrian activists working against the Bashar al-Assad regime from abroad. The U.S. State Department announced this summer that it had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States. Other Syrian activists living abroad have also declined to be named or appear on camera for fear of reprisals against their families at home. And in August, a rebel military leader living in exile in Turkey disappeared from a refugee camp and reappeared days later in Syrian government custody. Evidence also suggested that the government carried out reprisal attacks against the man's family.","The woman is the wife of a Syrian TV anchor in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- A judge in Aruba Friday rejected a prosecution request to hold U.S. citizen Gary Giordano for 30 additional days in connection with the disappearance of his traveling companion, Robyn Gardner, his attorney told CNN Friday. The decision means Giordano, who has been in Aruban custody since August 5, will be freed at 8 p.m. Tuesday, his U.S.-based attorney Jose Baez, said in a written statement. ""We are grateful the Arubian government has seen that no crime was committed,"" Baez added. ""Gary ... is excited to return home to his family in the United States."" Prosecutors immediately filed an appeal seeking to reverse the ruling and prevent Giordano from leaving jail, said Taco Stein, Aruba's solicitor general. A three-judge appeals panel will consider the matter. Giordano ""couldn't believe"" the decision because he had lost faith and confidence in the Aruban criminal justice system, said his Aruban defense lawyer, Chris Lejuez. ""When I asked him what he really thinks about his release, he started to cry and asked me to excuse him for a few minutes,"" the attorney said. The judge's ruling does not require Giordano to remain in Aruba; Lejuez said he believes Giordano will leave as soon as he is freed. The request to hold him was denied based on what the judge called a lack of progress in the investigation into the August 2 disappearance of Gardner, Stein said. Giordano made a passionate argument for his release, Lejuez said. The prosecution's appeal of Friday's order could be heard anytime between Friday and Tuesday, including the possibility of a weekend hearing, Stein said. Giordano, 50, denies being responsible for the woman's disappearance, insisting that he'd been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled her to swim back, according to statements from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the Aruban beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he reportedly said. According to a transcript of a police interview, obtained by CNN, Giordano told police he feared for his life when he'd tried to tell Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore. ""I only looked back when I hit a rock,"" the document quotes Giordano as telling investigators. ""Before that, I did not look back. I was only busy saving my life."" The Gaithersburg, Maryland, resident has acknowledged taking out a $1.5 million life insurance policy on Gardner days before they traveled to Aruba, investigators have said. The woman's body has not been found.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Esam Sharaf shuffled his Cabinet Sunday, amid protests calling for the interim government to quicken the pace of reform. Sharaf appointed Hazem El-Beblawi, a newly-named deputy prime minister, to replace outgoing Finance Minister Samir Radwan, said ministry spokesman Ibtisam Saad. The prime minister accepted the resignation of Industry Minister Samir Al-Sayyad, according to Ahmed Saman, spokesman for Sharaf. It was not immediately clear who would replace him. Sharaf also appointed new health and transportation ministers, Saman said. The antiquities minister submitted his resignation, which was accepted, the spokesman added. The moves come amid an ongoing shakeup in the government, which is under pressure to speed up the pace of reform since President Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11 after protests. Egypt's Foreign Minister Mohamed el-Orabi, who had been in office for less than a month, stepped down on Saturday. Several people working within the current government have been criticized for allegedly being too close to the former leader and those who helped suppress demonstrations last winter. Thousands of disgruntled pro-democracy activists have again descended on Cairo's Tahrir Square, setting up tents in the iconic roundabout that was the hub of the uprising. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Sharaf's caretaker cabinet have been in charge of the country since Mubarak's ouster.

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky denied Wednesday two new allegations of child abuse that authorities are investigating, his attorney said. ""Jerry has adamantly denied the allegations,"" said attorney Joseph Amendola, adding that the accusations appear to be part of ""a very nasty divorce and custody battle."" The investigations were opened by Children and Youth Services in Pennsylvania, sources close to the investigation said Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, cases of alleged child abuse reported by an alleged victim who is an adult are strictly police matters, even if the alleged offenses occurred when that person was a child. Children and Youth Services participates in the investigation only if the alleged victim is still under 18. Said Amendola: ""I know at least one Children's Youth Services investigation has been opened up by Centre County CYS regarding Jerry's alleged abuse of one of his (family members). We don't know for sure. The allegations are ridiculous and unfounded. ""Jerry has absolutely denied any inappropriate contact with his (family members). It's important to keep in mind these allegations were made after the attorney general filed charges against Jerry even though the alleged incident(s) took place before the AG's charges were filed,"" Amendola told CNN. Attorney: Evidence will prove Sandusky's innocence . The attorney said he and Sandusky haven't been told of the nature of the alleged abuse by the attorney general or the family member who made the allegations. ""Even if you buy into the attorney general's allegations against Jerry -- which we vehemently dispute and which we intend to vigorously defend against -- these new allegations don't fit the profile presented by the AG. These new allegations appear to be the result of a very nasty divorce and custody battle,"" Amendola said. If the allegations are found to be credible, they would be the first known cases involving current minors to become public since Sandusky's arrest. All the other publicly known cases have involved alleged victims who are now adults. The new cases were reported less than 60 days ago, according to sources close to the investigation. Sandusky was arrested on November 5 after the release of a grand jury report detailing crimes that he is accused of committing between 1994 and 2009. He is free on $100,000 bail, and he has denied the allegations. Based on the grand jury report, Pennsylvania's attorney general has charged Sandusky with 40 counts in what authorities allege was the sexual abuse of eight boys. In addition, Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president, resigned their posts after being charged with failing to inform police of the allegations. Head football coach Joe Paterno and President Graham Spanier also lost their jobs in the wake of the report, when questions were raised about the university's response. According to grand jury documents, a graduate assistant told Paterno in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in a football complex shower. Paterno informed Curley, who told Schultz, according to the grand jury report. CNN's Jason Carroll and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Two new accusations of child abuse stem from ""a very nasty"" divorce, lawyer says .

"Lome, Togo (CNN) -- Six members of the Etoile Filante soccer club died in a bus accident on Saturday in Togo and 25 people were injured, said a spokesman for the country's soccer federation. The team was headed to Sokode, where it was scheduled to play Sunday, when a tire reportedly burst, causing the bus to flip and catch fire, said Aime Ekpe, the spokesman. ""Twenty-five others, including some players, are severely injured. Most of the victims died in the fire,"" Ekpe said. He spoke to CNN from the scene of the accident in Glei, about 81 miles (130 km) north of Lome, Togo's capital. Among the victims were Christophe Dagbovi, the club's secretary-general, Isidore Kouma, the deputy coach, and Charles Balogou, a former national team goalkeeper. Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe issued a statement soon after the accident, offering condolences to the victims' families. Soccer in the West African country has suffered a series of misfortunes in recent years. Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Togo's national soccer team to a tournament in Angola in 2010, killing the team coach and the director of communications. A helicopter carrying 22 Togolese soccer officials, including Sports Minister Richard Attipoe, crashed in Sierra Leone in 2007.

"Cairo (CNN) -- One of three American college students arrested in Cairo passed out from fear when Egyptian authorities accused them of taking part in violence, he told CNN Sunday. ""There were cops and people with guns standing before us,"" Derrik Sweeney said, describing ""the scariest moment of my life. I didn't know if I was going to survive, and I actually fainted -- the only time I recall fainting in my life."" Sweeney, Gregory Porter and Luke Gates were back in the United States Sunday, a few days after an Egyptian court ordered their release. Egyptian authorities had accused them of throwing Molotov cocktails in the clashes that have rattled Egypt in recent days. ""That was entirely fabricated,"" Sweeney told CNN, adding that he and the others did not do anything ""to harm anyone or anything."" Porter was the first of the students to come home, returning to Pennsylvania on Saturday. ""I just want to say that I'm so thankful to be back in Philadelphia,"" Porter told reporters. ""I'd like to thank my parents, my mom and my dad, for their support."" He also thanked his lawyers, embassy officials and the administration at the American University in Cairo for their roles in helping to secure his release. Sweeney, 19, of Jefferson City, Missouri, arrived at a St. Louis airport late Saturday night and was greeted by about two dozen relatives and friends. All three students were attending American University in Cairo on a semester-long, study-abroad program. They have said they did not do anything wrong, according to their parents. Sweeney is a student at Georgetown University; Porter, 19, is from Glenside, Pennsylvania, and attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, attends Indiana University. Speaking to CNN on Sunday, Sweeney said he was ""hoping to see politics in action"" when he went close to the protests, but insisted, ""we were in the sidestreets"" and not in the thick of the demonstrations. ""We were right near a large crowd, apparently near the interior minister,"" he said, when the police ""shot something into the crowd and we all sprinted away. As we were trying to regather ourselves, we found -- the three of us Americans -- found each other. And then someone came in plain clothes saying that they would take us to a safe place and help us out. The next thing we knew we were getting hit... The first night we got hit in the face in the back of the neck a number of times."" While he does not know who the plain-clothed people were, ""I believe police,"" Sweeney said. ""They were certainly working with the police. They were able to walk around the police where the protestors weren't."" Looking back, he said, ""I have no regret that I went to the protests,"" but, ""I went too close to violent scenes."" ""Walking onto Mohamed Mahmoud street where there was violence was a bad idea,"" he said. Adel Saeed, the general prosecutor's spokesman, said Wednesday that a bag filled with empty bottles, a bottle of gasoline, a towel and a camera had been found with the three American students. ""They denied the bag belonged to them and said it belonged to two of their friends,"" Saeed said. Joy Sweeney, Derrik's mother, said her family would celebrate Thanksgiving belatedly on Sunday. Just three hours before the incident in Egypt, she said, she had talked to her son on the phone ""and he said, 'Don't worry mom, we're safe. It's far away from where we are.'"" While she knew her son was in Egypt ""to experience the culture,"" she said, ""I didn't want him to be that close to the violence... that was a little too close for comfort for me."" Drexel President John Fry released a statement Saturday expressing relief at Porter's safe return and thanking all those involved. Three Drexel students remain in Egypt and all of them want to stay as long as U.S. officials do not recommend they leave, Fry said. Asked whether he wants to return to Egypt, Derrik Sweeney told CNN, ""I really enjoyed most of my time there and hopefully one day,"" but, he added, ""not very soon.""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Suzanne Mubarak, wife of toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, suffered a heart attack Friday after being questioned in a corruption investigation, the manager of the Sharm el-Sheikh Hospital said. The manager, Mohamed Fatah Allah, said she had been taken to the intensive care unit. The incident came shortly after Suzanne Mubarak was ordered detained for 15 days in a corruption case, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. Assem al-Gohary, the assistant justice minister for the Illicit Gains Authority, ordered her detained for ""obtaining illegal wealth using her husband's position and political authority."" A team of investigators from the authority, a separate investigative unit under the Ministry of Justice, had questioned the former president in the same hospital for three hours Thursday regarding ""using his political position as president to acquire illegal wealth."" ""Hosni Mubarak was also questioned about his luxury mansion in Sharm el-Sheikh,"" al-Gohary said. Last month, the former president suffered a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges, Egyptian state television reported. But the head doctor from a Ministry of Justice team assisting with the questioning said later that the former leader had heart palpitations and was able to walk with assistance. He was deemed stable enough to allow prosecutors to resume questioning at the hospital, according to the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper. Mubarak has said the inquiry is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. The former first lady had been scheduled for questioning Thursday, but investigators postponed the interrogation until Friday morning. She was asked about the origin of 20 million Egyptian pounds ($3.4 million) deposited in her name in a local bank account, al-Gohary said. Both Mubaraks were questioned about accounts in Al Ahly Bank, containing $147 million under their authority, he said. The Mubaraks signed affidavits allowing investigators to further inquire into their bank accounts and wealth inside and outside Egypt. Suzanne Mubarak, 70, was treated successfully for leukemia 10 years ago, said Hanaa Gohar, the former first lady's former press contact. ""She was very healthy and very active"" before the revolution, Gohar said. The U.S. ally, a former military commander, resigned in February after nearly three decades in power amid massive demonstrations calling for him to step down.

"(CNN) -- It's not the kind of weather map or travel intelligence you want to see on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Two major storms in the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest are complicating matters on one of the busiest travel days of the year. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin saying terrorists could choose to strike during the holidays and everyone should stay vigilant. CNN has obtained a copy of the bulletin which says law enforcement is ""not aware of any credible threats to the Homeland specifically timed to coincide with the 2011 holiday season."" But the bulletin notes last year's Oregon plot to set off a bomb at a Christmas tree lighting. That one allegedly involved a homegrown suspect. And the bulletin says that as of February 2010, al Qaeda was considering attacks on the United States on symbolic dates such as Christmas, but there's no information to indicate that led to actual al Qaeda plots. These sorts of bulletins have come out at holiday time in past years. But this is the first once since the death of Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, rain has prompted flood watches in parts of Pennsylvania; up to 8 inches of snow have fallen in central parts of Maine; showers are soaking northern Florida; and wind gusts of up to 98 mph have been reported along the Oregon coast, CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. ""It's going to be a rough go for a whole lot of people,"" she said. Flight delays were spreading Wednesday afternoon, with Newark International, LaGuardia, San Francisco International and Boston's Logan International airports reporting problems.

Slightly fewer people are choosing to get to their destinations by plane. About 23.2 million travelers will fly over a 12-day period surrounding Turkey Day, a 2% drop from last year, according to a forecast by the Air Transport Association of America. Unlike last year, when the National Opt-Out Day movement against airport body scanners threatened to snarl security lines across the country, air travelers are not facing the prospect of protest-induced delays.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The founder of one of America's largest pizza chains has offered unexpected advice to his customers to limit themselves to only one or two slices. Pizza is not normally known for its health benefits; thick, cheesy toppings push up the calorie count. During an interview on BBC's Radio Four program in the United Kingdom, John Schnatter, said, ""you can't eat five or six slices."" He was responding to a question from presenter Adam Shaw about whether he was concerned about the impact of the British government's anti-obesity drive on pizza sales. ""No. Pizza's actually healthy for you if you don't eat too much of it,"" Schnatter replied, adding, ""You can't eat five or six slices but if you eat one or two slices it's very nutritious."" The pizza chain boss had just finished telling BBC listeners that the UK market was a ""huge priority for Papa John's International."" The company has 118 outlets in the United Kingdom, its second biggest market outside the U.S. after China. Sales in the UK jumped 60% on Monday alone after heavy snowfalls were estimated to have encouraged around one in five workers to stay at home. Schnatter is in the United Kingdom for the annual franchisee conference, a marketing tool to encourage more small business owners to buy into the Papa John's brand. While it's impossible to know whether his comments have dissuaded anyone from investing in the company, BBC presenter Shaw suggested shareholders might take issue with his suggestion. ""I'm not sure your investors would want to hear you tell people don't eat too much of our pizzas,"" he laughed before thanking Schnatter for his time. Schnatter opened his first shop in 1985, after selling his beloved Camaro to buy his first pizza oven. There are now more than 3000 restaurants worldwide.","Pizza chain founder advises customers not to eat more than one or two slices .

"(CNN) -- The protests that have spread through parts of the Arab world led to dramatic change in another country Tuesday, as Jordan's king dismissed his government. King Abdullah II made the decision following protests in recent weeks in which several thousand people demanded economic and political reforms. Experts on the region said Tuesday Abdullah's decision was aimed at warding off larger-scale demonstrations in the wake of the huge protests in Tunisia and Egypt.  The Tunisia protests, which began the movement, toppled that country's government.  In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak has fired his Cabinet, but protesters in massive demonstrations continue to call for his ouster. The protests -- which have also caught on to various extents in Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan -- have proved to be ""a real watershed event for the Arab world,"" said Blake Hounshell, managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine.  ""It's really unprecedented."" There was a series of protests in Arab nations in the 1950s, but those were prompted by an ideology of Pan-Arabism in a post-colonial world, said Emile Hokayem, with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  A 2005 uprising in Lebanon was about independence and ousting Syria.  While it was successful, the revolution's message was not one that other nations associated with, he said. ""It's different this time.  People are standing up for their economic rights, their dignity. It's very different,"" said Hokayem. Ibrahim Sharqieh of the Brookings Institution said there's a whole new mind-set. ""The Tunisian uprising has caused change in the attitude and behavior of ordinary Arab citizens -- and today we are witnessing the emergence of a can-do nation attitude,"" he explained. Economic concerns have fueled the protests across the region.  At a speech Tuesday in Singapore, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the need for action against unemployment was ""a strong undercurrent of the political turmoil in Tunisia, and of rising social strains in other countries,"" according to his prepared remarks. Arab leaders have been getting the message, Hokayem said, noting an article in the Wall Street Journal in which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said leaders must ""see the need of reform"" before protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia break out, because by then ""it's too late to do any reform."" Abdullah's decision and Assad's remarks ""are preventive moves,"" said Hokayem. Hounshell noted that the Jordanian king has sacked his government before in recent years.  ""But in the context of what's happening now, it's going to be seen as a way to get ahead of these protests."" When the Tunisia protests proved successful at first, many analysts still doubted a ""domino theory"" would play out through the Middle East, said Hokayem, because each nation has a different structure, population, and set of challenges.  But ""right now, it seems like it's a possibility.  So I think governments are trying to prevent what could be copycat movements in the region."" The level of solidarity in the Arab world has come as a surprise to some experts, said Hokayem.  But ""it's a matter of psychology at this point. People feel that there is an overture, and they want to push, want to do it."" Still, there are key differences.  ""I still think that monarchies have an edge in terms of legitimacy,"" Hokayem said.  Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen are officially republics, and leaders were gearing up for successions by bringing their children to power, sparking fury and frustration in an underserved population. In Gulf state monarchies, such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, uprisings that threaten the government are ""less likely,"" said Hounshell.  ""But I wouldn't rule it out."" The United States views Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia as key allies in the region.  The Saudi kingdom has been stable for decades.  ""If Saudi Arabia starts to see popular protests,"" said Hounshell, ""then you're really going to see people in Washington freak out."" It remains unclear how far the change in any of these countries might go. In Jordan, whether the king will regain support from protesters by dismissing his government is ""a million dollar question,"" said Hounshell.","NEW: Analyst: A ""can-do nation attitude"" is emerging .

"(CNN) -- It's a nerve-wracking week for the 20 young journalists of South Africa's newest youth magazine. It's nearly deadline day and the Cape Town office is a buzz of activity as the finishing touches are made to the first magazine aimed at the mainstream youth of South Africa. But it's also a publication that's been made entirely by the same people it's targeting. ""It's not just them writing articles and then a professional team taking that and making it pretty,"" said founder of Live Magazine South Africa, Gavin Weale. ""Live SA has been commissioned by young people, subedited, designed and illustrated. We even have young people working on the circulation, distribution and marketing,"" he added. But along with producing 48-pages of news, views and entertainment the project is bringing together young people from a range of different backgrounds and races. The results are breaking boundaries and giving many of the youngsters an opportunity to realize their full potential, the founders say. One of the writers, Ntomboxolo Nana, has aspirations of one day working as a professional journalist. Just a few years ago she was a member of a gang and spent time in prison. ""She has tried to apply for college but is struggling to get in to school so we are giving her a platform to get in to school. We hope that the experience she gets here will push her into journalism,"" explains Live Project Co-ordinator, Nkuli Mlangeni. Mlangeni says the magazine is also providing young people with a platform to speak out about issues that are affecting them. ""It's a place for them to communicate to other young people in their age group about the political situation, education system and discuss what culture they are interested in,"" she said. She adds that a lot of the media in South African is run by an older generation. ""They didn't have places to do this before, there are blogs and social networking but internet is still not accessible to everyone so this is a good medium as the magazine will be distributed for free,"" she continued. Nana is currently writing a story about an issue that the younger generation have been protesting about in the area. A child was beaten up at a school in Khayelitsha on the principal's orders. Nana's piece about violence in schools hopes to give a voice to some of the concerns the younger generation have had with the incident. Another writer is working on a 'dummies guide' to the ANC youth leader, Julius Malema. There will also be articles reviewing products and advice and tips for school-leavers and young entrepreneurs. Kenyan youth find their superhero . Live magazine originated in the UK and after a decade in business and a circulation of 30,000 the success of the quarterly publication prompted Weale to bring the concept to South Africa. Weale secured funding for the project from the Shuttleworth Foundation, a social innovation agency set up by Mark Shuttleworth, a famous South African entrepreneur. But the hope is for the magazine to become the authentic voice of South African youth and be entirely self-sustainable within one to two years. The reporters are aged 18-25 and come from a range of different circumstances. Weale says the editor comes from one of the most dangerous townships in Cape Town and is working alongside youngsters who have had more privileged upbringings. The organization is also working with 'remote' contributors in surrounding townships through regular workshops. However, despite the youngsters different backgrounds, the professional mentors that guide and train the youngsters report that a common theme unites them. ""All the kids wanted to address the segregation in Cape Town, they all wanted to talk about that and use the magazine as a platform to discuss it,"" said Mlangeni. Another mentor, photographer Chris Saunders, has been honing the youngster's camera skills. He says it's been incredible hearing how everyone has interacted with each other. ""The conversations they've had while they are working in the same room have broken a lot of boundaries,"" he said. ""There is still a rift between many communities and people are still separated by language and cultures and this has really been a bridge to that,"" he continued. ""They sit in a room and talk about their different cultures and problems. It's been a learning curve for us as well."" The first issue of Live SA will hit the streets in mid-November across the Western Cape and Gauteng. But Live has future ambitions to take the concept to other parts of Africa. ""There are millions of young people out there who are hungry for this kind of opportunity, so it can't happen too fast!"" Weale said.","Live Magazine South Africa is written for and produced by young people in Cape Town .

"(CNN) -- ""The people and the army are one hand,"" the chant of Egypt's January 25th revolution on the eve of President Hosni Mubarak's resignation, has yielded in the face of toxic gases, rubber bullets and live ammunition from the security forces, composed of army and police, to ""the army and the police are one dirty hand."" The trust and gratitude the Egyptian people once felt toward the military for their solidarity in ousting Mubarak has evaporated as the brutality of the army and police has caused scores of deaths and thousands of injuries. Not only tear gas and rubber bullets, but also toxic gases -- which cause seizures and reportedly led to several deaths by asphyxiation -- and live ammunition have been aimed at the protesters. Tweets from all over Egypt reveal the shock at this criminal behavior. One said, ""I am out of words. Egyptian army is murdering Egyptian civilians. That's our worst living nightmare."" The November revolution differs from the 18 days that led to Mubarak's downfall not only in the escalating violence, but also in the new coalitions that have emerged as well as the old alliances that have been exposed. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic opposition group, has fractured: Members of its youth have aligned themselves with the protesters, while the leadership has supported the position of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) that the parliamentary elections, which began today, must go forward. Banking on a good showing in the elections, the Muslim Brotherhood leadership stayed away from Tahrir Square for the first week of this month's protests. Islamist youths discovered their leadership's duplicity on the first day of the demonstrations, November 18, which was called as a day of protest by Islamists. The plan to have a contained demonstration backfired and led to the current nationwide uprising. Nawara Negm, a female journalist, activist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, said in an interview posted on YouTube that they were urged to leave Tahrir Square on the first night of the protests, when a few hundred youth activists moved in to reclaim the square. ""The Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi leaders insisted we go home after the Friday protests .... I decided to stay with my brothers and sisters here in the sit-in in Tahrir Friday night until our voices are heard. Then the brutal, deadly attacks on us started. I cannot help but think now that those Islamists' leaders had some sort of a deal with SCAF, but thank God it did not work out."" After days of equivocating on the violence, the U.S. first called on the military to halt its attacks on the protesters, and then, in a dramatic change of position, withdrew its support for the SCAF. The White House statement, issued early Friday morning, called for ""full transfer of power to a civilian government"" in a ""just and inclusive manner."" It was greeted with incredulity in Tahrir. As in the January revolution, the U.S. government has been perceived as supporting its allies -- the SCAF as much as Mubarak -- over the democratic aspirations of the people. That the tear gas canisters still bear the moniker ""Made in the USA,"" as they did in January, does not help. In its support for proceeding with the parliamentary elections, the U.S. finds itself in an odd allegiance with the SCAF and the Muslim Brotherhood and out of touch with the sentiment on the street. Tahrir Square never has been about ""free and fair elections first,"" although the people have that expectation. The revolution of people carrying signs asking for ""dignity,"" ""freedom,"" ""equality"" and ""social justice"" always encompassed much more than political processes. The people dying on Egypt's streets are fighting for the true conditions of a just society. Elections, which in Egypt always can be manipulated, cannot be trusted to deliver that goal. Far from promoting democracy, holding the parliamentary elections on time ignores the will of the people -- not to mention the sacrifices of those who have been killed or wounded -- and plays into the hands of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Many factors taint the elections: . -- Holding the elections amounts to a forced approval of SCAF's brutal repressive practices, with the violence still ongoing throughout Egypt, out of the sight of the cameras in Tahrir Square. -- Exerting total control over the media, SCAF manipulates public opinion with unchecked lies about protesters (think of the three American college students who were detained) and bullies independent networks, such as ONTV, with defamation campaigns, often targeting individual reporters, such as Yousri Foda. -- After refusing for months to allow international monitors to observe the elections, SCAF relented at the last moment. But irregularities such as removing the ballot boxes to remote locations remain troubling. A full post-election evaluation will reveal the monitors' assessment of the transparency and honesty of the elections. -- Governance is in chaos. The country, in effect, has three governments, not to mention SCAF: the new prime minister, Kamal Ganzouri, appointed by SCAF and still forming a Cabinet; the interim prime minister, Essam Sharaf, supposedly still in position; and a Tahrir-formed Civil Council, led by the former diplomat and Nobel Prize winner Mohamed ElBaradei, former Muslim Brotherhood leader Aboul Fotouh and others. The November protests have shaken Egypt out of a period of post-revolution stagnation, with serious implications for the future. With the exception of those who have joined the protests, the military, from the generals at the top to the soldier on the street, has violated the trust of the people. Now they are seen in the same light as Mubarak. Many Muslim Brotherhood youths have broken off and have joined forces with the broad coalition of protesters. Al Azhar, Egypt's leading religious institution, has weighed in with the people against SCAF. And the ""leaderless revolution"" now has political backing. A coalition of many leaders from the principal parties, called by ElBaradei, has formally asked SCAF to leave. Also, representatives of the principal revolutionary movements have come together to support ElBaradei as prime minister over the SCAF's choice of Ganzouri. The Egyptian people, who at times since January have seemed apathetic about the future of the revolution, have shown their determination to reclaim it. The protesters all determined to stay in Tahrir, and on the streets and squares of Egypt, until SCAF steps down, hands power to a civil body, and submits to a public independent investigation into the violence and killings in January and February, the October Maspero protests (when the police attacked peaceful Christian Copts) and the strife in November. As noted by a slogan pasted to the walls at Omar Makram Mosque (now turned into a field hospital), ""You can Crush the Flowers, but It Won't Delay the Spring.""

"(CNN) -- The investigation into claims that a Syracuse assistant basketball coach molested young boys is at a standstill as law enforcement officials find themselves at odds. In a news conference on Wednesday, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick harshly criticized Syracuse Police Chief Frank Fowler and Deputy Chief Sean Broton over the handling of a 2002 probe into a ball boy's molestation claims against Syracuse University assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine. Fine has called the allegations ""patently false."" Fitzpatrick accused police officials of leaking a sealed affidavit from a female witness in the Fine case to the media. Bobby Davis, 39, told ESPN last week that Fine molested him ""hundreds of times"" over the course of 16 years, starting from when he was in the fifth or sixth grade. Davis told university officials six years ago that he informed Syracuse, New York, police that he had been ""subjected to inappropriate contact by an associate men's basketball coach"" during the 1980s and 1990s, according to university Senior Vice President Kevin C. Quinn. Police had originally told Davis that they would not pursue the case because the statute of limitations had expired, Quinn said in a statement. Davis' stepbrother, Mike Lang, 45, has also accused Fine of molestation. Lang told ESPN last week that Fine molested him ""15 to 20 times."" That accusation has kick-started a new police investigation. Fitzpatrick filed subpoenas for records in the 2002 and current investigations that he said he should readily have access to. ""I have a chief that's intentionally trying to sabotage an investigation, a chief that is preventing the finding out of whether an innocent man has had his reputation besmirched or whether a person has been victimized in the most violent disgusting manner,"" Fitzpatrick said. Attempts to reach Fowler were not returned, but Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner defended the police department's actions. In a statement, Miner criticized the DA for ""grandstanding"" and said, ""It is deeply unfortunate for the people of this community, the accused and the accusers that the district attorney has chosen a different tactic, resorting to personal and professional attacks."" ""Chief Fowler, Deputy Chief Broton and the Syracuse Police Department have conducted themselves with complete professionalism and integrity throughout this process. We are focused on trying to find the truth in this highly charged environment."" Syracuse placed Bernie Fine on administrative leave last week after the accusations surfaced. The case has been adjourned by New York State Supreme Court Judge James Murphy until next Tuesday, according to Barry Weiss from the district attorney's office. CNN's Tom Watkins and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","District attorney accuses police chief of leaking affidavit to the media .

"(CNN) -- Two sailors from a ship that capsized in the Irish Sea in gale-forced winds were rescued ""in reasonable condition"" Sunday while five remained missing, the British coast guard said. The body of an eighth sailor was recovered, the coast guard said. After a daylong search in rough seas, the British coast guard ended the effort to find the five missing men as darkness fell, according to a coast guard press officer. ""Today at roughly 16:45 GMT (11:45 a.m. ET), a decision was made by the coast guard to call off the search and rescue mission for the five remaining missing sailors in the Irish Sea,"" press officer Jo Groenenberg told CNN. A Ministry of Defence spokesman earlier confirmed to CNN that Prince William was the co-pilot of the helicopter that plucked the two rescued sailors from a life raft. The crew of the Swanland sent out a mayday call about 2 a.m. local time, saying the ship was caught in strong winds and had a cracked hull, the coast guard's press office said. A few ships responded, but the Swanland had capsized by the time they got there, the office said. The coast guard dispatched two helicopters, including one from RAF Valley base, where Prince William is a search-and-rescue pilot. The helicopter pulled two men from the water. A coast guard spokesman later said the two -- who included the ship's second officer -- were in ""reasonable condition"" after the helicopter had carried them to the military base.","The British coast guard calls off a search for five missing sailors .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Streets in Egypt's capital remained tense Sunday a day ahead of elections. As protesters packed Cairo's Tahrir Square, the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces issued warning of ""dire consequences"" if the nation's political crisis continues, state-run Al-Masriya TV reported. Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi said parliamentary elections would go ahead as planned Monday, and that he would not allow the military ""to be pressured by any individual or entity,"" state media reported. Meanwhile, a member of an alliance of demonstrators told Al-Masriya that a new proposed government would be announced later Sunday after meetings with Mohammed ElBaradei, a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize winner who is frontrunner for Egypt's presidency. ""We will ask the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to form a new government. We don't want to take the country into the unknown but (the council) must listen to our demands and our call to form a new government and cede power to a civilian transitional council,"" Mohammed Mamdouh, a member of the alliance of revolutionaries in Tahrir, told Al-Masriya. Newly-appointed Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri was appointed last week by Egypt's military rulers after former Prime Minister Essam Sharaf and his government quit en masse. Ganzouri, who served as prime minister under President Hosni Mubarak, said he had asked for time to form a cabinet ""that will be accepted by everyone."" He told reporters last week that a new government could not be formed before Monday's parliamentary elections. Ganzouri, who was Egypt's prime minister from 1996 to 1999, is to remain as prime minister until at least January 10, when results of the parliamentary elections are finalized, said Aly Hassan, a judicial consultant. After that, Parliament would have to back Ganzouri for him to retain the position. Mamdouh said Sunday Ganzouri was the wrong man to lead the nation. ""Gazouri's government was born dead, and he doesn't have any legitimacy on the Egyptian street,"" he told Al-Masriya. At least 42 people have been killed in recent demonstrations in Egypt, including at least 33 in Cairo. An additional 3,250 have been wounded, the Ministry of Health's Dr. Hisham Shiha said. He said many of the casualties had been shot by ""live ammunition, rubber bullets and birdshot."" Egypt's military leaders apologized Thursday for the deaths of protesters, vowing to prosecute offenders and pay the medical bills of the wounded. The violence came as the country remains divided over the ruling military body and news that Ganzouri had regained his old role. The high military council decided Friday to extend voting to two days for each stage of the parliamentary elections, scheduled to begin Monday, according to state-run Egypt TV. Ballot boxes will be locked at 7 p.m. Monday and new boxes will be used on Tuesday, Ahmed Al Zind, head of Judicial Club, told reporters Saturday. ""The ballot box for the judge is like a part of his body,"" Al Zind said. ""Even though police and army will secure ballots, the judge is responsible. "" In all, 4,765 judges will monitor the three rounds of elections and report any violations to the Higher Committee of the Election Commission, he said. The elections will also be observed by a delegation from the International Republican Institute as well as a U.S. congressional delegation ""to identify and evaluate strengths and weaknesses in Egypt's election system, including campaign regulations, the balloting process, vote tabulation and reporting,"" the institute said Friday. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","The head of Egypt's military warns of ""dire consequences"" if a political crisis continues .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- In an industry dominated by men, leave it to women to come up with the winning idea in a contest to create a concept for a video game about losing one's virginity. Two women won a contest this week to create a concept for a video game about losing one's virginity. On Wednesday, at the Game Developers Conference here, the two-woman team of Heather Kelley and Erin Robinson won the Game Design Challenge with just 36 hours of preparation, while their competitors had weeks to come up with concepts for a game about ""your first time."" This was the sixth straight year of the design challenge, hosted annually by New York-based game developer Eric Zimmerman. The contestants are generally top-tier game designers like two-time winner and Spore and The Sims creator Will Wright, Deus Ex lead designer Harvey Smith, or 2008 winner and Leather Goddesses of Phobos creator Steve Meretzsky. The contestants are generally given several weeks to come up with a concept for a game based on some sort of unusual challenge posed by Zimmerman. Past themes have included a game about love, a game based on the poetry of Emily Dickinson, and a game that could win the Nobel Peace Prize. ""We are in a medium that is just incredibly plastic,"" Zimmerman said. ""We can put anything up on the screen...Still, we find every year that most of the money being put into games is put into a relatively narrow (set of) genres"" that tends to include monsters, dragons, and the like. Zimmerman added that the purpose of the challenge is ""to think about how we can create games that really break away"" from what's been done so many times before. Sex and autobiography have been constant themes in literature, film, and theater, Zimmerman argued, pointing to ""Lolita,"" the work of Henry Miller, Chaim Potok's novel, ""My name is Asher Lev,"" and the films of Fellini and Woody Allen. But while Zimmerman touted the widespread historical acceptance of the theme of autobiographical sex, he noted with some dismay that veteran game designer Kim Swift, who works for Valve and who created the award-winning Portal, had originally been slated to be among the contestants but had eventually been pressured by Valve to withdraw due to the theme. ""I'm saying this as a fan of Valve,"" Zimmerman said, ""but I do find it frustrating and disturbing that Kim would be pulled from the panel."" Still, he said, after word got around about Swift's withdrawal, Lapis designer Kelley and independent developer Robinson volunteered to step up and compete. The two ended up facing off against Meretzsky, on hand to defend his crown, and Habbo Hotel lead designer Sulka Haro. And in the end, while all three submissions were well-received, the duo of Kelley and Robinson were judged by the audience to have very closely beaten out Meretzsky. The two women came up with a concept for ""Our first times,"" and presented it as a two-level game, one level for Kelley's experience and the other for Robinson's. They imagined a series of mini games that could be played on Nintendo's Wii, or possibly on Apple's iPhone. Kelley began by explaining that her game would commence with the player having to pick an outfit for a date that was intended to conclude with their deflowering. It would have to be the least complicated outfit possible, she said, nothing with zippers that get stuck, or too many buttons or ties. Then, there would be a mini game in which players would have to shave their legs, making especially sure not to miss the all-important spot ""by the knees."" Next up, dinner, and making sure to remove all the garlic from the meals, something the main character--clearly a female, since the game was presented from a woman's perspective--would have to do because of the general cluelessness of the boyfriend in question. The next mini game would revolve around choosing the proper mood music from a selection of LPs--yes, records, since the game would be set in the timeframe of Kelley's first time. And clearly, she said, Miles Davis would have to be the choice. The penultimate mini game would task the player with ""not falling off the top bunk"" in a college dorm room,"" while the final task would involve flicking off the smirking roommate. The Robinson level also involved a series of mini games that commenced with ""driving home from ultimate-Frisbee practice"" and setting the radio station in a car--perhaps using the Wiimote dial, she said--to anything except country music. Next would be a stop at a drug store to buy a brand of condoms that doesn't terrify you, and then going ""back to his place,"" and grappling with adjusting the tracking on his ""antiquated"" VCR. Being a game concept presented from the woman's perspective, the next mini game would revolve around ""making the first move. Poor guy."" And then, afterward, calling the best friend to tell the tale. ""But you have to be careful,"" Robinson said, ""because she's next to mom and grandma on the speed dial."" Perhaps given their short notice, the mini-game concepts created by Kelley and Robinson weren't very fleshed out, something that was a shame since they seemed to be onto something. But the crowd appreciated how much effort they had put into the storyboards they'd created, and forgave the rudimentary fleshing out of the details. Meretzsky's concept--which came in a very close second--ended up revolving around the idea of moving beyond the awkwardness of fumbling high school attempts at romance. But before explaining his final design, he talked at length about the challenges of coming up with a game idea when every possible title was too overtly sexual. He said he tried out ""Where's dildo,"" but discarded it because ""it had nothing to do with my autobiography."" And then, he thought ""about the almost too obvious genre of first-person shooters."" He also threw away ""Call of Booty""--because it would have ""problems that would keep it off the shelf at Wal-Mart""--and then almost settled on a beat-matching idea called ""Hump Hump Revolution."" And, playing off the title of Swift's hit game, as well as a popular 2008 film, he said he nearly ended up with ""Zack & Miri make a Portal,"" but ""my business people tell me paying licenses for two different (intellectual properties) is a non-starter."" In the end, he said, he came up with a three-act structure for a game based in the virtual world, Second Life, where act one involves the awkward era of high school, the second act is the more promising college years and finally, act three, happiness in the form of a series of vignettes including dates, a wedding, and then, home life. The game, he said, would be called, ""Wait, time passes."" ""No matter how picked on you are,"" Meretzsky said, ""this too shall pass. Your time will come, and you will find happiness and your place in the world."" Of the six Game Design Challenges, this year's felt the most wanting for detail and working game mechanics. That may have been because the contestants' task of building something autobiographical didn't meld well with game design. Still, the crowd, which was heavy with game designers, appreciated the efforts and shouted out their support for all three contestants. After all, in the end, the point was to take a particularly challenging game design topic and create something that could plausibly be a working title. And who would know better the difficulties of doing so than a room full of game designers? © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Several hundred protesters were gathered in the center of Tunisia's capital Sunday as riot police stood guard. Members of the Army and military vehicles were also deployed on the main street outside the country's interior ministry. After police fired occasional tear gas canisters into the crowd, groups of young protesters fled and then returned. Some younger protesters threw stones at police, but older men gathered among the group urged them to calm down. On Saturday authorities imposed an overnight curfew in the capital and surrounding areas following a weekend of protests against the interim government and security forces, state media reported. The latest protests come amid growing concerns among Tunisians that their demands for democratic rule are not being met. Protesters are calling for the continuation of the democratization process, fundamental reforms, and a return to the ideals of the Tunisian revolution. On Saturday protesters called for the resignation of the interior minister as they chanted, ""The people call for a new revolution"" and ""No fear or terror, power belongs to the people,"" Agence Tunis Afrique Presse reported. Authorities said the curfew, which will run nightly from 9 p.m to 5 a.m., will prevent looting and protect citizens, the government said. Protests in Arab countries started in Tunisia when an unemployed college graduate set himself on fire after police confiscated his fruit cart and cutting off his source of income. The act sparked massive demonstrations over high unemployment, government corruption and political repression, and led autocratic President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to leave the country in January. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: Police fire occasional tear gas canisters into the crowd, protesters throw stones .

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for the family of Robert Champion, a Florida university drum major who died this month in what officials have called a hazing-related death, said Monday he will sue the school. ""We are intending to file a lawsuit to get answers"" about hazing at Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University, lawyer Chris Chestnut told reporters. ""We are concerned about the culture of cover-up, that hazing has been covered up at the Band FAMU for generations. So, it's time now that we expose the truth, eradicate this culture and come up with creative remedies on how to continue the excellence of FAMU's band, but without hazing."" Chestnut said he was not at liberty to discuss the facts of the case and noted that the medical examiner has not issued a report on the cause of death of the 26-year-old musician. But, he added, the facts that have emerged to date ""point to the fact that hazing was a cause of Robert Champion's death, and it was under FAMU's watch."" He said he could not address the scope of the lawsuit but added, ""I can tell you that FAMU will be named in it."" Chestnut described hazing at the school as a don't ask, don't tell culture. ""The family's message today is: Please, tell."" Because FAMU is a state institution, it is protected by sovereign immunity, which means that Chestnut must file a notice of intention to sue as a prerequisite to the suit, the lawyer said. ""After a six-month window, we will file a lawsuit,"" he added. ""He loved the band -- so much, I always called him Mr. Band,"" Champion's mother, Pam Champion, told reporters of her son. ""That was his life."" She added that she was in suburban Atlanta, where the family lives, when a phone call informed her of her son's death. The call came shortly after her son had called to say he was coming home for Thanksgiving. ""I thought it was some kind of mean joke. ... Maybe it's the wrong kid, maybe it's somebody else."" ""They had no idea of anticipating that he'd be coming to Willie Watkins' Funeral Home when he came back to Atlanta,"" Chestnut said. ""That's not what you send your kid to college for."" ""It needs to stop,"" Pam Champion said. ""No one wants to hear on a phone call that your son collapsed and died."" Champion became ill at an Orlando hotel after a game on November 20. He reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe, authorities said. Champion was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told CNN last week that hazing was involved but added that authorities were trying to determine an official cause of death. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. After the death, FAMU President James H. Ammons suspended all band performances and said he will convene a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100."" In addition, FAMU moved to fire longtime band director Julian E. White. White had led the 420-member band since 1998 and has hired an attorney to fight for his job. ""We believe that he was not treated with the respect that was due,"" Tallahassee attorney Chuck Hobbs said. He described as ""ludicrous"" the university's assertion that White did not do what he could do to address hazing. White, who said he will speak Wednesday at Champion's funeral, said he had told the victim's parents about their son's death. ""That was extremely difficult for me,"" he said. ""I wish that this could have been avoided. I took the necessary steps that this tragedy could have been avoided."" He said he had ordered the suspension of 26 band members two weeks before Champion's death. ""I thought that that would really be the end of these kinds of things,"" he said, adding that his move brought criticism from some band members and parents who asked him whether the band would be able to perform adequately without 19 trombone players and others. ""My comment was: 'It doesn't matter,' "" he said. ""I am not going to sacrifice the performance for the principle."" White added that he wished the administration had suspended from the school the students allegedly involved in hazing. ""If some strong actions had been taken, then Robert Champion may well be alive now, and we may not be having this gathering,"" he said. White added that he sent memoranda in 1989 and in the 2000s about hazing's presence on campus, not just among band members. ""It's no secret,"" he said. ""It's just a culture -- as much as I regret it -- that kids nowadays engage in."" Every year, he offers hazing workshops, and anytime a band member has been suspended for hazing, White sends a note to the school president, the vice president of student affairs, the chief of police and the band staff. ""I probably have more than 100,"" he said. ""I don't know how many."" He added, ""I feel very comfortable that I did everything that I could to eradicate hazing. I coined the phrase, 'Zero tolerance for hazing in the Florida A&M U band.' "" Asked whether he believes he is being made a scapegoat, White said, ""Yes, I do."" He said he had tried his best to make the administration aware of the problems. ""How would I be negligent in reporting the activities when I did report them?"" he asked. David Frank, a Tallahassee lawyer who represented another hazing victim, said it was not clear whether it was White or others who were at fault. ""He's a legend over there,"" he said. ""He walks in a room, people listen. Maybe he did. Maybe it's the rest of the system over there that fell apart."" Frank filed a suit against the school on behalf of a band trumpeter, Marcus W. Parker, who was beaten in 2001. Frank won the case for undisclosed damages (FAMU's sovereign immunity caps its liability for a negligence action at $100,000) and won another case against those who beat his client for $1.8 million, he told CNN in a telephone interview. Frank described the hazing as part of a deep tradition with the band, where each section acts like a fraternity. ""The trumpet section was the Screaming Eagles,"" Frank said. ""The school says you don't have to be a member of this fraternity. That's just horse s***. You couldn't survive as a trumpeter if you were not a member of the Screaming Eagles."" The beatings meted out were carried out with paddles, but that doesn't fully describe what happens, he said. ""Paddling is just the wrong word for it. It's vicious beating. I think one guy got hit over 100 times. And this is a solid, wood paddle. This isn't some Wiffle bat. This is something that would kill you."" In Parker's case, he was hit 30 times in his buttocks -- ""so hard they put him into renal failure,"" Frank said. ""His kidneys stopped working and he had to go into the emergency room. He almost died."" Parker spent at least five days in critical condition, endured several surgeries and quit school, the lawyer said. The former student is now living in Jacksonville, where he is in poor physical condition, has never fully recovered and is struggling, Frank said. ""It ruins their life,"" he added. ""You don't have to be beat to within an inch of your life to play a trumpet. That's nonsense, and they know it, and this tradition is just way off base."" A spokeswoman for the school did not return a call seeking comment. On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott sent a letter to Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey asking the department to join the investigation ""to assure that the circumstances leading to Mr. Champion's death become fully known, and that if there are individuals directly or indirectly responsible for this death, they are appropriately brought to justice and held accountable."" Ammons has acknowledged that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing.","""That was his life,"" mother says of the victim's band work .

"Glendora, California (CNN)  -- It's the kind of Southern California town made for daydreaming: Quiet streets and sunny skies, a place where tranquility seems rarely to be disturbed. But according to police, as well as classified U.S. diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks, the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora was the scene of an international assassination plot. The scheme involved would-be killers hiding out in a low-budget motel and an elaborate plan that, at first, involved shooting the victim, but later centered on running him over with a van, police documents disclose. ""I've been a police officer here for more than 20 years, and I've never investigated anything like this,"" said Glendora police Lt. Tim Staab. It all unraveled on a late summer day in 2009, when a would-be hit man hired by an Iranian national named Reza Sadeghnia got cold feet and called police from a local gas station. ""This person went on to tell us that for the past four days, they together had been scheming how to assassinate, how to kill another Glendora resident,"" Staab said. Police said the target in Glendora was Jamshid Sharmahd, an Iranian-American dissident who is the radio voice of a small group called Tondar, devoted to the overthrow of the Iranian government. The Iranian government calls Tondar a terrorist group, but the U.S. State Department says it is only a propaganda outlet. According to police reports, the informant offered proof: the purchase of a cheap van from a used-car dealer that would be used to run down and kill the target. He told detectives he had been paid $5,000 to kill Sharmahd, with another $27,000 delivered to his mother back in Iran. The plotters decided to use a van after deciding that buying a gun would be too risky, the reports state. The informant told police that Sadeghnia, the mastermind, had fled Glendora and was about to leave Los Angeles on a plane. Staab said Glendora detectives found him in an airport hotel under his own name and arrested him in his room. Along with his laptop computer, police seized $2,100 in cash. ""They were crisp $100 bills. There was a stack of them. And around it was a bank wrapping, and they were all written in Farsi,"" he said. According to those leaked American diplomatic cables, this wasn't the first time Sadeghnia had been implicated in an assassination attempt. A prominent Iranian dissident in London, Ali Reza Nourizadeh, ""had been targeted by Iranian intelligence,"" according to one cable. Nourizadeh is a prominent Voice of America commentator based in London, and Sadeghnia had contacted him several months before his California arrest, claiming to be a ""big fan,"" the January 2010 account states. But Nourizadeh became suspicious of Sadeghnia after he took large numbers of pictures -- photos that later turned up in the office of a deputy intelligence minister in Tehran, the cable states. He stopped taking Sadeghnia's calls ""and heard nothing more about the matter until he was visited by UK anti-terror police January 14,"" according to the cable. According to the cable, Sadeghnia had tracked the London dissident at the same time he was making plans to assassinate the California dissident. The arrest by Glendora police brought a halt to both plans. ""Nourizadeh is a well-known figure both inside and outside Iran, and is an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime, so it is unsurprising that the regime would want to keep a close eye on him,"" the document states. ""If, however, the regime has targeted Nourizadeh for assassination, as it appears to have done with Sharmahd, it marks a clear escalation in the regime's attempts to intimidate critics outside its borders, and could have a chilling effect on journalists, academics and others in the West who until recently felt little physical threat from the regime."" Sharmahd said there was ""no doubt"" that the plot against him involved the Iranian government. He said the motive was not only to kill him, but also to replace both Tondar's website and its radio broadcasts with fakes in an attempt to hijack the movement. Sadeghnia ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of solicitation of murder and was jailed for eight months. But the story doesn't end there. After he was released from prison in 2010, Sadeghnia applied for permission to leave the United States while he was on five years' probation and visit Iran for one month ""to visit his dying father,"" according to probation reports. His first application was denied, but a second request was granted a few weeks later on the condition that he return no later than October 27. He has not been seen in the United States since. Probation officials would not comment on the decision. Meanwhile, another Iranian-American -- a 71-year-old California businessman named Reza Taghavi -- was being held in an Iranian prison. He had been jailed for more than two years after Iranian authorities said he had given $200 to an Iranian dissident group: Tondar, the same group based in Glendora. Taghavi denied any association with Tondar. The money, he said, was to be given to a friend of a friend. Within weeks of Sadeghnia's arrival in Iran, Taghavi walked out of Evin Prison. Taghavi said he believes there was ""no connection"" between his release and Sadeghnia's arrival. His attorney, a former Bush administration ambassador, Pierre Prosper, said he doesn't think there's a link, either. ""But it's an interesting coincidence, isn't it?"" Prosper said in a telephone interview. The State Department told CNN that there was no link between Sadeghnia's return to Iran and Taghavi's release. But back in Glendora, Sharmahd said there's no doubt in his mind that there was a swap in which the United States traded the man who orchestrated his attempted murder to Iran in exchange for the jailed businessman. ""You give my man back. I give you your man back,"" he said. Watch Parker Spitzer weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Asbai Ramirez had toiled for months as a U.S. soldier in Iraq. But it was his 7,000-mile trip home -- racing against the clock to his wife's bedside, for the birth of their baby -- that he described Monday as ""pretty intense."" The Army specialist told HLN's Vinnie Politan that the tight timetable and sheer distance led him to believe that his chances were slim of joining wife Ashleigh Ramirez in Fort Polk, Louisiana, before their child was born. ""I didn't really have much hope about making it back,"" Ramirez said. First, there was the matter of leaving Iraq. Ramirez said Monday that his unit commanders ""sent me back as soon as they could."" On the baby's due date, he was finally back in the United States -- but not with his wife. Instead, he was in Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where he had to take a few mandatory classes. But the baby was still holding out. On Thanksgiving morning, Ramirez said he boarded a flight to Alexandria, Louisiana, then quickly hopped on the road -- still about one hour, 15 minutes from the base in the western part of the state. ""I got into a car and pretty much flew down there,"" Ramirez said from Fort Polk. ""I made it just in the nick of time."" Specifically, the soldier said he burst into the hospital room about 30 minutes before his son, Jason, made his own grand appearance. Ramirez said that, throughout the process, he'd been in regular contact with Ashleigh. But talking online and by phone didn't compare to being with his growing family in person, especially with baby Jason in his arms. ""He's doing fantastic,"" the soldier said of his son. ""I couldn't ask for a better gift than to have him healthy and here with me.""","Spc. Asbai Ramirez was in Iraq during much of his wife's pregnancy .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- For nearly 30 years, one man dominated Egypt. Hosni Mubarak, 82, survived would-be assassins and ill health, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement, and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed. His government's continued observance of the Camp David accords was the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. But following the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman, demonstrators in the streets of Cairo stood up to riot police, chanting, ""Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you."" Ultimately, the demonstrations helped bring down the man critics called Egypt's last pharaoh. Mubarak decided Friday to step down, Vice President Omar Suleiman said on state television. Now that Mubarak is finally exiting the political stage, the debate over his legacy is growing louder. Longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak purchased for nearly three decades came at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world's most populous nation. ""Egypt is a broken country,"" Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN. ""It used to be the jewel of the Middle East. It's the capital of its cultural production."" But now, Gerges said, ""Egyptians have no outlets. They don't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future."" Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt's air force during the 1973 Mideast war. The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero, and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975. Six years later, Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade, killed by Islamic militants from within the army's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel. Upon assuming office, one of Mubarak's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely. He made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades. The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986, and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists. ""He pretty much wiped them out,"" University of Michigan Professor of History Juan Cole said. ""It's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt."" The government penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that ""if five people (sat) down to plot something, the fifth person (wrote) a report to Hosni Mubarak about it,"" he said. The result was ""a regime that has very little legitimacy, but presents itself as something there's no point in trying to change,"" said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power, changed the thinking of many in the region. ""I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,"" he said. Mubarak headed off a similar movement in 2005, when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform. He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests, Brown said. But the most recent protest movement had ""no real leadership, so it (couldn't) be decapitated the same way,"" Brown noted. Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities. His fifth, in 2005, was Egypt's first multi-party presidential vote, but it was widely criticized as a ""sham,"" Cole said. Meanwhile, the country's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of Mubarak's rule. Development picked up in the last decade, fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars, but gains were ""very unevenly distributed,"" Gerges said. About 40% of Egyptians currently live in poverty, he noted. The aging autocrat escaped at least two assassination attempts, including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia. In recent years, Mubarak had several bouts of illness but never picked a vice president. He was widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor, but later insisted he never intended for his son to take power. In 2003, Mubarak collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu. He had back surgery in Germany in 2004, returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. He largely withdrew from public view in recent years. His domestic political situation was closely watched overseas, particularly in the United States. In the past decade, Egypt has been a major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. It receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year -- second only to Israel -- and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and while sticking with Camp David, Egypt's ties with Israel amount to a ""cold peace,"" Cole said. President Barack Obama said recently that Mubarak was ""very helpful on a range of tough issues,"" but prodded the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform. ""You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets,"" Obama said. He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the recent demonstrations, adding, ""I think it's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances."" Gerges said the Middle East has seen ""the barrier of fear"" removed since the events in Tunisia. ""Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus"" in Egypt and elsewhere, he said. ""We're going to have a new era of politics.""","Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years, surviving would-be assassins, ill health .

"Washington (CNN) -- In an effort to confront the growing problem of global counterfeiting of U.S. consumer goods, the government Tuesday launched a campaign designed to grab the public's attention. A series of catchy and dramatic TV and radio public service announcements and print ads were unveiled at a White House event headed by Attorney General Eric Holder and several other administration officials. The officials stressed the negative impact the sale of tons of counterfeit goods is having on the U.S. economy. The majority of the ""knockoff"" products originate in China, officials said. The low prices available from the online crime groups are hard for consumers to resist. ""The lure of the bargain overcomes the moral compass every time,"" said Ann Harkins, president and CEO of the National Crime Prevention Council. Officials said research shows the American public believes intellectual property theft is a harmless, victimless practice. ""Make no mistake, IP crimes are anything but victimless,"" Holder said. ""... these crimes can destroy jobs, suppress innovation, and jeopardize the health and safety of consumers."" Officials emphasized the personal danger from buying cheaper fake medicines and pills online. They also focused on the cost to artists, musicians, and others who are victims of knockoff DVDs and free downloads. That message was effectively driven home by a single performer. In a dramatic new PSA unveiled Tuesday, a young female street musician sings and plays her guitar, and watches dumbfounded as members of her audience start taking money rather than putting it in her open guitar case. The announcer then declares ""illegal downloads are not victimless crimes."" The singer-songwriter Addie Braunley was on hand for the event.","Series of catchy ads and PSAs focus on victims of intellectual property crimes .

"(CNN) -- Former NFL star Lawrence Taylor, who pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct with a teenager last year, was sued by the victim in federal court in New York on Monday. The lawsuit ""may be the first civil lawsuit of its kind on behalf of a child victim of sex trafficking against a buyer of a commercial sex act with that child,"" the victim's attorney, Gloria Allred, said at a news conference. ""I feel as though [Taylor] should be accountable for his crimes and misconduct toward me"" said Cristina Fierro, who was 16 when the episode occurred and who went unnamed during the criminal phase of Taylor's case. Now 18, she went public with her story earlier this year. In addition to seeking damages from Taylor, Fierro alleges in the lawsuit that Taylor assaulted and battered her. Allred did not offer details about the alleged assault, saying those would be revealed in the discovery phase of the lawsuit. Taylor was arrested at a Holiday Inn in New York in May 2010 after having ""improper sexual conduct involving an underage girl in a Rockland County hotel,"" the district attorney's office said at the time. Prosecutors said Taylor paid Fierro, who has repeatedly denied allegations that she was a prostitute, $300 for ""sexual acts."" The former Giants linebacker pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges stemming from the incident, one count of sexual misconduct and one count of patronizing a prostitute in the third degree. Taylor, who has said he was unaware that Fierro was underage when he had sex with her, was sentenced to six years' probation in March and assessed a $2,000 fine. A month later, a judge designated him a Level 1 sex offender, a low-level classification. In a statement, Taylor's lawyer chalked up the new lawsuit to a hunger for publicity. ""It's a shame that, once again, Gloria Allred's intoxication with media coverage for her cases has blurred her vision to uphold the highest level of ethical and moral standards to which attorneys are supposed to adhere,"" Arthur Aidala said. At the news conference Monday, Fierro said she was dissatisfied with the plea deal Taylor struck with prosecutors last spring. ""I feel as though he should have gone to jail to think about what he has done to me,"" she said. The lawsuit seeks ""compensatory and punitive damages"" from Taylor, Allred said, but she declined to specify a dollar amount. A note in the lawsuit states that ""the matter in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000."" The suit does not seek damages from Rasheed Davis, who arranged the liaison between Taylor and Fierro and gave her a black eye when she initially refused to go along with it. In August, a federal judge sentenced Davis to seven years in prison for sex trafficking. When asked whether Fierro is suing Taylor rather than Davis because Taylor is a multimillionaire, Allred said the suit was filed against only Taylor ""because this is the person we have decided to sue, the buyer."" Fierro's attorneys brought the suit under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, or TVPA, which historically has been used to target pimps rather than johns, Allred said. Suing johns under the TVPA is highly unusual, but suing pimps under the law is uncommon as well, according to Bridgette Carr, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School. Going after Taylor in the lawsuit might deter would-be buyers of sex from minors from going through with the act, according to Allred. ""Suing the buyer can have an impact on the demand for commercial sex of children,"" Allred said.","Cristina Fierro was 16 when the former NFL star was accused of sexual misconduct .

"(CNN) -- Italian police on Monday found an explosive package at the Greek Embassy in Rome, the second time in as many weeks that embassies there have received explosives through the mail. The parcel did not explode, and authorities hope that it will provide information that will help in their investigation. Police also responded to other reports of suspicious packages at the Venezuelan and Danish embassies in Rome and possibly other embassies as well on Monday. But only the Greek embassy package contained an explosive, according to Francesco Tagliente, the chief of police in Rome. ""The alarm system has worked,"" Tagliente said. ""Since this morning, all the embassies that had a suspected package alerted the police in enough time to determine whether the packages were dangerous and prevent any injuries."" Late last week, an anarchist group claimed credit for a pair of mail bombings Thursday at embassies in Rome, vowing in messages that it plans more such acts to ""destroy the systems of domination,"" the state-run ANSA news agency reported. Police said that the Informal Federation of Anarchists -- an offshoot of the Italian Anarchist Federation, or FAI -- claimed responsibility for attacks at the Swiss and Chilean embassies. Tagliente said that Monday's packages, which included a note from the FAI, were ""certainly related"" to the ones last week. Computer-written notes were sent in small boxes along with the earlier package bombs, according to ANSA. The messages read: ""We have decided to make our voices heard again, in words and deeds. We will destroy the system of domination. Long live FAI. Long live anarchy."" The notes also referenced Lambros Fountas, who was shot dead last March while protesting in Athens. The 35-year-old has since become a martyr for the international anarchist movement, particularly groups in Greece, Italy and Spain. Formed in 1945, Italian Anarchist Federation had seen a ""a slow but constant increase"" of supporters in recent years, said the website of an umbrella group, L'International des Federations Anarchistes. The Italian organization aims for ""radical change"" in support of ""oppressed and exploited peoples,"" doing so with opposition to political powers and even the Catholic Church, the website said. There was no warning before a Swiss-born, 53-year-old mailroom worker was seriously hurt by an explosion while opening a package at the Swiss Embassy, according to police and the Swiss Foreign Ministry in Bern. One person was taken to a hospital when the second bomb exploded shortly afterward at the Chilean Embassy, police said. Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattin called the attacks ""a serious threat against foreign embassies in Rome."" He said that authorities were checking all embassies in Rome and Italian embassies aboard for suspicious packages. ""We should avoid being alarmist,"" Frattin said. Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said the incident is similar to a wave of letter bombs sent last month by an anarchist group based in Greece and claimed the bombs came from there. But Greek officials disputed the notion that anyone in their country was involved in the blasts. ""There is no evidence that the bombs originated in Greece,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. In addition to the Swiss and Chilean blasts, a ""suspicious package"" was found at the Ukrainian Embassy in the Italian capital, police said, but it turned out not to be dangerous. There were also false alarms at the Slovenian and Estonian embassies. In November, police discovered 14 parcel bombs emanating from Greece, most of which were sent to various embassies in Athens. Police intercepted and destroyed most of them in controlled explosions, but a woman at a courier office was wounded by one of the devices and another device exploded in the courtyard of the Swiss Embassy. Two men accused of participating in the bombings were remanded into custody after they were arrested in Athens in possession of two parcel bombs, Glock pistols, a bulletproof vest and a wig. Panagiotis Argyrou, 22, and Gerasimos Tsakalos, 24, were also in possession of a delivery slip for another parcel containing an explosive device that had been delivered to a courier service and was addressed to the Dutch Embassy, police said. Hellenic Police spokesman Maj. Athanasios Kokkalakis called the two suspects ""important members of a terrorist group."" Before the attacks, Argyrou already faced an arrest warrant alleging his membership in an illegal organization called the Conspiracy of Cells of Fire. Greek authorities stressed that they believed the wave of letter bombs in November was the work of a home-grown Greek terrorist group that does not have ties to international organizations like al Qaeda.

"ROCKVILLE, Maryland (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced it is blocking the import from China of five species of seafood until their importers can prove they are not contaminated. About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the U.S. comes from China, according to the National Fisheries Institute. ""FDA is initiating an import alert against several species of imported Chinese farmed seafood because of numerous cases of contamination with drugs and unsafe food additives,"" said Dr. David Acheson, the agency's assistant commissioner for food protection, in a conference call with reporters. The species cited are catfish, eel, shrimp, basa and dace, he said. Basa is similar to catfish; dace is similar to carp. The medications cited include the antimicrobials nitrofuran, malachite green, gentian violet and fluoroquinolones. Nitrofuran, malachite green, and gentian violet have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Use of fluoroquinolones in food-producing animals can result in antibiotic resistance. None of them is approved for use in farmed seafood in the United States and some of them have been shown to cause cancer when fed to laboratory animals for ""prolonged periods of time,"" Acheson said. Alerts have been issued in the past, but Thursday's announcement is the largest. The food will not be allowed into the United States until the importer can prove it is free from harmful contaminants, Acheson said. He said the agency decided to broaden its previous alerts for products from individual companies to a countrywide alert after tests showed that 15 percent of those species of seafood produced by 18 companies in China contained traces of one or more of the contaminants. ""FDA is taking this action to protect the public health of the American people,"" he said. Watch more on the FDA's import alert on five kinds of fish from China. » . The products ""could cause serious health problems if consumed over a long period of time,"" he said. Still, Acheson added, the low levels of contaminants means that there is ""no imminent threat"" to the public health. China is the world's largest producer of farmed fish, accounting for 70 percent of the total produced, he said. It is the third-largest exporter of farmed fish to the United States. The action is an import alert, which means that these products from Chinese processors ""will be detained and refused entry into the United States until the importer can demonstrate that the product is safe and in compliance with applicable regulations,"" said Margaret O' K. Glavin, FDA's associate commissioner for regulatory affairs. Last year, the FDA slapped a countrywide alert on all Chinese eel after tests showed residues of an antimicrobial agent, she said. Since then, and ""despite extensive communications between FDA and appropriate Chinese authorities to correct the problem, we have continued to find residues of certain veterinary drugs or food additives that are not permitted for use in the United States,"" she added. Glavin said the FDA inspects 5 percent of seafood from China. The first alert on Chinese seafood occurred before 2001, she said. ""We're not asking for this product to be withdrawn from the market or for people to take this out of their freezers and throw it away,"" Acheson said. ""This is a long-term health concern; it is not an acute health concern."" China is not the sole offender, Glavin said. Import alerts have been ordered for firms in the Philippines, Mexico ""and several others,"" though this is the first countrywide import alert, she said. More than 80 percent of shrimp eaten in the United States is imported, including 7 percent from China, according to the National Fisheries Institute. About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the United States comes from China, the seafood industry advocacy group said. Last year, the United States imported 590,299 metric tons of shrimp from abroad; 68,150 metric tons of which came from China, according to the Department of Commerce. The United States imported $1.2 billion of fish from China in 2004, according to H. M. Johson & Associates, a seafood industry research group.

"(CNN) -- High in the Peruvian Andes, where it's so dry and cold that very little vegetation grows, life depends on one animal: the alpaca. But in recent years, raising alpacas has become a greater challenge. Mountains that used to be covered with ice around the town of Licapa, elevation of 4,200 meters (about 13,780 feet) above sea level, are now barren. Salomon Parco, a 30-year-old Alpaca shepherd who lives in Licapa, says that no ice means no water; and no water means no grass to feed the animals. Parco also says the ice has all but disappeared in the last three decades. ""The difference is that when I was a little boy, the mountaintops were white with snow and ice. But as you can see, they now look black. That's the difference,"" he says. Read more coverage of the Road to Durban . A stranger recently arrived in Licapa bringing hope. Eduardo Gold, an engineer and self-described inventor, is the founder of Peru Glaciers. The organization's goal is to bring the ice back to the mountains. ""This community is closely tied to the glaciers,"" he says. ""As soon as they disappear, their livelihood disappears for them as well."" Along with Gold and his crew of five locals, photographer Jose Armijo and I travel to the top of the mountains. The lack of oxygen makes the hike challenging. At an elevation of 5,000 meters (about 16,400 feet), we see firsthand what's happening to the glaciers. This is where Gold and his crew are working on the project to bring the glaciers back. Gold's idea is very simple: If dark mountains absorb more heat from the sun, white mountains will have the opposite effect. The solution is to make them white. Under Gold's direction, the crew of five goes around the mountain, splashing a mixture that turns the rocks white. It's not paint, but a combination of water, sand and lime. Two percent of the mixture is soap, which makes it stick to the rocks and stay waterproof once it dries. An infrared thermometer shows a difference of 30 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius) in temperature between the dark rocks and the previously whitened ones. Gold acknowledges there is a lot of work to go before he can prove his theory works. ""This is an experiment. It may or may not work. Or it may work a little. Doing something about it is better than nothing at all,"" he says. And it seems to be working. Gold shows us a crevice between the rocks where he finds some ice. The locals say there was no ice at all before. ""We had very little water. The difference this year since we have whitened the mountain is that there's water. As you can see down there, there's a well with plenty of water, and down the hill we have even more,"" says Parco, the shepherd. Glaciers are crucial not only for this mountain region. They are also natural dams for all of Peru from which water flows to streams and rivers in downhill valleys. Glaciers also decrease the temperature. So far, the crew has covered an area of roughly 15,000 square meters (almost the size of three football fields), still too small to determine if Gold's idea will work in the long term. His goal is to cover 3 billion square meters, which would be much more than 500,000 football fields. For that, he would need about $1.5 billion spread over five years. He's received an award from the World Bank to work on the project, but only enough for a modest beginning. ""If there's a chance of bringing change, why ignore it? Doing nothing would be worse. If we fail to act, life will end in this area,"" Gold says. In a way, life has already ended in the town of Licapa. Gold says that only about 900 people remain in a place that thousands used to call home. But Salomon Parco says he's confident the project will work in the long term. He's betting his children's future on it.","Mountains in Peruvian Andes that used to be covered with ice are now barren .

"(CNN) -- Friday proved a good evening for some major European football nations, with the Netherlands, Italy and France all claiming away victories in their Euro 2012 qualifying groups. However, it was the Dutch who were most impressive coming away from their Group E match in Hungary with a thumping 4-0 success. Tottenham forward Rafael van der Vaart set the visitors on their way with an eighth minute opener and Barcelona midfielder Ibrahim Afellay added a second on the stroke of half time. Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt made it 3-0 early in the second half and Arsenal striker Robin van Persie completed the scoring on the hour. The victory maintained Netherlands' 100% group record. They have won all five of their matches, conceding just two goals in the process, and are now six points clear of second-placed Hungary. Meanwhile, Italy continue to set the pace at the top of Group C after a late goal from Brazilian-born Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta gave the Azzurri a narrow 1-0 success in Slovenia with a fine strike from the edge of the area. That result puts Italy on 13 points from their five games, six points clear of Slovenia who remain in second. Serbia are up to third place, level on points with Slovenia, after coming from behind to beat Northern Ireland 2-1 in the evening's other group match. Meanwhile, goals in each half from Philippe Mexes and Yoann Gourcuff gave France a 2-0 win in Luxembourg to consolidate their position at the top of Group D. The result leaves France on 12 points, four clear of Belarus, and well on course to qualify for next year's finals. There was also an away success in Group A, where Axel Witsel scored both goals in Belgium's 2-0 victory against Austria.

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese journalist could receive 40 lashings after she was caught wearing trousers. Lubna al-Hussein was arrested with 18 other women this month for wearing indecent clothes. A Sudanese court began hearing Lubna al-Hussein's case Wednesday. It will continue the hearing August 4. At the time of her arrest, she was wearing pants, a blouse and a hijab, she said. Police accused her of wearing trousers that were too tight and alleged that her blouse was too transparent, al-Hussein said. Al-Hussein, who works for a newspaper and the media department of the United Nations mission in Sudan, said she did nothing wrong. She has been released to her home in Khartoum. The crime of wearing indecent attire has only one punishment under Sudanese law, a 40-stroke public flogging, according to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information. ""This case is the official retaliation against the reporter for her writings criticizing the Sudanese regime and extremists,"" the organization said in a statement. Al-Hussein was arrested along with 18 others July 3 after Sudan's ""discipline police"" accused the women of wearing indecent clothes, al-Hussein said. Six were released, and 10 received the 40 lashes, she said. Al-Hussein and two others fought the charges and hired attorneys, she said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke out against the decision Wednesday, saying he was ""deeply concerned"" and would take every effort to protect his staff member.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The Kenyan government plans to appeal a warrant issued by its high court calling for the arrest of the Sudanese president over alleged war crimes. A Kenyan judge on Monday ruled that President Omar al-Bashir be arrested if he sets foot in the nation again after the government failed to execute an International Criminal Court warrant when he visited Nairobi last year. The ruling sparked a diplomatic row between the two nations, with Sudan expelling the Kenyan ambassador and recalling its envoy to the nation. A day after the ruling, Kenya's foreign minister described it as "" unhelpful"" and pledged to ensure it does not undermine relations between the two nations. ""Since our judicial system provides for right of appeal, we shall carefully look at the judgment with a view to requesting the Attorney General to expeditiously prefer an appeal in the matter,"" Moses Wetang'ula said in a statement Tuesday. The high court ruling was the result of a case that the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) brought against Kenya's attorney general and internal security minster in 2010. Al-Bashir visited Kenya last year to attend the signing ceremonies for the nation's new constitution. At the time, Kenyan officials said their first obligation was to the African Union, not the International Criminal Court. The African Union opposes the ICC warrants, saying his arrest could destabilize Sudan. The ICC based in the Hague has issued arrest warrants for al-Bashir on alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes. He has denied the charges and accused western nations of ""neo-colonialism."" The Sudanese leader is wanted by the ICC on allegations of war crimes and genocide in western Sudan's Darfur region, where violence that erupted in 2003 left at least 300,000 people dead.","A Kenyan judge rules that President Omar al-Bashir be arrested if he visits .

"(CNN) -- Diplomatic tension between Brazil and Italy heightened Thursday after Brazil's Supreme Tribunal freed a fugitive wanted for multiple killings in Italy in the 1970s. The high court's decision appeared to put an end to years of wrangling over the fate of Cesare Battisti, who was condemned to life in prison in Italy for four murders he denies committing while a member of an extremist left-wing group. Italy's foreign ministry responded to the Wednesday night ruling with a promise to take the issue to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. ""I cannot but comment that today's ruling by Brazil's highest judicial body, apart from offending the right to justice of the victims of Battisti's crimes, appears to run contrary to the obligations stated in the international accords that bind our two countries, which, moreover, have age-old ties of friendship and shared blood,"" Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said. The Brazilian judges found, by a vote of 6-3, that former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's decision to deny Battisti's extradition was ""an act of national sovereignty"" that the high court could not reverse. Battisti was a member of the Armed Proletarians for Communism, or PAC, guerrilla group in Italy. He is alleged to have participated in a number of crimes, which led to his incarceration. He escaped from an Italian prison in 1981 and was granted asylum in France during the presidency of Francois Mitterrand. The so-called Mitterrand Doctrine gave asylum to all Italian militants who renounced the armed struggle. In 1998, Battisti was tried and convicted in absentia of the four killings. For several years, France and Italy were embroiled in diplomatic spats over extradition requests. Battisti later fled to Mexico, where he continued his work as a writer of thriller novels, and subsequently to Brazil. In Brazil, his fate was oftentimes unclear. In January 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Tribunal granted refugee status to Battisti. But later it reversed course and supported extradition, giving then-President Lula the final say. ""Italy may not like it, but will have to respect it,"" Lula said at the time. ""This person is being accused of a crime which took place in 1978, and his accuser no longer exists to prove the veracity of the facts."" Lula sided with the Italian's claims that the conviction against him was politically motivated, and in the last days of his administration rejected the extradition. Italy protested. ""What is at stake here is an act of sovereignty of the president,"" Judge Luiz Fux said. ""The Italian government has litigated against the Federal Republic of Brazil."" The point the majority made was that they were not ruling on the Battisti's culpability in the crimes, but whether the court had the power to overrule Lula. Another judge, Ricardo Lewandowski, said that when he studied the original request for extradition, he was convinced that Battisti had indeed committed the crimes. ""But right now, this is not the issue at stake,"" he said. ""I understand that the president made a political act, an act of government, which is characterized by broader discretion."" Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ""learned with deep regret"" about the court's decision, his office said. ""The decision does take into account the legitimate expectations of the justice of the Italian people and especially of the family of Battisti's victims,"" his office said in a statement. Armed Proletarians for Communism was one of Italy's home-grown left-wing armed groups of the 1970s. Like the infamous Red Brigades, they committed politically motivated murders on behalf of what they saw as working-class ideals.

"(CNN) -- Texas officials are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and temporarily block a controversial congressional redistricting plan from going into effect Monday. The state's attorney general, Greg Abbott, filed an emergency ""application"" with the justices, saying a map approved by a federal panel in San Antonio is ""fatally flawed."" It would increase the number of districts dominated by minorities, especially Hispanic voters. The court-drawn map was imposed after Democrats and minority groups in Texas challenged the original plan approved by the GOP-led state legislature. Those seeking public office can begin filing their candidacies Monday, prompting the state's time-sensitive appeal to the high court. ""Elections should not proceed based on legally flawed maps that are likely to be overturned on further review,"" Abbott said in a written statement. The Supreme Court could allow the court-approved plan to remain in effect for now, or order the judicial panel to redraw the map, a process that could shorten the time candidates would have to campaign. The state's primary election is set for March. Texas is getting four new congressional seats -- more than any other state -- after the latest census showed its population grew by 4 million people. The plan drafted by the three-judge panel would give minorities the majority in three of those congressional districts, and could give Democrats more seats statewide. ""Ninety percent of the growth in this state in the last decade was minority growth,"" said Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic state representative. ""Sixty-five percent of that alone, Latino. So you would expect these new congressional districts would reflect the minority populations that created the opportunity."" Fischer leads the Texas House Mexican American Legislative Caucus, the key plaintiff in the lawsuit against the legislature's original map. Under state rules, redistricting plans approved by the legislature can be challenged in court, with judges having the power to craft alternate maps. Republicans in the state have a super-majority in the legislature, meaning they needed no Democratic support to pass their plan. A similar party split a decade ago led Democratic lawmakers to flee to neighboring Oklahoma in an effort to kill the 2000 redistricting bill. Abbott said the federal court's plan is an unconstitutional intrusion into the legislative process. ""It seems apparent that the proposed map misapplies federal law and continues the court's trend of inappropriately venturing into political policymaking rather than simply applying the law,"" Abbott said. ""Perhaps worst, in the name of protecting Hispanic voting power, the court seems to be discarding already elected Republican Hispanics in favor of drawing maps that may elect Democratic Hispanics."" The state's Republican governor, presidential candidate Rick Perry, supported the map passed by the legislature, but has not signed it into law while the plan is challenged in court. All states are required to redo their voting boundaries following the recently completed nationwide census, conducted once every 10 years. The court-approved plan in Texas will stay in effect until all the legal challenges are exhausted. The high court appeal is Perry v. Perez (11A520).","A federal court panel drew the map after the state legislature's map was challenged .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- Waging war against historic flooding in eight Midwestern and Southern states, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened a spillway north of New Orleans on Monday in an effort to calm the rising Mississippi River. A crowd gathered near the entrance to the Bonnet Carre spillway to watch workers use cranes to slide open the gates to the flood control system. The spillway, like another that could be opened next week, is designed to divert floodwater away from New Orleans and slow the raging river to protect the low-lying city. Bonnet Carre is part of a system built after the devastating Mississippi River flood of 1927. While the river's highest levels may still be days away, a decision to open the second flood control structure -- the Morganza Spillway -- may not be, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said. People with property that would flood if the spillway is opened should not dally, Jindal warned: ""My advice to our people is not to wait, to get prepared now."" The Bonnet Carre spillway diverts water from the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico by way of Lake Pontchartrain. But opening the Morganza Spillway would flood populated areas and could put Morgan City, Louisiana, and other communities at risk. Col. Ed Fleming, the Corps of Engineers' district commander in New Orleans, said he has requested the authority to open the Morganza Spillway. Jindal said the Louisiana National Guard had asked for at least three days, but preferably five days, to evacuate those areas before the Corps opens the gates. Upstream in Memphis, Tennessee, residents and authorities had prepared all they could Monday as they waited for the Mississippi to crest at a near-record 14 feet above flood stage Tuesday morning. ""It's sort of torturous,"" Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. said. ""We've been waiting so long. It's hard keeping people's attention. It's warning fatigue, if you will. But we're ready for it."" The river level stood at 47.8 feet Monday evening and is expected to crest at 48 feet, said Ryan Husted, a forecaster for the National Weather Service in Memphis. President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state of Tennessee Monday, which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms, flooding and tornadoes since early April. The Mississippi is the highest it's been at Memphis since 1937, when it crested at 48.7 feet -- 14.7 feet above flood stage. That flood killed 500 people and inundated 20 million acres of land, said Col. Vernie Reichling, the Corps' Memphis District commander. The river covered the lowest parts of the city's historic Beale Street and had forced about 400 people from their homes Monday, Wharton said. Another 1,300 remained in low-lying areas, he said. Corps officials said levees protecting the area appeared to be holding up well, with only minor amounts of water seeping in from beneath or lapping over from above. ""All of our levees were designed to withstand heights greater than what we're seeing today, although this height is significant,"" Cory Williams, chief of geotechnical engineering in the Memphis district with the Corps, told CNN affiliate WMC. ""The levees have held up very well in this event."" But local officials were taking no chances. ""It's a very powerful river. It looks like it's running very slowly, but it has a very strong current,"" said Bob Nations, director of preparedness in Shelby County, Tennessee, which includes Memphis. ""We still don't know (exactly what) the river might do."" Nicholas Pegues, an East Memphis resident who lives near the Wolf River, said he's seen extensive flooding and homes left uninhabitable by the water as he's traveled through the region. ""It's affecting daily life tremendously,"" said Pegues, a Shelby County elections' division employee who submitted photos of the flooding to CNN iReport. ""It is pretty severe downtown. ... I know a lot of ... people have lost their homes."" Wharton said the flooding had not yet caused major disruptions in the city, and he did not expect it to, even though National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Borghoff said it is possible the river won't fall below flood stage at Memphis until June. That's the problem in Missouri and southern Illinois, where flooding continues even though the Mississippi and Ohio river crests have moved south. In Murphysboro, Illinois, CNN iReporter Robert Icenogle said a swollen creek is inundating a church and bandshell while threatening to wash out telephone poles. ""We cannot get to the park, which is underwater, or to other towns,"" he said. ""Most of the roads are closed, plus the water sewage plant is getting sandbagged."" If a nearby sewer plant is forced to shut down, ""We won't have tap water to bathe in or drink,"" he added. Last week, the Corps intentionally breached a levee in Missouri as part of its effort to reduce the pressure on other levees, flooding 130,000 acres of agricultural land over the objection of state officials and some farmers. ""I'm very sad. I look at that and I don't have a home,"" Marilynn Nally said, pointing to her flooded family farm.  ""I feel like we're having to suffer for somebody else."" As the floodwaters worked their way south, the operator of a nuclear power plant in Port Gibson, Mississippi, expressed concerns that rising water could cut off an access road to the facility. However, there was no plan to shut down the Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station and no immediate cause for concern, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Agency said Monday. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN's John King the greatest risk will likely be from flooding around the powerful river's tributaries, rather the Mississippi itself. ""Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst,"" he said. In Louisiana, where the river's crest is not expected to begin arriving until next week, Jindal added bears to the list of things residents need to think about. He said flooding could force some of the state's ursine residents from their homes and into populated areas. So far, 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations ahead of expected flooding, Jindal said. He said 400 National Guard troops would be active by the end of the day Monday helping prepare for the flood. Even with a forecast for record or near-record crests into next week and weeks of high water to follow, Corps officials say they expect nothing like the widespread and devastating flooding that occurred along the southernmost stretch of the Mississippi River in 1927. That flood began near Memphis in the fall of 1926 and did not end until the following August, according to the National Weather Service. It devastated the levee system, and flooded 165 million acres of land, sweeping 600,000 people from their homes. It came at a cost of 246 lives and the equivalent of nearly $624 million in 2011 dollars. As a result of that flood, the report says, Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1928, which led to a massive public works programs to build a system of levees and other structures designed to hold back the river more effectively. The latest flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region. Over one two-week stretch, there was about 600% more precipitation than usual, Reichling said. The weather now appears to be working in the flood fighters' favor. Only minimal rain is expected over the coming days, with daytime temperatures forecast to be in the upper 80s and 90s through Thursday, at which point the water levels should begin to creep back down. Still, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told HLN's Vinne Politan that people around the river and its tributaries need to be careful and should not wait until they see water to take action. ""It's going to be a tragedy on many levels. So many people are going to be displaced. They're going to be displaced for a long time and they may not have much of anything to come back to,"" said Jeff Rent. CNN's Greg Botelho, Marlena Baldacci, Phil Gast and Ben Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's going to be a tragedy on many levels,"" says Miss. emergency management spokesman .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- With the late evening sun casting a dramatic light across the 65th floor of an empty Hong Kong office block, everything was primed for a spectacular entrance from Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo. Director John Woo: Hardboiled on the outside, soft on the inside. With the scene set and cameras ready, the lift doors opened on cue. But instead of the director appearing, perhaps with a spectacular pyrotechnic backdrop or with a motif dove, out stepped one of the building's security guards wondering what a CNN film crew was doing filming an empty building. It turned out the 63-year old director was embroiled in another dramatic scene on the other side of town, commonly known as ""Hong Kong Rush Hour."" We were assured Jackie Chan wasn't involved in the hold up. By the time Woo did make it to the interview the sun was setting, but regardless of the scene or location, the unassuming 5-foot 5-inch tall director still casts an impressive shadow over international action cinema. From Hong Kong-based ""Gun fu"" flicks of the 1980s and '90s, to Hollywood blockbusters like ""Mission Impossible II"" Woo has made a reputation as a master of stylish gangster films and thrillers. His latest release, ""Red Cliff: Part II"", an epic-historical action film set in Three Kingdoms-era China, marked his return to China and a simpler method of making films. ""Even though I enjoyed the opportunity to work in Hollywood, I never got used to their system. I didn't like much of the studio people. Well, there are too much politics and so much going on, and a lot of them have nothing to do with the movie. It's all about power, it's all about egos,"" Woo told CNN. Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are just a few of the A-list egos he has had to deal with in front of the camera. However directing actors, even a demanding Tom Cruise, is a pleasure not a problem for the self-effacing Woo, who admits his directing style is controlled and quite reserved. ""Sometimes he [Cruise] gave me so many suggestions about the camera (and) about the scene. And then I knew he just wanted to be good. So then I just walked up to him, 'Tom just believe me, I will make you look great.' And then he had so much confidence [in me] and then he kept quiet and let me do my work. I did make him look good,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Nicholas Cage is such a nice man. When working with him, I just feel like I am talking to Tony Leung. When I worked with John Travolta, it just made me feel like I am working with Chow Yun-fat. I think we have the same kind of emotion, the same kind of passion about life, about movies."" Chow Yun-fat, a superstar in his own right across Asia, dropped out of Woo's ""Red Cliff"" just days before shooting began. However, it appears that no matter who he works with or where, Woo's passion for film-making and movies will never diminish, and he admits he still thinks of Chow Yun-fat as a good friend. At one point during the interview -- speaking about choosing the right guns as props for his 1987 film, ""A Better Tomorrow"" -- Woo reveals his almost child-like glee in putting together his shots and scenes. Woo's own childhood was spent in Shek Kip Mei, at that time one of the more insalubrious parts of the city, and cinemas and theatres provided both escapism and a physical escape from the violence and ""hell"" of life on the streets. ""I had to fight to survive. Whenever I got beat up, I got upset, I also ran into the theater to watch a movie. But I have a very strong character, I never surrender, I (am) never afraid, no matter how big they are, how cruel they are, they never beat me down. ""I didn't have money. I just sneaked in or watched the movie from the peephole. I have found my heaven in musicals. When I watch a musical, it makes me believe life is still beautiful. There are still a lot of beautiful people in the world. So I like the costumes, I love the song, I love all those smiles, I love those dance. In theater I found my heaven,"" he said. A religious man, Christian symbolism often appears in his films; he almost devoted his life to the church as a priest, but was dissuaded by the minister college. ""They encouraged me to go for art. They didn't believe I could be a good minister. They just said, 'John you are so artistic, you just go for your art, don't come back.' I am grateful they knew me better,"" he said. It wasn't quite divine intervention, but no doubt millions of fans of his explosive cinematic style will be just as grateful he was persuaded to pick the directors chair over the pulpit.","""Mission Impossible II"" and ""Red Cliff"" director has worked with Hollywood A-listers .

"London (CNN) -- People trafficking syndicates could try to exploit the unrest in North Africa, potentially causing a surge in the number of victims arriving in Europe, experts fear. The trade in people trafficking is worth $3 billion a year in Europe alone, but organized smuggling syndicates are constantly looking to expand their operations beyond national boundaries, analysts add. Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency that handles criminal intelligence, says it is now sending experts to Italy to see if syndicates are trying to take advantage of violent protests on the other side of the Mediterranean. Italy has long been at the forefront of Europe's battle to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, due to the close proximity of some of its islands to the African coast. The current influx to Italy -- nearly 10,000 migrants since the start of 2011 -- is much higher than in previous years. Italy: Al Qaeda will exploit North African migrant flood . ""I think there's an important dynamic around the external border of the EU, Turkey, central Asia republics and now of course North Africa and the Middle East,"" Europol's director Robert Wainwright told CNN Tuesday. ""We have experts on the ground in Italy working with the Italian authorities right now to try to identify any signs that organized crime, even terrorist organizations, are trying to exploit the situation in North Africa in particular and the upsurge in the migratory flows that we've seen in recent weeks. ""We haven't seen any strong indications yet but we're working very hard to see the extent to which organized crime might be doing that."" Europol's warning follows a similar one by the United Nations refugee agency that people trying to flee Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and other countries where protests have taken place this year, will be fair game for those trying to profit from their fear and misery. ""Obviously, smugglers' business is seeing big opportunities to exploit the situation,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told reporters in Geneva on February 15. ""As said in Tunisia, we are very concerned. We are hearing the smugglers are not only hanging out at the ports waiting for people to come, but they are actually moving inland and seeking out people falsely advertising what they could offer, what kind of futures they could offer to young Tunisians frustrated and wishing to move on,"" Fleming added, according to reports. There are about 270,000 trafficking victims in Europe at any one time, according to Europol. Many of these people come to Europe hoping for a better future but end up becoming coerced into sexual exploitation and forced labor. Money is the driving force, Europol's Wainwright said, adding that trafficking syndicates are constantly looking to diversify and improve their operations. Despite this, European law enforcement officials have had some successes. Last year they carried out 500 operations against crime syndicates organizing trafficking and sexual exploitation. One operation, against a Romanian gang allegedly trafficking Roma children, culminated in the arrest of 120 suspects, Wainwright said. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","Traffickers could try to exploit unrest in North Africa, experts fear .

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is still believed to be at his residence in Sharm el-Sheikh, will be brought to Cairo next week for questioning in his corruption case, said Mustafa Bakri, a former member of parliament. Bakri, who brought the case against Mubarak and other officials, was told of the development by the Prosecutor General's office on Thursday. Attorney General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud issued an order freezing assets of Mubarak and his family on Monday and prohibited them from leaving the country. Meanwhile, Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik has submitted his resignation and the Egyptian military has appointed former transport minister Essam Sharaf to the post, the military's Facebook page said Thursday. Bakri, a member of Egypt's parliament who lost his seat after filing corruption cases against various officials, provided documents indicating Mubarak's family has secret bank accounts totaling more than 200 million Egyptian pounds ($147 million), according to EgyNews. ""I submitted the corruption documents on Sunday night and on Monday morning I was called in by the public prosecutor for investigation, and he asked me to rush to his office."" Bakri told CNN. ""The attorney general, himself, went over the documents in my possession and then issued his orders to bar Mubarak and his family from travelling and to impound their assets."" Mahmoud ordered the freeze for property owned by Mubarak, his wife Suzanne, his two sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and their wives and children, EgyNews reported. The seizures include ""movable properties, real estate, stocks, bonds and various financial assets."" It wasn't immediately clear how the order differed from a similar one reported last week. Mubarak, through his attorneys and in official filings, has described reports of immense wealth as ""fabrications and baseless rumors."" But Bakri said the documents he provided to Mahmoud ""are the first solid and concrete evidence on the fortune collected illegally by Mubarak and his family."" Mubarak resigned February 11 after 18 days of protest against his rule. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","Egypt's attorney general freezes former president's assets this week .

"(CNN) -- They were outside every polling station I visited in Cairo: earnest young men bent over laptops on rickety tables, checking names and ID numbers against voting lists, explaining to people where they were supposed to vote, and, in light of Egypt's wildly complicated electoral system, how to vote. Scattered around the tables between the laptops were pamphlets and fliers for candidates of the Freedom and Justice Party, the newly established political wing of the once banned but now free and unfettered Muslim Brotherhood. ""Who doesn't want freedom and justice?"" a middle-aged man asked me approvingly as I leafed through a pamphlet over at one of the tables in the working class Cairo neighbourhood of Sayida Zaynab. The ""help"" at the polls was just the tip of an organizational iceberg that may well ensure the movement emerges victorious from the first, critical round in Egypt's first post-Mubarak parliamentary elections. Egypt awaits election results . Both the movement's leaders and rank-and-file are now quietly confident their moment is fast approaching. They have, after all, been working -- methodically and patiently -- to achieve it since the movement's founding in 1928 in the city of Ismailia, on the Suez Canal. They've come a long way since then -- occasionally operating openly, other times hounded by the police. Shortly after Hosni Mubarak was ousted, the movement was legalized. Journalists can now jettison the tired old phrase ""banned but tolerated."" The Brotherhood is unbound. The movement is well entrenched in mainstream Egyptian politics. Its leaders do not appear to be wild-eyed fanatics. Most are highly educated -- doctors, lawyers, engineers, professors, and businessmen -- and come from solidly middle-class backgrounds. Some western observers see the Brotherhood as a sinister, secretive society, feigning moderation and democracy in public while in private embracing an extremist, totalitarian, anti-western agenda. The movement's Egyptian opponents frequently describe the Brotherhood as sheep in wolves' clothing. Its members endured decades of persecution by the authorities, going back to the days of the monarchy. In the 1930s and 1940s the Brothers were accused of assassinations and bombings - although the Brothers always publicly rejected violence as a means to political ends. The secrecy that alarms some Egyptians may have simply been a necessity to function in an environment where the secret police, the mukhabarat, and their army of informers were watching everyone. But who knows. Whatever one thinks of the group, it is skilled at building broad popular support through its extensive network of charities and social services, and stepping forward in emergencies when the state has failed. In 1992 when an earthquake in Cairo left hundreds of the city's poor homeless, it was the Brotherhood who quickly mobilized to provide food, blankets and medical care. The government's reaction was criticized as slow, late, and clumsy. In 2006, when a ferry sank between Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea port of Safaga carrying more than 1,000 workers from Upper Egypt, the Brotherhood rushed relief supplies, only to have them blocked by the government. The first official reaction to the ship's sinking, as I saw myself, was to send hundreds of riot police to Safaga. Government relief supplies arrived three days later. In a country where the sheer mass of people sometimes overwhelms creaking government services, the Brotherhood has won praise for its ability to create order out of chaos. ""What's wrong with good organisation?"" said Abdel Aziz Zaid, production manager at an industrial printing press in Cairo and Brotherhood member. He was keeping an eye on the turnout at the Mohamed Ali School in Sayida Zaynab. He smiled confidently as a steady flow of voters -- women to the left, men to the right-walked past him to cast their ballots. ""When people see that we are well-organised now and were well-organised in the past, they will know we can use that organisation to achieve prosperity in the future,"" he said. What men like Abdel Aziz Zaid call public service, critics shrug off as cynical, opportunistic stunts to win popular support. For Egypt's impoverished millions, however, motives don't matter. They need all the help they can get. The Brotherhood is often accused of opportunism, but, if that's the case, it's chosen its opportunities wisely. During this year's uprising, the Brotherhood kept a low profile, letting secular and leftist youth take the lead. When it became clear Mubarak's days were numbered, the Brotherhood's presence in Tahrir Square increased steadily. The group's leaders cheered the fall of Mubarak but never took credit for it. During the recent protests against the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the Brotherhood stayed on the sidelines. They condemned what they called police brutality, but also rejected calls for them to join the protests. They were bitterly criticized by the activists in Tahrir Square, who warned they would be punished at the ballot box. But the people in Tahrir, not for the first time, misread the public mood. Many Egyptians I spoke with outside the Square said they were tired of demonstrations and clashes, wanted the elections to proceed, and wanted the country to settle down. The large turnout for the first two days of voting, and the dwindling numbers in Tahrir Square, suggest that the Brotherhood once more played its cards well. Call it opportunism, call it clever politics. The result is the same. I met 29-year-old Amna Abdel Aziz as she was going up to the stairs of a school to vote in Sayida Zaynab. ""I'm going to vote for the Freedom and Justice Party!"" she proclaimed loudly. An office worker and mother of three, she listed her reasons for voting for the Brotherhood's Party: ""If the Muslim Brotherhood run the country, they'll fix everything - health, housing, jobs, girls who walk around with their hair uncovered, girls who walk around in the wrong clothing. God willing, they'll fix everything."" Amna was wearing a headscarf, hijab, not the full face-covering niqab favoured by the ultra-conservatives, so I was a bit taken aback. ""You mean,"" I asked, ""the Brotherhood will force women to wear the hijab?"" ""No, no,"" she responded. ""They'll just convince them it's better for them."" And that seems to be the attitude of many members and supporters of the Brotherhood -- that they'll bring people over not by compulsion but rather by conviction and example. It's an attitude 27-year-old interior decorator Hind Mohamed vehemently rejects. The Muslim Brothers, said the unveiled Hind, ""are just liars. They don't do what they say. They use religion to convince people to vote for them."" Obviously they hadn't convinced her. She was waiting in line to vote ""against the Muslim Brotherhood,"" she said. The movement's leaders are well aware that many Egyptians, especially Christians, liberals, leftists and others, are wary of their growing power. Senior Brotherhood leader Issam Al-Arian is quick to reassure them they are all partners in a new democratic Egypt. ""They are our friends, our neighbours, our citizens, they are Egyptians as we [are], and they have the same rights and duties, and nobody can deny that,"" he told me on the second day of voting. ""If they oppose us, they are participating in building this country, and are correcting our mistakes, if we commit a mistake. And this is very important for a democratic system."" A few years ago I interviewed Mahdi Akif, then the leader, or Supreme Guide, of the Muslim Brotherhood. Akif, a doctor, had worked in Germany but had also spent many years behind bars under Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak. ""A long-term guest of the government,"" is how he described it with a chuckle. Like so many Egyptians he had a sharp sense of humor. But the smile evaporated when he told me, ""We are a religion, a mission, a programme. I don't care what the government thinks. What concerns me is that God is satisfied."" Rifaat Said, the wizened old leader of the leftist, secular Agama's Party shared with me his concerns about the Brotherhood. ""So, if you are not with them, the Brotherhood, with God's party, are you with the devil's party?"" Said spent time in prison with the Brotherhood's Akif, and knows him well. He doesn't trust the group. ""If God's party reaches power,"" he asked me, ""who can move them away?"" ""God's party"" is closer today to power in Egypt than it's ever been.","Muslim Brotherhood members had to endure decades of persecution by Egyptian authorities .

"TAIPEI, Taiwan (CNN) -- Former Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian was convicted Friday on corruption and money laundering charges, and was sentenced to life in prison, according to officials at Taipei City Court. Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian walks inside the Taipei Detention Centre in Tucheng on Friday. He was fined 200 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S.$6.1 million) as well. Chen's wife, Wu Shu-chen, who earlier had been convicted of lying to prosecutors, also was convicted on similar charges. She received a life sentence and was fined 300 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $9.1 million), according to the Central News Agency, Taiwan's official news agency. The former president was not at the courthouse when the verdict was read. He had asked to be excused and was being held at a detention center. Supporters of Chen gathered outside the courthouse hours before the verdict, wearing bright-green shirts, and carrying yellow balloons and banners. Riot police stood by in case the crowd got out of control as they protested the verdict. The former president's corruption trial began in March. It is the first for a former head of state, and has gripped the island for months. He has denied wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated. Prosecutors say Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S.$17.7 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen has countered that the bribe money was actually political donations. He has also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and cannot be used for. Ahead of Friday's verdict, the island's former first lady was sentenced to a year in prison for lying in her husband's corruption case. Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son, daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony. Prosecutors said the former first couple's son has a Swiss bank account with $22 million they think are illegal proceeds. The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor. Chen's party favors independence for Taiwan. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China. Journalist Yin Chen contributed to this report.","Riot police stand by, as Chen supporters gather outside courthouse .

"WASILLA, Alaska (CNN) -- For more than two decades, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was a practicing Pentecostal. She belonged to the Wasilla Assembly of God church in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska. But though she attended the church from her teenage years to 2002, the Alaska governor hasn't talked much about her religion since joining the Republican ticket. Palin's former pastor, Tim McGraw, says that like many Pentecostal churches, some members speak in tongues, although he says he's never seen Palin do so. Church member Caroline Spangler told CNN, ""When the spirit comes on you, you utter things that nobody else can understand ... only God can understand what is coming out of our mouths."" Some Pentecostals from Assembly of God also believe in ""faith healing"" and the ""end times"" -- a violent upheaval that they believe will deliver Jesus Christ's second coming. ""Our basic belief is that God is God and he knows where history is going and he has a purposeful plan and within the middle of that plan we live in an environment in our world where certain events would take place,"" says McGraw. ""Sarah wasn't taught to look for one particular sign -- a cataclysmic sign. She knew as every Christian does ... that God is sovereign and he is in control."" The McCain campaign says the governor doesn't consider herself Pentecostal.  Watch Palin's father talk about her religious upbringing » . McGraw says Palin's Pentecostal roots may be being downplayed for a reason: ""I think there may be issues of belief that could be misunderstood or played upon by people that don't know."" When asked by CNN about Palin's beliefs, campaign spokeswoman Meghan Stapleton would only say the Republican vice presidential candidate has ""deep religious convictions.""  Watch how Palin's religious roots formed » . But how might her religious beliefs impact policy in Washington if the Republican ticket is successful? Palin's former pastor says he has no doubt her religious beliefs will influence her decision making when it comes to government policy. Regarding her desire to build an Alaskan pipeline and explore for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, McGraw told CNN, ""Sarah knows that in Genesis, God creates the world and it's very good and that we're supposed to be caretakers in terms of not destroying the environment, so there's no way that Sarah is going to exploit or damage the Alaska tundra in the name of getting gas if she doesn't have to."" Palin's neighbors react to her swift rise . Six years ago, Palin left Assembly of God to join the non-denominational Wasilla Bible Church. But the Assembly of God says she still returns for special conferences and events, such as the graduation of ministry students in June. Video of a speech she gave at the church just two months before joining the Republican ticket is making the rounds on the Internet. Speaking of the troops in Iraq, Palin says on the video, ""Pray for our military men and women who are striving do to what is right. Also for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for -- that there is a plan, and that plan is God's plan.""  Watch Palin speak at her former church » . Her campaign says she doesn't mix her faith with government business. But Palin did ask her audience to pray for a $30 billion natural gas pipeline she is on a mission to build in Alaska. In the video Palin says, ""I think God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas pipeline built. So pray for that ... I can do my job there in developing my natural resources. But all of that doesn't do any good if the people of Alaska's heart is not good with God."" McGraw, who was her pastor until 1998 and while she was mayor of Wasilla, says that Palin attended discipleship classes to strengthen her Pentecostal faith and that he counseled her on how to become a better leader. ""Everyone has a way of viewing the world and Sarah does too and hers would be shaped by the common-sense practicality of how she's been shaped by the Bible -- which is basically the world view that says God loves people, people can access him and he's given us wisdom for living,"" McGraw says. He says Alaska has seen Palin's faith play out. As governor she passed ethics reform and took on what she's referred to as a ""good-ol'-boys network."" However, she has said she would not seek to impose her religious views on others. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Sarah Palin . ""I think one of the most obvious ways it plays out is what you've seen -- is being courageous enough to deal with deception and corruption,"" McGraw says. Palin now attends the Wasilla Bible Church. She was there on August 17, just days before entering the national spotlight. David Brickner, the founder of Jews for Jesus, was a speaker. He told congregants that terrorist attacks on Israel were God's ""judgment"" of Jews who haven't embraced Christianity. Brickner said, ""Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television. When a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment -- you can't miss it."" The McCain campaign says Brickner's comments do not reflect her religious views. Palin's spokeswoman says she is pro-Israel. Pastor Ed Kalnin, the senior pastor of Palin's former Pentecostal church, has also come under fire for his comments. In 2004, he told church members if they voted for John Kerry for president, they wouldn't get into heaven. He told them, ""I question your salvation."" The Assembly of God issued a statement online in response, which said Kalnin was ""joking"" when he suggested ""Kerry supporters would go to hell."" The statement went on to say: ""We do acknowledge in hindsight that it was careless, and we do apologize for that. This statement is not written as a defense, but as a clarification."" Palin has done little while in office to advance a social conservative agenda. She told The Associated Press in an interview in 2006 that she would not allow her personal beliefs to dictate public policy. ""I've honestly answered the questions on what my personal views are on things like abortion and a lot of controversial issues,"" Palin told AP. ""I won't hesitate to answer those questions about what my personal views are, but I am not one to be out there preaching and forcing my views on anyone else.""  But in the last week, her religious background and outlook has certainly spurred debate far beyond Alaska.","Sarah Palin belonged to Pentecostal church for more than two decades until 2002 .

"(CNN) -- Rome's mayor has given up hope of hosting a Formula One race in the Italian capital, and announced on Friday that he will instead focus on winning the rights to stage the summer Olympics. Italy already hosts one F1 race in the northern city of Monza, but Rome officials had hoped the historic city would have its own date on the elite motorsport's calendar from the 2013 season onwards. ""Today we're definitively and formally renouncing the plan for Formula One in Rome,"" Gianni Alemanno told reporters at a news conference. ""This move represents a step backwards because we have always said we would have done so, should the FIA have posed an alternative between Rome and Monza."" Alemanno's statement came a week after F1's most powerful man Bernie Ecclestone suggested it would be difficult for Italy to host two races. Monza has a contract to host a grand prix until 2016, and Alemanno said the Rome will now concentrate its efforts on a bid for the 2020 Olympic Games. ""We have an Olympic dream that is still going on. So let's make clear to Italy and to the world we want to stage the Games in Rome,"" he said. Rome has hosted the summer Games on one previous occasion in 1960, and has never staged the Italian Grand Prix. The race started out in Brescia in 1921 but quickly moved to Monza, which has run the event every year but one since the F1 world championship began in 1950.","Rome's mayor announces the city will end bid to host a Formula One grand prix .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A black politician campaigning in eastern Germany has become the victim of a racist campaign by a far-right party. Zeca Schall says he is not thinking of leaving Germany despite the threats. The National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) says it is trying to persuade Zeca Schall, a German citizen who came from Angola 21 years ago, to leave the country. Schall is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the party led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and has been named as a CDU expert for the integration of minorities. The NPD's Web site calls Schall the CDU's ""quota negro"" and urges him to leave the country. ""The CDU seems to be realizing that even after years of re-education, negroes cannot be accepted as permanent guests in our state,"" said the NPD, which goes by its German initials.  Watch more about the campaign against Schall » . Schall told CNN he had never before been subjected to such a level of racial hatred. ""I am shocked,"" he said Thursday at a campaign event in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia. ""I simply cannot believe that people would do this to fellow humans."" Schall, who appears on a CDU election poster, said he is scared. ""I have police patrolling at my house day and night, and some officers stay in my house overnight,"" he said. But Schall said he is not thinking of leaving Germany and the CDU said he has the party's full support. Schall and the CDU said they have filed a lawsuit against the NPD. The situation escalated Wednesday when the NPD's national leadership held a rally in Schall's adopted hometown of Hildburghausen. Party Chairman Udo Voigt tried to speak with Schall ""and persuade Mr. Schall that he is needed more in Angola than in Germany,"" the NPD said in a news release. Police sent to protect Schall stopped the NPD's representatives from accessing Schall's premises. He is campaigning for the CDU for a state election in Thuringia, which is in the former communist East Germany. Right-wing extremism is generally a bigger problem in eastern Germany than in the west of the country, and citizens of Hildburghausen told CNN that, though most people support the politician, fascism is a problem in the area. ""Of course we have a base of right-wingers here,"" a passer-by said at the market in the town's center. But most of those questioned by CNN denounced the campaign against Schall and said he is a respected member of the community. ""I am not only a member of the CDU, I am also a voluntary firefighter at the local department,"" Schall said. Frank Schwerdt, the NPD's leader in Erfurt, tried to downplay the events. ""This is not a personal campaign against Mr. Schall,"" Schwerdt said. ""We simply feel that many citizens don't want foreigners to have a say in our politics."" The NPD has been under surveillance by Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution for alleged contacts with illegal neo-Nazi groups. However, past efforts to ban the party have failed on technical grounds. The NPD denies ties to illegal groups. But members of the Christian Democratic Union told CNN that, since the racist campaign started against Schall, he has received several death threats and the party will no longer allow him to do media interviews because of the risks. At Thursday's campaign event in central Erfurt, increased police presence was noticeable and CDU members said plainclothes officers had been dispatched among the crowd.","National Democratic Party of Germany trying to persuade Zeca Schall to leave country .

"(Wired) -- Twitter confirmed Tuesday evening that its microblogging site has been shuttered by Egyptian authorities. This came hours after widespread reports that access had been cut off, as Egyptians took to the streets in what many hope and some fear would be a sequel to the revolution in Tunisia last week. The day's speculation that the Mubarak administration might have pulled the plug on Twitter underscored the power of the site and other social networks as tools to both coordinate and disperse news of a citizen uprising. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube were widely used in Tunisia's recent uprising and in Iran last year. But it remains an open and hotly debated question about how much of a role these tools actually play in real-world social movements, with some critics rightly pointing out that it becomes tempting for analysts to give more credit to the new and sexy tools than they actually deserve. ""We can confirm that Twitter was blocked in Egypt around 8 a.m. PT today. It is impacting both Twitter.com @applications,"" the company tweeted from the handle @twitterglobalpr. Earlier in the day, Twitter seemed unsure. ""We're not experts on how Twitter is being used in highly developing situations 1000s of miles from our comfortable HQ in SF,"" the company tweeted from the same handle. In a separate tweet, San Francisco-based Twitter added, ""the experts are those using Twitter on the ground and those coordinating with them around the world."" One of the leading authorities on Middle East censorship, who is based in Cairo, said in a telephone interview that his Facebook account was accessible but not his Twitter account. His ISP, he said, is TE Data, that nation's largest internet service provider. The source, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said some Egyptians using the Nour ISP were getting access to Twitter. ""Twitter, it's almost across-the-board inaccessible in Egypt,"" he said. ""Given the size of the crowds we saw in the streets, I wouldn't be surprised the outage was from the government. There's been calls to censor the internet here for ages."" ABC News reported from Cairo that Twitter was down and that as many as three people were killed as tens of thousands of protesters hit the streets demanding President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year reign come to an end. Vodafone, using the handle @VodafoneEgypt, had tweeted ""no blocking from our side!"" It speculated that the outage may have been from ""overload."" Jillian York, who compiles a crowd-sourced ledger of unavailable websites across the globe for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, said the center had received about a dozen reports of Twitter being inaccessible inside Egypt.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt sent hundreds of troops with armored vehicles onto the streets Wednesday to protect the Ministry of the Interior, the army taking over from the police, as anti-government protests raged. The confrontations began when a planned memorial for people killed in Egypt's revolution earlier this year turned into an angry demonstration against the country's interim military government. Clashes began Tuesday afternoon and continued overnight and into Wednesday, with intense confrontations between relatives of victims on one side and security forces on the other. Many Egyptians are angry at the slow pace of change since President Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11 after protests. A group called the January 25 coalition issued a range of demands Wednesday night, a day after the demonstrations began. They called for the ""speedy trial of snipers and killers of protesters, the removal of Cairo's head of security and the official spokesman of the Ministry of Interior"" and ""an immediate investigation in the events of last night."" The group, named for the day anti-government protests began this year, also called for the release of detainees held overnight and the ""immediate expulsion of security officers who continue to butcher and kill Egyptian people,"" among other demands. Protesters burned tires and threw Molotov cocktails, and police responded with tear gas, bullets and pellets in the biggest demonstrations in Cairo in months. But despite the efforts of police, demonstrators maintained their positions in Cairo's Tahrir Square, increasing their numbers to about 2,000. Dr. Hatem Ashraf, the minister of health, said 75 people were admitted to hospitals, with 10 still there after 65 people were treated and released. Ministry spokesman Dr. Adel Al Adawy said earlier that 32 police officers were injured and more than 590 people were treated at the scene of the clashes. Some 23 ambulances were running to help care for the wounded, he said. Nine people were arrested, said Alla Mahmoud, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior. ""Thugs carrying swords and weapons infiltrated the protesters and attacked the Ministry of Interior with Molotov cocktails and rocks,"" Mahmoud said. A makeshift clinic was established in a nearby mosque where dozens of people were treated for minor wounds and fatigue from inhaling tear gas.  Many people were seen bleeding from their heads and had suffered bullet wounds to the chest and face. Several thousand protesters chanted against Gen. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who heads the Supreme Council of the Egyptian Armed Forces.  The council has been running the country since Mubarak was forced to step down. The council said the demonstrations ""have no excuse but to destabilize the security and stability of Egypt."" The armed forces statement urged ""the great Egyptian people... not to follow these calls... for the sake of the security and safety of Egypt in these difficult circumstances."" Ambulances streamed out of the square in the aftermath, transporting protesters to hospitals, while others were treated on the scene. Noor Noor, the son of presidential candidate Ayman Noor, was seen bleeding with a serious injury to his eye and was later transferred to the hospital. The protesters blocked the entrances to the square as calls were made on the Internet for more people to join the cause. The imam of the nearby Omar Makram Mosque called via loud speaker for police to stop attacking the protesters, saying Tahrir Square belonged to ""the revolutionaries.""  He also urged the demonstrators to go home. By late afternoon Wednesday, the square that was the center of the revolution was no longer blocked, but demonstrators remained at the Interior Ministry, the focus of much of the anger. The human rights group Amnesty International has estimated at least 840 people were killed and more than 6,000 wounded during the 18-day revolution that began in late January. The military-led government that took over when Mubarak resigned has been prosecuting several former officials accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters. A police officer accused of killing 20 protesters during a January 28 demonstration has been sentenced to death.  Former Interior Minister Habib El Adly has been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges but still awaits the verdict for the charge of killing protesters. Mubarak is scheduled to face the Cairo Criminal Court on August 3 on charges of corruption and deaths of protesters, the justice department said Wednesday. Egypt's military rulers have set parliamentary elections for September. Protests have continued in the months since Mubarak's ouster as Egyptians have demanded speedier reforms and economic improvements. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Journalist Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","NEW: An opposition group demands that officials be sacked over the crackdown .

"(CNN) -- Every move scrutinized, every word analyzed: life in the electoral spotlight where a clothes selection can be as much a defining moment as policies espoused. Cindy McCain entered John McCain's life after his return from the Vietnam War. This is life - not for the presumptive presidential nominees Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain - but for their respective wives. Michelle Obama has already been in the firing line - accused of being angry, negative and ""unpatriotic"" with growing concerns she will be the target of ever more intensive attacks by conservatives as the election battle heats up. For Sen. John McCain the attacks could come on two fronts - confined not just to his current spouse, the striking, elegant heiress Cindy Hensley McCain, but those rooted in his own marital history and the other Mrs. McCain before her - a woman of more modest means who is now virtually invisible. The first Mrs. McCain was born Carol Shepp. She was also a beauty in her youth but after their marriage she suffered a terrible misfortune. In 1969, while John McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Carol was badly disfigured in a car accident. She underwent such drastic surgery to rebuild her body that she ended up several inches shorter and a good deal heavier. For years, she struggled to recover and raise their three children but kept it secret from her POW husband to avoid adding to his ordeal. He didn't find out until he was released and they were reunited, in 1973, but the marriage soon ran into trouble. He was 42 and Cindy Hensley was 24 when she became the woman with whom he would make a new life. He separated from his wife within months. In his memoirs, McCain writes that their break-up was caused by his ""selfishness and immaturity""....""The blame was entirely mine."" Carol doesn't often talk to the media but she doesn't think her accident or injuries ended her marriage. She told one biographer ""I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else."" By all accounts, she got a generous divorce settlement and they remain on good terms. It's an old story to the Washington press corps and one that has been largely overlooked in the course of the campaign. Whether history encourages impartial observers to see McCain in a positive light; as a man who has publicly accepted his personal shortcomings; or more negatively, as a man who left a long suffering spouse for a young heiress, the bigger issue is whether his marital history could or should play a part in determining his credentials to become president. And for that matter - the actions and words of a current spouse for either candidate.","Life in the spotlight for the wives of the candidates may play a number of ways .

"Liberia (CNN) -- Thousands of young men shouting, driving in pick-up trucks and taking control of the streets of Monrovia was, only a few years ago, a reason to flee. They are scenes reminiscent of the 14-year civil war that devastated Liberia and left an estimated 250,000 people dead. But today, these young men and women are thronging the streets of the capital in excitement - supporting their preferred candidates in the last day of campaigning in the nation's elections. The front-runner : the first African female president, grandmother of three and newly-awarded winner of the Nobel Peace prize. But what President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf really wants is to win re-election for a second term in office. ""Just to consolidate the gains, preserve the peace, to keep bringing the development - we've put in the fundamentals, the foundation - the possibility to reach our accelerated growth and development, fix our infrastructure, the potential and chances are so high,"" she said. But President Johnson-Sirleaf has already broken one major promise - that she would not run for a second term. And many Liberians believe she has not fulfilled many of her first term campaign promises - with up to 80% of Liberians unemployed and a majority living without basic necessities such as water and electricity. And there has been plenty of campaigning going on for Tuesday's election, some of it a little unorthodox - I saw one car handing out money to crowds as it drove through town! The main opposition party - the Congress for Democratic Change - is drawing big crowds with their popular vice-Presidential candidate, Liberia's most famous international football star - George Weah. ""Madame Johnson-Sirleaf - all the promises she made, she has never kept them - and the people are ready, you can see the excitement - that they're ready for a change,"" he said. Forty percent of Liberians are under the age of 14 and many believe that, at 72, President Johnson-Sirleaf is out of touch with the needs of the average Liberian. ""I promise them a good life, a life that is affordable. I want to see Liberians not suffering and to have light and water and healthcare,"" Weah added. Desirable, but difficult promises to keep for any incoming administration in a country where many buildings in the capital are still riddled with bullet holes. The voters themselves are split :""The process she started - we need a person who will finish that peaceful process,"" one said. While another said: ""She promised and she didn't do it - she promised and she never delivered.""","Liberians head to polls Tuesday amid excitement .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The death toll from an earthquake that struck eastern Turkey a week ago was at 601 as of Sunday, the Turkish state-run Anatolia news agency reported. More than 4,100 people were injured in last Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake, which struck Turkey's Van province. At least 455 people died in the town of Ercis, where rescue efforts have been under way throughout the week, a crisis center in Van province reported Saturday. However, some 231 people have been found alive in the rubble, despite temperatures nearing the freezing mark at night, Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said Saturday, according to Anatolia. Two teenagers were pulled out of the rubble alive late Thursday and early Friday, more than 100 hours after the quake. Eighty-four buildings have collapsed in Ercis and six more in the city of Van, Atalay said. Relief crews have distributed 40,721 tents -- including 6,088 from abroad -- and 159,360 blankets to survivors, authorities said. A total of 1,309 aftershock quakes have occurred since Sunday's main temblor, officials said. Turkey's government plans to present a new law to parliament by the end of December which would see the evacuation of settlements in areas at high risk of natural disaster, Anatolia reported. Laws governing construction and property management would also be revised under the so-called Urban Transformation Law, the agency said. The United States and China are the latest countries to offer help to Turkey's quake survivors. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered the U.S. European Command to provide humanitarian relief supplies including blankets, cots, sleeping bags and hygiene kits, the Pentagon said Friday.","More than 4,100 people were injured in the quake last Sunday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Remember the little box you can check off on your federal tax return to donate three dollars to pay for presidential campaigns? House Republicans voted that in this era of e-mailing or texting campaign contributions, it's time to get rid of the federal program, and remove taxpayer money from presidential elections and political conventions. The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill that eliminates the ""Presidential Election Campaign Fund"" and uses the over $600 million it's collected since the end of 2010 to pay for other programs. However, a similar bill in the Senate appears to be stalled. The White House has said it opposes the measure, but has not yet threatened a veto. The House passed a similar bill in January, but this new legislation pushed by Republicans also eliminates the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), an independent agency created after the 2000 presidential recount in Florida to help states meet minimum federal standards for voting equipment and administering elections. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, sponsored both bills, and argues that public financing in presidential races is no longer necessary. ""Everybody is about one viral video away from becoming world famous around here. It's not hard to raise money. The Internet has totally revolutionized this. The American people have moved on,"" Cole told CNN. Since the Presidential Election Campaign fund was created in 1976, the Internal Revenue Service reported that about 30% of taxpayers participated in 1980 -- the highest rate on record -- but in 2010 less than 7% of taxpayers checked off the box on their tax forms to direct money to the program. When the program was created, it originally directed $1 from the Treasury to the fund for those who wanted to participate, but the amount was upped to $3 in 1994. Taxpayers who participate do not increase their tax liability. Candidates who apply for public financing must adhere to overall spending limits. Those running for their party's nomination can apply for partial federal matching funds by raising at least $5,000 in 20 states. According to the FEC, every campaign since 1976 has included at least partial public financing. But in the 2008 presidential campaign, both of the major political party candidates -- then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain -- opted out of the public financing system in the primary, and Obama decided against participating in it for the general election because he didn't want to be limited to the cap on campaign spending. Cole criticized Obama for trying to have it both ways -- he didn't want to operate within the public financing system himself, but hasn't joined any efforts to eliminate it at a time when the money saved could be used for other priorities. But Democrats say the fund and the Election Assistance Commission were put in place after two public controversies: Public financing was created after the Watergate scandal and the EAC was set up after the 2000 Florida recount. They worry that eliminating them would erode public confidence about private money having too much influence in campaigns. Rep. Robert Brady, D-Pennsylvania, said the taxpayer funding is entirely voluntary, but that ending it now and closing down the EAC sends the wrong signal. ""When we give the impression that our policy choices will be influenced by campaign donations, we sell out the American people. When we try to deprive citizens of information about their rights and responsibilities as voters, we erode trust in our system. It is tantamount to legal corruption and has no place in our democratic system,"" Brady argued in testimony this week before the House Rules Committee. The presidential election fund also helps pay for both parties political conventions. According to the Federal Election Commission the Democratic and Republican conventions planners have already received more than $18 million to plan their conventions in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Tampa, Florida, scheduled for the end of this summer. Cole, who before serving in Congress was a top aide at the Republican National Committee, said both parties will spend more than $100 million on their conventions, but they don't need to rely on federal help anymore because they can raise the money from private sources. ""The president talks a lot about shared sacrifice. He should call up Debbie Wasserman Schultz [chair of the DNC], my good friend and colleague, and say you should give back that $17 million and then the Republicans I bet would feel they have to give it back,"" Cole said. As for getting rid of the EAC, supporters of the bill argue that there once was a need for the agency to help states upgrade and meet standards after the 2000 election, but states stopped asking for federal guidance. But Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer says doing away with the Election Assistance Commission only a year before a presidential election could lead to lower voter turnout. ""The Commission's primary mission is to provide states with the resources they need to ensure everyone eligible to vote can cast their ballots and have their voices heard. We ought to be making it easier for voters, not eroding our ability to protect them and their right to participate,"" Hoyer told CNN.","Currently, taxpayers can direct $3 to support presidential elections and conventions .
That option may disappear if a bill passes the Senate .
Fewer than 7% of taxpayers took advantage of it in 2010 .
The $600 million collected so far would be redirected to other programs ."
"London, England (CNN) -- The idea that Shakespeare did not write the works attributed to him didn't surface until 1856, 240 years after he died. Until then no one even suggested he might not have done so. The theory originated with an American woman, Delia Bacon, who spent a night in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon trying to summon up the courage to open Shakespeare's grave, apparently in the odd hope that its contents might help her case. She gave up with the morning light, and died not long afterwards in a lunatic asylum. Since then however the theory has spread, to such an extent that now at least 77 people have been suggested as the author of the works attributed to Shakespeare -- including such absurdities as Queen Elizabeth I and Miguel Cervantes, author of ""Don Quixote."" For some time Francis Bacon was the leading candidate. He was supplanted by the poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe, whose death in 1593, when Shakespeare's writings were just starting to appear, is one of the best recorded events in English literary history. The current favorite is Edward de Vere, seventeenth Earl of Oxford, who died in 1604, whereas Shakespeare's plays go on appearing until 1613. An absurd story about him, suggesting that he was both the son of Elizabeth I and her lover, father by her of the Earl of Southampton as well as the author of Shakespeare, is told in the new film ""Anonymous,"" directed by Roland Emmerich and starring Vanessa Redgrave as the Queen. The theory flies in the face of a mass of historical evidence. Shakespeare is mentioned as the author of his poems and plays by at least fourteen contemporary writers. His name appears on the title pages of some 34 editions of plays and poems by him. Anecdotes about him as a writer are told by his contemporary playwright and poet Ben Jonson. In 1623 appeared the great First Folio edition printing 37 of his plays. It has a long poem in praise of Shakespeare written by Jonson, which refers to him as the Swan of Avon (the name of the river of his town of birth). In Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon there is a monument to Shakespeare with inscriptions comparing him to great figures of antiquity and praising him as a writer. In spite of all this and more, conspiracy theories about him constantly emerge in the press and elsewhere. Most of them come not from scholars of literary history but from amateurs. Many scholars have remained aloof from the debate, though I, who have spent most of my life studying, editing, writing about and teaching Shakespeare, have taken part in numerous discussions and media debates of many kinds over the years. James Shapiro, of Columbia University, published an excellent book, Contested Will, about the subject last year -- fascinatingly investigating the psychology of some of the better-known doubters, such as Sigmund Freud and Mark Twain. Disturbingly, the topic has spread to universities. It is now possible to take courses in the authorship of Shakespeare at Concordia University, Vermont and Brunel University, England. Even more disturbingly the makers of the film are distributing to schools in America a study guide intended to sow seeds of doubt in the minds of schoolchildren. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust is the oldest organization devoted wholly to the man and his work. We are energetically pursuing a campaign to defend Shakespeare's name, and have enlisted the help of many high profile figures, including the Prince of Wales, and a string of British actors and writers. We are about to launch a free e-book refuting the theory that Shakespeare didn't write his works -- we profoundly hope that when you read it you will be completely convinced that Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon (1564-1616) is the author of the great plays and poems which carry his name round the world.","New film 'Anonymous' claims Shakespeare did not write works attributed to him .

"(CNN) -- Why is having an affair worse than being a sexual harasser? Why does a woman's claim that she had a 13-year extramarital romance with Herman Cain seem to be more deadly to his Republican presidential campaign than accusations by several other women that he aggressively pressured them for sex -- behavior that would be not only sleazy but criminal? Cain himself has said that donations to his campaign have fallen off since the adultery allegations. This is a far cry from the surge of support that followed the allegations of harassment. Why is this? My take is that working women who allege sexual harassment arouse fear in men, especially men who have conservative views about sex, marriage and women's place at work and in the home. The guy in the office in the gray flannel suit fears that his taken-for-granted sexualization of the women in his workplace may be interpreted as harassment when he doesn't want it to be. He doesn't think he's a bad guy, but can't imagine treating his female co-workers like, well, colleagues first and only, and not like ladies. He would never dream of harassing someone, and is terrified that the quick little pat on a co-worker's butt or comment on her appearance won't be interpreted the way he means it, as just a sexual compliment. He thinks the women in his office might be infected with the crazy feminist idea that a little playing around makes for a chilly workplace climate. Reports of sexual harassment terrify him -- might he be charged next? So he denies that such a thing exists. The rules really aren't that clear, and besides, he doesn't really trust women to tell the truth. A consensual affair, on the other hand, is a lot easier to understand. It's sleazy, something that a good tradition-bound husband recognizes and knows he can avoid, so he's comfortable in holding that against Cain. But whom does an affair really hurt? The victim in these new allegations, it seems to me, is Mrs. Cain, and so far, she seems to be the stand-by-your-guy sort of wife. And if she is hurt by the charges, she's not likely to go public with the pain. Their children too might be hurt, and that too, is a family affair. I don't really care who Mr. Cain is alleged to have slept with as long as she's willing. This is not the first man who ran for president who has ever had an affair. In fact, it might be a good parlor game to try to find one that hasn't. My guess is that there isn't a strong relationship, historically, between being a good president and never having had an extra-marital affair. Women simply haven't been that important; the wives and the mistresses have not been their men's equal, but merely their mates. Perhaps that's changing in the 21st Century. I hope so. But I'm not putting my money on it. And whom does sexual harassment really hurt? Every woman who works for a living. Every time a high profile man gets away with treating women who work with (or especially for) him primarily as sexual objects, and not as workmates, every woman who works for a living is reminded that she too is at risk. When women make public charges, they go on public trial themselves, with their pasts mined for anything that might discredit them. Have they ever gone bankrupt or lost a job? Intimate details of their lives are held under the microscope. Why should their past matter? The issue is whether a man in authority misused his power to coerce sexual favors from a subordinate or take other liberties. If women make a charge, they have to live with an assault on their own character. The guy down the hall needs to learn one very simple lesson: Treat your female colleagues just as you would treat the guys. If you pat the guys on the head, and put your arm around them, or pat their butt to show you like their outfit, go ahead and do it to the ""girls"" in the office. But if not, keep your hands to yourself, and learn to treat the women you work with like colleagues, not ladies. If every man learns to treat women in the workforce as, well, regular people, the fear of behavior being ""misinterpreted"" as a sexual harasser will disappear. No one should make a sexual overture to a subordinate, a gay man shouldn't come on to his male assistant, and a heterosexual woman shouldn't hit on her male secretary. No one likes a sleazy cheat. But harassing women who work for you is far more than sleazy. It is criminal. It's time for a fourth wave feminist movement to create a world where being a woman doesn't mean you are treated differently at the office. When that world comes, we will be finally be in a post-feminist era. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barbara Risman.","Barbara Risman: Why do Cain adultery accusations seem to stick, but not harassment ones?
She says men dismiss harassment because of worry about own workplace actions .
She says adultery hurts the spouse; harassment hurts every woman in a workplace .

"(CNN) -- An American man who was held in Aruba for nearly four months in connection with the disappearance of his traveling companion insisted Thursday he had nothing to do with her vanishing but said it will ""weigh heavily on me for a very long time."" ""I feel as if a person I cared about, a companion ... has disappeared on my watch,"" Gary Giordano said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in his first interview since being released from custody in Aruba earlier this week. Giordano, 50, had been held in the disappearance of 35-year-old Robyn Gardner of Maryland. Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back. When he reached the beach, he told police, Gardner was nowhere to be found and has not been seen since. ""I only looked back when I hit a rock,"" he said, according to a transcript of a police interview obtained by CNN. ""Before that, I did not look back. I was busy saving my life."" Aruban judges repeatedly granted requests to extend Giordano's detention, while the investigation continued. But last week, a judge rejected prosecutors' request to hold Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, for an additional 30 days. He was released Tuesday. A three-judge panel of Aruban judges held a hearing Wednesday to review the decision to release Giordano, but upheld it. ABC aired a clip of an emotional Giordano learning of the decision at the airport. ""I'd accepted the fact that they were going to keep me from my kids forever,"" he told reporters in the video. Aruban prosecutor Taco Stein said Monday he was aware Giordano was going to return home after being freed. ""If we need him again, we will seek extradition with the United States,"" he said. The unresolved case has raised a host of questions, including the nature of the relationship between Gardner and Giordano. His U.S.-based lawyer, Jose Baez, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Thursday night that the two were both single and their personal activities -- including photographs taken by Giordano of the people that have been widely speculated about -- are irrelevant to what happened on the beach that summer day. ""What they do in the privacy of their own bedroom is their business, and really has nothing to do with this except scandalizing the case and trying to cast more aspersions on Gary and his lifestyle,"" Baez said. The attorney said that the couple were ""not exclusive."" Responding to a question about whether Giordano was a swinger, Baez said, ""Gary has a different lifestyle than perhaps you and I."" ""These were things that the this couple did, and they did not only with each other but with other individuals,"" the lawyer added, referring to what transpired involving Giordano and Gardner before she went missing. In his own interview Thursday with ABC, Giordano -- flanked, at the time, by Baez -- disputed allegations he and Gardner had been drinking and that he took her to a ""remote location."" ""We were a sober couple,"" he said. ""... We were 100 yards from a scuba diving store."" The two were in view of other people at Baby Beach the day Gardner disappeared, he said. While Giordano answered specific questions -- at one point saying, ""Here, I'll just interview myself"" -- he refused to give an entire account of that day, saying, ""I'm not going to sit here and answer something I've answered repeatedly."" But he said he was not hurriedly attempting to escape from Aruba when he was detained at the airport August 5. He said following Gardner's disappearance, he met with her mother and with a U.S. Embassy representative. Both told him that he should go ahead and return to the United States on his scheduled flight, he said, and police said he was free to go. He said he was running through the airport to catch the last flight home, as the airport was closing because of a tropical storm passing north of the island. Asked about a surveillance video showing him just after Gardner disappeared, Giordano disputed that he appeared to be dry and said he was exhausted from swimming back to shore, explaining why he did not appear to be acting more urgently. When seeking help, he said he found ""nobody there ... I'm supposed to scream into the air?"" Giordano was asked about a $1.5 million life insurance policy he took out on Gardner days before they traveled to Aruba. He said he purchased travel cancellation insurance on a website and also purchased medical, dental and accident insurance on both him and Gardner. Because both people were listed on the cancellation policy, the site automatically assigned Gardner the other insurance, he said. ""You can't unselect anybody."" He said he routinely purchases such insurance when traveling. ""I have children,"" he said. ""I have a house ... I maxed out on everything ... I was selecting it for me and she got the same thing."" Giordano acknowledged he inquired about the policy two days after Gardner disappeared but said he was told by his then-attorney Michael Lopez to do so. Lopez told him that he could be billed for helicopters and scuba divers used to search for Gardner, he said. He told ""Good Morning America"" that a travel handbook issued by the Dutch government advises travelers, in the case of a missing person, to call authorities and then call their insurance company. Baez, who represented Casey Anthony earlier this year, suggested in the ""Good Morning America"" interview that Lopez might have had a financial motive for advising Giordano to call the insurance company. He alleged Lopez was ""seeing dollar signs"" and attempted to get Giordano to sign a retainer agreement giving him one-third of the insurance money. Reached by telephone in Aruba on Thursday, Lopez denied that, saying his agreement with Giordano did not give him one-third of the money. Giordano vehemently denied any involvement in Gardner's disappearance. Asked if he would do anything differently if given the chance, he said, ""Absolutely. That's a silly question ... I wouldn't have come (to Aruba)."" But, he added, ""You can't unring a bell."" His lawyer, Baez, likewise claimed that critics are looking for a scapegoat in Gardner's disappearance. ""Everything that they have said in a negative way towards Gary is really supposition upon supposition, guess upon guess,"" he told HLN. ""And just because she hasn't been recovered or found, they're just pointing their finger toward a convenient person, which is Gary."" CNN's Martin Savidge contributed to this report.","NEW: Giordano's ""different lifestyle"" is irrelevant to his guilt or innocence, his lawyer says .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- The lawyer for a man convicted of murdering a Connecticut mother and her two daughters described his client as ""damaged"" and suffering from a mood disorder Friday during a last-ditch attempt to spare his client's life. On October 13, Joshua Komisarjevsky was convicted of 17 charges, including three counts of murder, four counts of kidnapping and charges of burglary, arson and assault, in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, Hayley Petit, 17, and Michaela Petit, 11. The sentencing phase of the trial began 12 days later and continued for six weeks. Beginning at 10 a.m. Monday, the New Haven-based jury will now decide whether to sentence Komisarjevsky to death or to life in prison. Steven Hayes, the first defendant to stand trial in the case, was sentenced to death in December 2010 after a jury convicted him of 16 of 17 charges. Prosecutors had argued that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, though William Petit managed to escape. Prosecutor Michael Dearington described the ordeal as a night of ""terror that no person should endure."" He also contrasted defense discussion of Komisarjevsky's family history with that of William Petit. ""When I looked at the Komisarjevsky family photos, I realized that Dr. Petit doesn't have any family photos anymore, because they were burned,"" Dearington said. He described what he called the heinous nature of the crime, insisting that a troubled past couldn't justify Komisarjevsky's actions. ""How many people do you have to kill before the death penalty is appropriate?"" the state's attorney asked, rhetorically. Defense lawyer Walter Bansley, as he had done during the trial, insisted that Komisarjevsky ""wasn't involved in the killings to the extent that Mr. Hayes was."" He then recapped what he described as Komisarjevsky's sordid family history and ongoing battle with his personal demons. His client, Bansley said, was a ""dark kid"" who later got caught up in a life of crime, especially burglaries. ""Joshua was a damaged young man ... and he remains that way, to this day,"" the attorney said. Komisarjevsky was then quoted in a letter to his mother, saying he was sorry ""for not being the boy you wanted me to be"" and ""a loser."" Bansley then insisted that his client posed no danger as long as he is in prison, where he does art and studies Latin. ""Josh is not a future danger to anyone, and you really shouldn't consider killing him,"" Bansley said. ""There is no reason to kill him.""","Komisarjevsky was convicted of 17 charges, including three counts of murder, in October .

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- A Wisconsin Republican official compared the protests over Gov. Scott Walker's attempts to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees to the Holocaust on Wednesday, a remark he later conceded was ""a bad word"" to use. Wisconsin Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection Secretary Ben Brancel, a Walker appointee, told visiting members of the state Farm Bureau that rookie lawmakers ""got stuck in the middle of the Holocaust"" when pro-union demonstrators led rallies and camped out in the Capitol for days. ""Some of you might have had past relationships with your legislators, because they've been here for a while,"" Brancel said. ""But there's a huge number who this is their first time around. They came to town with a lot of ideas and a lot of concepts they could really work on, and they got stuck in the middle of the Holocaust and the horror story that was going on in town as far as people using the building all night long and some shenanigans."" Brancel was making off-the-cuff remarks before the arrival of Walker, who spoke to the farmers Wednesday afternoon and was unaware of his appointee's comments. Brancel later told reporters, ""I better go back to English school."" ""That was a bad word,"" he said. ""It should have been total confusion in the Capitol. It was not an appropriate word to use in the context of which I used it."" Brancel also issued a written apology through his office, apologizing for his ""unfortunate choice of words."" And Walker ""hopes everyone accepts the apology that was immediately issued,"" Walker's office said in a separate statement. Walker and GOP lawmakers are trying to close a $137 million budget shortfall with a plan that calls for curbs on public employee union bargaining rights and requires public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums. The proposal ignited fierce opposition from labor leaders and their supporters, and state Senate Democrats have skipped the state to prevent their chamber from advancing the bill. Public employee unions agreed to financial concessions that they say will help meet the state's fiscal needs, but Walker has said the limits on public bargaining are a critical component of his plan.","A Wisconsin official said rookie lawmakers walked into a ""Holocaust"" in Madison .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's new government on Sunday ordered banks closed for the next two days after protests by National Bank workers apparently drove out the head of the institution. The chairman of the National Bank of Egypt, Tarek Amer, told employees via e-mail that he submitted his resignation on Sunday, according to a person who received the message. ""I was saddened because I could not enter the bank's building today due to hundreds of protesting employees,"" the e-mail said, according to a bank employee, who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. Amer was joined by two of his deputies and the bank's head of human resources, according to the message. It was not clear whether the resignations have been accepted. But Sunday evening, Egyptian state television announced that the country's lenders would be shut down until Wednesday. The announcement asked employees to consider the national interest in the wake of the revolt that drove longtime President Hosni Mubarak from office on Friday. The military council that took power from Mubarak has urged Egyptians to help bolster the country's economy, which had been paralyzed during the protests. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that the new government has made restoring security and reviving commerce its top priorities. ""The Egyptian economy has suffered during this period of unrest, and was suffering from the global recession with a rising unemployment rate,"" Shoukry told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" Bank workers complained that members of Mubarak's family put their allies into positions of power at the bank with grossly inflated salaries. But the National Bank's headquarters in Cairo continued to function during Sunday's protests, with disgruntled staff taking turns to work and demonstrate. There were reports of protests at branches of the Bank of Alexandria and the Bank of Egypt as well. And hundreds of police officers launched demonstrations outside Interior Ministry headquarters on Sunday to demand higher wages, shorter hours, better benefits and more respect, participants told CNN. The protesters faced off with a cordon of Egyptian troops outside the ministry Sunday evening. They currently earn 500 Egyptian pounds (about $85) a month -- a quarter of what army troops of comparable rank earn, they said. They, too, want to earn 2,000 pounds a month, police protesters Mahmoud Tawfiq and Mahmoud Bedwai said. They also want their hours reduced and to be paid for working overtime, saying they work 12 to 15 hour days and face imprisonment if they refuse to work past the end of their shifts. And they called for free transportation to their job sites and housing once they get there, saying some travel hundreds of miles from Cairo for work at their own expense. Both low-ranking police officers and administrative staff joined in the protest. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Arwa Damon and Journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Egypt shutters its banks until Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Band members who were with Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion on the bus in a parking lot in Orlando, Florida, where he died last month tried frantically to get him help when they realized he was not breathing, a 911 tape released Thursday reveals. ""One of our drum majors is on the bus and not breathing,"" a male caller tells a female dispatcher for the Orange County Fire Rescue. ""Is he breathing or is he not breathing?"" she asks. ""We don't know if he's breathing or not, but we need to get an ambulance ASAP."" ""I have help on the way already,"" she says. She asks, ""Is he awake?"" ""He's not even responding. He's responding a little. He wasn't responding. We thought he was breathing. He was making noises, but I don't even know if he's breathing now."" ""Is he awake?"" ""His eyes are open; he's not responding."" ""But is he breathing?"" ""I have no idea. I cannot tell you. He just threw up."" ""He just threw up?"" ""Yes."" The dispatcher then asks whether Champion was shaking prior to stopping breathing. ""No, he wasn't. He wasn't shaking. I don't even know how he was. He was just sitting there. We were just talking and the next thing you know, he was shaking and not doing anything."" Asked again whether Champion was shaking, the caller -- who says he has left the bus in order to hear the dispatcher -- tells her, ""No, no, he wasn't shaking. He wasn't moving. I don't know what's going on."" The dispatcher then calmly asks him to get back on the bus. ""I want you to see if he's breathing, because that's very important,"" she says. After a silence, the voice of another man tells the dispatcher, ""Ma'am, we have a band member right here,"" he says. ""He's on the bus and he's not breathing."" He says, ""I tried to give him CPR and he started to vomit."" ""OK, and you're right by him now?"" she asks. ""He's in my hands, ma'am. He's cold. He's in my hands."" Asked to lay Champion flat on his back on the floor of the bus, the man says, ""OK, I'm going to try. He's heavy."" ""I understand,"" the dispatcher says. ""Just try to do your best, OK?"" ""All right."" After more silence, the conversation resumes. ""All right, cool. He's flat. He's flat on this back."" ""OK, then I want you to kneel next to him and I want you to look in his mouth for food or vomit."" ""Yes, there's vomit."" ""There is vomit in his mouth?"" ""Yes."" ""OK, then I want you to turn his head to the side and I want you to clean out his mouth and his nose."" At that, six minutes after the call started, the connection is lost. The dispatcher calls back and gets a recording: ""Sorry, you've reached me at a time of inconvenience."" Band director Julian E. White told CNN Atlanta affiliate WXIA that he was walking to dinner when he saw the police and paramedics show up pull into the parking lot. ""I followed them, and that's when I saw that Robert was laying on the bus and, obviously, having medical difficulty,"" he said. He said the drum major looked like he had passed out. ""At that point, my concern was getting the best medical attention that I could for Robert."" He accompanied Champion to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His death at age 26 occurred on November 19 after a football game that included a halftime performance by the Florida A&M Marching 100 band. Officials have said his death was related to hazing. The tape was made public Thursday as a school official confirmed that FAMU had dismissed four students. The dismissals were announced Tuesday in a letter from university President James Ammons to the board of trustees. Another 30 students were dismissed from the band, Ammons wrote. No reason was given. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called Thursday for a review of state universities' hazing and harassment policies. ""Hazing should be strictly condemned on our college and university campuses and by any organization associated directly or indirectly with our institutions,"" Scott said in a letter to the chancellor of the state university system. He asked Chancellor Frank Brogan to request that the state's 11 university presidents to ""remind students, faculty and staff of these policies and procedures and how potentially detrimental hazing can be."" No cause of death has been released. Champion's family has said it plans to sue the school ""to get answers."" Speakers at Champion's funeral in Decatur, Georgia, described him Wednesday as a kind person and a leader dedicated to achieving his goals. ""Robert gave us his all every time that he took the field. ... Whenever Robert heard the sound of the drum, his knees raised, his toes pointed and he was on a mission to make the FAMU community proud,"" said White, who began leading the 420-member FAMU band in 1998. Ammons moved to fire White shortly after Champion's death, citing ""alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the 'Marching 100.'"" White, who has hired an attorney to fight for his job, said he has zero tolerance for hazing, which he described as a national problem. ""This is a problem that we are going to have to address as a nation if we are going to save the youth of America,"" he said. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. After the death, Ammons suspended all band performances and said he would convene a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100.""","NEW: Band director Julian E.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Army general Wednesday approved a possible death penalty in the future military trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan, the American Muslim accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. Lt. Gen. Donald Campbell, the Fort Hood commander, formally announced that the charges against Hasan will be tried as capital offenses in a general court-martial. His decision means that if a panel of military officers finds Hasan guilty, they can consider the death penalty as a possible sentence. Campbell's decision moves the case forward and also eliminates the possibility that Hasan, a psychiatrist, could enter a guilty plea and prevent a costly and lengthy trial. A court-martial could be months away. ""After a referral of a case to trial by court-martial, a military judge will receive the case and at some future date, set a schedule,"" said a statement from Fort Hood on Wednesday. ""The first likely matter for a military judge to schedule in this court-martial is the arraignment of Hasan. No military judge has been named to this case at this time."" A capital court-martial is highly unusual. The last military execution in the United States took place in 1961. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in November 2009. Witnesses at a preliminary hearing identified him as the man who calmly walked through a medical building on the country's largest military base, shooting and frequently reloading his handgun as he shouted ""Allah Akbar,"" which means ""God is great"" in Arabic. Hasan's government-appointed defense lawyer, John Galligan, had urged the military against allowing the death penalty as a possible sentence in a trial. Galligan met behind closed doors with Army officials in mid-May to argue that the case should not have the possibility of the death penalty, and described his meeting with Campbell as very cordial. ""The law accepts life without the opportunity of parole as an appropriate punishment for murder,"" Galligan said. ""We had an opportunity to make our compelling argument that the (Hasan) case should be referred noncapital."" Galligan was at the jail Wednesday morning, meeting his client, when the prosecution delivered papers to him informing him that the court-martial would proceed with a possible death penalty. The defense attorney said he was not properly informed in advance and was not provided with the necessary documents by the prosecution. ""It is a sad, sad day to see how they are proceeding,"" Galligan told CNN by telephone. ""They continue to use these tactics that are a denigration of the defendant's right to due process."" Galligan has previously said that a noncapital trial for his client would be quicker and cheaper. And he repeatedly has complained that he and his client have been denied full details of what U.S. intelligence agencies knew about Hasan's contacts with overseas terrorists, including Anwar al-Alwaki, an American-born cleric now believed to be in Yemen and to be the target of American drone attacks. Hasan, who is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair after being shot by police responding to the rampage, is being held in a county jail near Fort Hood. Last week, the Obama administration's top anti-terrorism official pointed to the Fort Hood killings as an example of how extremists overseas were inspiring or assisting violent attacks inside the United States. ""It is al Qaeda's adherents -- individuals, sometimes with little or no direct physical contact with al Qaeda, who have succumbed to its hateful ideology and who have engaged in, or facilitated, terrorist activities here in the United States,"" John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said in a speech in Washington on June 29. ""These misguided individuals are spurred on by the likes of al Qaeda's Adam Gadahn and Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, who speak English and preach violence in slick videos over the Internet,"" Brennan said. ""And we have seen the tragic results, with the murder of a military recruiter in Arkansas two years ago and the attack on our servicemen and women at Fort Hood."" Brennan said the shootings at Fort Hood and the attempted bombing of an airliner in December 2009 had prompted new vigilance by U.S. intelligence. ""Following the attack at Fort Hood and the failed attack over Detroit, we've improved the analytic process, created new groups to track threat information, and enhanced cooperation among our intelligence agencies, including better information sharing so that all threats are acted upon quickly."" An investigation by two senior U.S. senators called Hasan ""a ticking time bomb"" and faulted both the military and federal agents for not raising the alarm sooner about his links to overseas terrorists and possible violence. ""Although neither the Department of Defense nor the FBI had specific information concerning the time, place, or nature of the attack, they collectively had sufficient information to have detected Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism but failed both to understand and to act on it,"" that report said . The Army admitted problems with how it had evaluated and promoted Hasan and disciplined nine officers for ""administrative and leadership failures"" in not spreading the alarm about Hasan before the attacks.","Maj.

"(CNN) -- In anticipation of more flooding next week, residents of Fargo, North Dakota, began stacking sandbags Wednesday for the second time in just over two weeks along the banks of the Red River. A trucker relaxes April 1 on sandbag pallets in Fargo, North Dakota,  which is preparing for more flooding. They hoped to fill 1 million, said Fargo spokeswoman Karena Lunday. ""If we get a million, that will be a total of 4 million we've made since the flood started,"" she said. The first sandbag effort began about March 23. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet at Fargo on March 28, breaking a record that had held since 1897, when the Red River reached 40.1 feet. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning Tuesday, predicting that melting snow -- and possibly rain -- will start to raise river levels on the Red River south of Oslo, Minnesota, this week. Lunday said forecasters expected the river to crest there between April 16-18, possibly reaching 35 feet on April 14. ""I don't think people are as worried as they were the last time, but the possibility of getting up to 40 feet is a concern,"" Lunday told CNN. The Red River meanders along the border between North Dakota and Minnesota, so many other cities also were bracing for flooding.","Fargo spokeswoman says city has goal of filling 1 million more sandbags .

"Doula, Cameroon (CNN) -- Gunmen opposed to Cameroon's long-time leader traded fire with police for hours Thursday in the nation's largest city, Doula. Eyewitnesses told CNN the gunmen, wearing military uniforms, blocked the busy Wouri Bridge brandishing signs reading ""Biya Must Go"" and ""We Want The Dictator Out."" President Paul Biya has been in power in the West African nation for nearly 30 years. His decision to seek another seven-year term in the October 9 election has sparked unrest, and observers have warned that his expected victory might bring post-election violence. The state media, CRTV, reported that five gunmen had been captured and no civilian had been injured. One of the gun men plunged into the river, it said. His fate was unclear. There is a heavy presence of the military in the strategic Wouri area. The 5,900-foot-long bridge carries both road and rail traffic and is estimated to be used by nearly 40,000 people a day. ""This is a warning for the campaigners for Mr. Biya. They must accept what is right or go with the wind of change,"" Collins Ntar, a fruit seller, told CNN. An angry youth who would not give his name told CNN, ""We are not happy with the Biya regime and we want him out by all costs."" With the expected unrest, popular marches have been banned in key parts of the country, including the Northwest and Littoral regions. Campaigns have officially kicked off in all regions, though at a snail's pace. The 22 opposition candidates to challenge Biya say there is a slow disbursement of money from the government to fund their campaign rallies. In 2008, Biya erased term limits from the constitution. That move, coupled with rocketing food prices, fueled anti-government riots that human rights groups, cited by the U.S. State Department, say killed approximately 100 people. The government of Cameroon put the number of deaths at 40.","Gunman and police battle on a bridge in Doula, Cameroon .

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- After weeks of demonstrations in the state capital, Wisconsin Republicans cleared a final hurdle to a controversial proposal on Thursday after the state's Assembly passed an amended version of a bill that would curtail the bargaining rights of most state workers. The vote was 53-42 in favor of the bill. ""I applaud all members of the Assembly for showing up, debating the legislation and participating in democracy,"" Gov. Scott Walker said in a written statement. State Senate Republicans had approved the amended version Wednesday night, despite the absence of 14 Democratic senators who fled the state to prevent a necessary quorum of 20 votes. The amended bill stripped the spending components out of the original proposal, enabling lawmakers to pass the measure with fewer votes. Cries of ""Shame, Shame, Shame!"" filled the Capitol building following Thursday's vote. The bill will soon be delivered to Walker's desk, who is expected to sign the bill into law. Meanwhile, at least one Senate Democrat said he has returned to his home state after spending weeks in Illinois in an effort to prevent the bill's passage. Sen. Jim Holperin said the remaining 13 absentee Democrats will be returning individually between Thursday and Saturday. But Democrat Sen. Kathleen Vinehout quickly disputed that assertion, claiming absentee lawmakers have remained in Illinois. She added that she did not know where Holperin was. The weeks-long standoff reached a fever pitch Thursday after a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said the leader received two death threats, which detailed the ways in which the writer claimed Fitzgerald would be killed. Both threats were e-mailed from the same address, said the majority leader's spokesman, Andrew Welhouse. Meanwhile, throngs of protesters demonstrated outside the Capitol building, which police had earlier closed, forcibly removing those inside who refused to leave. The police later reopened one entrance. ""These arrogant actions are what I had a nightmare about last night,"" said Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, a Democrat, who called the lockout an ""outrage."" The Assembly had convened Thursday afternoon to vote on the revised measure, which was left only with provisions taking away collective bargaining powers and increasing health insurance and pension fund contributions. Placard-wielding demonstrators had blocked the building's entrances, chanting ""Let us in!"" as police struggled to keep order. But shortly before noon, lawmakers were able to access the building through the one open entrance. The governor has defended the proposal as an integral measure that allows Wisconsin to avoid property tax hikes and public employee layoffs in an effort to balance the budget. ""It's about giving local government the tools they need to make reforms,"" he told reporters, saying it's part of an effort to address the state's impending $3.6 billion deficit. While the proposal has a fiscal impact, he said, the new version of the bill does not have an appropriations component -- something that allowed Senate Republicans to approve the measure, despite the absence of Democratic senators. Fourteen Democratic senators fled the state in mid-February to prevent the 20 votes necessary for a quorum on spending bills. ""The dirty trick is what those Democrats have played for the last three weeks,"" Walker said to critics' claims that the Senate had pulled a fast one. Senate Democrats have called the bill an attack on the negotiating rights of state employees. Barca filed a complaint with the Dane County District Attorney's office, claiming Wednesday night's committee hearing on the collective bargaining bill violated Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law. ""The state Senate and the state Assembly violated Wisconsin's very strict Open Meetings Law, by failing to give proper notice of their intended activities,"" said Lester Pines, an attorney for a teachers' union called Madison Teachers Incorporated. ""When you act in violation of the law to pass a bill, the bill itself is void."" Nearly 200 protesters refused to leave the Capitol after the Senate vote, sleeping on the floor of the rotunda and in front of the Assembly doors. Capitol police had initially allowed the protesters to stay despite a court order that prohibits people from remaining inside the building at night. ""The Senate Democrats have had three weeks to debate this bill and were offered repeated opportunities to come home, which they refused,"" Walker said in an earlier statement on the vote. ""In order to move the state forward, I applaud the Legislature's action today to stand up to the status quo and take a step in the right direction to balance the budget and reform government."" But the move drew howls of outrage from outside the chamber, where pro-union demonstrators again chanted ""shame"" and ""you lied to Wisconsin"" as the bill passed. Thousands more began to converge on the building, and a chorus of horns from passing cars echoed in the streets around the Capitol after the vote. James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, said officers with the Madison police department and Dane County sheriff's deputies had been placed on alert ahead of Thursday's protests. Walker and GOP lawmakers are trying to close a $137 million budget shortfall with a plan that calls for curbs on public employee union bargaining rights and requires public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums. Public employee unions agreed to financial concessions that they say will help meet the state's fiscal needs, but Walker has said the limits on public bargaining are a critical component of his plan. Raises would be capped to the rate of inflation, unless state voters approve. The legislation also would require unions to hold a new certification vote every year, and unions would no longer be allowed to collect dues from workers' paychecks. Unions mobilized their supporters to oppose the bill, drawing tens of thousands of workers to rallies opposing Walker and supporting the fugitive Democrats. Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the state AFL-CIO, said Wednesday night's maneuver ""shows that Scott Walker and the Republicans have been lying throughout this entire process."" ""None of the provisions that attacked workers' rights had anything to do with the budget,"" Neuenfeldt said. But the Tea Party Express praised the developments, saying Walker was ""holding strong"" to his principles. ""Under tremendous pressure from union bosses, who have become irrelevant other than in their unquenchable thirst for power, Gov. Walker held fast and did what was best for the people of Wisconsin,"" a statement from the political action committee said. The vote in the Senate on the amended measure was 18-1, with Republican state Sen. Dale Schultz -- who earlier had floated a compromise that neither side bought into -- the lone opponent. Sen. Mark Miller, the Democratic Senate leader, said Republicans ""conspired to take government away from the people."" ""In 30 minutes, 18 state senators undid 50 years of civil rights in Wisconsin,"" Miller said in a statement condemning the vote. ""Their disrespect for the people of Wisconsin and their rights is an outrage that will never be forgotten.""

"(CNN) -- A serving Egyptian police officer describes firing tear gas into crowds of protesters trying to reach Tahrir Square during the country's revolution in January. ""I just had a job to do,"" he says. ""I had my orders, a mission."" Another describes himself and fellow Central Security officers as ""bogeymen."" ""We suppressed people and made them feel terrorized,"" he admits. ""But if I didn't do it, someone else would do it in my place."" These rarely-heard voices from Egypt's revolution appear in a documentary film called ""Tahrir 2011: The Good, The Bad and The Politician,"" which has made waves at the Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals. At its first ever screening, in Venice, the film won the C.I.C.T. UNESCO ""Enrico Fulchignoni"" Award. A review in Hollywood Reporter: ""Shot from the demonstrators' viewpoint, the first part of 'Tahrir 2011, The Good, the Bad and the Politician' captures the passion and excitement of the sit-ins in Cairo's Tahrir Square far better than Western TV cameras."" Egyptian elections to start Nov. 28 . The film is divided into three sections by three different Egyptian directors, Tamer Ezzat, Ayten Amin and Amr Salama. ""The Good"" covers stories of the protesters, ""The Bad"" is interviews with police officers and ""The Politician"" gives a light-hearted ""10 steps to becoming a dictator"" based on interviews with allies and opponents of former president Hosni Mubarak. The police were often feared during Mubarak's time in power and some were accused of excessive violence in their attempts to suppress the revolution. The government announced in July that it was firing hundreds of high-ranking police officers, including 27 accused of killing demonstrators during the revolt. A police officer accused of killing 20 protesters during a January 28 demonstration has been sentenced to death. Amin, who directed the section on the police officers, said: ""I met up with 12 officers and the one thing they all had in common was they were shaky and kept changing their minds about doing interviews. ""This was a few weeks after the events and they were being attacked everywhere. Some of them agreed to do it and on the morning of the interview I would get a message saying they couldn't do it."" Amin, 32, finally secured interviews with three serving officers and one retired officer. Some were filmed anonymously, while others gave their names. She said: ""All the officers had the idea they were protecting their country. That's what they were educated to believe. ""Some of them believed what they were doing was wrong, but that they had to follow orders. ""Out of six-hour interviews, the last 30 minutes was usually the most important because they finally became honest at the end. At the beginning they were just saying the things we knew from TV."" Egypt's banned graphic novel to be published in English . For his section on ""The Good,"" Ezzat, 40, made use of footage supplied by members of the public to a hastily erected ""media center"" in Tahrir Square during the revolution. Ezzat said: ""By the end of the 18 days there was a wealth of material from the protestors themselves of the action. ""I tracked down some of the characters shown and took them back to the location of the events. ""I thought geography was very important to the story. Every character in my film reached the square by a different route and has a different story."" His characters included an upper-middle-class girl who had never been involved in activism before but witnessed the death of a protester next to her, a Muslim Brotherhood member, a doctor who helped set up a field hospital, and photographer who gave up his dream of a scholarship in Denmark to return to Egypt and document the revolution. Ezzat said: ""There was an endless number of interesting stories to tell. I wished my piece could have been much longer. I wanted to show the diversity of the participants."" The final section ""The Politician,"" by Salama, uses interviews with opposition politicians such as Mohamed ElBaradei and author Alaa Al Aswany to delve into the psyche of Mubarak. The directors all used their own experiences in their films. Egyptian film shines light on sexual harassment . Amin said: ""January 25 was the first time I had ever been to a protest. I hadn't intended to go, but a friend called me and told me I should come. ""I live near Tahrir Square, so I walked there. During that first day there were 45,000 people and I had never seen crowds like that. ""After midnight, the police began to attack. We were running everywhere and some of my friends were arrested. ""I saw a police officer beating a guy. I couldn't believe all the violence. I think that's the reason I wanted to make the film."" She added: ""I told one ex-officer that I was there and they were very violent. He told me at the time they didn't see the protesters as people."" Ezzat said: ""During the 18 days, I forgot that I was a filmmaker because I was very emotionally involved as an Egyptian. At the end of the 18 days I remembered that I was a filmmaker.""","""Tahrir 2011: The Good, The Bad and The Politician"" wins Venice film award on its first screening .

"(Health.com) -- Your racial and ethnic background can shape many aspects of your life: the type of food you eat, where you live, and your political views. Now a new survey suggests that how you sleep and what you do before you hit the hay -- whether it's watch TV, pray, or have sex -- varies by ethnic group as well. In the survey, the first of its kind, a representative sample of more than 1,000 whites, African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics ages 25 to 60 were asked about their sleep and bedtime routines. While their answers revealed plenty of differences between groups, they also showed that we have something in common: Most of us aren't sleeping well. In each group, roughly six out of 10 people reported that they don't get a good night's sleep every night or almost every night, according to the survey, which was conducted by the National Sleep Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. ""A significant proportion of all ethnic groups are experiencing sleepiness that impacts their day to day living,"" says Thomas J.Balkin, Ph.D., chairman of the National Sleep Foundation. ""Sleepiness impacts every aspect of our lives, so for those people who are not getting a good night's sleep, getting better sleep will make you sharper in the boardroom, give you a better quality of life, and [make] the sun seem a whole lot brighter."" Across the board, a lack of sleep appears to be affecting people's lives and relationships. Roughly one in four people in each ethnic group said that they missed work or a family function because they were too sleepy, and a similar proportion said they were too exhausted to have sex on a regular basis. Health.com: Eight natural remedies that may help you sleep . The survey results offered a peek inside the bedrooms of Americans, and how we spend our time before drifting off. For instance, 75 percent of African Americans reported watching television routinely in the hour before going to bed, compared with 64 percent of whites. Only 52 percent of Asians said they watched TV before bed almost every night, but they were far more likely to use a computer or surf the Web before bed; more than half said they did so almost every night, compared with about 20 percent in the other groups. Sexual activity also varied among the groups. Ten percent of African Americans and Hispanics reported having sex almost every night, compared with 4 percent of whites and 1 percent of Asians. African Americans, meanwhile, were far more likely than other groups to pray before bedtime almost every night of the week. Who -- or what -- Americans sleep with also appears to vary by ethnicity. Nine out of 10 whites who are married or ""partnered"" sleep with their significant others, a slightly higher rate than that among African Americans. But three-quarters and two-thirds of Hispanics and Asians, respectively, said that they don't sleep with their partner. Those groups, however, were more likely to share a bedroom with their children. ""Asians tend to sleep with children in their beds and that could have an impact on sleep quality because anything that disrupts sleep like a dog or kid in the bed can negatively impact sleep and the restorative value of that sleep,"" Balkin says. Whites were more likely to sleep with their pets than other ethnic groups, the poll showed. Although each group reported getting between six and seven hours of sleep on the average weekday (or other workday), the amount of sleep did vary significantly. African Americans got the least (about 6.25 hours), and whites got the most (just under  seven hours). With numbers like these, it's not surprising that relatively few of the survey respondents reported consistently getting a good night's sleep. ""Most people require seven to nine hours of sleep to feel rested,"" says Balkin. ""The first step is to become aware of the problem, and then make more time for sleep and engage in practices that promote good, healthy sleep."" According to Balkin, good sleep hygiene includes going to bed and waking up at the same time each day (ideally without an alarm clock); using the bedroom only for sleep and sex; abstaining from nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol after 2 p.m.; and avoiding stressful tasks right before bed. Health.com: What's keeping you awake at night? ""If you try all these tips and are still not getting enough sleep or are still sleepy, you may have a problem that requires a greater level of intervention, such as medication or light therapy, which can help re-train or reset your body's internal clock,"" he adds. The rate of diagnosed sleep disorders differs among the groups, the survey found. Whites were more likely to have been diagnosed with insomnia, while African Americans were more likely to have sleep apnea, a breathing problem that causes people to wake up frequently. What else is keeping us awake at night? Roughly 20 percent of whites, African Americans, and Hispanics said that financial problems were causing them to lose sleep at night, compared to just 9 percent of Asians. More so than other groups, Hispanics also worried about health-related concerns. Priyanka Yadav, D.O., a sleep medicine specialist at Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, New Jersey, says that the survey's findings suggest that she and other experts in the field need to tailor their treatment to different ethnicities. While Asians reported the fewest sleep problems and were among the least likely to use sleeping aids (such as medication), for instance, they were also least likely to bring up sleep problems with their doctors. ""Now that I know this, if I had an Asian patient, I would ask them about their sleep to get the dialogue started,"" says Yadav. ""It is really important to realize how ethnicities view sleep, so we can better target our treatment recommendations,"" she adds. In the end, the racial and ethnic differences in the survey may be less important than the fact that so many people struggle to get a good night's, suggests Mark W. Mahowald, M.D., the director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center. ""There are ethnic and cultural differences and socioeconomic factors that play a role in how much sleep everyone gets, but a significant percent of the adult population is sleep deprived,"" he says. ""The main consequence of this is impaired performance in the workplace, in the classroom, and behind the wheel, followed by irritability."" People with busy schedules often cut back on sleep to make time for other things,  Mahowald adds. But, he says, ""Sleep is non-negotiable and is as important as diet and exercise to our overall well-being.""

"(Financial Times) -- Prime minister Manmohan Singh faces a growing political storm over how to measure poverty in India amid fears that new benchmarks proposed by a powerful policymaking body could see many of the country's poor lose their welfare benefits. The poverty line estimates in India, traditionally worked out by calorie intake, are highly sensitive because as many as 400m Indians live on less than $2 a day. Those below the poverty line are entitled to subsidised food and other welfare payments. But new benchmarks by the Planning Commission, submitted in an affidavit to the Supreme Court as part of new food security legislation, suggest that a person living on more than Rs32 ($0.64) a day in urban areas, like New Delhi and Mumbai, would no longer be classified as being below the poverty line. The threshold for rural areas would be Rs26 a day. By comparison, the World Bank's poverty line is $1.25 a day. India is now home to more poor people than the entire sub-Saharan Africa region. Two years ago, a government appointed commission estimated that one in three Indians live below the poverty line. The commission's estimate was higher than an earlier Planning Commission estimate of 28 per cent of the population. But Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the respected economist who is now the Planning Commission's deputy chairman, has argued that up-to-date data will show that India has made considerable progress in reducing poverty levels. The proposed new benchmarks have angered leaders across India's political spectrum. They have also opened India's two most respected government economists -- Mr Singh and Mr Ahluwalia -- up to criticism that they are out of touch with the poor in India, who are struggling with the highest inflation of any large emerging market . Yashwant Sinha, a former finance minister and Bharatiya Janata party leader, lambasted poverty threshold estimates put forward by the Planning Commission as ""laughable"". Mr Sinha derided the body's calculations as having exposed Mr Singh, who cuts an increasingly solitary figure in his cabinet after a year battling high profile scandals, as insensitive to what was ""a matter of life and death"" for many people and the cause of violence across India. ""Neither the prime minister nor the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission has any real idea of poverty. They rarely go to the villages and interact with the poor,"" Mr Sinha said. The benchmarks have also divided the Planning Commission itself. A senior member of the commission told the Financial Times that the poverty line figures should not have been included in the affidavit. He said the government had to do better on how it communicated economic policy to the country's 1.2bn people. ""I wouldn't have put these numbers in,"" he said. ""You can't [as an economic planner in India] get on your high horse of economic rationalism."" Senior Congress party ministers have also raised objections. Jairam Ramesh, the minister for rural development and a close ally of Congress party president Sonia Gandhi, has written to Mr Ahluwalia asking him to consider alternative measurements and warning of possible confrontation. A.K. Shivakumar, a member of the National Advisory Council chaired by Mrs Gandhi, said Rs32 a day went nowhere in India's fast-growing cities where rents are high and food inflation in double digits. © The Financial Times Limited 2011 .","Indian prime minister faces a growing political storm over how to measure poverty .

"(WIRED) -- In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt. Google and Apple basically told the CTIA to stuff it -- they're sticking with their own rating schemes. ""We've put a lot of effort into Android Market's rating system, which now works well globally,"" Google spokesman Christopher Katsaros said in a statement. ""While we support other systems, we think it's best for Android users and developers to stick with Android's existing ratings."" Apple, too, has outlined its app review guidelines in extensive detail, but has not publicly commented on the CTIA app rating issue. In the Android Market, Google assigns content ratings that range from ""Everyone"" to ""Low Maturity"" to ""High Maturity,"" but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings. However, outlines for the ratings are provided in Google's Android Market support forum. In its App Store, Apple provides an age rating ranging from 4+ to 17+, and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating. For instance Plants vs Zombies received a 9+ rating for Infrequent/Mild Horror/Fear Themes and Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence. The CTIA's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five-point scale based on their violence and sexual content. The ratings, which would be controlled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings) would range from ""Everyone"" to ""Adults Only."" Apple's App Store alone has more than half a million apps and Android is getting close to that number with at least 300,000. CTIA announced it would be developing its app rating system in March. The initiative would call for ""voluntary self-certification of apps."" The system would make it easier for parents to see -- regardless of mobile platform -- if an app was appropriate for their child. The mobile application rating system was officially announced on Tuesday. AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile USA, U.S. Cellular and Microsoft are the founding bodies of the age-appropriateness rating system. It works like this: App developers answer an online questionnaire about their app's content, including whether it shares location information, has a social networking component, and if it contains violence or sexual content, among other things. Apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously, and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating, it could appeal it. The ESRB would regularly test popular applications and monitor complaints. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Books, movies, magazines and newspapers repeatedly refer to addiction, usually concerning drugs or alcohol. It is only recently, in the modern realm of celebrity addictions that the public discourse has added sex to the list of potential afflictions (see: Tiger Woods, David Duchovny) and the general public is still rather slow on acceptance. How can something as fun as sex be an addiction, you ask? The answer is, any addiction is potentially destructive, turning something enjoyable, like a pint of beer or an intimate evening into something entirely different. Feeling compelled can take the joy out of anything. ""Shame,"" the excellent and profoundly disturbing sophomore film (following 2008's highly-regarded ""Hunger"") from English director Steve McQueen, is basically a character study of two damaged souls and their relationships both with each other and the world around them. It's a penetrating and deeply unsettling look at addiction, obsession and self-destruction. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is an upwardly-mobile, thirtysomething New Yorker who just happens to spend every waking moment that he's not otherwise occupied with work, engaged in some sort of sexual activity. Pornography, escorts, random encounters, group sex, masturbation ... all are fair game. He is an addict by any definition of the word and lest you consider sex addiction as a comparatively harmless addiction compared with, say, drugs or alcohol, think again. It's as if he's constantly in pain and sex is the only way to stop the agony, to shut his emotional life away in a box. It's routine self-numbing, and however charming or chatty Brandon may be in public, it's all just a means to an end -- the search for sexual release. Maintaining a tenuous balancing act between his work life and his life as an addict, Brandon is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged younger sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). The two have a past. Something has happened in their childhood that has shaped their lives and their relationship and each has dealt with it in a different way. While we might be able to read into their behavior somewhat, we are largely left to imagine what that past might contain. While Brandon has buried his emotions in sexual release, Sissy is the opposite and wears hers on her sleeve, along with scars from a past of cutting and perhaps, suicide attempts. She is all externalized emotions, a gadabout to Brandon's stoic. She's a nightclub performer and extrovert, the exact opposite of her brother's bottled-up persona, and her visit upsets his apple cart completely. In this oil-and-water sibling relationship, all he wants is for her to take life seriously and exhibit some responsibility, while she's trying to get him to loosen up and have some fun. It seems as though neither is capable of doing what the other wants and both are eminently self-destructive. He is used to his solo sex life: He has an extensive porn collection, uses escorts frequently and visits Internet sex sites, all of which are interrupted by Sissy's visit. She has no idea of his addiction and when she stumbles onto it, things go pear-shaped, but fast. Fassbender's performance is not entirely unlike the one he gives in David Cronenberg's ""A Dangerous Method"" in that much of his character's emotional life goes on beneath the surface. However, in ""Shame"" it's reversed. While his portrayal of Carl Jung in the Cronenberg film came alive when he was with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), Brandon shuts down when he's in sexual situations and the only person who can coax an emotion out of him is Sissy -- and that emotion usually is anger. Sissy, on the other hand, is just looking for some love, caring and protection from her big brother. It's clear the two don't see each other very often, otherwise she'd know that Brandon is the last person to go to for those things and the last to understand what she needs. Carey Mulligan more than holds her own against yet another impressive 2011 performance from Fassbender, giving one of the best female performances in a year rife with them. A decent shot at a best supporting actress Oscar nomination, her Sissy is an open wound, raw and emotionally unguarded and working without a safety net. For his part, Fassbender inhabits Brandon like a less-homicidal version of Patrick Bateman (""American Psycho""). Cool, calm and collected, his emotions buried ... until they aren't and they leap out of him in a torrent. Like any addict, he's forever searching for something to soothe his pain. The third major character in ""Shame"" is New York City, and McQueen shows its cold, bleak and rather lonely side. If you've lived there for any length of time, you ought to understand: For such a large and vibrant city, it can make you feel like you're the last person on earth. McQueen uses the subways and dark, outer borough streets, bars and clubs to great effect, leaving most of the city (and most of its occupants) outside a tight frame and out of focus. No sweeping, glorious views of the skyline, but rather tight shots of Brandon on the subway or in a club. Even many of the sex scenes are shot as a collection of limbs and faces and breasts and other various body parts so you often aren't exactly sure where one person ends and another begins. As for said sex scenes, they are anything but sexy. By the time the most graphic of Brandon's encounters occurs, arousal doesn't even enter the mind. Much how ""Leaving Las Vegas"" was unlikely to cause most people to reach for a vodka on the rocks, ""Shame"" is not going to be the cause for much late-night pillow talk. On the other hand, it may just make you reach for that drink. ""Shame"" is rated NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted). There's a lot of graphic sex, all sorts of nudity and the subject matter is pretty damn dark.","""Shame"" is a penetrating, deeply unsettling look at addiction and obsession .
Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is constantly in pain; sex is the only relief .
He is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged sister ."

"Cairo (CNN) -- The next phase of Egypt's complex elections process continues Monday, with runoff races pitting candidates vying to join the lower house of parliament. The two-day vote -- which continues into Tuesday -- comes exactly a week after Egyptians cast ballots for the first time since last February's toppling of long-time President Hosni Mubarak. That vote ended with moderate and more conservative Islamist parties together winning big and earning a majority of seats within the new parliament, called the People's Assembly. Such results appear to mirror recent victories by moderate Islamists in fellow North African nations Morocco and Tunisia. Presidential candidate Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister and Arab League secretary-general, told CNN on Sunday that he expected this week's runoff to change the final mix of parties in the legislative chamber. Still, he suggested that already the announced results should serve as a wake-up call to more liberal and sectarian factions within Egypt. ""The ... final results, I believe, will be more balanced,"" predicted Moussa of the upcoming election. ""(Still), this is a message to the liberal forces that they have to come together and ... mobilize themselves in order to create a strong opposition within the parliament."" Last week, Egyptians could cast three votes: two for independent candidates and one for a party or coalition. Four independent candidates secured seats, including Amr Hamzawy, once a research director at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a spokesman of the ""Board of Wise Men"" that worked to foster negotiations between the government and anti-government protesters earlier this year. But other positions in parliament remain in limbo because no candidate won clear majorities, leading to this week's runoff. It's all part of a multi-step process set up that will shape the makeup of Egypt's legislature and government going forward. The last step takes place in June with presidential elections, according to military leaders who have in effect ruled the country since Mubarak's fall. One hot topic that will face the new government is how to handle Egypt's currently peaceful arrangement with Israel. Under Mubarak and his secular government, Egypt and Israel forged agreements that have resulted in peace and economic cooperation between the two nations. But the successes of Islamists in elections, to date, have raised the specter that major changes, and perhaps rising tensions, could be on the horizon. The relatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party won 40% in the first round of voting for the lower house of parliament, according to Yousri Abdel Kareem, head of the executive office of the Higher Judicial Election Council. The second highest total, at 20%, went to members of the Al Noor Salafi Movement, a hard-line Muslim group. Speaking to his nation's Channel 2 on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak called the Egyptian vote results so far ""very troubling."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added Sunday -- while participating in an annual state memorial service for David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister -- that both countries would be best served by not significantly altering their relationship. ""I hope that whichever government takes power in Egypt would recognize the importance of maintaining the peace agreement with Israel,"" he said. ""There is an importance in recognizing the peace with Israel, both as a value of its own and as a basis for the financial and security stability of the region."" But Moussa said that change may be inevitable, given that ""the Middle East of last year is ... gone for good."" He claimed it should be no surprise that a ""new Arab world"" would want a ""new set of relations,"" stressing that Israel will more likely have positive relationships with its neighbors once it ends its ""occupation"" of Palestinian territories. ""The Israelis must sit now and reflect. Egypt is no (longer) the Egypt they knew (and) the other neighbors are not the same and will not be the same,"" Moussa said. ""There is a window of opportunity for all of us to solve the problems and move on in a totally new era, including Israel."" CNN's Jim Clancy and Guy Azriel and journalist Mohamed Fahmy Fadel contributed to this report.","A two-day runoff starts Monday for remaining seats in Egypt's parliament .

"(CNN) -- The number of people who have driven drunk or drugged is down, a new government survey said Thursday. Still, in an average year, 30 million people drive drunk, according to the survey released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In addition, 10 million people drive after under the influence of drugs, said the agency, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, . ""13.2 percent of all persons 16 or older drove under the influence of alcohol and 4.3 percent of this age group drove under the influence of illicit drugs in the past year,"" it said. Both figures are a drop from recent years. In the time period of 2002 to 2005, the rate of people driving drunk was 14.6%. Those driving drugged was 4.8% during the same period, the agency said. The survey also provides a state-by-state tally of drunk and drugged driving. Wisconsin topped the list of drunk driving at 23.7%. North Dakota was second with 22.4%, the agency said. The highest rate for drugged driving was in Rhode Island at 7.8% and Vermont at 6.6%. Utah and Mississippi had the lowest rate of drunk driving. Iowa and New Jersey had the lowest rate of drugged driving, the agency found. The agency surveyed more than 400,000 people to get its results.","Wisconsin tops of the list of drunk driving, agency says .

"(CNN) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross has been granted access to a detention facility in Syria for the first time since unrest broke out in the country, the committee's president said Monday after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called the breakthrough ""an important step forward for our humanitarian activities in Syria."" Kellenberger's meeting with al-Assad occurred amid mounting reports of bloodshed by Syrian security forces. On Monday, security forces killed six people during an ongoing crackdown in the province of Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group. The group also reported a similar offensive in Idlib province, where security forces entered with seven armored vehicles, nine cars and four buses. Seventy people were arrested in the operation, and dozens of homes were raided, the opposition group said. Syria has been engulfed in public protest for months, and the regime has been accused internationally of a crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The government has maintained it is targeting armed terrorists. But opposition activists say it is a systematic, sustained slaughter. ""Ensuring that the sick and the wounded have access to medical care will be among the particularly urgent humanitarian challenges to be addressed with the Syrian authorities,"" the Red Cross said in a statement. The committee will initially be allowed to see only people detained by the Ministry of Interior, Kellenberger said, adding, ""We are hopeful that we will soon be able to visit all detainees."" Also Monday, the Arab League announced that its secretary general, Nabil al-Araby, will travel to Damascus on Wednesday. The Arab League last week publicly called for restraint and an end to the violence in Syria. Kellenberger's two-day visit kicked off Sunday with meetings with Prime Minister Adel Safar and Foreign Minister Walid Muallem. The Syrian government said it briefed Kellenberger on the regime's efforts to ""restore stability and security to the country."" Reports have surfaced of people not being able to access medical care during security operations. The foreign minister ""stressed that the public hospitals in Syria are constantly ready and provide the required medical services for all the citizens,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Monday. The news agency added that Muallem ""appreciated the humanitarian activities of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Organization which has played an effective role in providing the humanitarian needs of the citizens during the current crisis."" Also Monday, Kellenberger discussed with al-Assad ""the rules governing the use of force by security forces ... and the obligation to respect the physical and psychological well-being and human dignity of detainees,"" according to the ICRC. On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said four people were killed in Idlib province and three others were killed in the village of Tahtaiya by security forces pursuing wanted activists. The opposition group also said a resident from Suraqib who was detained for 20 days died in detention after being tortured. It also claimed that at least 15 people were wounded in the city of Homs due to heavy gunfire by security forces. Another opposition activist group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said eight were killed in Idlib, four in Hama province, and one each in the provinces of Homs and Damascus. Meanwhile, the Syrian news agency reported that six troops and three civilians were killed near the city of Muhardeh in Hama province. The agency said a ""terrorist group"" ambushed a bus carrying troops and civilians, killing nine and injuring 17. A security patrol pursued the attackers and killed three of them, wounding a fourth and seizing explosives, guns and medical supplies from their stolen pickup, the news agency said. CNN cannot independently confirm either the opposition or government claims. Syria has made it difficult for foreign journalists to work in the country since the unrest started, restricting their entry. Officials do not usually comment on opposition allegations concerning the killing or wounding of protesters. The United Nations has reported more than 2,200 people killed in Syria since February, including more than 350 people since security forces stepped up operations against demonstrators during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. When Kellenberger visited Syrian officials in June, he reached an understanding that would give the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent ""enhanced access to areas of unrest, and negotiations would take place concerning ICRC visits to detainees."" He aims to ""review progress made in both these areas,"" the ICRC said, including ""an opportunity to discuss the impending start of ICRC visits to persons detained by the Ministry of the Interior."" The agency ""visits detainees in order to assess the conditions in which they are being held and the treatment they receive,"" it said. This week's visit comes on the heels of an Amnesty International report detailing the deaths of at least 88 people in detention and describing widespread abuse of prisoners. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","NEW: Arab League secretary general will travel to Damascus .

"New York (CNN) -- Jeff Parness still remembers the pain of September 11, 2001, when his friend and business partner, Hagay Shefi, was among the thousands killed in the World Trade Center attacks. But Parness, a native New Yorker, also hasn't forgotten the support that his hometown received from other communities in the immediate aftermath. Many cities -- in the United States and around the world -- sent volunteers and supplies to aid the rescue and recovery effort. ""9/11 changed all of us forever, but 9/12 changed us just as much,"" said Parness, 45. ""That outpouring of kindness and generosity, to me, was more powerful than the terror that happened the day before."" That spirit of goodwill inspired Parness to create New York Says Thank You, an organization that sends volunteers from New York City to disaster-stricken communities every year -- normally around the 9/11 anniversary. To date, more than 7,000 people have participated in the group's rebuilding projects. Running a nonprofit isn't something that Parness, a former software venture capitalist who lives in Manhattan, ever thought he'd do. He had never been community service-oriented. But a suggestion from his 5-year-old son changed all of that. In November 2003, Parness' son, Evan, saw a news report about wildfires near San Diego. He asked his dad if he could send the children in California some of his toys. Parness suggested that they ask all of the children in their apartment building for donations. Three days later, Parness and two friends were headed to San Diego in a truck half-filled with toys and supplies. Parness put a sign on the truck that read: ""New York Says Thank You."" ""I wanted to make a bigger statement,"" he said. ""I wanted to let people know that New Yorkers will never forget what people did for us after 9/11."" As Parness and his buddies made their way to California, people they encountered along the way added donations. By the time they arrived, the truck was full. The whole experience deeply touched Parness, who wanted to turn it into something more. That's when he came up with the idea of helping a different city every year. ""On a day that's about destruction ... let's create an organization that's focused on helping people rebuild,"" he said. ""It's our way to really honor the sense of spirit and volunteerism (of) 9/12."" Each year, Parness finds a community that has been hit by a disaster and he selects a structure to rebuild there. The projects often hold some significance to the area -- a historic church in Indiana, a veterans' home in Texas, a Boy Scout camp in Iowa. But Parness says that in a way, what's being built really doesn't matter. ""It's not about building structures. It's about building hope,"" he said. ""We want able to touch people who are still recovering from disasters and show them that other people care."" For the organization's first project in September 2004, Parness brought 14 volunteers from New York City to rebuild homes destroyed by the wildfires outside of San Diego. The next build, in September 2005, was in Utica, Illinois, a city that had been hit by a deadly tornado. Thirty New Yorkers made the trip this time, and they were joined by eight people from California who had received help the previous year. It is this cycle of ""paying it forward"" that is at the heart of New York Says Thank You. It's also part of what gives the group its unique character: Nearly all of its volunteers have survived a disaster of some sort, be it natural or man-made. That shared connection means a lot to firefighter Brian Fitzpatrick, who was at ground zero on 9/11 and lost 10 members of his fire academy class that day. As a volunteer for New York Says Thank You the last four years, he says he is motivated by helping others who've also lived through a tragedy. ""You're there to let them know that ... they're not alone,"" he said. ""It's like a crazy club that you join."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . The organization has helped communities in nine states since 2003, and its web of volunteers now extends across the country. With more volunteers from outside New York than from the city itself, Parness says his group isn't really about New York anymore -- it's about America. Eric Kreippen, a firefighter from Slidell, Louisiana, would agree. He has been a dedicated volunteer since Parness' group came to his community after Hurricane Katrina. He says he's ""addicted"" to the experience, and he brings more people with him every year. ""This past year, I brought 22 people to Arkansas,"" Kreippen said. ""This whole 'paying it forward' thing, it's just contagious."" Every September, Parness' army of disaster survivors -- usually 200-300 people -- rolls into town for what amounts to an old-fashioned barn-raising. The atmosphere is like a family reunion as volunteers from past projects reunite. The locals ""can't believe that people from Manhattan and Slidell and Indiana and all of these towns are all in their town to help them,"" Kreippen said. ""You get the thanks, and it's 'No, we're here because we went through the same thing!' "" Working side by side, many volunteers form friendships and stay in touch year-round. ""You're banging nails and building something, but it's the relationships that help you heal,"" Fitzpatrick said. Many volunteers discover that the work helps them move forward with their own lives. Megan Manning lost her husband on 9/11, and she has been volunteering with New York Says Thank You since 2007. She said the experiences have completely changed her attitude every time September 11 comes up on the calendar. ""Ever since it started, I wake up on 9/11 and I feel grateful,"" she said. ""That's huge for me."" It's huge for Parness as well. ""When I started this, I thought it was about building homes and churches that were destroyed, "" Parness said. ""When we went on ... I realized that 50% of value went to the survivors, but 50% went to the volunteers. It's empowering."" This year, for the 10th anniversary of 9/11, Parness is planning to go to Ellijay, Georgia, a small town that was hit by a tornado earlier this month. There, he hopes to rebuild a barn that housed Build An Ark Animal Rescue, a sanctuary that saves and rehabilitates animals. ""We always look for special projects that could benefit a community,"" Parness said. ""This lovely woman, Susan Littlejohn, lived in the barn with 65 animals that she used as therapeutic companions for disabled children and senior citizens. ... We couldn't think of a better place to do this year."" A new documentary about Parness' group, also called New York Says Thank You, will premiere April 28 at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. Parness says the film's message is about the power of volunteerism, and he hopes it will inspire people to get involved, in some way, in their community. ""This is about honoring that volunteer spirit,"" he said. ""It shows that nothing is impossible if you can come together."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Federal officials charged 20 people Wednesday in a scheme to recruit illegal immigrants from Russia and Eastern European countries to work as exotic dancers in New York strip clubs, according to Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Charges against the 20 individuals include racketeering, extortion, visa and marriage fraud, and transporting and harboring illegal immigrants. The accused are alleged to be members of the Gambino and Bonanno organized crime families, according to federal authorities. ""The defendants themselves had one thing in common -- the desire to turn the women they allegedly helped enter this country illegally into their personal profit centers,""Bharara said. ""Today's arrests have brought an end to their illicit activities."" Several of the accused are alleged to have run the ""Strip Club Enterprise,"" which controlled a series of strip clubs throughout Queens and Long Island. Through these clubs, the accused are alleged to have recruited Eastern European women to enter the United States on student J1 visas to perform as strippers in their enterprises. Prosecutors also charge the defendants threatened physical violence and economic harm if the owners and operators of New York strip clubs as part of a broad extortion scheme. ""The defendants controlled their business and protected their turf through intimidation and threats of physical and economic harm,"" said James T. Hayes, Jr., special agent in charge with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which led the investigation. ""Today's arrests bring to an end a long-standing criminal enterprise operated by colluding organized crime entities that profited wildly through a combination of extortion and fraud."" Some of the exotic dancers brought illegally into the United States were also matched with U.S. citizens in fraudulent marriages to resolve their immigrations status, prosecutors said in the indictment. Before dawn on Wednesday, federal agents arrived at Cheetah's Gentlemans Club and Restaurant off Times Square in Manhattan, Gallagher's 2000 in Queens, NY, and seven other New York-area strip clubs and confiscated files and documents. Attorneys for those indicted were not immediately available for comment.","The women are from Russia and Eastern European countries .

"(CNN) -- Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who remains a popular figure in his country, vowed in a video posted on YouTube to beat his recently diagnosed throat cancer. The two-minute personal message was published Tuesday, the same day as Lula was released from the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital in Sao Paulo, where he underwent his first round of chemotherapy this week. Doctors surgically inserted a port that allows the transfer of medicine straight to the former president's vein. Lula then underwent his first chemotherapy session, which went ""without incident,"" according to the hospital. Doctors have said that they found a tumor located in Lula's larynx.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- After a nearly year-long investigation, police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of Long Island, New York, beach are linked to a single killer. ""The theory is now that we're dealing with one serial killer,"" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told CNN affiliate WABC on Tuesday. He noted the killer did not ""necessarily do the same thing all the time."" ""What's common here is the dumping ground,"" he added. Dormer previously said that only the bodies of four females uncovered in December were thought to be the work of a serial killer or killers. It is not clear what prompted the change. Authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case. But it's unclear whether they have shed any light on an investigation that has drawn state and federal agents and garnered national attention. In June, police upped the ante in their search for a culprit. The reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $5,000 -- was raised five-fold, making it the largest offered in Suffolk County history. It was an apparent bid to fill out a case that some fear has gone cold. ""We're hoping the increased reward money will encourage somebody to come forward by calling the police in respect to the families and to (the) victims,"" Lt. Robert Donohue said at the time. At least 10 sets of human remains have been found in Nassau and Suffolk counties since December. But the woman whose disappearance triggered the searches, 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert, remains missing. The New Jersey woman was last seen in May 2010 at a private party at a home in Long Island's Oak Beach community. The first four bodies have since been identified. They, like Gilbert, had advertised for prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist. Their remains were found among bushes along a quarter-mile strip of beachfront property, according to police. More human remains were found on March 29 and April 4. Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in May that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims. In September, authorities released composite sketches of what two unidentified victims might have looked like. Authorities at the time said the evidence suggested two other killers dumped bodies along Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, about 40 miles east of New York City. ""This investigation is not an episode of 'CSI' or 'Criminal Minds' that is going to be solved in a one-hour period,"" Spota said of the serial killer probe. ""Most likely, it ... is going to take a very long period of time to complete."" Spota was not immediately available for comment Wednesday regarding police statements that the killings are now thought to be the work of a single killer.","Police say they think a single serial killer is responsible for bodies found in Long Island .
Police previously thought only the first set of remains could be the work of a killer or killers .

"(CNN) -- Southern California residents and recovery crews continued their cleanup efforts Saturday, two days after powerful winds downed power lines, damaged structures and caused other devastation. ""From what we have been told, this was probably the worst windstorm to hit this particular area in over a decade,"" said Bob Spencer, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. While the weather was good Saturday, with clear skies and high temperatures in the 60s, that didn't mean the headaches were over. Residents still faced the prospect of new wildfires breaking out and spreading -- as evidenced by the red-flag warning in effect through Sunday morning in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The National Weather Service issued the warning -- which means that conditions are favorable for fire to grow rapidly if it ignites -- through Sunday morning due to gusty northeast winds and low relative humidity. The strong winds that continued to blow Saturday, though, were well short of the hurricane-force gusts measured Thursday and Friday. It was an extreme manifestation of a regional reality: Santa Ana winds, a condition in which strong winds descend to the Pacific Coast around Los Angeles from inland desert regions, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service reported gusts stronger than 140 mph along the Sierra Crest mountain ridge, while there were roughly 100 mph-hour winds in the San Gabriel Mountain Foothills of southern California, said Southern California Edison spokesman Gil Alexander. Widespread damage in southwestern California led Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich to issue a state of emergency ""to ensure that state and federal financial resources are available to serve county residents impacted by the windstorms."" The effects are still being felt. Southern California Edison, for example, had 77,400 customers still without power as of 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) on Saturday, said Alexander. And the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported in an online news release that, as of 3 p.m., about 7,000 households in its coverage area still didn't have electricity. Those numbers, while significant, mark a major drop from those reported several days ago. More than 200,000 of the Los Angeles utility's customers didn't have power at one point, while Edison had about 250,000 in the dark, said Alexander. ""Four hours ago, we had over 90,000 customers without power,"" Alexander said early Saturday evening. ""That tells you crews are making progress, rather than responding to more outages."" Communities along the San Gabriel Mountain foothills, where he lives -- including Monrovia, Sierra Madre and La Canada Flintridge -- suffered especially extensive damage in Edison's territory. Alexander said that the utility had more than 500 personnel out working and urged residents to steer clear of power-lines for their own safety. Los Angeles County also had ""several hundred personnel spanned out across"" the county to deal with fallen trees and clear out debris, said Spencer. That includes 50 county public works personnel alone in the hard-hit city of Pasadena, with the spokesman estimating they would be there for at least a week. One positive, aside from gusty if not likely damaging winds, is that the weather appears to be cooperating. In Pasadena, conditions are forecast to be sunny or mostly sunny, with day-time highs in 60s and nighttime lows in the 40s, all next week, according to the weather service.","85,000 households were still without power Saturday evening, two utilities report .

"(CNN) -- New Inter Milan coach Claudio Ranieri suffered his first defeat on Saturday as Joel Obi was sent off in an ill-tempered 3-0 home reverse against new Serie A leaders Napoli. Inter were already annoyed to have a 24th-minute goal by Giampaolo Pazzini ruled out for offside, but tempers flared when Nigeria international midfielder Obi was sent to the dressing room for his second yellow card four minutes before halftime. Television replays showed that Obi pushed Christian Maggio outside the box, but a penalty was awarded by Gianluca Rocchi. Marek Hamsik's spot-kick was saved by Julio Cesar but Hugo Campagnaro followed up to deftly score from the rebound, and the goal was allowed to stand despite the defender clearly being inside the area when the penalty was taken. Cesar was booked for shouting at the match official, and the Brazilian was lucky not to be sent off as he continued to harass him. An angry Ranieri watched the second half from the stands, and saw Napoli take control as Maggio capitalized on poor defending by Japanese defender Yuto Nagatomo to beat a stranded Cesar in the 56th minute. Inter survived an incredible close-range miss from Juan Zuniga, but Hamsik settled the match with 15 minutes to play as he beat the offside trap to collect a pass from Ezequiel Lavezzi and beat Cesar. ""He wasn't equal in his decisions, it was an unfair game,"" Ranieri told reporters in quotes carried by AFP. ""The first half was a great game but Obi was given a first yellow card when he clearly won the ball. ""Then (the foul) was outside the area and he was given a second yellow card and he was off. That ruined the game. ""It's a shame because we tried very hard, but (the referee) messed up everything there was to mess up."" The result put Napoli on 10 points -- two clear of Juventus, Udinese and Roma -- after completing an early-season double over the two Milan clubs. Juve host defending champions AC Milan in the pick of Sunday's matches, while Udinese are at home to second-bottom Bologna. Inter, who had won the first two matches of Ranieri's reign, remained on four points after five matches -- just above the relegation zone. Roma earlier ended Atalanta's unbeaten start to the season with a 3-1 home victory. Pre-season signings Bojan Krkic and Pablo Osvaldo gave the capital club a 2-0 halftime lead before Argentine striker German Denis reduced the deficit soon after the interval. Brazilian midfielder Simplicio netted with nine minutes to go, giving Luis Enrique's side a second successive win and leaving Atalanta on four points along with Inter and promoted Novara. In Spain, Malaga went top of La Liga with a last-gasp 3-2 victory at home to Getafe as Brazilian forward Julio Baptista scored a spectacular overhead kick two minutes into injury-time. Getafe had Algerian midfielder Medhi Lacen sent off for a second booking soon after Miku made it 2-1, but Malaga equalized with two minutes to play through Italian midfielder Enzo Maresca. Big-spending Malaga lead on goal difference from Valencia, who earlier moved up to 13 points with a 1-0 win at home to lowly Granada thanks to an early long-range left-foot strike from Sergio Canales. Previous leaders Real Betis host Levante on Sunday, when fourth-placed champions Barcelona travel to Sporting Gijon and last season's runners-up Real Madrid visit Espanyol. In Saturday's other matches, Mallorca came from behind to draw 2-2 at Osasuna as Israeli striker Tomer Hemed netted twice from the penalty spot. Villarreal needed a late leveler from Paraguay midfielder Hernan Perez to earn a 2-2 draw at home to Real Zaragoza, while Rayo Vallecano drew 1-1 at Racing Santander.","Inter Milan beaten 3-0 at home by Napoli as Joel Obi is sent off in first half .

"(CNN) -- The debate in Congress this week about whether to pay for extending the payroll tax cut by imposing a new tax on millionaires will have nothing to do with solving our nation's economic challenges and everything to do with election-year politics. Senate Democratic leaders have already signaled they will use the debate as a purely partisan exercise designed to embarrass Republicans into opposing tax cuts for the poor while defending tax cuts for the rich. I intend to offer an alternative. Instead of punishing the rich with higher taxes, I will give Congress the option of helping pay for extending the payroll tax cut by ending welfare to the wealthy. Read Sen. Coburn's report, ""Subsidies of the Rich and Famous"" Every year, politicians on both sides engage in a process of reverse Robin Hood in which they steal $30 billion from low- and middle-income Americans and provide handouts to the rich and famous. Millionaires receive tax earmarks and deductions crafted by both parties that allow them to write off billions each year. These write-offs include mortgage interest deductions on second homes and luxury yachts, gambling losses, business expenses, electric vehicle credits and even child care tax credits. Meanwhile, direct handouts for millionaires have included $74 million in unemployment checks, $316 million in farm subsidies, $89 million for preservation of ranches and estates, $9 billion in retirement checks and $7.5 million to compensate for damages caused by emergencies to property that should have been insured. Millionaires have even borrowed $16 million in government-backed education loans to attend college since 2007. The goal of highlighting these excesses is not to demonize those who are successful. Instead, by highlighting the sheer stupidity of pampering the wealthy with lavish benefits through our safety net and tax code, I hope to make a moral and economic argument for real entitlement and tax reform. The most troubling gap in America today is not an income gap. It is an integrity gap -- and even intelligence gap -- between Washington and the rest of the country. Families are struggling to make ends meet and are making painful economic choices as politicians in Washington borrow billions to provide welfare to the wealthy. Politicians on both sides refuse to fix big problems and defend stupid policies because changing those policies would involve upending a comfortable political status quo. It's important for taxpayers to understand that these distortions are not accidental loopholes in the law. To the contrary, these provisions are intentional efforts to get all Americans to buy into a system where everyone appears to benefit while the poor and middle class are being robbed. In the case of entitlements such as Social Security, progressives have argued for decades that a program for poor people will be a poor program. Yet, Warren Buffett hardly needs the same retirement check as his secretary. Ending welfare handouts to millionaires will strengthen, not undermine, the safety net for people who need it most. Even Canada has adopted means testing in its retirement program by limiting benefits for high-earners. That fact is we can't afford the system we have today. Only by adopting common-sense reforms can we sustain a safety net for those who truly need assistance. On the tax side, both parties have been reluctant to alter tax earmarks and deductions, such as the mortgage interest deduction. These are considered sacrosanct. Yet, it's hard to understand how limiting the mortgage interest deductions for yachts will hurt working families. Defending spending in the tax code is not conservative. Providing tax earmarks and deductions to millionaires is a tax increase on everyone who doesn't receive the benefit. The only way we will enact real tax reform, and grow the economy, is by lowering tax rates and broadening the base by scaling back these egregious handouts. This is precisely what President Ronald Reagan did in 1986. Even though the super committee failed to reach an agreement on broad deficit reduction, there is no reason why the other super committee -- Congress -- should drag its feet. Change in Washington tends to start with small steps. There is no better place to start than scaling back ludicrous handouts to millionaires that expose an entitlement system and tax code that desperately need to be reformed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Coburn.","Tom Coburn: It's not necessary to raise taxes on the rich to pay for payroll tax cut .
Instead, he says, end the annual $30 billion in tax break handouts to the rich and famous .

Earmarks, deductions for millionaires amount to a tax hike on everyone else, he says ."
"(Mashable) -- So you want to work at Facebook, one of the world's hottest companies -- what do you have to get your foot in the door and get noticed? It's not going to be easy -- you have competition. Facebook received 250,000 job applications last year and is consistently rated as one of the best places to work. And with Facebook's IPO around the corner, the competition for jobs is only going to heat up. There are plenty of ways to get noticed and stand above the crowd, though. I chatted with Thomas Arnold, head of recruiting for the social network, on what the company looks for and what it takes to get a job at Facebook. What jobs are available at Facebook? Ever since Facebook announced it was moving to a bigger office and raised $2 billion in funding, it has been ramping up its hiring. While there are many openings in legal, communications, HR, marketing, online operations, business development, IT, design, user experience and internationalization, the company is especially looking for technical talent, especially software engineers and product managers. The Facebook interview process . I actually went through the entire Facebook interview process in 2008, before I joined Mashable as an associate editor. And while it's definitely changed since I applied for a job on the company's User Operations team, the basic format has remained the same. The first step is almost always a recruiter phone-screening -- Facebook will begin exploring your resume, asking you about your previous work, especially about what you've built and what leadership roles you've had in the past. Sometimes there's a second screening, depending on the role. If you pass the screening, the company will fly you out to its Silicon Valley headquarters for a series of on-site interviews with the hiring manager (your potential future boss) and a group of your peers -- in other words, you will be interviewed by the members of the team you're hoping to join. As Arnold explained to me, these interviews are designed to determine whether you have the skills for the job and whether you're a cultural fit. The group then makes ""a collective decision on whether you're a great fit"" for the position. The process itself greatly varies from group to group -- expect more technical skill challenges if you're applying for an engineering job. Oh, and one extra piece of advice from me: Always put the user first in any scenario or interview question. Standing apart from the crowd . With more than a quarter of a million applicants, how does Facebook whittle down the applicant pool? ""We're primarily looking for builders,"" Arnold says. He explains that Facebook has an entrepreneurial spirit and is a flat organization, and thus it's looking for people who can thrive in that environment. Employees need to be self-starters who don't need a lot of direction, so autonomy and self-motivation are highly valued. Builders -- especially engineers who like to build projects on their own and have cool, working products or apps they can show off -- are sought after by the Facebook team. If someone builds a unique application and/or solves a problem in a way that hasn't been done before, he's going to get Facebook's attention. Strong applicants to Facebook also ""just get the social space,"" Arnold says. They not only understand the product, but can see the company's vision. Even more important is that they're active users of the product. This may seem like a no-brainer, but Arnold says his team finds a lot of applicants who haven't used their Facebook accounts in weeks or even months. And that is a very clear sign to Facebook that the person won't be a good fit. Finally, it's very helpful to know someone at Facebook who can vouch for you -- this was true even when I interviewed with the social network three years ago. While I got special consideration due to my unique history with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, I still had a Facebook reference. Final thoughts . While I ultimately failed to secure a job at Facebook, you don't have to let that be the case for you. For those of you applying to non-technical roles, be sure you're active users, understand the company culture and have a resume filled with leadership and ""builder"" activities. It's more impressive if you launched an organization or product than if you simply took it over. For technical talent, the best thing you can do is build something. If you build a really impressive iPhone application that gains some traction, you're going to get noticed. If you are a major contributor of open source code to various projects, you're going to get noticed. In the end though, the big filter is cultural fit. There isn't really much you can do to prepare for that -- the Facebook team simply knows if you're going to mesh well with them or if you're not going to be able to keep up. And as I said before, be sure to have an employee refer you. Otherwise, you're going to have a really difficult time just getting the phone screening. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- I would not take anything away from the success of Occupy Wall Street in bringing so many people together in Lower Manhattan and elsewhere. It is quite an accomplishment. Notwithstanding what has happened so far, the hard work of leadership has not yet begun. It is relatively easy to get disempowered, angry, frustrated people together to rail against a wide range of enemies and scapegoats. It is quite another to effect change. Like it or not, the values and processes that have created the Occupy Wall Street phenomenon are inadequate and ill-suited to taking the next steps and creating real impact. The democratic, inclusive, and consensus-driven norms that have guided OWS up to this point will not get it to the next level -- that is, if there is real interest in changing the current reality rather than just complaining about it and speaking out against it. Another view: Occupy beta tests a new way of living . Here are three big examples of the self-imposed constraints that will get in the way. First, everyone's grievance is equal to everyone else's grievance. Anti-capitalism, lack of health care for the uninsured, tuition hikes at public universities, and many other complaints share the stage. The message is muddied. Clarifying the message and focusing on specific targets are necessary next steps. They will inevitably leave some of the grievances on the cutting room floor, and leave those who care most about those abandoned grievances disappointed and alienated both from the rest of the group and from their own constituents who are not camping out at Zuccotti Park, but who expected them to ensure that their particular issues stayed front and center. Second, the nonhierarchical consensus-driven process will soon reach the end of its utility, at least in its purest form. If OWS is to lead change rather than just call for change, some individuals will have to step up and take on authority roles. The presence of authority is essential in order to move this work forward. Someone, or some ones, will have to provide some of the functions of authority -- direction, protection and order -- so that the movement can begin to make hard choices, create priorities, allocate human and financial resources, and keep the anarchistic outliers from undermining the potential outcomes. When people have different agendas, the downside of operating by consensus is that the only way to get everybody to agree is to agree on something that is so ethereal and abstract it becomes meaningless. That works in an election where you are mobilizing people to vote (see Obama 2008 and ""Change We Can Believe in""), but not to generate change from the outside in. Third, the movement will have to decide whether it is willing to create change by infiltrating the dreaded system it is trying to change. There is no other way except violent revolution, and if those in Zuccotti Park think there has been pushback so far, wait till they see what is in store for them if there were to be violence. History has important lessons here. The great movements of the 1960s in civil rights, women's rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War were narrowly focused, well organized, strategically brilliant, and, while attracting large numbers of people, managed by people who took on authority roles and made essential decisions, albeit often with significant consultative processes. They all used their share of extreme measures, but all were directed toward capturing the attention and support of people on the sidelines. Violence, when it surfaced at all, was perpetrated by the system, with the protesters having adroitly stimulated the establishment powers to overreact, thus generating more popular support for their cause. The over-the-top response by law enforcement to nonviolent civil rights protests was so embarrassing to Northern liberals like me that we had to get involved and provide the civil rights cause the additional personpower, financial resources and political clout to create change. More recently -- and both sides hate this comparison -- in a remarkably short period of time, the tea party movement went from a rowdy group of people who felt disenfranchised in different ways to a nonviolent army with a sharply focused, clearly articulated agenda, and fierce commitment to infiltrate the system in order to change it. It has been amazingly successful, influencing elections and the political discourse and soon winning elections with candidates who were completely beholden to its agenda, whether they believed in it all or not. Whether you like it or not, the tea party has changed the system. Where does that leave OWS? Very soon, it will come to a fork in the road. Numbers are very important in a democratic society, and OWS is beginning to have numbers that have caused some establishment members they are railing against to take notice, either positively or negatively. Right now, the Zuccotti Park protesters are being used by those establishment folks, one way or the other, to shore up their own bases and spruce up their own images. Those numbers will only translate into power, and then change, if they can be harnessed to raise the heat on the decision-makers to get them to do something they would otherwise not do. That translates, alas, into joining the system they are protesting against, by taking a page out of the tea party's book and working in campaigns, raising money, and running for office. Leadership is a risky and subversive activity. The crowds at Zuccotti Park and their colleagues in other cities have yet to demonstrate that they are interested in anything other than, well, demonstrating. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marty Linsky.","Marty Linsky says it's impressive that Occupy Wall Street has so many supporters .
But he says it isn't likely to have a big impact unless it develops leadership .
Governing by consensus means agreement on watered-down, vague goals, he says .
Linsky: Great movements of 1960s were narrowly focused, well organized and strategic ."
"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored twice for Barcelona as the European champions crushed BATE Borisov 5-0 to claim their first Group H win in this season's Champions League. Barca opened the scoring in the 19th minute of a wet evening in Belarus, when Alyaksandr Volodko turned a Dani Alves cross from the right into his own net and they doubled their lead three minutes later when Pedro headed home David Villa's left-wing center. Goalkeeper Alyaksandr Gutor gifted Barca their third, dropping Pedro's cross onto Messi's head for the Argentine's first goal of the night, while Messi added his second soon after the interval -- firing home after exchanging passes with Alves. Messi has now scored 14 goals already this season and takes his total number of Barcelona goals to 193, joint second with Hungarian Ladislao Kubala in Barca's all-time list of leading scorers. Villa added a last-gasp fifth goal for Barca, after BATE had made a mess of a free-kick, as the Catalan giants equalled their biggest-ever Champions League win. Barcelona are level on four points with Milan at the top of the group, after the Italian champions saw off Czech side Viktoria Plzen 2-0 at the San Siro. Milan opened the scoring in the 53rd minute when Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked his return from injury by netting from the penalty spot after Marian Cisovsky handled in the area. And Ibrahimovic set up Milan's second 13 minutes later, holding off his marker before slipping the ball through for Antonio Cassano to deftly find the net. BATE Borisov and Viktoria Plzen are joint third on one point apiece and already look to have a mountain to climb against the two giants of the group. Chelsea are top of Group E with four points from their first two matches, despite conceding a late penalty in a 1-1 draw at Spanish side Valencia. England midfielder Frank Lampard, who was restored to the side by manager Andre Villas-Boas after being left out of their weekend win over Swansea, opened the scoring in the 56th minute when converting Florent Malouda's pull-back. But, just three minutes from time, Roberto Soldado levelled from the spot after substitute Salomon Kalou handled a cross in the area. Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table with three points after a 2-0 home victory over Belgian champions Genk. Lars Bender opened the scoring on the half hour mark, slamming home a shot from a tight angle, and veteran midfielder Michael Ballack sealed the win in injury time with a superb volley -- his first goal in more than 18 months. Valencia are third in the table on two points, after drawing their opening two games, with Genk propping up the others with just a single point from their two matches. In Group F, Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain entered the record books as the London side beat Olympiakos 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium. Chamberlain, 18, opened the scoring with a composed eighth minute finish to become the youngest-ever Englishman to score in the competition. Brazilian left-back Andre Santos scored his first Arsenal goal from a tight angle to double their lead before David Fuster pulled a goal back with an unmarked header from inside the area. Arsenal are second in the table with four points, two behind French champions Marseille, who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund. Andre Ayew gave the hosts a 1-0 half-time lead when he fired home a low shot from outside the area and they doubled their lead in the 62nd minute when Loic Remy blasted home after superbly chesting the ball down. Ayew added his second, and Marseille's third, seven minutes later, converting from the penalty spot after Remy had been bundled to the ground by Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl. The only down side for Marseille was the late dismissal of Jordan Ayew, who was shown a second yellow card for diving. Meanwhile, Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg battled back from going behind to claim a 3-1 Group G win over 10-man Porto. Europa League winners Porto went ahead in the 10th minute when Colombian James Rodriguez netted from Hulk's right-wing cross, but the home side drew level 10 minutes later when Roman Shirokov scored from the edge of the area after goalkeeper Helton had deflected a Viktor Faizulin cross into his path. Porto had defender Jorge Fucile sent off for two yellow cards just before the break -- and Zenit took control in the second half. Shirokov scored his and Zenit's second when converting from close range and Danny added a third 18 minutes from time when turning home Alexander Kerzhakov's cross. However, surprise leaders of the group after two matches are Cypriot side APOEL Nicosia, who drew 1-1 at last season's quarterfinalists Shakhtar Donetsk. That result leaves APOEL on four points, with Zenit and Porto on three apiece and Shakhtar trailing on a single point.","Lionel Messi scores twice to help Barcelona thump BATE Borisov 5-0 in Belarus .

"(WIRED) -- Steve Jobs made it clear what he thought of 7-inch tablets in October 2010. They're ""too small,"" and as good as ""dead on arrival."" But the announcement of and anticipation surrounding Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet may soon have Jobs eating his words. If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard the news, Amazon debuted its $200 7-inch tablet, the Kindle Fire, this week. Make no mistake: It's no iPad. There's no front-facing or rear-facing camera, and it's only got 8 GB of storage. But it's not meant to be an iPad. It's a completely different kind of tablet, designed for the pure consumer. That is, it's designed for consumptive behavior: reading, listening to music, watching video content. The lack of local storage isn't an issue, either; it's meant to take advantage of the cloud with services like Amazon's $80 yearly Prime service, as well as Amazon Cloud Drive. And the smaller form factor makes it extra portable, easy to whip out on the bus or the subway (much like a Kindle). ""With a 7-inch device, you can easily take your Kindle Fire with you and hold it in one hand for gaming and movie watching,"" Amazon representative Kinley Campbell said via e-mail. UX design consultant Greg Nudelman thinks that 7-inch tablets could become just as popular as larger 9.7 and 10.1-inch tablets, ""but the types of applications and the context and length of use between might be very different."" The iPad, although portable, is more difficult to manage with a single hand due to its larger size. And while it is certainly geared towards consumptive behavior, the iPad also strives to break the mobile-PC barrier by becoming a tool for creation, with programs like iMovie for iPad and GarageBand for iPad allowing users to produce content rather than just passively take it in. Whether it actually accomplishes that or not is subjective (some scoff at GarageBand's limited capabilities), but it's possible, and likely that more apps of this nature are in the pipeline (third-party produced or otherwise). Amazon's decision to debut a smaller-sized tablet was likely influenced by the players in the current tablet market. The 7-inch space has the least resistance, DisplaySearch's Richard Shim says. Its direct competition is more likely to be the Barnes & Noble Nook Color, which also runs Android and touts a similar form factor, than Apple's iPad. That's exactly what fueled Velocity, makers of the 7-inch Android-running Cruz tablet, to choose that size. ""We wanted to avoid the head-to-head comparisons to the 10-inch iPad â€” ours is a very different product that goes after a different target customer,"" marketing manager Josh Covington said. The smaller size also allowed Amazon to more easily make a splash with a lower price point, something other 7-inch tablet manufacturers are going to have to mimic to stay competitive. Take HTC, which just dropped the price of its 7-inch Flyer tablet from an iPad-range $499 to a more affordable $299. Samsung also jumped in on the hype, introducing its Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus on Friday. If Samsung can manage a similar price, the Kindle Fire could have another legitimate competitor. And just in case it crosses your mind, a 7-inch tablet would not be something Apple would likely ever debut. Apple has been tremendously successful with its 9.7-inch iPad, which flew off shelves shortly after its debut and has continued solid sales since. Unless that changes for some reason, there isn't a need for Apple to break out a smaller iPad, economically speaking. It's also not in Apple's DNA. Since Steve Jobs jumped back on board with Apple in the late '90s, Apple's success has hinged on innovation, rather than riding on the heels of successful consumer reaction in markets it doesn't have a presence in. Take the netbook market for example: Rather than releasing a netbook, Apple introduced the MacBook Air, and later of course, the iPad. Part of what's hindered the success of the 7-inch tablet, until now, is that they are perceived to be more like an over-sized mobile phone than a tablet, ""and that appears to be the Achilles' Heel of the mini-tablets,"" Nudelman says. But the genius of the Kindle Fire is that it's more closely identified with Amazon's popular e-reader line than with smartphones, so it has a clearly defined place within the user's mind. And now that Amazon has made that distinction clear, other 7-inch tablet makers can at least attempt to capitalize on that extra portable, media-consumption angle, rather than marketing them against the iPad. The Kindle Fire's separation from both larger iPad-sized tablets and large-screened smartphones, both in size and in function, will help secure a solid niche for other 7-inch tablets to follow.

"(CNN) -- On Friday the countdown will officially begin to soccer's Euro 2012 finals -- arguably the climax to the second biggest festival of football on the planet behind the World Cup. The draw for the co-hosted tournament will be held in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, and football fans across the continent will learn the fate of their beloved nations. It will kick off a six-month countdown to the date of the first game on June 8, to be held in the Polish city of Warsaw. The final will be held in Kiev on July 1. Amid the excitement, critics have questioned whether the stadiums and infrastructure will be delivered on time for the visit of thousands of fans to Eastern Europe. Platini: Euro 2012 build up 'a complicated adventure' Here, CNN examines the myriad of issues on the field, and off it. What is the European Championship? The competition was born in 1960 and is held every four years. It sees Europe's top soccer nations battle it out to be crowned the continent's best team. There is a two-year-long qualification period, at the end of which 16 teams make the finals. They are then drawn into four groups of four, with the top two teams progressing from the group to the quarterfinal stage. The last installment, hosted by Switzerland and Austria in 2008, saw Spain beat Germany 1-0 in the final. Which venues will stage the games? There are four stadiums in each country that will host games. Poland's newly built National Stadium in Warsaw will stage the opening game, while the PGE Arena in Gdansk and the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw have also been constructed specially for the tournament. Poznan's Municipal Stadium will also host games. In Ukraine, Kiev's Olympic Stadium has the honor of the final, while the Donbass Arena in Donetsk, the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv and the brand new Lviv Arena will also stage games. What are the fears surrounding the tournament? Euro 2012 was awarded to Poland and Ukraine by European football's governing body UEFA in 2007 -- the first time Eastern Europe has been called upon to host a major football tournament. But their preparations have been criticized for the delayed building of stadiums and infrastructure projects necessary to support the thousands of fans that will descend on both countries come June. As early as 2008, UEFA president Michel Platini was speaking of the need to resolve problems with the project, saying of Ukraine he had to ""wake them up a little"" and tell them to ""get going."" Despite rumors that Scotland offered to step in should the tournament be taken away from Ukraine, Platini said it would remain with the its original hosts. There are still issues to resolve around the stadium in Lviv, with Polish authorities facing similar concerns over their brand new Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Boris Kolesnikov told CNN World Sport's Pedro Pinto this week that at no stage did he think the tournament would be stripped from his country: ""Neither the president nor the government feared they'd lose the right to host the championship. Of course we were a little bit scared to physically not be on schedule. Our sleepless nights, there have been too many to say, but construction has kept going 24/7 during the last 15 months."" But World Soccer's Gavin Hamilton told CNN that Ukraine's focus on getting the stadiums ready has come at the expense of the infrastructure needed to stage the event. ""The concern is that externally, outside of the stadiums, the transport infrastructure hasn't been brought up to speed, there aren't enough hotels. ""So there will be trouble for fans getting around the tournament. As far as UEFA are concerned, in terms of putting on a television spectacle for the world, Ukraine has done a very good job in getting the stadiums ready."" What has CNN discovered in Ukraine? On a whistle-stop tour of the four cities and stadiums that will host matches in Ukraine, Pinto said he had been impressed with the football arenas but found that some building projects were still battling to be ready, such as the one at Lviv airport, where construction on a new terminal and a lengthened runway continues 24 hours a day. He said: ""Having spent the last week traveling across both countries I can tell you that if you are a football supporter, you needn't worry. The stadiums look great and although some of the roads and railways may not be completed by the start of the tournament, enough progress will have been made to make the fan experience a good one."" What are the costs involved? According to UEFA figures, revenues taken during the 2008 tournament were $1.7 billion, with an estimated television audience of 4.8 billion for the 31 matches. The final was broadcast to 231 countries around the world. Speculation in Ukraine, from the Kyiv Post, claims the country's total cost of staging Euro 2012 is $14.5 billion, paid for by a combination of private and public money. The paper claims Poland's estimated costs are in the region of $30 billion. Mikolaj Piotrowski, communications director for PL.2012 -- the national coordinating company for Euro 2012 in Poland -- told CNN: ""The investment, thanks to Euro 2012, has accelerated infrastructure development in this country by three to five years. The overall cost has been $27 billion and has made Poland the largest construction site in Europe."" Yury Gromnitsky, head of the press office for the vice-prime minister of Ukraine, told CNN: ""The Ukraine has invested $750 million in sport infrastructure to host Euro 2012, not including the cost of the airport and transportation infrastructure. But being host has really acted as a catalyst for this development to take place."" All four airports in Ukraine's host cities are being revamped, while a series of new hotel developments have also been built -- 67 in Donetsk alone. A high-speed rail link will be in operation to ferry fans between host cities, and new road networks have also been built.","The draw for Euro 2012 will take place in the Ukrainian capital Kiev on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, embroiled in a child sex abuse scandal, attempts to clarify in a new interview how he feels about his relationships with young people. ""If I say, 'No, I'm not attracted to young boys,' that's not the truth,"" Sandusky said in an extensive interview with The New York Times in a story published Saturday. ""Because I'm attracted to young people -- boys, girls -- I ..."" His lawyer, who was present at the interview, spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is ""not sexually"" attracted to them. ""Right. I enjoy, that's what I was trying to say, I enjoy spending time with young people. I enjoy spending time with people,"" Sandusky continued. ""I mean my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young."" A grand jury report, made public last month, detailed 40 charges against Sandusky in a child sex abuse scandal involving at least eight alleged victims and spanning 15 years. In a recent interview with NBC's Bob Costas, Sandusky was asked directly: ""Are you sexually attracted to underage boys?"" Sandusky repeated the question, paused, and responded, ""No. I enjoy young people."" The former Penn State defense coordinator has maintained his innocence throughout the investigation -- saying he only ""horsed around"" with the disadvantaged boys in his care -- and is currently free on $100,000 bail. An attorney -- this one representing Victim 6, as identified in the grand jury report -- predicted Sandusky's latest interview with the newspaper will not help his case. Howard Janet called the ex-coach's remarks ""another failed attempt to manipulate the public and potentially manipulate the future jury pool."" ""He's not accomplishing ... his desired goal,"" Janet said, calling much of the interview ""uncomfortable to watch"" and ""disingenuous."" ""Every time he opens his mouth, virtually, he puts his foot in it."" According to the New York Times story, Sandusky stressed that he and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno never discussed the allegations of sexual misconduct. ""I don't know that he didn't know,"" he told the newspaper. ""I know that he never said anything to me. I know that."" The Board of Trustees removed Paterno and President Graham Spanier on November 9, amid the allegations that also implicated high-level university officials. Athletic Director Tim Curley, 57, and the school's vice president for finance and business, Gary Schultz, 62, have since been charged in the scandal. Each faces one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations. Paterno, 84, has not been charged in the investigation, but has received criticism for not alerting authorities to the alleged misconduct. He has said he did his duty in referring the allegations to his superior; according to the grand jury report, Paterno called Curley to report allegations of Sandusky ""fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy."" Spanier also was informed of ""a report of an incident involving Sandusky and a child in the showers on campus."" The New York Times' with Sandusky honed in on two separate allegations of misconduct in 1998 and 2002. When Sandusky retired in December 1999, an investigation of his alleged actions a year before had never been made public, but were later detailed in the grand jury's report. A mother had come forward, saying the coach had showered with her son and hugged her boy, naked from behind. Two campus police detectives eavesdropped on conversations in May 1998 when the mother confronted Sandusky. Police later monitored a second conversation that month, in which the mother told Sandusky to stay away from her son. ""I understand. I was wrong,"" Sandusky said, according to the grand jury report. ""I wish I could get forgiveness. I know I won't get it from you. I wish I were dead."" Four years later, the report said, graduate assistant Mike McQueary claimed to have seen Sandusky sodomizing a boy in a locker room shower. Sandusky told The New York Times that Curley, Penn State's athletic director at the time, confronted him about the alleged misconduct. ""He was concerned about it,"" he told the newspaper. ""He was coming to me with a concern because, in his words, somebody had talked to him about inappropriate behavior in the shower."" Sandusky said he responded by saying ""it didn't happen."" ""In my mind, there wasn't inappropriate behavior,"" he said. The former coach said Curley then told him that ""he didn't want me to bring kids (into university facilities) and work them out anymore,"" according to the interview. But, he told the Times, Curley never commandeered his keys to the facility. ""And I still went in there and worked out,"" the former coach said. The four-hour interview was conducted at the home of his lawyer over two days, where he insisted that his decades of work with troubled youths as part of his charity the Second Mile had been ""twisted"" by prosecutors. ""They've taken everything that I ever did for any young person and twisted it to say that my motives were sexual or whatever,"" Sandusky said. ""I had kid after kid after kid who might say I was a father figure. And they just twisted that all."" But an attorney for a 29-year-old alleged victim of Sandusky's, who is not among the eight people named in the grand jury report, said the interview is further evidence that the former coach ""cannot resist center stage."" ""Sandusky is making Joe Paterno look reckless and negligent,"" said Marci Hamilton, whose client is suing the school, Sandusky and the charity he founded for sexual abuse the man allegedly suffered at the hands of the former coach during the 1990s. Sandusky, meanwhile, told the the Times that he misses his old job at Penn State, as well as the work he did at the Second Mile. He added that children at the charity were like an ""extended family,"" calling himself an ""extended father."" Sandusky described how the scandal has taken a toll on his life and relationships. ""I miss coaching. I miss Second Mile. I miss Second Mile kids,"" he said. ""I miss interrelationships with all kinds of people. I miss my own grandkids."" But a lawyer for one alleged victim, who is part of the criminal investigation, said that the interview only further pains Sandusky's accusers. Justine Andronici, who is part of the legal team advising the client and other rape victims with the intention of later filing lawsuits, decried what she called Sandusky's ""delusional rationalization"" and said she was taken aback by his assertion that some victims' ""got pulled into"" the investigation and pointing out positive things he'd done for them. ""Sandusky needs to know that with every denial, every attempt to cast himself as the victim in this case, he inflicts more suffering,"" Andronici said in a statement. CNN contributor Sara Ganim and CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","NEW: An alleged victim's lawyer rips what she calls Sandusky's ""delusional rationalization""

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- President Alassane Ouattara opened negotiations Thursday with a coalition of opposition parties to try to convince supporters of the country's former president not to boycott upcoming parliamentary elections. ""We hope It is the beginning of a republican dialogue,"" said Miaka Oureto, acting president of the Front Populaire Ivoirien, the party of former President Laurent Gbagbo, at the end of the meeting. Last week, Gbagbo's party pulled out of the commission in charge of the elections, citing a ""recent modification of the electoral commission's composition in favor of the coalition of parties behind President Ouattara."" It also denounced what it characterized as ""a climate of terror"" that is preventing the party leaders from freely participating in what party officials say could become a ""mockery of an election."" The parliamentary elections are set to take place mid-December, and will close the electoral process that started with the violently disputed presidential elections last November. Ouattara was declared the winner by the electoral commission, but the results were annulled by the Constitutional Council -- which was made up of Gbagbo loyalists -- despite their certification by the United Nations, and Gbagbo refused to step down. The crisis claimed more than 3,000 lives and ended with the capture of Gbagbo on April 11. The World Bank has said that Ivory Coast must hold credible elections if it hopes to secure international backing for a series of development projects. The meeting with the opposition comes a day after Ouattara officially installed the Commission on Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation, fulfilling his promise to promote reconciliation in the aftermath of the post-electoral crisis. Comprised of 11 members, including religious and other civil society leaders, the commission has two years to heal the wounds of a nation profoundly divided since the first coup d'Ã©tat of its history in 1999. ""For a few months now, CÃ´te d'Ivoire is under reconstruction. But our largest construction site is the reconstitution of the Ivorian nation,"" Ouattara said, using the French name for the country. In the days following the capture and arrest of Gbagbo, the newly installed president appointed former Ivorian prime minister and political ally Jean Konan Banny as president of a commission for reconciliation that he vowed ""would be fair and independent."" ""We know that reconciliation is the only way out of the impasse in which we locked ourselves,"" Banny said Wednesday, promising that ""the years to come will see the rising of a new (Ivorian) citizen."" The optimism of Ouattara and Banny is not shared by Gbagbo supporters, who have denounced a ""justice of the victor"" attitude ""incompatible with the reconciliation they promote."" ""I don't think Mr. Ouattara really wants reconciliation. How could there be reconciliation when Laurent Gbagbo, his wife and most of our political leaders are illegally imprisoned with their assets frozen?"" asked Gbabgo communication adviser Alain Toussaint. ""There is no reconciliation without Gbagbo."" So far, Ouattara has yet to bring any of his supporters to justice, even though the United Nations and human rights groups accused both sides of perpetrating massive human rights violations in the aftermath of the elections. On the eve of the installation of the reconciliation commission, South Africa Archbishop Desmond Tutu warned that ""the perception that 'victor's justice' is being applied would greatly undermine the reconciliation process."" ""We encourage President Ouattara to demonstrate to his people and the world that the judicial process he has started is both fair and completely impartial,"" the archbishop said in a statement.","Ouattara created a reconciliation commission .

"New York (CNN) -- New Jersey resident Becky Fisher said Tuesday that she's counting the favors she'll now owe her neighbors after a powerful snowstorm left her family and more than a million others without power across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. Fisher, along with her husband and their 6-month-old daughter, have been camped out at a neighbor's house in Maplewood, New Jersey, since the weekend storm coated her home in snow and knocked down trees and power lines across the region. ""There are just pockets of those who have electricity,"" Fisher said. ""So we're using our neighbors' goodwill. ""We'll owe them lots."" Fisher said they first lost power Saturday and were forced to relocate to her neighbor's house the following night as temperatures dropped to just above freezing. Fisher said that while she and her husband are accustomed to cold weather, they didn't want to risk it with their child. ""Every time I call (the state's utility provider), they say the ticket's open,"" she said. ""Initially the message (of when power would be restored) was for Wednesday night, then Thursday, and now maybe Friday. ""Luckily, we have nice neighbors,"" she added. By Tuesday evening, about 195,000 New Jersey residents remained without power. Meanwhile, temperatures in parts of New England were expected to hit the low 50s Tuesday, which could be considered balmy to some who braved the October snowstorm that dropped more than 2 feet of snow in some places over the weekend. But while temperatures are on the rise for parts of the Northeastern United States, more than 1 million residents were still in the dark, dealing with widespread power outages. On Monday, officials warned it could be Friday before power is back on everywhere. At least 15 deaths have been blamed on the weekend storm, which prompted emergency declarations from the governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and also canceled Halloween trick-or-treating in some areas. President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration for Connecticut Monday, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. Gov. Dannel Malloy on Tuesday said he was not satisfied by the number of crews coming from out of state, CNN Hartford affiliate WFSB reported. By Tuesday evening, about 612,000 Connecticut residents remained without power, down from a peak of 830,000, according to the state utility company. More than 900 crews were restoring electricity. About a dozen Massachusetts cities postponed Halloween celebrations, according to CNN affiliate WGGB. At least 20 Connecticut cities and towns, including the capital, Hartford, canceled events or asked parents to wait until later to take their kids trick-or-treating, according to CNN affiliate WFSB. Malloy and his wife, Cathy, said they will be leaving the lights off. ""No amount of candy is worth a potentially serious or even fatal accident,"" the governor said in a statement. In Worcester, Massachusetts, officials asked residents to postpone Halloween celebrations until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to climb to 60 degrees. Trick-or-treating, the city said, would ""put families and our youth in harm's way as they negotiate piles of snow and downed limbs."" In Springfield, Massachusetts, school officials announced classes would be canceled for the week. Some of the heaviest snow fell in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, but snowfall amounts of at least a foot were recorded from West Virginia to Maine. The Berkshire County community of Peru, Massachusetts, received 32 inches of snow during the storm. In Massachusetts, state officials said utility crews had come from as far as Louisiana and Texas to help. About 256,000 people remained without power Tuesday evening, according to officials. Elsewhere, about 77,000 customers were without power in Pennsylvania. Thousands also lost power in New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, according to figures from emergency managers and power companies in those states. About 128,000 were affected in New York. As of Monday, authorities reported at least 15 deaths blamed on the storm. Three people died in Massachusetts, officials said, including a Lunenberg resident who died in a fire and a resident of Hatfield who succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning, apparently from an improperly vented generator. The third death happened in Springfield when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guardrail, which was charged, city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere said. Four people also died in New Jersey because of the storm, police said. Two were killed in motor vehicle accidents, one in Bergen County and one in Passaic County, while two others died after trees fell on their cars. In Connecticut, four people died, officials said. They included one person who died in a traffic accident in Hebron, a second who died in an accident on Interstate 91 in Hartford, one who died in an ATV accident in Enfield and one who died of carbon monoxide poisoning while trying to heat their home, also in Enfield. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Marina Landis contributed to this report.","NEW: About 195,000 New Jersey residents remain without power .

"Washington (CNN) -- Testimony on day three of proceedings about the future of presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. turned to whether Williamsburg, Virginia, is the right place for him to eventually live as an outpatient. ""I think it is right now,"" said Dr. Deborah Giorgi-Guarnieri, a psychiatrist whom Hinckley sees during his trips to his mother's home in Williamsburg. ""It always requires constant assessment, but I think it is right now."" But Giorgi-Guarnieri testified Monday that Hinckley has had difficulty forming new relationships there. She said Hinckley does regularly talk with a female neighbor of his mother, and with both his female supervisor and a female co-worker at his volunteer part-time job at a hospital library. Giorgi-Guarnieri said Hinckley, who likes to paint, has given paintings to both his supervisor and the co-worker. But she said that is something that is not unusual at that mental health care facility. According to the psychiatrist, Hinckley also offered her a painting for her office but she declined, saying she already has enough artwork. ""He doesn't have a romantic relationship in Williamsburg,"" Giorgi-Guarnieri added. Hinckley's relationships with women have always drawn scrutiny because he hoped to impress actress Jodie Foster with his attack on Reagan. Hinckley, 56, currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in Williamsburg. A plan proposed by St. Elizabeths Hospital, where Hinckley has been treated since being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of President Ronald Reagan and three other men, calls for the visits to be expanded and, if no problems develop, for Hinckley's eventual release to live as an outpatient. Prosecutors oppose the plan, which initially calls for two visits of 17 days each, followed by six visits of 24 days. A key question posed during the hearings is what will happen to Hinckley when his widowed mother, Jo Ann, is no longer alive. She's 85 years old and sat in court Monday listening to testimony. According to Hinckley's lawyer, Barry Levine, his mother is in good health. Hinckley caregivers have not fully answered the question of what would happen after his mother is gone. Hinckley has been seeing Giorgi-Guarnieri in October of 2010, she said, and she estimated she has seen him no more than a dozen times. She agreed with doctors from St. Elizabeths who testified last week that the most serious illnesses he had been diagnosed with -- depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in remission. However, the psychiatrist said Hinckley should continue taking his medicines, which include an antipsychotic drug called Risperdal and Zoloft for anxiety. Giorgi-Guarnieri also agreed with other doctors who say Hinckley still suffers from narcissism but it has improved. Hinckley has been listening quietly to testimony. His brother and sister are expected to testify tomorrow. In March of 1981, Hinckley shot Reagan as he left a Washington hotel after making a speech. Also wounded in the attack were Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington policeman Thomas Delahanty.","Man hospitalized since he shot President Reagan in 1981 seeks to become outpatient .

"(CNN) -- Groupon, always good for a discounted pizza or spa treatment, is adding gadgets and other goods in an e-commerce expansion. Groupon Goods, unveiled this week by the Chicago-based Web service, is a departure for the company which, since 2008, has been sharing mainly service-industry offers with users as it helped define the daily-deals space. The move comes as Groupon approaches a $750 million public stock offering (albeit one that has been postponed amid a turbulent stock market). ""Groupon Goods features really good deals on great products,"" Groupon wrote on the FAQ page about the service. ""To get airspace on Groupon Goods, a product has to be cool enough to share and innovative enough to inspire. It also must be made of reliably bonded molecules and stardust.

"(CNN) -- A South Korean court sentenced a U.S. soldier to 10 years in prison for raping an 18-year-old South Korean girl in September, court officials said Tuesday. The Uijeongbu District Court handed down the sentence Tuesday, about a month after the rape occurred in the area of Dongducheon, where the U.S. Army's 2nd Infantry Division is based. The private, identified by the U.S. Army as Pfc. Kevin Lee Flippin, will be required to complete 80 hours of education on sexual violence, and his personal record will be available to the public for the next 10 years, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. Flippin broke into the teenager's home and raped her numerous times in a ""sadistic"" fashion, the court said as part of its ruling statement, according to Yonhap. ""Our sincere apologies go out again to the victim, her family and the Korean community,"" the Army's 2nd Infantry Division said in a statement. ""The Republic of Korea executed jurisdiction, requested custody, tried, convicted and sentenced the soldier for his crime inside the Korean justice system, and he will now serve his sentence in a Korean prison. ""From the beginning we have worked in complete cooperation with the Korean National Police and other agencies."" This case came to light in September, around the same time that another soldier was accused of raping a South Korean girl. U.S. Forces Korea reinstated a curfew on its troops October 7, days after allegations of the two rape cases involving U.S. soldiers surfaced. ""Given the incidents that have occurred over the last several months, I'm reinstating the curfew to assess current conditions,"" the commander of U.S. Forces Korea Gen. James D. Thurman said early October, as he announced the 30-day curfew. Military officials had rescinded the previous curfew on July 2, 2010.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli ambassador to Jordan has returned to Amman a day after security concerns pushed officials to send much of the embassy staff home early, an Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said Friday. All but a skeleton staff at the Israeli Embassy in Amman went home due to security concerns Thursday. Staffers typically travel between Amman and Israel every Friday and Saturday, but they were sent home a day early this week after last week's ransacking of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo by protesters and plans for anti-Israel protests this week in Amman. The turnout for Thursday's demonstration in the Jordanian capital, however, was small and the Israeli ambassador returned Friday. The full embassy staff is expected to be back at work Sunday in Amman. Anti-Israel expressions and demonstrations have been taking place in Amman recently. A Facebook page calling for a million-man protest to close the Israeli Embassy in Amman has more than 3,000 people signed up as ""attending"" the event. Also, protesters against Jordan's ties with Israel have been gathering every Thursday outside an Amman mosque for more than a year. Those who organize the gatherings refer to themselves as the jama'at al-Kalouti, which means ""the group of the Kalouti,""  named after the mosque near the Israeli Embassy in western Amman. The protesters are calling for the closure of the embassy, the expulsion of the ambassador and annulment of the 1994 peace treaty that established diplomatic relations between Jordan and Israel. On Thursday night, about 400 people gathered outside the mosque, according to Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency. Eyewitnesses reported that security was increased around the already-fortified embassy in the western part of Amman in anticipation of the protest. More than half of Jordan's 6.5 million residents are of Palestinian origin. On September 9, an estimated 3,000 Egyptian protesters tore down a wall surrounding the building that houses the Israeli Embassy in Cairo and entered its offices, tossing papers bearing Hebrew writing from the windows and into the streets. Egyptians have been angry about the killing last month of five Egyptian police officers by Israeli soldiers when Israel went after militants who had attacked civilians near the Israeli-Egyptian border. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and journalist Amy Hybels contributed to this report.","All but a skeleton staff was sent home from the embassy Thursday .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Herman Cain's assertion that blacks' overwhelming support of the Democratic Party was evidence of their having been ""brainwashed"" was the latest salvo in an intra-racial war of words over the state of black politics. From President Barack Obama's recent run-ins with BET News and the Congressional Black Caucus, to attendees at a caucus conference questioning the racial consciousness of Cain and Republican Rep. Allen West because of their association with the tea party, many observers on both sides of the political aisle are trying to figure out what to make of all of the infighting. Is there such a thing as a uniform black political agenda? Are conservatism and black cultural pride incompatible? Do blacks really behave as political lemmings, and could they benefit from embracing the Republican agenda? The answers to these questions reflect an often overlooked fact: Neither the African-American community nor its politics have ever been monolithic. The overwhelming unity we have witnessed in black voting behavior and party identification in the last 50 years belies a surprising diversity. For instance, in fall 2008, during the height of Obama-mania, nearly 32% of black respondents in a Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies survey indicated that they were ideologically conservative. In 2009, 53% of black respondents to a Pew Center poll on race believed that middle and lower class blacks shared different values. Indeed, robust disagreement has been a norm, not the exception. Given the history of vigorous debate within the African-American community, it is reasonable to wonder why black voting behavior does not reflect this diversity. When we observe blacks voting for Democrats in election after election, it is easy to assume that these voters must be ill-informed or unthinking. However, many factors contribute to vote choice and party identification. African-American political behavior is shaped by a combination of factors, many of which are rooted in the unique historical experience of blacks in this country. For starters, black conservatism does not necessarily correlate with a belief in small government or with trust in state and local government to enforce civil rights. Historically, black civil rights were protected when activists appealed to the federal government for redress. This makes blacks more comfortable with the idea of a larger national government. So, when Republican politicians talk about limiting the scope of federal government, many blacks will be concerned that a contraction of federal power will limit continued progress in the realm of civil rights enforcement. Second, the conservative emphasis on individualism runs counter to blacks' more group-centered self-identity. In the 1970s, political scientists started to notice that politically active blacks were more likely to frame their ideas about politics in terms of racial group interest. By the early 1990s, Michael Dawson was able to demonstrate empirically that middle class blacks who believed in the idea that what happens to other blacks affects them were more likely to support racially redistributive policies that ran counter to their apparent class interests. Dawson argued the belief that blacks' fates were linked together was a thoroughly rational response to historic discrimination. While blacks acknowledge that race relations have improved dramatically since the 1960s, polling data show that blacks still perceive more discrimination than whites. As long as blacks still believe that they are the targets of discrimination, it is reasonable to expect them to factor group interests into their political choices. Thus, contrary to Cain's opinion, blacks who choose to vote Democratic have their reasons, just as he has good reasons to be a Republican. The good thing about the democratic process is that all voters have the privilege to weigh candidates' appeals and make their own decisions about who should represent them. Cain has made headway in Republican polls recently in part because of the appeal of his policy proposals. If he hopes to make inroads among blacks, it will be on the merit of his ideas and his demonstrated ability to challenge the Republican establishment to frame its platform in a way that is culturally sensitive to the concerns of blacks. For Cain to stoop to the level of those who unfairly taunted him and the tea party at the Congressional Black Caucus Weekend undermines his candidacy and only adds fire to the fuel of political incivility. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andra Gillespie.","Andra Gillespie: Herman Cain's remarks add to ongoing discussion of black politics .

"(CNN) -- Syria's failure to respond to Friday's deadline for it to allow Arab League observers into the country to monitor the government's response to civil unrest moves the country a step closer to economic sanctions from its neighbors, a senior Arab League diplomat said. ""The Syrians responded with more requests to amendments to the protocol; they did not reject or accept,"" he said. The finance and economic ministers of the Arab League will meet Saturday to draft economic sanctions that will be discussed Sunday by the Arab League's foreign ministers, said the diplomat, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. These could include halting dealings with Syria's central bank and airlines, the official said. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Syria risked international isolation if it continued on its present path -- and, that the bloodshed resulting from its crackdown on pro-democracy protests could not be tolerated. ""Syria has to make a decision,"" he said in Istanbul alongside his Italian counterpart, Giulio Terzi. ""It will either continue this crackdown policy against its people and become isolated more and more, or it will say yes to this well-intentioned Arab League proposal, sign this protocol and observers will monitor the situation on the ground by going to all Syrian cities."" In New York, a representative of Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. secretary-general ""welcomes the efforts of the League of Arab States to end the bloodshed and promote a political solution"" and urged Syrian authorities to agree to the league's proposal to send an observer mission to protect civilians in Syria. Since March, protesters in cities across the country have been demanding al-Assad's ouster and democratic elections. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the move by Arab League diplomats meeting in Cairo was unprecedented. The league was rejected by the Syrian people as ""a tool for foreign interference,"" it said. ""The sanctions include stopping air flights, trade exchanges and monetary dealings with the Syrian government and freezing its assets, which harms the interests of the Syrian people,"" it reported. The 22-country Arab League suspended Syria from its membership this month after President Bashar al-Assad's regime ignored demands to end its crackdown on citizens. Adding to the pressure on Damascus, the United Nations Committee Against Torture said Friday it is ""deeply concerned about gross and pervasive human rights violations in Syria,"" which are allegedly taking place ""in a context of impunity."" ""Of particular concern are reports referring to children who have suffered torture and mutilation while detained; as well as cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; arbitrary detention by police forces and the military; and enforced and involuntary disappearances,"" said Claudio Grossman, who heads the expert panel. Reliable sources indicate the abuses ""are allegedly conducted under direct orders from public authorities, at their instigation or with their consent or acquiescence,"" Grossman said. The committee has asked Syria to provide a special report by early March indicating it is abiding by its obligations under the U.N. Convention against Torture, to which Syria is a signatory. Earlier Friday, Moscow -- a historic ally of Damascus -- warned against international military intervention in Syria and described it as an ""absolutely unacceptable"" solution to ending the government crackdown against protesters. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said the Syrian people must be left to decide their own fate. Human rights issues should not be used as a justification for action by the West, he said. ""Under no circumstances must human rights issues be used as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a state, in this particular instance, Syria,"" Lukashevich said, quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax. ""A scenario involving military intervention in Syrian affairs is absolutely unacceptable for us."" Russia, a major arms supplier to Damascus, blocked a U.N. Security Council resolution last month that would have condemned the Syrian response to the demonstrators and called for an immediate end to the government clampdown on the opposition. It abstained from voting on another resolution that was passed Tuesday by a humanitarian committee of the United Nations' General Assembly. Al-Assad has resisted mounting calls for his resignation in recent weeks as international outcry over the Syrian violence has intensified. He says his government is battling armed terrorist groups. The United Nations says more than 3,500 people have died in the course of an eight-month government crackdown on protests. Twenty-seven people died Friday, one of them a child, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria activist group said. More than 20,000 anti-government protesters gathered in the city of Dael as a child's funeral was held, said the opposition group, which organizes and documents anti-government protests. Power, water and communications to the city had been cut, it reported. Another opposition group, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said there was heavy gunfire in the streets of Hama from military and security forces. In Daraa, weapons were fired outside mosques to prevent people demonstrating after Friday prayers, the group said. The LCC said at least 35 people died Thursday in clashes with security forces. CNN cannot independently verify the reports because the government has restricted access to Syria by international journalists. CNN's Alla Eshchenko in Moscow and Yesim Comert in Istanbul, and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy in Cairo contributed to this report.","Sanctions considered by the Arab League would hurt the Syrian people -- state media .

"London (CNN) -- Australian cricket legend Shane Warne and actress Elizabeth Hurley are engaged, it was confirmed on Sunday. The couple confirmed the news on their Twitter pages, with both saying: ""Thanks for all your congratulations."" They also linked to a picture of themselves about to go to dinner in St. Andrews, Scotland, where Warne is playing in a golf championship. Warne, 42, proposed to Hurley, 46, on Friday, the organizers of the tournament said in a statement. The couple later celebrated with guests in St. Andrews' Old Course Hotel. Hurley's four-year marriage to businessman Arun Nayar ended in divorce in June. Hurley has a son from an earlier relationship. The actress rose to fame in the 1990s as the girlfriend of actor Hugh Grant, attracting attention in 1994 when she wore a Versace dress held together with safety pins. She has starred in films including "" Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" and ""Bedazzled."" Warne is widely regarded as one of the finest bowlers of all time having taken 708 wickets in the long form of the game. He retired from Test cricket in 2007 after playing 145 matches, prompting his captain Ricky Ponting to call it ""the end of an era"" for Australian cricket. He announced his separation from his wife Simone in 2005. The couple, who have three children, divorced shortly afterwards. According to the cricket website CricInfo, Warne's story was ""part fairytale, part pantomime, part hospital drama, part adults-only romp, part glittering awards ceremony."" ""He took a Test hat-trick, won the Man-of-the-Match prize in a World Cup final and was the subject of seven books. He was the first cricketer to reach 700 Test wickets. He swatted more runs than any other Test player without making a hundred, and was probably the wiliest captain Australia never had. ""His ball that gazoodled Mike Gatting in 1993, bouncing outside leg stump and cuffing off, is unanimously esteemed the most famous in history. He revived legspin, thought to be extinct, and is now pre-eminent in a game so transformed that we sometimes wonder where the next champion fast bowlers will come from.""","Australian cricket legend Shane Warne and actress Elizabeth Hurley have become engaged .

"South Bend, Indiana (CNN) -- The glow from the Golden Dome still is wonderfully blinding on bright days. Touchdown Jesus, the nickname of the skyscraper-sized mural on the side of the Hesburgh Library, continues to inspire with its version of Jesus stretching his arms high and wide as a football referee signaling for a touchdown. The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, where folks haven't stopped lighting candles for miracles. The Basilica of the Sacred Heart, which resembles something straight from the Vatican. The splendid lakes. The immaculate trees, with leaves that dance in the autumn wind while dressed in various October colors. For a guy born and raised a few punts away from all of this on the campus of the University of Notre Dame, I keep hearing a depressing question: Is Notre Dame football relevant anymore? The answer is yes, definitely yes. ""Talent-wise, we're pretty much there, because players keep coming here to be great, and they know there is life after football when they choose to play for Notre Dame,"" said Adrian Jarrell, now a senior financial analyst, who had several gigantic catches as a wide receiver for the Fighting Irish during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Those were the last of Notre Dame's glory days. Thus the question of relevancy. ""I live in Dallas, and I hear that question all the time,"" Jarrell said, chuckling, while many Irish eyes are crying. Here's why: With Notre Dame spending another season tumbling into obscurity, there are more than a few reasons to doubt its relevancy. For one, this 125-year-old football program that made dominance famous hasn't won a national championship since 1988, when that other Gipper was in the White House. The original Gipper was George Gipp, Notre Dame's icon of yore. Years after legendary Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne satisfied the wishes of a dying Gipp by delivering his ""Win one for the Gipper"" speech before a Notre Dame game against Army during the 1920s, Gipp was portrayed in Hollywood by future U.S. President Ronald Reagan. That Gipper speech was about the last time Notre Dame won a bowl game worth mentioning. Actually, we're talking about 1993, when Jarrell helped Notre Dame beat Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl. After that, the Irish dropped a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record nine-straight bowl games, spanning from the mighty Orange to the lowly Insight. They've won their last two bowl games, but nobody who participates in either the Sun Bowl or the Hawaii Bowl is considered a national power. They've had four coaches since College Football Hall of Fame inductee Lou Holtz resigned after the 1996 season. Three of those post-Holtz coaches were fired, and the fourth is Brian Kelly, whose team in his second year at Notre Dame had a disturbing 31-17 home loss last Saturday to archrival Southern Cal. It dropped Notre Dame's record to a sloppy 4-3. Of the 120 schools at the top of the NCAA's two-tier system, 119 of them have a better turnover margin than the Irish. Worse, Southern Cal players accused Notre Dame players and coaches of quitting during Saturday's game. Southern Cal coach Lane Kiffin apologized to Kelly for the remarks, and Kelly joined Notre Dame players in denying the charges. Then again, those things happen when the mighty has become the meek in the minds of many. ""For anybody to say that Notre Dame can't win again is the most ridiculous, asinine comment I've ever heard, because they've got more going for them now than they've ever had before in the history of the school,"" said Holtz, 74, now a college football analyst for ESPN. He finished his 11 years at Notre Dame with a 100-30-2 record, featuring that 1988 national championship and three other seasons with one loss or less. Holtz's legacy at Notre Dame is even more astounding when you consider the following: Back then, Notre Dame officials didn't allow ""red shirting,"" which gives players a chance to spend an extra year with a team while retaining their normal four years of eligibility. Holtz had several five-year players at Notre Dame, but that mostly was because they were exempt for medical reasons. Now, even though Notre Dame officials don't call it red shirting, they allow five-years players for a variety of reasons. There also is Notre Dame's change in recent years to allow freshmen to enter the university in January instead of September. It has expanded the Irish's recruiting possibilities. Then there is the acceptance of transfers. It was discouraged for academic reasons during the Holtz era, except in rare cases. Transfers happen slightly more frequently these days at Notre Dame. Plus, former Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis and his strength coaches often complained about players suffering huge weight losses near the end of seasons. Because of football and Notre Dame's fierce academic schedule, players weren't eating properly. Unlike other major programs, Notre Dame lacked a training table, which allows players to eat structured meals each day around class and practice times. Notre Dame finally got a training table during Weis' last year there in 2009, and since then, players have enjoyed meals at the Irish's state-of-the-art football complex that was built across 96,000 square feet in 2005. That was nearly a decade after Holtz's era. With its multiple fields, extensive weight-training area and huge locker rooms featuring the latest in technology, the so-called Guglielmino complex (nicknamed The Gug) is eye candy for recruits. In other words, those who keep saying the Irish can't recruit anymore aren't paying attention. They had more players (11) on preseason ""watch lists"" this year for major individual awards than any team outside of Alabama (12). Wide receiver Michael Floyd and linebacker Manti Te'o are among several Notre Dame players tagged as future high picks in the NFL draft. Speaking of the future, there were around 50 of the nation's top recruits at the Southern Cal game, and despite the Irish's ugly loss, the South Bend Tribune reported that most of the recruits said they were highly impressed with the Notre Dame atmosphere. ""In the end, Brian Kelly will figure it out, just the same as Ara Parseghian did and every other coach before him,"" said Holtz, referring to Notre Dame's legacy that has produced 11 national championships and seven Heisman Trophy winners under the likes of Parseghian, Frank Leahy, Dan Devine, Rockne and, of course, Holtz. What Kelly must do to join them at Notre Dame is win, and he must do so for just shy of forever. That's all.","South Bend, Indiana, native Terence Moore: Players come to Notre Dame ""to be great""

"(CNN) -- From sweeping grasslands to the desolate Gobi desert, Mongolia's dramatic landscape lends itself to the idea that it is one of the world's last frontiers. Mongolian national identity is entwined with its nomadic history of horsemen and herders. Traditional pursuits like horse-riding are alive and well and celebrated each year at the ""naadam"" festival. Despite the impact of modernity and urbanization it remains in many ways a ""land without fences."" Sandwiched between Russia to the north and China to the south, Mongolia's President Tsakhia Elbegdorj likens his country's position, geographically and politically, to ""a pony between two elephants."" Recent history has seen Mongolia both squeezed and supported by its two heavy-weight neighbors. The country declared its independence from China in 1921 and then fell under the influence of the Soviet Union and communism. The demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to the country losing one-third of its GDP, but did result in the creation of a new democratic constitution in 1992. The president is the country's head of state and is elected every four years. Mongolia is currently modernizing, but its historical position as the one-time center of the world's largest-ever land empire is not forgotten within the country. History books often portray Genghis Khan as a blood-thirsty warrior who led murderous hordes across Asia and Europe. But in Mongolia he remains revered as the man responsible for uniting nomadic tribes and creating an empire that spread ideas and trade across continents, including the invention of paper money and the concept of diplomatic immunity. Today Khan's presence remains in street names, products and monuments, most strikingly with a 40-meter-tall statue situated 50 kilometers outside the capital city of Ulaanbaatar that faces towards the vast interior of the country. Three times the size of France, Mongolia's riches lie in its land. Among the breathtaking vistas of seemingly timeless landscapes studded with Gers (traditional nomadic homes) lies the source of Mongolia's current economic boom. Natural resources of copper and its vast reserves of coal are literally fueling China's growth and the means for Mongolia's own development of recent years. Other sought-after minerals like zinc, gold and uranium have bolstered trade and foreign investment, as well helping to bringing Louis Vuitton and Burberry to the streets of Ulaanbaatar. But with its wealth of natural assets comes the need to balance development with environmental protection and address the country's pressing problem of lifting one third of Mongolia's three million people out of poverty.","Mongolia has a population of around 3 million people and is three times the size of France .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's new authorities found chemical weapons about a month ago and asked for international aid in securing them, a top military spokesman for the National Transitional Council told CNN Monday. ""We found mustard gas missiles in Jufra and we asked our friends to come and help us,"" Col. Ahmed Bani said. He was adding details to the announcement Sunday by the National Transitional Council's outgoing prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, that two chemical weapons sites had been discovered. Jibril, speaking to reporters in Tripoli, said the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague and the United States were notified. Jibril did not provide any details about the sites, their location or when they were discovered. His announcement came the day before NATO was due to declare the end of its mission in Libya. ""Libyans have now liberated their country. And they have transformed the region,"" said NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen on Friday. ""This is their victory."" International inspectors working for the OPCW left in February, the chemical weapons organization said, and do not know what has happened to Gadhafi's stockpiles since then. But U.S. officials told CNN in August that they and NATO had been discussing Libya's chemical weapons store with the transitional council in case the Gadhafi regime fell. ""The opposition forces are being asked to keep track of what's going on"" with both weapons of mass destruction and the regime's inventory of surface-to-air missiles, a NATO official said. ""We have had direct eyes on the storage facilities"" of the weapons for some time, the official said, including the use of satellites, drones and other surveillance aircraft. The official also confirmed that intelligence personnel from the United States and other countries had been in Libya over the summer to help maintain security at various sites. ""Individual nations have folks on the ground,"" he said in August. A U.S. official also confirmed that U.S. intelligence personnel have been involved in monitoring WMD stockpiles inside Libya. Both officials declined to be identified because of sensitive intelligence matters. Jibril said Sunday the OPCW is in direct contact with Libyan authorities and is taking the necessary measures to help Libya deal with the sites. Jibril said the situation would be handled by the OPCW and that a delegation from the organization is expected to arrive in Libya on Thursday. ""The United States was notified because it is technically equipped to deal with this issue,"" Jibril said. He declined to give details about the sites or weapons, but said the OPCW will make an announcement soon. ""By making this announcement, we reaffirm that the new Libya is a peaceful Libya, a Libya that abides by international law, a Libya that aims for development before anything else for the good of its people,"" Jibril said. Libya's chemical weapons stockpiles consisted of about 9 metric tons of sulfur mustard agent and more than 800 metric tons of precursor chemicals, as of February. The destruction facility was sealed before the inspectors left but the OPCW does not know what happened to it since then. The inspectors' first job when they return will be to determine whether any of the material has been removed. In 2003, Libya agreed to destroy its entire chemical weapons arsenal, which included some 25 tons of mustard gas and 3,300 empty aerial bombs. The entire stock of shells and bombs was literally crushed by bulldozers in 2004. Before the outbreak of the crisis the Gadhafi regime had destroyed 55% of its declared amounts of mustard gas and 40% of its precursor chemicals for making weapons, according to the OPCW. CNN reported earlier this year that Libya still had approximately 10 tons of the deadly blister agent left in its arsenal, according to an assessment from the Arms Control Association. Much of the material was located at the Rabta chemical weapons facility south of Tripoli. U.S. officials say any chemical weapons material that remains in Libya would be difficult to ""weaponize"" into a form that could be used to conduct attacks. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and CNN's Tim Lister and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","NEW: Libya's new authorities found mustard gas missiles about a month ago, they say .

Authorities in Papeete said the victims included two tourists and two European officials posted to the region, who local media said had been visiting a water purification plant. Moorea is popular with foreign tourists, and the crash occurred in the tourist high season. French Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie issued a statement expressing her condolences and saying that Christian Estrosi, secretary of state for France's overseas territories, would go to the region to show the government's solidarity.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Marty Gardner faced strict standards when she started training to be what was then known as a stewardess in 1954 for Delta Air Lines: Being young and single were conditions for employment, and weight, girdles, hats and gloves were monitored closely. Her flying career ended after five years. Marty Gardner wore her 1955 uniform to the Delta Clipped Wings anniversary celebration in Atlanta. ""You had to quit when you got married. That was the rule,"" said Gardner, 73, a member of Delta Clipped Wings, an organization of retired and longtime flight attendants. Still, Gardner and other members of the group that gathered this week on Delta's Atlanta, Georgia, campus to celebrate the Clipped Wings' 50th anniversary said they loved their jobs. ""It was a lot of fun. We got to know the passengers,"" Gardner said. ""A lot of times we had the same passengers back and forth."" Marriage restrictions for flight attendants were relaxed after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; men joined the ranks in the 1970s; and by 1994, Delta's female flight attendants were allowed to fly up to 26 weeks into pregnancy. As the profession and the industry have changed and grown, a sense of adventure seems to be a common thread for the Clipped Wings.

"(CNN) -- Italian football champions AC Milan have announced that Antonio Cassano will undergo heart surgery, after the striker was hospitalized following last weekend's 3-2 win against Roma. The Italy international fell ill after Saturday's match at the Stadio Olimpico, with a statement from the seven-time European champions on Wednesday confirming the 29-year-old experienced ""ischemic cerebral damage."" The condition was caused by a malformation in Cassano's heart, resulting in poor blood flow to the brain -- which can lead to possible vision, movement and speech restrictions. Milan said he suffered no lasting neurological damage but will now face months on the sidelines. Messi treble puts Barca into the last 16 . ""AC Milan, according to medical reports of the Policlinico in Milan, have said that Antonio Cassano has experienced ischemic cerebral damage,"" read the statement on the 18-time Serie A title winners' official website. ""The cause was identified as the presence of a patent foramen ovale septal heart, detectable only with sophisticated specialized investigations. The timing of therapy established has allowed a rapid recovery and improvement of clinical conditions. ""In the coming days the player will undergo a small surgical interventional cardiology (closure of the foramen ovale). The recovery time for return to playing will be better defined after the surgery, but probably will be a few months."" In Cassano's absence, the Rossoneri ensured their progression into the last 16 of the European Champions League on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw at BATE Borisov of Belarus. Ghana midfielder Kevin Prince Boateng revealed a shirt with Cassano's name and number on it after striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave Massimiliano Allegri's side a first-half lead. Midfielder Renan Bressan later equalized for BATE from the penalty spot, but a point was enough to ensure Milan's place in the knockout stages. An often controversial figure, Cassano began his career with hometown club Bari before making a big-money move to Roma as a teenager in 2001. After five years in the Italian capital he switched to Spain with nine-time European champions Real Madrid. Following an unhappy spell ruined by injury and a falling-out with coach Fabio Capello, Cassano returned home to Sampdoria in 2008 after a season's loan before joining Milan in January this year -- a move prompted by another dispute, this time with the Genoa side's chairman Riccardo Garrone. He will be hoping to recover in time to be part of Cesare Prandelli's Italy squad for next year's European Championship in Poland and Ukraine, which starts in June 2012.","AC Milan's Antonio Cassano will undergo heart surgery .

"(CNN) -- MotoGP championship leader Casey Stoner claimed his 10th pole position of 2011 on Saturday to boost his bid for a ninth victory this season at the Japan Grand Prix. After 14 of 18 meetings, the Australian holds a 44-point lead over world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who will start Sunday's race second on the grid for Yamaha at Motegi. He broke Lorenzo's 2008 lap record with a time of one minute 45.267 seconds to earn his first pole at the circuit, where he won last year's race. Stoner's teammate Andrea Dovizioso qualified third ahead of another Honda rider, Dani Pedrosa, while American Ben Spies claimed fifth for Yamaha. Honda's Marco Simoncelli completed the third row for Honda, while fellow Italian and seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was seventh for Ducati. Hiroshi Aoyama, in 11th, was the highest-placed Japanese rider for what will be an emotional day. Motorcycling's top names had initially refused to travel to Motegi due to health fears after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was damaged during March's earthquake and tsunami. They backed down after MotoGP officials refused to cancel the race, but Stoner arrived late to reduce any exposure to radiation and Lorenzo told reporters that he had been washing with bottled water despite experts insisting the Motegi area is safe from any fallout. But the riders have helped raise $140,000 for the ""We are for Japan"" campaign, with Aoyama to present the check to local officials before the race. ""Everything has gone very well so far this weekend. We've been fastest in all but one session, so it's been fantastic,"" 2007 world champion Stoner told the MotoGP website. ""We'll have to watch the weather as this will affect the set-up. There's also a chance of rain, so it could get complicated. Jorge has been riding fantastic, as has Dovi and Dani, but there is no doubt that the Honda suits this track.""","Casey Stoner will start Sunday's Japan Grand Prix at front of the grid .

"(CNN) -- The debate over genetically engineered salmon should be put in the proper context: As the world's population grows at an accelerating pace, so does the consumption of seafood. This is true not only because there are more mouths to feed, but also because as people become more aware of the health benefits associated with eating seafood, more are switching from meat to fish. To satisfy this demand, we have become very sophisticated fishers, with ever-growing fleets, factory fishing ships and very effective gear. We efficiently hunt our own seafood in the wild; it seems natural to all of us, while we do not hunt for wild chicken, beef or pork. But fish is harvested at a rate that exceeds the fisheries' ability to replenish themselves. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, more than 50 percent of the world's main fisheries stocks are fully exploited, while another 28 percent are over-exploited or depleted. Fish species that used to be plentiful, such as cod, plaice, haddock and others, are now rare in the wild. The king of the oceans, the giant bluefin tuna, is now near the point of no return, its stocks dropping precipitously in the past decade alone. Reflecting upon these declines, the U.S. has become the world's second largest importer of seafood (after Japan) with more than 80 percent of the seafood consumed in this country coming from overseas. And seafood imports contribute $9 billion annually to the U.S. trade deficit, largest among all agricultural products. Fisheries scientists have repeatedly warned us that if we do not change our commercial fisheries practices, we will run out of the vast majority of the commercial species by the middle of this century. This must stop. Like any other animal or plant crop, fish and seafood must be produced through farming -- or aquaculture -- and the wild stocks should be protected so they can recover. As a society, we must accept that while it is nice to eat wild salmon, there is no wild Atlantic salmon out there; we must get used to eating farmed fish. The aquaculture industry faces a huge challenge. It must grow fish in a way that is economically viable and environmentally responsible. And this is where genetic engineering enters the picture. Genetically engineered fish, like the AquAdvantage salmon, offer great benefits to fish farmers and should be available to the industry. If used carefully, genetic engineering can produce fish that reach the market much faster, as in the AquAdvantage salmon, and use less feed (and thus less fish meal). As the science develops, it could generate fish that are resistant to disease (currently the aquaculture industry loses billions of dollars annually to disease in its fish population) and healthier for the consumer -- making beneficial omega-3 oils available in fish that do not normally contain them, for example. The public should not be scared by the term ""genetic engineering."" This powerful platform requires making only relatively minor and very targeted modifications to the animal genome, compared, for example, with selective breeding and domestication, where we manipulate many genes over generations without knowing exactly what is altered. We have all been eating selectively bred fish, chicken, beef and other animals for many years without thinking twice about it. The AquAdvantage Atlantic salmon has only one extra copy of a fish gene inserted into its genome. This one addition, while enhancing the hormones of the growth axis in fish, operates within the fish's physiological range. And these are fish hormones that have no effect on the human consumer. The AquAdvantage salmon is no different from conventional farmed salmon in its composition and health benefits, and the Food and Drug Administration has concluded that it is safe for people to eat. The single most important caution I would offer is that we must ensure that these fish, as well as any other farmed but domesticated fish (non-genetically engineered), cannot escape from the farming systems to our seas or rivers. The AquAdvantage salmon must be fully contained, both biologically and physically. Indeed, AquAdvantage salmon are sterile fish, and therefore unable to reproduce even if they escape. These fish are intended to be farmed only in fully contained, land-based farming systems. Every new operation that would grow these fish for sale in the United States would be subject to FDA approval, according to the FDA. By using multiple and redundant mechanical means to prevent escape (such as screens and filters), as well as reusing the culture water, the systems should be close to full containment, having minimal interactions with the environment. And the implementation of these new, land-based and fully contained marine aquaculture systems offers an opportunity for aquaculture to become more efficient and environmentally sustainable. However, before approving the genetically engineered fish for use in aquaculture, as a scientist, I would like to see the FDA and AquaBounty be less presumptive and more experimental about the potential environmental risk of AquAdvantage salmon. I want to see scientific data, proof beyond a shadow of a doubt, that if fish do escape from containment, they will not survive, will not breed and will be purged from the environment. Experiments to demonstrate this are all feasible, but will take a few more years to complete. And finally, consumers should absolutely be informed whether the salmon they are buying is genetically engineered or not. It is our responsibility to make sure the public is educated so the fear factor dissipates and the consumer can make rational decisions regarding genetically engineered salmon. Not labeling the fish will harm the industry altogether as people who do not want genetically engineered fish will avoid farmed salmon altogether. As a society that is in dire need of more plentiful and healthier food, we must accept the practices of modern agriculture in fish farming. We must trust the power and virtue of the advanced sciences and technology in providing new generations with high-quality food. We must stop depleting the wild stocks, reducing our biodiversity and harming the oceans around us. Sustainable aquaculture, based on responsible modern biology, including genetic engineering, will provide the world with the seafood that we need and help conserve our planet.

"London (CNN) -- Actor Hugh Grant tried to persuade photographers stalking the mother of his child to leave her alone, but they just said: ""Show us the baby,"" he told British lawmakers Monday. ""Do you really think this is a way for grown men to be behaving?"" he said he had asked paparazzi staked out at the home of the woman, but they ignored him. Grant was part of a panel of celebrities testifying before lawmakers examining press ethics amid scandals about phone hacking and police bribery by journalists. Comic Steve Coogan and former motor racing boss Max Mosley were also on the panel, alongside member of Parliament Zac Goldsmith. The witnesses were asked how much it cost to fight newspapers . ""You've got to risk a million pounds to get justice,"" said Mosley, who successfully sued the now-defunct News of the World tabloid for libel. Coogan said it had cost him 15,000 to 20,000 pounds ($23,500 to $31,400) to have lawyers get a court order to keep a newspaper from publishing a story about one of his relatives, and he said he had spent ""over 200,000 pounds"" over the hacking of his phone by journalists. Mosley also talked about the difference between defamation and invasion of privacy. Mosley sued the News of the World after it ran a front-page article claiming he had organized a Nazi-themed orgy with multiple prostitutes. A court found in his favor, saying there was no Nazi element to the event. ""If the News of the World had been forced to run a front-page picture with the statement 'Actually, this was a private orgy,' it wouldn't have done me much good,"" he said to laughter. The hearing is separate from a government-backed inquiry into press ethics. The Leveson Inquiry was set up in response to outrage at revelations of the scale of illegal eavesdropping and police bribery on behalf of News of the World, which was shut down in July over the scandal. Police are separately investigating phone hacking, computer hacking and bribery. They say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories. Phone hacking involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely.","The actor says he tried to shame press photographers but they ignored him .

"(CNN) -- The families of seven people killed and 61 survivors injured when a stage collapsed at the Indiana State Fair in August are being offered a total of $5 million by Indiana's attorney general. The settlements proposed by the state are separate from the lawsuit most of the families filed last month against Sugarland, the country duo that was set to perform just before a windstorm caused metal scaffolding to fall on dozens of fans. The estate of each of those who died would get at least $300,000, while the injured would get 65% of their medical expenses paid out of the state's tort claims fund, Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a news release Tuesday. ""No amount of money ever can replace lives lost or alleviate anguish endured by the victims of the Indiana State Fair tragedy,"" Zoeller said. ""Because state law limits the amount the state can pay to $5 million per incident or $700,000 per individual and we are legally obligated to defend those limits, we had to make extremely difficult decisions about which injured victims would receive payment out of the limited pool of funds available."" The estates and survivors must decide by December 12 if they will accept the state's offer or pursue tort claims in court. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most faithful fans, when a storm swept through the Indiana State Fair on August 13. A lawsuit filed last month by 48 plaintiffs contends that the band ""failed or refused to cancel the Sugarland concert despite inclement weather"" and that it had ""ultimate control over the lighting"" that fell on many of the victims. ""Sugarland had supervisory authority and discretion for stage size, lighting, instruments, trusses, sound equipment and location of sound equipment, and the stage system,"" the suit said. Forecasters warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through, causing the collapse of the stage. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. ""Sugarland was not required to perform if Sugarland determined their performance would be impaired or prevented due to inclement weather,"" the suit said. ""The decision whether to cancel the Sugarland concert due to weather conditions was the responsibility of Sugarland."" Sugarland's representative said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit. The suit also names other defendants, including Mid-America Sound, the company that rented the stage, roof and lighting system, and event promoter Live Nation.","Families of those killed would get $300,000 each, while injured would get 65% of medical bills .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A second typhoon in a week pounded the Philippines over the weekend, weakening Sunday only after prompting evacuations, causing severe flooding and contributing to at least one death, officials said. Typhoon Nalgae, known locally as Quiel, lost some strength by Sunday morning, though it still had maximum sustained winds of 130 kph (80 mph), with gusts recorded 30 kph (18.6 miles) stronger, according to an 11 a.m. Sunday advisory from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Administration. At that point, its center was 290 kilometers (180 miles) west of Baguio City. The storm comes on the heels of Typhoon Nesat, which left 52 people dead and hit 34 provinces Tuesday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. The two typhoons have affected about 3 million Filipinos, according to the nonprofit humanitarian group, World Vision. ""The immediate need is ready-to-eat food and water,"" said Jay Mijares, a spokesman for the group. ""Survivors have no means to cook food. We are seeing a mass exodus of people looking for food, there is no supply, and on top of that their livelihood is disrupted. They have money but there's just nothing to buy."" The latest typhoon -- Nalgae -- made landfall in Dinapigue, in Isabela province, on Saturday morning, the disaster council said. It moved past the Asian island nation by Sunday, forecasters said, after having brought rain of 15-25 millimeters per hour (0.6-1 inch) in many areas. The heavy rains caused a landslide Saturday that swept a passenger van off a highway, killing one man and injuring one more, the disaster council said . At least 850 families, or roughly 3,500 people, in the provinces of La Union and Pangasinan were affected by flooding, according to a Sunday morning update by the council. Over the course of the weekend, the storm forced the closure of a number of bridges and made a number of roads impassable in the cities of Calasiao and Dagupan on Luzon island, according to the disaster council. Affected residents are being evacuated from those communities and others, including Santa Barbara. Officials suspended operations at ports in Balanan, Batangas, Lucena, Puerto Real, Kawit and Calapan City, the disaster council said. Service was expected to be restored at some ports by late Sunday morning, the council said. By Sunday, gates were opened at four dams that had reached their spillage levels, the council said. World Vision said Saturday that it had to postpone some of its relief efforts from the first typhoon due to Nalgae, with two of three emergency teams set to deploy once the storm passes. Another team is in Bulcan province, most of which is ""still submerged"" from heavy rains from the first typhoon that struck days earlier. Sherbien Dacalanio, a CNN iReporter in the Philippines, described one area of Manila as being devastated by Nesat. ""The damage is shocking. It's like a damage brought by earthquake and tsunami,"" Dacalanio said. CNN's Ivan Cabrera and journalist Arlene Samson-Espiritu contributed to this report.","Heavy rains in latest typhoon cause a landslide that sweeps a van off a road, killing 1 .

"(CNN) -- Could it be that the reason our government is broken is because of which generation is running things? Authors Morley Winograd and Michael Hais think so, insisting that the problem is that power is now firmly in the hands of self-righteous baby boomers who have spent their entire lives convinced that anyone who disagrees with them is morally inferior. Boomers won't negotiate anything, Winograd and Hais say, because they think every position they hold is rooted in something no less sacred than their values, and they're understandably reluctant to negotiate their values. Winograd, who worked as a policy adviser to former Vice President Al Gore, and Hais, an expert on polling and research, insist that the situation will get better when the generational torch is passed and younger people take over. In their new book, ""Millennial Momentum,"" they explain how the millennial generation (born from 1982 to 2003) will remake America in education, politics, entertainment and every other conceivable endeavor. There will be more compromise, they predict, and more tolerance for different points of view. There will also be more of a desire to rule by consensus and not decree. But until that day comes, the authors told me during a recent interview, there will be gridlock and dysfunction. And our government will stay broken. I'm not sure I'm sold, but it's a provocative theory. There are others out there as well, and I wanted to hear them. I have a lot of friends who are in Generation X -- in between boomers and millennials. Some of them are political insiders in their 30s and 40s who have worked as congressional staffers, run major political campaigns, worked in the White House, or been elected to legislatures and city councils. They know all about government, what works and what doesn't. So I asked some of them why our government is broken, and here are some of the reasons they gave: . Safe districts. Now that the redistricting process has become all about preserving incumbency, and limiting the number of ""competitive"" districts that could go into either party's column, there are fewer moderates in Congress. It was bound to happen. Once politicians start thinking in terms of creating safe Republican districts and safe Democratic districts, it becomes a contest to see which candidate for a congressional seat is more of a partisan Republican or Democrat. The result: plenty of highly partisan and comfortable lawmakers who don't have to worry about being voted out of office. Constant need to fundraise. Because members of Congress have to stand for re-election every two years, they are in constant need of ready cash, which the candidates then turn around and spend on glossy mailers, campaign staff, and television commercials. Besides being undignified, this dialing for dollars leaves little time to get to work on solving the nation's problems. Words speak louder than actions. Somewhere along the road, lawmakers got the idea that talking about a subject was just as good as tackling it. On an issue like immigration, for instance, members of both parties talk endlessly -- and with every utterance, move further away from ever finding a solution. Powerful special interests. Many people run for Congress because they think these are powerful positions. But when they arrive, they realize just how little power they have. The clout lies with special interests, which turn out volunteers and give money to campaigns. Want to get education reform? Talk to the teachers unions. Want to save Social Security? You'll need to go through the senior lobby. All politicians have pressure points, and the special interests know just where to push. Polarization. No matter what the issue at hand, the extreme voices tend to be the loudest -- and often the most inflexible. So policy debates quickly degenerate into a pair of competing and intractable positions that neither side will budge from. Compromise is unlikely, and combat is inevitable. And in that environment, it's usually all or nothing. No one will settle for half a loaf; they all want the whole bakery. Resistance to accountability. Lawmakers would rather wring their hands over a problem than lay claim to a remedy that might ruffle feathers. They know that, if they approve a controversial bill, they have to own it for the next election. So, oftentimes, they would rather have an issue to bat around than risk accountability at the polls for rolling up their sleeves and working out a solution to a problem. Voter apathy. The irony is that the worse government performs, the greater the public cynicism, and the less likely it is that many Americans will turn out to vote -- which, in turn, only makes government even worse, because it offers little incentive for politicians to do better. That's dangerous. After all, as former Wyoming Sen. Al Simpson likes to say, politics is a contact sport: ""You take part, or you get taken apart."" What if you were in charge? The old saying dictates that people get the government they deserve. But they also get the government they'll tolerate. If it's really true that record numbers of Americans are fed up with their government, as the latest polls show, they have to make it known -- and make some changes. And one way to fix government is to replace those who are doing the governing -- whatever generation they're from. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Two authors blame baby boomers for broken government .

"London, England (CNN) -- Want to make the ultimate superyacht entrance? Why not go by submarine through ""James Bond-style"" doors? Or if you'd prefer, take a helicopter ride then keep it stowed securely away in your very own on-board hangar. Sounds far-fetched? Not at all. These feats are all possibilities on the PJ World yacht. The 82-meter vessel, with a price tag of more than â‚¬110million ($150m), is currently being built in Norway. Designed in conjunction with Rolls Royce and boat makers Palmer Johnson, the ice class superyacht aims to be the ultimate luxury home on water. ""This is a moving house,"" says the Director of Palmer Johnson Europe, Russell Morris. ""But with this home, if you don't like the neighbors, you can just sail away."" Unlike submarines on other superyachts, passengers can access their six-man vessel via an internal docking station. ""It has a James Bond door that opens to the water,"" explains Morris. ""Then once in the submarine you can explore deep water."" The futuristic entrance shares the limelight with a helicopter hangar that can be compared to the Batmobile's garage. The hangar is accessed through opening hatches on the deck and an hydraulic lift. The hangar, which also comes equipped with a re-fueling system, means that the helicopter is protected from the elements and can stay on-board while the PJ World yacht explores. This is a handy feature considering the vessel is capable of sailing in all kinds of water from the Mediterranean to the Antarctic. Keeping in mind the boat's ability to sail in waters across the globe, security has also been made a priority, the manufacturers say. Water cannons and thermal imagery systems are in place in a bid to defend against potential pirate attacks. PJ World is more than a year into construction, with building expected to be complete in around 18 months time. Makers hope the yacht will be a keen sailor's mega mansion on water, with room for offices kitted out with the latest in satellite technology and a classroom for the children. The owner's apartment covers three decks and there's a fourth deck for guests. In the public area there's a piano salon, a cinema, a beauty salon, a fitness center and a private swimming pool. While luxury has been at the forefront of the minds of her makers, PJ World has been designed with an environmentally-friendly focus. ""We've used the latest technology to make it as green as possible,"" says Morris. The hull's shape and the medium speed diesel engine means the yacht produces low emissions. She also has a dynamic positioning system so that PJ World can avoid anchoring in environmentally sensitive areas.","The PJ World yacht is priced at more than $150m .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli Embassy in Amman on Thursday sent home all but a skeleton staff due to security considerations, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official told CNN. The official, who asked not to be identified in keeping with diplomatic protocol, said the staffers typically travel from Amman to Israel every Friday and Saturday. They were sent home a day early this week after last week's ransacking of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo by protesters and plans for anti-Israel protests this week in Amman. The turnout for Thursday's demonstration in the Jordanian capital, however, was small. The full embassy staff is expected to return Sunday to work in Amman. Anti-Israel demonstrations have been taking place in Amman for the past several weeks.  One group, called ""Million Man March to Close the Israeli Embassy in Jordan,"" has more than 3,000 members on its Facebook page.  The group's motto is: ""No Zionist embassy on Jordanian land."" The main group calling for the protests seems to be an organization called Jamee al-Kalouti, or JAK. Dozens of its members have protested at the embassy every Thursday for years to denounce Jordan's ties with Israel. The group calls for the expulsion of the ambassador and annulment of the 1994 peace treaty that established diplomatic relations between Jordan and Israel. Eyewitnesses reported that security was increased around the already-fortified embassy in the western part of Amman in anticipation of the protest. More than half of Jordan's 6.5 million residents are of Palestinian origin. In Cairo on September 9, an estimated 3,000 Egyptian protesters tore down a wall surrounding the building that houses the Israeli Embassy there and entered its offices, tossing papers bearing Hebrew writing from the windows and into the streets. An Egyptian commander at the embassy told CNN that security personnel were ordered to avoid confrontations with protesters, who cheered the embassy's demolition and chanted calls for the ouster of Israel's ambassador to Egypt.  However, the Egyptian Health Ministry told the state-sponsored Al-Ahram newspaper that three people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in clashes between security forces and demonstrators.  Amnesty International said 130 people were arrested. Egypt's military leaders promised the following day to re-establish order. Officials reactivated the country's emergency law, according to Mohamed Hegazy, spokesman for the prime minister. The government also vowed to try those responsible for the attack on the Israeli Embassy, which pushed Israel to withdraw its diplomatic personnel from Egypt, Hegazy said. Amnesty International warned of the consequences of the expanded emergency law, calling it ""the greatest erosion of human rights since the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year."" Egyptians have been angry about the killing last month of five Egyptian police officers by Israeli soldiers when Israel went after militants who had attacked civilians near the Israeli-Egyptian border. Since the revolution that ousted Mubarak in February, many Egyptians have taken to the streets to call for the end of diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. After the incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will stick to its 1979 peace agreement with Egypt. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and journalist Amy Hybels contributed to this report.","NEW: Turnout at the protest is small .
