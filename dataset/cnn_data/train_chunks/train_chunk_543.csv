In the dock: A saliva stain on the T-shirt of the victim of a fight allegedly involving N-Dubz rapper Dappy has a 'billion-to-one' DNA link to the singer, a court has heard. Dappy is pictured arriving at Guildford Crown Court this morning . Saliva linked to N-Dubz rapper Dappy was found on the T-shirt of the alleged victim of a mass brawl, a court heard today. Guildford Crown Court was told that Dappy sparked a 'mob attack' when he spat at two girls who refused to get into a car with him and two friends at a petrol station in the early hours of the morning. The spit missed the girls but he then spat at another person, David Jenkins, who had stood up to defend them before becoming subject to an attack. Dappy, charged under his real name of Costadinos Contostavlos, swung a punch at him before Mr Jenkins put the rapper in a headlock, the trial was told. Forensic scientist Carolyn Smith told the court that saliva linked to Dappy was detected on Mr Jenkins’ T-shirt. She said: 'We estimated the probability of getting this DNA profile from another person who was unrelated to Mr Contostavlos as one in a billion.' Paul Greaney, defending Dappy, asked Ms Smith if the saliva could have been wiped on to the T-shirt sleeve as a result of the headlock. She replied: 'It could have been that way, there are numerous options.' Brian Stork, prosecuting, told the jury that Dappy, 25, pulled up in a car at the Shell garage in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey at about 3.30am on February 28 last year. He and a friend, Kalonji Stewart, got out of the car along with a third man. While Stewart went inside the shop Dappy began talking to the girls, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, who were in a group sitting on the kerb outside. Mr Stork alleged that Dappy tried to persuade the two girls to come with them in their car and when they refused he called the girls sluts, said one was ugly and then spat at them, but missed. Mr Stork said that after Mr Jenkins was spat at, Dappy swung a punch at him and the violence 'kicked off'. The incident then turned into a 'mob-handed, utterly unlawful and aggressive attack', according to Mr Stork. Dappy was joined by two other men, Kieran Vassell and Alfred Miller, who had arrived in a second Mercedes car with other unidentified men. Witnesses: It is alleged that Dappy spat at Grace Cochran, left, and Serena Burton, right . Mr Stork showed the jury CCTV footage, lasting just moments, from the garage. It showed the men attacking Mr Jenkins and his two other friends, resulting in damaged teeth to Mr Jenkins and a fractured nose to another man. They then all got into cars and drove off. Miller and Vassell are alleged to have used their feet and fists in the attack and Dappy is alleged to have got involved when he was released from the headlock. Stewart also got involved but less so, the prosecution claims. Taxi driver Tahir Jaffrey told the jury that he pulled on to the forecourt and saw a group fighting.He described how he locked his car’s doors because he did not want him or his fare-paying passenger to become inadvertently involved. He said: 'I do not want to see violence, I just called police when I saw it happen. 'I saw these three guys and all of a sudden people came out of their cars and began fighting.'I do not know how this fighting started. It was very quick what I saw.' Mr Jaffrey cowered in his taxi . after pulling into the forecourt of a Shell petrol garage. Accused: Dappy has been charged under his real name of Costadinos Contostavlos . He . said: 'Three people came out from the shop. There were three cars in . front of me and people turned up - they started fighting with these . three guys. Mr Jaffrey, who . claimed that the row involved 12 to 13 people, added: “I saw three cars, . people turned up, got out from the cars and they were shouting. 'There . were three other people, they came out from the shop and they were all . shouting. I saw one guy hit someone and he fell down on the ground.' Mr Jaffrey continued: 'He fell down on the floor and then I think I saw he hit him again when he was on the floor.' Asked . by Mr Stork how the incident had made him feel, Mr Jaffrey described . how 'aggressive' those brawling were and added: 'I did not feel good - I . didn’t feel good. 'I was in my car with my passenger. I just called the police straight away. 'I . was sitting in my car and I locked the car. People are fighting. My . passenger was there when there was fighting - I did not want to unlock . the car.' Paul Greaney QC, for Dappy, used CCTV to challenge Mr Jaffrey’s claim that he had seen the violence kick-off. Mr Jaffrey answered: 'I saw what I saw. I came and I saw these three guys. 'All of a sudden people came out of the car and then started fighting.' He added that some of those involved 'zoomed off' shortly afterwards. Mr . Jaffrey was also questioned about why he had not given a statement on . the incident until May, and whether he could have confused what he had . seen with a different row. Stewart and Vassell both deny affray. Miller has admitted the offence and will be sentenced at a later date. Dappy denies two counts of common assault on the two women, one of assault by beating, of Mr Jenkins, and one of affray. He is charged alongside Vassell, 25, of Hammersmith, west London, and Stewart, 32, of Harborne, Birmingham, who are each charged with affray. Miller, 28, of Brentford, west London, has pleaded guilty to affray and his case was adjourned for sentence at the end of the trial. Mr Stork said Dappy told police when he was arrested that he was attacked, put in a headlock, his security came to help him and he then got straight into a car. He denies spitting at anyone and said he cannot understand how his saliva came to be on Mr Jenkins’ shirt. The other men made prepared statements to officers and then gave 'no comment' interviews.The trial was adjourned until tomorrow. The trial continues.

A historic Yorkshire marketplace will have its cobbles ripped up and replaced with modern block paving for health and safety reasons. East Riding council said the traditional stones in Beverley's Saturday Market could 'cause problems for visitors and residents with disabilities' and has ordered crews to dig them up next week, causing uproar among townsfolk and English Heritage. The conservation body has strongly advised against the plan and urged the council to keep the cobbles, which historians believe are at least 175 years old and probably date back to the 1700s. Rage: A number of protest marches have been held to oppose the cobbles being ripped up in Saturday Market . Protest: Campaigners opposed to the removal of the cobbles bear signs saying 'What next? The Minster?' and 'Cobblers to the council' It said the traditional surface is 'important to the historic character' of the market town, which is popular with day-trippers and tourists. Residents have held 500-strong marches through the market square and presented petitions containing almost 1,000 names in a bid to halt the work. However, town hall bosses said work will go ahead after they consulted community groups, including members of a disability advisory group, which were in favour of removing the stones. History professor Barbara English, of Beverley Civic Society, said it was a 'hugely disappointing' and short-sighted decision in the face of 'an overwhelming amount of opposition'. 'This will destroy the town's historic atmosphere,' she said. 'Saturday Market, which is surrounded by listed buildings, is the absolute core of the town. This and the minster (an historic church in the town) are what people associate with Beverley.' Vocal: More than 500 people marched on Sunday, and 1,000 have signed a petition opposing the council's plan . Angry young man: A Beverley child shows his support for the Save Our Setts campaign . History: The cobbles in Saturday Market, Beverley, East Yorkshire are due to be removed next week because of health and safety concerns. Residents and historians have blasted the plans . Outrage: Marches attended by 500 people and a 1,000-signature petition have failed to dissuade town chiefs from removing the cobblestones . Legacy: The stones in Saturday Market are believed to be 175-years-old or more . Prof English said historic records show the stones were in place in 1829 and may well be from the 1700s. But the council says many of the cobbles - or setts - were replaced or restored when they were uncovered from beneath a layer of tarmac in the 1980s. Campaign group Save Our Setts, organised by Beverley Action Group, has held 500-strong protest parades through the town, which has a population of less than 30,000. The Yorkshire town of Beverley is famous for its 13th century Minster, its market and its music festivals, which celebrate traditional and early music. The medieval background of the town is reflected in street names like Toll Gavel, Butcher Row, Ladygate, Hengate, Wednesday Market and Saturday Market. The Minster has Europe's largest collection of musician stone carvings. It also boasts the 700-year old Percy Tomb, a masterpiece of European medieval art. On the other side of town is St Mary's Church, which has a brightly-painted Minstrel pillar and a decorated ceiling depicting the Kings of England. The church also has a carving of a pilgrim hare, which was said to be the inspiration behind Lewis Caroll's White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. Beverley's annual festivals of early music, chamber music and folk music attract visitors from far and wide and celebrate the town`s ancient tradition as a centre of musical excellence. The town's Art Gallery is renowned for its permanent collection of Frederick Elwell paintings, a painter who once painted a portrait of King George V and lived in the town. A spokesman called the idea 'a crude, inappropriate scheme that will remove these wonderful landmarks and change the character of Beverley's main square for the worse, forever'. He added: 'The setts, pavements, curbs and gullies are an essential part of the cultural heritage of this town and a major feature of Saturday Market, drawing visitors from around the UK and abroad.' English Heritage said East Riding council asked for its advice about changes to the marketplace in 2012, which also include upgrading pavements and increasing pedestrian areas as part of a £2.5million scheme. An English Heritage spokesman said: 'We believe it is possible to improve the market area and still keep the cobbles, which are important to the historic character of Beverley. 'We were supportive of the proposals in principle, although we advised there were elements of the scheme which could be changed to be more sympathetic to the historical character of the conservation area and the 40 listed buildings in the area. 'We advised that it was better to keep the cobble stones rather than remove them completely and only remove them where wheelchair access was needed. 'This advice was given before East Riding submitted their official planning application and since then we have heard nothing from the council on their plans for the area.' Saturday Market's large market square is still used by traders and is lined with conservation-listed Georgian, Victorian and other historic buildings.

It contains a 300-year-old market cross that is Grade I listed - the highest historic protection possible, reserved for 2.5% of all listed structures including Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and York Minster. Nigel Leighton, director of environment and neighbourhood services at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the cobbles 'can cause problems for less able-bodied people or those using wheelchairs and prams'. He said a number of community groups, including the town council, chamber of trade and the Disability Advisory Monitoring Group were consulted. What a mess: In November bungling council workers enraged residents in the picturesque market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, after wrecking historic cobblestones by covering them with thick yellow paint . He added: 'The proposed scheme is a good compromise of all the feedback received by the council from groups and individuals who represent a broad cross-section of Beverley's 30,000 population. 'Work on the scheme will begin next week and the council has agreed to look into reclaiming the setts and other historic materials to be set aside for use in Beverley.' Several years ago, plans were put forward to transform the market square into a continental-style piazza, complete with fountains and trees. They were ditched following a public outcry. In November residents in the picturesque market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, were furious after council workers clumsily daubed double yellow lines on Georgian cobbles in an historic square. The paint dribbled down the stones leaving an unsightly mess in St Mary's Place in the town, a popular tourist destination. James Tweedle, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'It's absolute incompetence.'","Residents fume over plans to tear up cobbles in town's scenic marketplace .

Photographs taken moments before an aircraft crashed into a mountain killing two men have been published. The pictures, taken from a video camera attached to the Pegasus Quik microlight, show 3,850ft Ben More in Scotland looming ever closer. The aircraft ran into severe turbulence and crashed about 100ft from the summit in May last year. The dramatic photographs show the final moments before a microlight crashed into a mountain killing two men . The pictures show the mountain getting ever closer as the pilot struggled to regain control in strong winds . The final tragic picture shows the peak of Ben More in Scotland seconds before the crash . The pilot David Martin, 63, from Kinghorn . in Fife, and his passenger Alan McCaskie, 62, from Broughty Ferry in . Dundee, who owned the microlight, were killed in the accident in . Stirlingshire. Pilot and father-of-two David Martin had 12 years flying experience . The Air Accidents Investigation Branch released the pictures as part of a report into the crash. It said: 'The severity of the turbulence created by . the wind, close to the summit of Ben More, was such that it exceeded . the safe conditions for flight in the microlight. 'This resulted in a loss of control which led to the impact close to the summit of the mountain.' The report said the video showed the flight path had been stable up to a point about 300 metres from the summit. It went on: 'At this point the aircraft started to roll rapidly from left to right and pitched nose-down.' The AAIB added that the increase in . engine power 'suggests the pilot was trying to arrest his rate of . descent and climb out of the turbulence'. The . report said a witness on the top of Ben More saw the last moments of . the aircraft's flight and had described the wind at the summit as 'very . strong'. When the witness removed an item of . clothing from his rucksack it was nearly 'ripped' out of his hand by the . wind, the report said. The . report added: 'It is likely that, in this case, a lack of awareness of . the wind conditions, and of the likelihood and severity of turbulence . downwind of high ground were factors in this accident.' Father-of-two Mr Martin had been flying for 12 years and was a member of the Scottish Aero Club in Perthshire. Mr McCaskie, who was married with a son, joined the club in 2011 and was working towards his pilot's licence.

A lorry carrying cans of soft drink burst into flames on a busy motorway, leaving thousands of drivers caught up in rush hour tailbacks. A section of the M6 motorway remains closed after the Eddie Stobart truck caught fire at junction 9, north of Birmingham, at around 3.15pm this afternoon. The lorry is understood to have been filled with thousands of cans of cola and other soft drinks which began 'exploding' as a result of the blaze, the Highways Agency said. Dramatic: The Eddie Stobart lorry burst into flames on the M6 motorway between Junctions 7 and 9, near Birmingham . The dramatic scene was captured on camera by John Trifonos, whose photographs show the lorry can and wheels flaming. 'You could literally see the plume of smoke for miles,' he said. 'I slowed down to take the photo but the heat from the fire was that intense I couldn't pause for long. 'I've never felt heat like it - it was like a furnace. Immense but very frightening. 'You could also hear popping and crackling sounds as the fire consumed the lorry,' Mr Trifonos said. Flames: The lorry was carrying thousands of cans of cola and other soft drinks that began to 'explode' as a result of the fire, the Highways Agency said . Disruption: The plume of smoke emerging from the flaming lorry was 'visible for miles', one motorist said . Eddie Stobart spokesman Glenn Patterson said the lorry had been carrying palettes loaded with cans of a variety of soft drinks. Mr Patterson said the cause of the incident was still under investigation, but it is suspected to have been the result of a technical fault inside one of the lorry's wheels. Nobody was injured in the blaze, West Midlands Police said. The Highways Agency said the motorway was closed northbound between junctions 7 and 10, as was the link from the M5 north to the M6 at junction 8, and added that delays were expected until well after the evening rush hour. The closures were causing delays of around one hour. A spokeswoman said: 'It happened at around 3.15pm. At the minute there are closures from junction 7 to 10 of the M6 on the northbound carriageway, and we are advising motorists to find alternative routes where possible. 'We are not expecting it to be cleared up until the early evening,' she added. Chris Caine, operations manager at the Highways Agency, said: 'We are working closely with the fire service to clear the incident as soon as possible. 'We have reopened the majority of the motorway between junctions 7 and 10 but two lanes remain closed past the scene. 'We will have to examine the carriageway and determine what repairs are needed before we can fully re-open the road.' The Environment Agency also attended the scene today, where liquid from the lorry began seeping into the drainage system.","Eddie Stobart lorry caught fire at junction 9 of the M6 at around 3.15pm .

A quarter of parents now regard heating up baked beans or putting a frozen pizza in the oven as ‘cooking’, according to a new study. The researchers concluded that British people are in danger of losing their cooking skills as more of us rely on ready meals. Another finding was that traditional British dishes such as Bakewell Tart and steak and kidney pie are in danger of dying out. Culinary masterpiece: A quarter of Britain's parents would regard this as a cooking triumph, the study says . The survey of 2,000 adults found that fewer British people than ever are cooking properly every night of the week, with just 19 per cent of us doing it, compared to nearly 40 per cent 20 years ago. Researchers found that one in five British parents also believe heating a ready meal in the microwave constitutes cooking, and nine per cent of mothers and fathers have tried to pass off microwave meals as their own work. And 27 per cent - or 3.6 million - say shoving a pizza or chicken nuggets and chips in the oven counts as ‘cooking’. The poll, commissioned by the cookery book publisher Parragon, also found that as our lives become increasingly hectic, we spend less time in the kitchen than we did 20 years ago. Just a third of us can claim we spend more than 40 minutes cooking a meal - compared to 50 per cent of the previous generation. As we spend less time cooking, so we are forgetting how to cook traditional favourites.  The survey showed that only ten per cent of us have made a Bakewell Tart in the last five years, and just one in five of us have made a steak and kidney pie from scratch in that time. Do you know how to make one? Only ten per cent of us have made a Bakewell Tart in the last five years . The descent of Britons’ culinary skills contrasts sharply with the rise in popularity of cookery programmes and celebrity chefs. More and more of us are relying on . frozen food and ready meals - which we munch while watching cookery programmes on television. But we're not learning from them: the average Briton learns five recipes from a cookbook in comparison to just two from a food show. The speedy choice: More of us are turning to ready meals as our lives become busier . The research showed that just a quarter of us are likely to try a recipe we’ve seen on television as we find them too complicated and too fast to follow. Sue Irvine, a 46-year-old admin worker and mother-of-three from Southampton, said: 'We’ve certainly had more pre-prepared meals since having kids. 'When my husband and I get back from work . the last thing we want to do is spend an hour in the kitchen cooking - . on a busy day it's so much quicker and easier to heat up a ready-made . lasagne in the microwave than make it from scratch.' New family tradition: More families are eating ready meals heated in the microwave . Vickie Voss, of Parragon Books, which produces the Love Food range of cookbooks, said: 'Brits have less time to cook but still want to eat and provide good food. 'Despite millions of us tuning in to cookery shows, a cookbook still seems the easiest way for people to improve their culinary skills as they can go at their own pace, choose recipes to suit their tastes and enjoy the experience of cooking.'","Only a third of British parents spend more than 40 minutes preparing food .

Colin Farmer, 63, has today issued a compensation claim after he collapsed to the ground in shock and believed he might be dying from another stroke. The blunder happened on October 12 last year after reports were received of a man walking through the town centre in Chorley, Lancashire, with a martial arts weapon.

A spokesman for the Race2Recovery team said a support vehicle the three team members were travelling in during the Dakar Rally was involved in a head-on collision in Peru which is believed to have left two other people dead. The three men, who are part of a team of injured soldiers taking part in the challenge, were named as Justin Birchall, 40, a team driver and civilian volunteer from Burnley, Lancashire, whose Wildcat vehicle retired earlier in the race, former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer and Gulf War and Falklands war veteran Lee Townsend, a team mechanic, from Yate near Bristol, and retired Army Major John Winskill, 42, the team logistics expert, who is from Durrington, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. 'Stable and conscious': Justin Birchall (second left) was among three British men seriously hurt in a crash during the Dakar Rally in South America . 'Huge shock': The three men are part of the Race2Recovery team of injured soldiers (seen here before the race in Peru) taking part in the challenge to raise money for disabled servicemen . The men were transferred to a local hospital and later flown by aircraft to another hospital in Lima where they are said to be 'stable and conscious' with injuries described as 'non-life-threatening'. Their families have been informed of the accident by other team members. The crash happened when their vehicle, a Land Rover Defender, was travelling in convoy on day five of the rally with other support vehicles in the Peruvian town of Tacna, near the Chilean border. It is understood that two other vehicles were involved in the accident and two people received fatal injuries. The Race2Recovery team, which has been raising funds for forces charities since 2011, is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the challenge . Dedicated: Sgt Mark Zambon, who was not injured in the crash, is pictured climbing into his co-driver seat before the race . Team leader Captain Tony Harris said: 'Our hearts go out to the families and relatives of those who have died in this tragic accident and we offer them our condolences and sympathy. 'Our entire team has been struck by the friendliness and support we have received from the Peruvian people since arriving for the Dakar Rally.' He said that the team had unanimously agreed to continue the challenge with the two remaining Wildcat vehicles. 'The team decided before we even started that we would continue our endeavour. This is obviously a huge shock but we know that we have the blessing of the injured. They want the team to finish,' the captain added. The accident is believed to have happened at 9.30pm local time yesterday. Tough going: The rally began in Lima on Saturday and ends in Santiago, Chile, on January 20 . Perilous: The rally, described as the most dangerous in the world, and accidents like this are a common sight . It is being investigated by the local police in Peru and the team is being supported by the race organisers. The Race2Recovery team, which has been raising funds for forces charities since 2011, is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the challenge. The rally began in Lima on Saturday and ends in Santiago, Chile, on January 20. It will see the team travel some 5,600 miles of extreme mountain and desert terrain that will take them through southern Peru, across the border into Argentina and then to Chile over 15 days. The Race2Recovery team began the race with four Wildcat race vehicles along with additional support vehicles but will now continue with just two race vehicles. Hundreds of motorbikes, quads, cars and trucks will race 5,600 miles (9,000km) over extreme mountain and desert terrain during the rally . Blow: The Race2Recovery team began the race with four Wildcat race vehicles along with additional support vehicles but will now continue with just two race vehicles . Capt Harris, 31, who had his lower leg amputated while serving in Afghanistan, is one of the rally drivers. The fleet of support vehicles include a 4x4 truck racing with it, plus 8x8 support trucks and a number of Land Rover Discovery vehicles to help move the support team and mechanical equipment. The team has the motto Beyond Injury - Achieving The Extraordinary, and set up its Dakar Rally challenge to inspire people who may be injured, ill or facing adversity. The 28-strong team includes British and US servicemen who were wounded in combat and have missing limbs, spinal injuries and psychological and fragmentation injuries. They received royal backing when it became the first recipient of a grant from the Endeavour Fund, set up by the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. All proceeds raised by the team go to the Tedworth House Personnel Recovery Centre, Tidworth, Wiltshire, which is part of a Government-led initiative to help wounded and sick servicemen and women recover. A host of celebrities including Dame Kelly Holmes and Robbie Williams took to social media to show their support for the Race2Recovery team and wish them luck as they set off. Olympic and Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius, a motoring enthusiast, sent a video message praising them for putting the focus on ability rather than disability.","Race2Recovery members injured in head-on crash which killed two others .

It emerged last week that senior stand-ins at Southend as well as Basildon and Essex County . Council cost £8million-a-year. In 2011/12, Mr Boyle would have been paid a staggering £187,154.40 based on his daily rate for 48 weeks - significantly more than council chief executive Rob Tinlin, who was on a basic salary of £148,881, and David Cameron, who is on £145,500. Mr Boyle, who works five days a week, was even on a higher rate than his current £779-a-day when he worked for the authority briefly in 2007, before he was drafted back three years later. Council leader Nigel Holdcroft said Mr Boyle was in post because the authority had been unable to find a permanent head of adult commissioning since 2010. Mr Tinlin said: 'When the post became vacant again 2010, we were unable to recruit to this position so Mike returned to fill the post in the interim, from June 2010 at a reduced rate of pay. 'Over the period Mike has been acting for the council, this and other posts have been filled on temporary arrangements to facilitate service reviews and a review of the senior management structure.' Southend Council would not say what Mr Boyle's original daily rate was before it was scaled back, but a slice of it will be paid to a recruitment agency, who provided My Boyle. Temporary: Mr Boyle has been the interim head of adult commissioning at cash-strapped Southend Council, Essex, since 2010 . Opposition leaders have called on the council to make better use of its money particularly as its budget is set to be slashed by the Government later this year while unions say 90 jobs are at risk. Martin Terry, leader of the opposition independent party, said: 'We are looking at more cuts this year and when you set that against the backdrop of these huge salaries it makes me angry. 'The council should be looking at training and using some of their existing staff to temporary fill in rather than bringing in staff at a ridiculous cost to the taxpayer.' Graham Longley, leader of the Liberal Democrat Group in Southend, said: 'Interim staff is quite acceptable providing they are temporary and once they go beyond what is a reasonable timeframe for a temporary member of staff, they should not be in post. 'I'm surprised no-one has picked up on the fact that Mr Boyle has been in his role so long in terms of his temporary contract.' Interim members of staff are not entitled to pensions or holiday and sick pay, and Southend Council claims that it has reduced its numbers of temporary staff over the past few years. The council says Mr Boyle has played a major role in shaping council policy during his time in Southend. Since returning to the authority in 2010, he has taken the lead in a number of projects which have taken months and even years to reach fruition. Pricey: It emerged last week that Essex County Council, pictured, employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million . Nigel Holdcroft, leader of Southend Council, defended the authority. He said: 'When we employ interims they have always been for a good reason, either because we have been unable to find a suitable appointment or where we anticipate that there is likely to be a reconstructuring of areas of the council. 'Councils are under financial pressure and on occasion it's in the financial best interests to fill a post with an interim because it gives us greater flexibility. 'We can only appoint somebody full-time if we can find the right person to fill the role and we are confident that role is going to be retained in any future organisation. 'We go through great lengths to ensure the number of interim staff is kept to an absolute minimum and when they are appointed it is for a good reason and that reason is discussed by senior staff at the council.' At Basildon Council, one executive director who remains in a job is . paid £565-a-day and was among seven other staff who earned more than . £300 a day. They were all hired through agencies. One interim executive director has been in post since August 2011 and is not due to leave until April 2013. In total, Basildon Council spent £501,000 on temporary staff in 2011-12, . while Southend's seven temporary employees cost a total of £330,000. Essex County Council, which has cut almost 1,000 workers since 2009, . employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million.  Two of the temps were . paid more than £900-a-day. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said last week: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked that local authorities in the county are spending so much money on interim staff. ‘Temporary staff may be needed sometimes to fill roles in the short term, but these figures suggest they are being used for far longer than that by local authorities which is an enormous waste of money. ‘Councils need to explain why these staff were needed or to take action to deliver better value for our money.’ Mr Boyle has declined to comment.","Mike Boyle has been in his role at Southend Council since 2010 .

"UPDATED: . 08:39 EST, 14 September 2011 . With her long blonde hair and healthy tan Carolyn Still wouldn't look out of place in Footballers' Wives. So it is little wonder that the 29-year-old is causing a stir in the real world of football. But she is not the latest squeeze of some millionaire Premier League star - the politics graduate has become the the youngest CEO in English . football after being appointed to the board of Mansfield Town. Youth beauty AND experience: At 29 years old, Ms Still becomes the youngest in the country to hold such a high role in football . Young, . female and attractive, Carolyn Still - former high flyer in the luxury fashion industry . and now brand new chief executive of the Nottinghamshire club - is a . rare breed in the male-dominated world of football. But . armed with a knowledge of business acquired in the cut-throat fashion . industry, Still is adamant she is more than woman enough to fill the . role. Still, who has . held executive roles at luxury brands Gucci and Bulgari, says she will . draw on her fashion past to improve the fortunes of the club. 'Working in that industry I've absorbed a lot of useful information,' she says. 'Strategies can be utilised from fashion to football. It's business at the end of the day.' Outnumbered: As West Ham vice-chairman, Karren Brady, far right, with the club's owners, is one of the few women to hold top flight roles in the industry . On the ball: Karren Brady was just 23 when she was appointed managing director at Birmingham City . 'It's a great privilege for me to be . offered the chance to lead this football club,' said Miss Still on her . appointment. 'I intend to add vibrancy and fresh ideas to our approach . off the field.' Miss . Still has promised to do her best to bring success back to the Blue . Square Premier team, whose 77-year stay in the Football League came to . an end in 2008. 'I want to wake sleeping fans with a lot of different initiatives by liaising with them and finding what they want,' she said. She added: 'We have a fantastic team both on and . off the field and I am pleased to accept this role during a time when . there appears to be a real buzz around the place.' Unsurprisingly, her appointment has been compared to that of West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady, who at the age of 23 was made . managing director of Birmingham City Football Club. 'I do see a correlation,' says Still. 'Karren is steely, determined and, at . the end of the day, she turned around a football club that wasn't doing . very well that is now doing extremely well. In her wisdom, Still admits . that although her business acumen landed her the job, an unusual . appointment - in this case, of a young, attractive woman to a top-flight . football position - is nevertheless a shrewd one. 'There's no doubt that having a . 29-year-old female in the . role will attract publicity to the club,' she says. But as Still says, . that female has to have the brains to back up the beauty. 'Essentially, she had the business . brain behind it,' Still says of Brady. 'She had the statistics, the . enthusiasm - and that's very important within every business . environment.' 'It's about being positive, streamlining. I've got passion and enthusiasm. 'I'm going to observe and listen, and make the most out of the club's resources.

The problem-plagued Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner suffered another scare today as a fuel leak forced a Japan Airlines flight to be cancelled at Boston's Logan International Airport. It's the second problem with the jet class in as many days as another plane caught fire Monday when a battery exploded shortly after landing at the same airport. Today's incident occurred after the plane left the gate prior to takeoff for Tokyo and it was discovered that about 40 gallons of fuel had split, officials said. WATCH VIDEO BELOW . Boston firefighters work on Monday to douse a fire in a Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner's cargo hold . No fire or injuries occurred in today's incident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which . is investigating the fire that occurred on Monday, said the latest problem wouldn't warrant an investigation because there was no accident, according to Reuters. Monday's fire was discovered when a . mechanic inspecting the Japan Airlines Co Ltd jet saw the smoke in . the cockpit while performing a routine post-flight inspection. Smoke continues to billow out from the jetliner on Monday . Passengers had just exited the plane 15 minutes before the blaze broke out. A fire crew responded and determined . that a battery used to power the plane's electric systems when the . engines are not running had exploded, authorities said. The mechanic was the . only person on board the plane when the smoke was discovered and no one . was hurt by the blaze. The . fire was the latest reported mechanical failure in a string of incidents . affecting the Dreamliner, which was also plagued by production problems . that delayed initial delivery by 3-1/2 years. The design project began in the late 1990s. Boeing finally rolled out its first Dreamliner last year. There are currently 13 Dreamliners in service. Monday's explosion caused a fire but no passengers were hurt . The U.S. jet maker's shares fell more than 3 percent to $75.34 on the news. Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said of Monday's fire, 'We are aware of the event and are working with our customer.' The company has yet to respond to today's incident. The . 787 relies heavily on electrical power to drive onboard systems that in . other jet models are run by air pressure generated by the engines. It . also suffered electrical problems during testing that prompted a . redesign. The . aircraft is Boeing's first to be made of carbon composites rather than . aluminum, a change that lowers the plane's weight and allows it to burn . less fuel. Boeing stock dropped 3 points on the news of the fire . The . Dreamliner has suffered a string of mishaps with electrical systems in . recent weeks. On Dec. 4, a United Airlines flight from Houston to . Newark, New Jersey, made an emergency landing after it appeared that one . of its power generators failed. On Dec. 13, Qatar Airways said it had . grounded one of its three 787 jets because of the same problem United . had experienced.

A shocking new report has found one in eight U.S. women admit to binge drinking with that rate increasing to one in four among high school girls. With the figures, binge drinking was found contributing to the deaths of about 12,000 women and girls annually, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said with their report released on Tuesday. They say it's a long-overlooked problem, with the women found drinking an average of six drinks per session, despite it causing a long list of health risks, including breast cancer and heart disease. Downing: A new report has found one in eight U.S. women binge drink an average of six drinks in one sitting, with that average increasing among high school girls to one out of every five . 'Binge drinking is an under-recognized women's health issue,' Frieden said in a conference call on the new report. 'Women tend to be smaller and therefore are more susceptible to the harms of alcohol at lower levels of drinking.' Binge drinking for females is defined as four or more drinks in a single session. For men it's at least five. About twice as many men than women binge drink, but the health risks are different for women and the dangers of their behavior draw less attention, CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters. Binge drinking can increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, heart disease, unintentional pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and auto accidents, he said. Too much: A woman is seen lying on a bench after a night out, while binge drinking has been found contributing to the deaths of about 12,000 women and girls annually . Rates: Binge drinking for females is defined as four or more drinks in a single session while for men it's at least five . CDC scientists reviewed data collected on the drinking behaviors of approximately 278,000 women aged 18 and older, as well as 7,500 high school girls in 2011. The report estimated that nearly 14 million U.S. women binge drink about three times a month, consuming an average of six drinks during each binge. Half of all high school girls who consume alcohol reported binge drinking, the CDC said. The excessive use of alcohol is most common among white and Hispanic women, those aged 18-34, high school girls and women with household incomes of more than $75,000, the CDC said. Underage women and those who are pregnant should not drink at all, the CDC said. Other women are advised not to have more than one alcoholic drink per day.","CDC: Binge drinking contributes to death of roughly 12,000 women and girls annually .

Church leaders have warned that Christmas Day is in danger of becoming a ‘frenzy of bargain hunting’ after Amazon announced it is launching its sale on December 25. Online retailers expect an astonishing £307 million of business on Tuesday alone – 50 per cent more than an average day. Critics have called for the sales to be postponed until Boxing Day, leaving Christmas as a family occasion and religious celebration. Unheard of: Amazon has announced that it will be launching its sale on Christmas Day to the anger of church leaders . However, after a disappointing December, many retailers desperate to clear their stock have decided to unveil their sales a day early. A huge proportion of the 42 million Britons who shop online are likely  to log on, dwarfing the 2.3 million expected at Christmas Day services, including Midnight Mass. Most controversially, the biggest retailer, Amazon – already under fire for avoiding UK tax on its  estimated £3 billion annual sales – will begin listing bargains from 9am on Christmas morning. Alongside discounted stock will be ‘Lightning Deals’ – limited offers throughout the day, which are likely to pose a distraction from unwrapping presents. High street chains in the online rush include Currys PC World, John Lewis, Halfords, Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser and Argos, all of whose sales begin on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. However, many have already begun to offer major discounts in shops and online. 'It never stops': Amazon (warehouse pictured) - already under fire for avoiding UK tax - will begin listing bargains from 9am on December 25 . Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said: ‘Christmas Day is a time to be together with the family, to focus on the children and to have a great time together. ‘This day is precious. We are  now in danger of the gadgets taking over our lives and we are not in  control of them.’ The Rt Rev Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, a close contender for the post of Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year, said: ‘Christmas Day is an oasis of peace in an often frenzied world. ‘It’s a pity we don’t seem able to sustain a 24-hour period free of  our acquisitiveness. We do need a Sabbath [rest] from shopping if only once a year.’ And Andrea Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern and a member of the General Synod, added: ‘We all miss out if we forget the true meaning of Christmas. ‘And we will forget it if there is no space to remember. Big businesses have a responsibility to leave that space open for families to spend time with one another. Lord Carey said: 'Christmas Day is a time to be together with the family...' ‘Companies like Amazon will say they are meeting consumer demand. But surely even they recognise their responsibility to ensure time for things that money can’t buy?’ Her views echo the words of Pope Benedict XVI, who last year claimed Christmas had increasingly become a ‘shopping holiday’. However, a spokesman for Amazon said that although its website would take orders on Christmas Day, warehouse staff would not begin dispatching products until Boxing Day or December 27. He added that last year, some shoppers logged on as early as 6am to download music and books for their new iPods, Kindles and other devices. Andrew McClelland, of e-retailers’ organisation IMRG, said: ‘As consumers encounter discounts and offers already available in the sales on these sites, it is not surprising they will spend more than £300 million even on Christmas Day itself. ‘Online, the Christmas shopping never really stops.’ A spokesman for Currys PC World said: ‘We are simply offering something our customers want and have, in past years, demonstrated that they want. ‘Of course the convenience of online is such that customers can dip in and out of the sales without compromising time with family, friends and the other things that they hold dear at this time of year.’ However, MP Gary Streeter,  chairman of the all-party Christians in Parliament Group, said: ‘It’s a sad reflection on our times. I hope that most people will be focusing on their families and on bigger issues on Christmas Day and not ordering books online. ‘I would hope we’d never see shops opening at Christmas. It would require a change in the law and I can’t see Parliament voting for that – most people want to focus on their families and rightly so.’ Senior Tory backbencher Sir  Tony Baldry, who speaks for the Church of England in the Commons, added: ‘I think that it’s very sad if we can’t retain at least one day  of the year as a family day, a day  of celebration and reflection  to mark Christmas and for people to be together. ‘Whatever Amazon or others sell on Christmas Day, they will just as easily sell on subsequent days. It just seems unnecessary commercialism and very regrettable.’","Online retailers expect £307million of business on Tuesday alone .

The mother of nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who was gunned down two years ago outside of a supermarket in Tucson last year delivered a powerful message to lawmakers demanding harsher laws for gun control. Roxanna Green, Christina’s mother, said in a television commercial today that elected officials must take serious action so innocent children like her daughter are not killed. She said, ‘We have to demand a plan.’ The ad will first air in the Arizona city at 10:10am, the exact moment a lone gunman opened fire at a political event featuring former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011. Scroll down for video . Demands: Roxanna Green, who lost her daughter Christina-Taylor, 9, in 2011 at the Tucson shootings, appears in a commercial demanding a plan from lawmakers . Loss: Christina-Taylor Green, 9, was killed at a constituent meeting outside of a Safeway after a shooter opened fire . Scene: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others were wounded outside of this Safeway parking lot; six, including Christina-Taylor, were killed . The video, part of the Demand a Plan campaign, opens with Ms Green telling the parents who lost children in December’s Sandy Hook massacre that she knows ‘how much it hurts.’ The mother continues: ‘My nine-year-old daughter was murdered in the Tucson shooting. ‘I have one question for our political leaders – when will you find the courage to stand up to the gun lobby. Whose child has to die next?’ she asks. The ad was paid for by the Mayor’s Coalition Against Illegal Guns, an initiative run by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The mayor, a firm supporter of gun control, said in a statement that Mrs Green’s poignant message made it all the more clear that new laws are needed to protect the country’s citizens. 'We need political leaders to hear Roxanna loud and clear: we cannot wait any longer for you to do something about gun violence.  Another child should not have to die,’ the mayor, 70, said. Vigil: Thousands came out to hold candlelight vigils following the Tucson shooting in 2011 . Taking a stand: Green, left, stands with Chris Foye, who's son Chris Owens was killed by a stay bullet in Harlem in 2009 at a gun violence press conference days after Sandy Hook . Mr Bloomberg was on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ this morning discussing the video and the idea that some lawmakers are hesitant to vote on gun control laws for fear it would hurt their political career. But the mayor said that lobbying by the National Rifle Association was ‘notoriously unsuccessful in this last election. 'My nine-year-old daughter was murdered in the Tucson shooting. I . have one question for our political leaders; when will you find the . courage to stand up to the gun lobby. Whose child has to die next?' -Roxanna Green . 'They set one major priority, to defeat Barack Obama.’ He said that no overly dramatic measures need to be taken to implement control. ‘All you have to do is accept reasonable restrictions,’ saying that no one is trying to take away the right to target practice or weapons for home protection. Referring to Mrs Green, Mr Bloomberg said: ‘Every parent sits there and thinks, if it was my kid.’ Christina-Taylor was one of six people killed when gunman Jared Lee Loughner opened fire outside of a Safeway grocery store where Rep. Gabby Giffords was speaking. Rep. Giffords was shot in the head and was critically wounded. Twelve other people were also injured. Change: New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke on 'Morning Joe' today about Mrs Green and the gun control issue . Grief: Family, including mother Roxanna Green, third from right, father John, and son Dallas Green kneel in prayer behind the casket during the funeral service for Christina-Taylor in 2011 . Remembering: A memorial for the girl was presented in April of 2011; it was created from a beam from ground zero, a piece of steel from the Pentagon and a large rock from the Flight 93 crash site . From a young age, the bright child had an interest in politics, and was attending the constituent event to meet Rep. Giffords and ask her questions on what it was like being a politician. President Obama said of Christina-Taylor four days after the shooting that the girl was dancing in rain puddles in heaven. The president said: ‘I want America to be as good as she imagined it.’ Mrs Green, along with her husband John, have since founded the Christina-Taylor Green Memorial Foundation, an organization committed to doing good deeds in her name. Loughner, who was convicted of the shooting, was given seven consecutive life sentences, plus 140 years, last November. Outspoken: Former Rep.

She told AZCentral.com that seeing a row of 26 ribbons as she entered the town gave her goosebumps and sent a whole new wave of anxiety rushing through her. She said that visiting the town ‘brought back the whole thing.’ The mother added: ‘Not that it should happen anywhere, no matter what kind of town, but this place was like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.’","Roxanna Green lost daughter Christina-Taylor, 9, on January 8, 2011 shooting at Tucson supermarket .

A mother-of-two who was left breathing through a tube and barely able to speak after a routine operation went wrong has spoken of her horror that the surgeon is being allowed to work again. Jo Roche, 43, from Bridlington, had surgery to remove the thyroid gland on her neck. But the operation, which took just 90 minutes rather than the recommended two or three hours, severely damaged nerves linked to her vocal cords. She was left barely able to speak and the damage led to blockages in her airway. Six months later she had to undergo a complete tracheostomy to fit a tube through her neck and into her windpipe to allow her to breathe properly. Jo Roche was left breathing through a tube in her neck and barely able to speak after a routine operation to remove her thyroid went horribly wrong . Mrs Roche, a healthcare worker, had to teach herself to talk again and said the ordeal in January 2008 had changed her life and that of husband David, 44 and their two children Calvin, 15, and Poppy, 13, permanently. Speaking shortly after the operation, she told told the Bridlington Free Press: 'Life’s hard, basically. The tracheostomy looks so ugly and there’s so much that I can’t do that I used to love, like swimming and singing with the kids. 'I had to teach myself to talk again, but my voice is so quiet it’s hard to make myself heard. It’s changed my personality, I tend to just observe things now rather than speak up. Talking is difficult and takes a lot of energy. 'The children can’t really remember how I used to speak. When they see old holiday videos they see me without the tube and realise they had forgotten what my voice was like. I have nieces and nephews who will never know.' She added that she tires easily, is more prone to infections, and cannot enjoy many of the everyday things she loved. Egypt-trained vascular and general . surgeon Nayef El-Barghouty was suspended last year after a General . Medical Council fitness to practise hearing found he had lied under oath . to a coroner, and mistreated three patients including Mrs Roche. Mr El-Barghouty, who worked at . Scarborough Hospital for 15 years, was suspended in July 2011 for a . year but a tribunal has since decided that he can work again when his suspension ends on Saturday. A panel from the Medical . Practitioners Tribunal Service decided that Mr El-Barghouty can remain a . registered practitioner once his 16-month suspension finishes. He will . be subject to 21 strict conditions, which include no undertaking of thyroid surgery and four months of close supervision. Egypt-trained vascular and general surgeon Nayef El-Barghouty was suspended last year after a General Medical Council fitness to practise hearing found he had lied under oath to a coroner, but will now be allowed to work again from Saturday . Earlier, Mr El-Barghouty was found to have lied on oath during an inquest, admitting giving 'false and utterly misleading' evidence about Wilfred Taylor, who bled to death in January 2009. Mr Taylor, 84, had been due to have surgery on an aneurysm in his left leg, but Mr El-Barghouty operated at the wrong site, mistakenly tying off an artery. He was forced to carry out another corrective procedure which led to severe bleeding. Mr Taylor died during the third operation carried out on him in a day. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal . Service panel hearing Mr El-Barghouty’s case said it still 'remained . concerned' that he had 'not yet fully accepted and adopted the principle . that honesty is a fundamental tenet of the medical profession' – after he had lied under oath to a coroner. The panel heard evidence from his . mentor Professor Al-Doori, who said that Mr El-Barghouty had been . 'slightly bitter' about his suspension, and that he 'had not discussed . with him why he had been dishonest'. But the panel was 'impressed' with . testimonials and evidence it had seen and 'believed that Mr El-Barghouty . is a better person and doctor'. Mr El-Barghouty, who has been working . in Saudi Arabia during his suspension, will now be allowed to return to . practice in the UK from December 29 as long as he abides by the 21 . conditions for two years. He will only be allowed to work in the NHS, must notify the GMC upon accepting any job, and remain under . the supervision of an educational supervisor. Commenting, . the chair of the panel, Dr Vicki Harris, said: '[The panel] regards . lying to a coroner as an extremely serious incident of dishonesty. The . panel remains concerned that Mr El-Barghouty has not yet fully accepted and adopted the principle that honesty is a fundamental tenet of the medical profession.' She added: 'We want to encourage anyone who has concerns about this doctor to  contact the GMC straight away. They need to hear from people directly so they can investigate these cases.' Mrs Roche described the decision to allow Mr El-Barghouty to work again as a 'slap in the face' Mrs Roche said in response to the panel's decision: 'I was hoping and praying that he would not be allowed to practice again but I guess I half expected it. 'It would have been nice if he had been struck off - this just feels like a slap in the face for myself and other people. 'I still have to live with the consequences everyday but he doesn't - he can just pick up where he left off. There is no way that he should be allowed to work again. I worry for other people. I know that anybody who knows me or knows him would  never allow themselves into his care but if he moves out of the area then he will be able to do this again. 'I know that I wouldn't be suffering these difficulties if it wasn't for him.' Among other conditions, Mr El-Barghouty will not be able to work as a locum or work out-of-hours, or undertake thyroid surgery. 'That is a little victory,' she added. 'He had carried out seven thyroidectomies in three years and two of us ended up with a tracheotomy. The odds of something going wrong should be one in 1000. 'Still, you feel sorry for people living in a different area who do not know what he has done. 'I believe that patients should have the right to see their surgeon’s record before having an operation. You can choose which hospital you go to, but we do not have the information on the surgeon.' Other families in the area are also campaigning for the surgeon to be struck off for good. Lisa Pickup  and her sisters Sharon Pickup and Kerrie Smith have been collecting signatures in their home town of Scarborough, in a bid to keep Mr El-Barghouty off the GMC register following the death of their father Trevor in 2006 after a routine operation. Miss Pickup said: 'I know he won't come back to Scarborough Hospital but he could get a job anywhere else in the NHS. I want people to be aware of him on a national scale.' She added that the public response to their petition has been 'unbelievable', adding: 'People were actually queuing up to sign the petition. It has been amazing.' The Pickups' case is currently under investigation by the GMC. Back in July, a spokesperson for Scarborough Hospital said that while they could not discuss individual cases, 'dependent on the individual circumstances, if an employment has been terminated it would be very unlikely that the staff member would be reappointed'. A spokesperson this week said: 'Mr El-Barghouty’s contract with the Trust was terminated in August 2011 following the outcome of the GMC Fitness to Practise hearing. As he is no longer employed by the Trust it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.'","Jo Roche, 43, had routine surgery to remove the thyroid gland on her neck .

Universal benefits for pensioners could be cut after the next election, Iain Duncan Smith indicated yesterday. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes and TV licences will not be means tested until at least 2015 because the elderly need more time to prepare for a cut in the handouts. And he insisted that the Tories will honour David Cameron’s pledge not to touch the benefits before the General Election. Winter fuel allowance, TV licences and free bus passes could all become means tested for pensioners from 2015 . ‘We gave that clear commitment at the time of the last election,’ he said. ‘Pensioners need a much longer time if you are going to make changes to their income. ‘They are arguably the most difficult group to make short-term change because they can’t effect that change through any other means. They can’t suddenly say “I’ll take on more hours of work”.’ But Mr Duncan Smith’s choice of words puts him on a collision course with some of the Prime Minister’s closest advisers, who believe Mr Cameron will be damaged if he ever cuts the payments – even after 2015. There is a growing political consensus that pensioners should be asked to contribute more to the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans having escaped the worst of the austerity measures. Senior Liberal Democrats also spoke out yesterday, indicating that they will campaign to cut the payments to wealthy pensioners so that around £2billion that would be saved can be targeted at the least well off. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said pensioner benefits will not be touched until after the General Election . Research commissioned by Mr Cameron’s polling guru has found that a majority of the public back plans to cut the handouts for better off pensioners. But the polling also found that he will suffer a ‘crisis of trust’ if he breaks his pledge and leave him reviled by voters as Nick Clegg was when he broke his promise never to raise university tuition fees. That will dismay both Mr Duncan Smith and Chancellor George Osborne, who both privately regard the case for means testing pensioner benefits after 2015 as compelling. Last year Nick Clegg also signalled that the Liberal Democrats will go their own way on the issue at the 2015 election. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would be ‘looking again at universal benefits paid to the wealthiest pensioners’. Ros Altmann, director-general of over-50s group Saga, said a raid on pensioner benefits would punish those who have saved for retirement. Mr Duncan Smith’s spokesman said: ‘Iain made it very clear  that we have protected all the pensioner benefits for the whole of this Parliament and there are absolutely no plans to change that.’","Universal benefits could be axed from 2015 .

A father and his four children were killed early this morning when their home in rural eastern Kentucky burned to the ground. The bodies of Billy Wilfong, and his kids Dakota Lee, 5, Tyler Lane, 4, Cheyenne, 2, and 6-month-old Emily, were found within two feet of each other in the small Jonancy home's living room, where the family had been sleeping near an electric space heater, said Pike County Coroner Russell Roberts. Wilfong's partner and the mother of the children, Tammie Tucker, survived the blaze, which began about 2:30 a.m. She was in critical condition on Wednesday afternoon after suffering serious burns. Cause: Wilfong, pictured, and his children had been sleeping near an electric space heater when the fire broke out . A relative who lives nearby said she woke up early this morning to find the house engulfed. 'There was nothing I could do, I got second-degree burns just getting close to it,' said Glema Blair, the children's great-aunt. Tucker's father, James Tucker, said he was awakened by his daughter beating on the window of his home, screaming 'Help, Daddy, help!' 'When I opened up the curtain and looked out the window, the whole house was up in flames,' James Tucker said. His daughter yelled through the window, ""I need help getting the babies out of the house."" Tucker rushed to the house but 'there wasn't no way I could get into it.' Tragic: Pictured (r-l) Dakota Lee, 5, Tyler Lane, 4, Cheyenne, 2, and 6-month-old Emily, were all killed in the tragic fire . Parents: Billy Wilfong, right, died in the fire while Tammie Tucker, left, is fighting for her life . Just after it started, Blair, who . lives behind the home, ran to the fire and saw Tucker and her father . attempting to get inside. Tammie Tucker was taken to UK Medical Center . with burns all over her body. 'She was trying her best,' said Blair, who was fighting back tears. The children and their mother were inseparable, said Vicki Elkins, mother-in-law to one of Tammie's sisters. 'It's going to take all her family pulling together,' Elkins said as she wondered how Tucker would endure such a heavy loss. As . the house still-smoldered, neighbors and relatives gathered to remember . the loving father and bubbly children, vowing to support Tucker through the incomprehensible . tragedy, if she survived. Burned to the ground: Firefighters from the Shelby Valley Volunteer Fire Department extinguished the blaze at the family's Jonancy, Ky., home . Mourning: A makeshift memorial, pictured, was placed in front of the smoldering home on Wednesday afternoon . By afternoon, a makeshift memorial had sprung up at the single-story frame home, located on a narrow, serpentine road that leads up the Appalachian hillside. Red flowers and four blue balloons decorated the memorial and included a collage with pictures of the father and four children, topped by a plastic gold angel. Near the charred remnants of the home were a swing set and a tricycle. The family had switched from burning wood to an electric heater and it was the only heat source in the living room where the family slept, James Tucker said. Blair said Tucker lived in the home with the children's father. The two weren't married but had been together for about seven years, she said. However, Wilfong's Facebook page claims they were married. Sad: Tyler Lane, left, and Cheyenne, right, were among the four children killed in the devastating blaze . Support: Relatives vowed to support Tucker, pictured right while pregnant with Cheyenne, as she deals with losing her family . Blair said she watched the kids often and that they loved to play outside and watch TV together. 'They were good kids, you couldn't ask for no better,' Blair said. Dakota liked robots and cartoons; Tyler was a monster truck fan and Cheyenne enjoyed playing with Barbie dolls. They were close-knit playmates, relatives said. 'That might be why the Lord took all four of them at the same time,' Elkins said. Roberts said the bodies would be taken to the medical examiner's office in Frankfort, and it could take several days for positive identifications. The infant was found within a foot of the father, and all the victims were within about two feet of each other. 'They could've been overcome by that . smoke and just went into like a deep sleep,' Roberts said. 'They just . couldn't make it out.' Sleeping together: The bodies were found in the small home's living room, pictured, where the family had been sleeping near an electric space heater . Critical: Tammie Tucker, right, is fighting for her life while all of her babies, including Cheyenne, pictured in 2011, were killed . Fire investigators said the blaze was accidental and broke out in the living room where the space heater was found. A cause had not been determined. No officials could recall a similar deadly blaze in Kentucky since 10 people, including six children, were killed in a house fire in Bardstown in February 2007. County Judge-Executive spokesman Brandon Roberts said there's been no similar fatal fire in Pike County in recent years. 'I can't remember a whole family perishing in a fire in my lifetime,' Roberts said. 'It's just, ""Oh God.""' On Wilfong's Facebook page, the father wrote: 'My name is Billy Wilfong i am married to Tammie Wilfong the most beautiful and smartest woman that i know we have 4 childern together Dakota 5, Tyler 4,Cheyenne 2 and Emily and she is 2 months old...I Love My little family and wouldn't trade them for the world..(sic)'","Kentucky man Billy Wilfong, and his kids Dakota Lee, 5, Tyler Lane, 4, Cheyenne, 2, and Emily, 6 months, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday morning .

Apple is developing a cheaper version of its iPhone and could launch the new device as early as this year. The tech giant has been exploring a lower-end iPhone for years but plans have accelerated as Apple's supremacy in smartphones has slipped, sources told the Wall Street Journal. The less expensive phone is likely to resemble the standard iPhone, but with a different, cheaper body. Making the shell out of polycarbonate plastic rather than the aluminum casing of the iPhone 5 would allow Apple to lower the cost. Cheap version: Apple is developing a cheaper version of it's iPhone, pictured, and could launch the new device as early as this year . Most of the other parts could remain the same or be recycled from older iPhone models, according to the WSJ. Launching the cheaper phone would be a big shift in corporate strategy. Under former chief executive Steve Jobs, Apple prided itself prioritizing profits over scale and offered a relatively small number of products mostly targeting the high end. The less expensive iPhone has been in the works since at least 2009, with the company seeing it as a way to grab market share and introduce people to the brand, sources close to the project said. They added that prior to the iPhone 4's mid-2010 launch, Apple had developed designs for cheaper phones that differed only in the material used for the back and sides. But the idea was shelves after some executives raised concerns that a second product would complicate its manufacturing processes. According to the WSJ, the company chose instead to keep older iPhone models on sale for less. But Apple now faces greater pressure to make the iPhone more affordable. The iPhone 5 without a wireless contract starts at $649 in the U.S., which is out of reach for many customers in countries where carriers don't help cover the cost of the phone. In the works: The less expensive iPhone has been in the works since at least 2009, with Apple seeing it as a way to grab market share and introduce people to the brand . A raft of cheaper rivals powered by Google Inc.'s Android operating system are gaining market share. The iPhone remains the top-selling . smartphone in the U.S., but Apple's share of the high-end mobile phone . market has fallen in China and remains low in other emerging markets. Apple's worldwide smartphone shipments have dropped from 23 per cent of the total in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 14.6 per cent in the third quarter last year. The iPhone is Apple's chief revenue driver, with sales of iPhones and related products and services accounting for 48% of revenue in the quarter ended in September. Samsung Electronics Co.'s share, meanwhile, jumped from 8.8 per cent to 31.3 per cent from the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2012. But Apple could still decide to scrap the plan, the WSJ reported as executives still fear the less-expensive iPhone could curb profits and put off investors. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, however, told the WSJ that a less expensive iPhone won't necessarily hurt Apple's overall profit margin if it attracts buyers who haven't bought iPhones before and not those who would have been willing to purchase the higher-end device.","The less expensive phone is likely to resemble the standard iPhone but with a cheaper body .

Vega, the second brightest star in the northern night sky, may have a family of planets similar to the Sun's, say scientists. Astronomers have discovered evidence of an asteroid belt surrounding the star like the one that circles the Sun. If confirmed, it means Vega is likely to have a solar system containing rocky planets similar to Earth or Mars. This artist's concept illustrates an asteroid belt around the bright star Vega. Evidence for this warm ring of debris was found using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory. The discovery, presented at the . American Astronomical Society's annual meeting in Long Beach, . California, was made using the Herschel and Spitzer space telescopes. Detectors on the telescopes measured infrared light emitted by warm and cold bands of dust around the star. In our own system, the asteroid belt beyond the orbit of Mars is maintained by the gravity of rocky planets and gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn. Scientists believe Vega has an inner asteroid belt and outer belt of debris separated by a gap. The same pattern is seen around the Sun. A distant band of rock and ice, called the Kuiper belt, orbits the Sun near the edge of the Solar System. Astronomer Dr Kate Su, from the Steward Observatory at the Arizona University in the US, said: 'Our findings echo recent results showing multiple-planet systems are common beyond our Sun.' Vega, known as the Harp Star, is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra. It is relatively close at a distance of just 25 light years, and around 600 million years old - much younger than the Sun. Astronomers have discovered what appears to be a large asteroid belt around the bright star Vega, as illustrated here at left in brown . The discovery, presented at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting in Long Beach, California, was made using the Herschel and Spitzer space telescopes. Detectors on the telescopes measured infrared light emitted by warm and cold bands of dust around the star. Scientists suspect hidden planets are sweeping the region between the bands free of dust. Vega may have several undetected planets up to the size of Jupiter, they believe. The limits of current planet detection techniques make it difficult to spot small rocky planets, or larger worlds in outlying orbits. Similar bands of debris were found to surround another star, Fomalhaut, which is known to have at least one candidate planet. 'Overall, the large gap between the warm and the cold belts is a signpost that points to multiple planets likely orbiting Vega and Fomalhaut,' said Dr Su.","Astronomers have discovered evidence of an asteroid belt surrounding the star like the one that circles the Sun.

Rescue workers have begun searching for bodies in the burnt-out remains of homes devastated by wildfires in the Australian state of Tasmania. Many of the 100 people who were declared missing as the fires raged have now been accounted for, but authorities still fear that search teams could find casualties in the areas affected. And while the Tasmanian fires appear to have largely died down, other areas of the country are bracing themselves for the possibility of new blazes - with the conditions in New South Wales described as the most dangerous in the state's history.

Comfort: Scott Griffiths is consoled by his neighbour Bryan Webster as he surveys the remains of his house after it burned down . Tasmanian police commissioner Scott Tilyard said no casualties had yet been reported, but it would take time before officials were certain that no one had died in the blazes that have razed 50,000 acres of forests and farmland across southern Tasmania since Friday. On that day, the island state saw its highest temperatures since records began as the thermometer hit 107F (42C). Mr Tilyard added that 11 teams were searching ruins in places including the small town of Dunalley, east of the state capital of Hobart, where around 70 homes were destroyed. 'Until we've had the opportunity to do all the screening that we need to do at each of those premises, we can't say for certain that there hasn't been a human life or more than one human life lost as a result of these fires,' he said.

Abducted: Moira Anderson went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist Alexander Gartshore . The fate of a schoolgirl who disappeared more than 50 years ago remains a mystery after a grave search found no evidence of her remains. Moira Anderson was 11 when she failed to return home from running an errand in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, in February 1957. Following a two-day search of a grave plot at Old Monkland cemetery in Coatbridge, chief inspector Kenny McLeod from Strathclyde Police said: 'I can confirm that Moira's remains have not been found. 'Despite today's outcome, the case will remain open.' It is widely believed that Moira was abducted and murdered, but her body has never been found. Detectives recently reopened the case, focusing on a family grave plot where they believed it was possible that her body may have been dumped. Convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, a Coatbridge bus driver who died in 2006, has been connected with the schoolgirl's disappearance. On Tuesday investigators began excavating the plot of Sinclair Upton, said to have been an acquaintance of Gartshore, to see if the youngster's remains were put there. The operation was led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University.

'Despite today's outcome, the case will remain open. Any further lines of inquiry will be fully investigated.' Gartshore, who died in 2006, was . accused of the murder by his own daughter. Not the end: 'My belief is that Moira is not far from us but she remains concealed' Hunt: Forensic Anthropologist Sue Black has been leading the exhumation in Coatbridge . It later emerged he told a colleague that Mr Upton had done him a ‘big favour’. The exhumation was ordered after . Moira’s sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, launched a petition . for Mr Upton’s grave to be opened in the hope of finding her remains. Forensic experts warned they . faced a sensitive and painstaking task, however, with a total of eight . people known to have been buried in the plot dating back to 1908.

At the . time, Mrs Brown said: ‘I truly believe this grave has secrets to give . up. We owe it to Moira to open it.’ She believes her father was a paedophile who operated as part of a ring in central Scotland over a number of decades. Ms .

The campaigner said her father told her that Moira got on his bus during a blizzard and he was the last person to see her. Speaking at the cemetery today, she . said: 'I'd like to thank the inspector and while I'm very sad about the . result of the operation, I'm absolutely satisfied that the police view . that it's not a crime scene is correct. 'Moira's two sisters now know but . I've explained that although the grave is closed, it's not the end of . the story and we strongly believe that Moira still wants to be found. 'We've had experts here working with . the police with the highest integrity but the people who did this crime . were devious in the extreme and their wickedness knows no bounds. Hope: The exhumation, which began at the request of Moira's sisters Janet Hart and Marjory Muir, lasted two days . Mystery: Police had hoped to find the remains of Moira Anderson who disappeared while running an errand for her grandmother in 1957 . 'My belief is that Moira is not far from us but she remains concealed by extremely wicked people. 'It's a difficult day but my thoughts are with the Upton family, who can now hopefully have their family members put to rest.' Ms . Brown, who set up the Moira Anderson Foundation in 2000 to help victims . of childhood sexual abuse, said at the graveside today: 'Both of . Moira's sisters are hugely disappointed. It's been a long time and it's a . shame that their hopes are dashed. 'It's not what I would have liked to have happened today but it's certainly not the end of the story.

'Some people might think we've hit a brick wall here but I think we've actually punched through a brick wall. 'Over the last few months Moira's case has been upgraded from a missing person to a murder inquiry. 'It's become a cold case review and in the future there could be further developments.' The excavation team started work this morning to fill in the grave. Sensitive: Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod said officers would be as respectful as possible to the graves . Excavation: Officers begin exhuming the grave which is believed to belong to an acquittance of suspect Alexander Gartshore . A woman from the Moira Anderson . Foundation arrived at the scene after the police announcement to pay her . respects with a large bouquet of flowers. Ms . Brown said: 'The tide has turned. We're no longer in the '60s and '70s . when people didn't discuss things like this. Victims are coming forward . and there are more Moiras, believe you me, and we still have to try and . find them.' Police warned that the heavily . waterlogged grave at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge has as many as . three layers, and that establishing whether it contains Moira’s remains was likely to be a slow process. They were exploring the possibility . that Moira’s body may have been dumped under a coffin in the grave, . which was thought to have been open around the time of her . disappearance. Allegations: Sandra Brown has compared her late father Alexander Gartshore to paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile . A large section of the . cemetery was cordoned off with police tape, with a large black tent and a . series of smaller blue tents erected around the excavation site. The exhumation was led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University. Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod, of .

Alcohol has also been outlawed while throwing a 'DJ party' will now carry a fine of 11,000 rupees. Trend setter? Khedar Village is in the north-west of the country. Alcohol has . also been outlawed, while throwing a 'DJ party' will carry a fine of . 11,000 rupees. Khedar village patriarch Sarpanch Shamsher Singh told the Times of India: 'We have decided to ban alcohol as it is the main reason behind rapes. We have also banned jeans and T-shirts for girl students as it is not a proper dress.' But while the decree may prove unpopular among young people in the town, it has been welcomed by older members of the village. Protests: Treatment of women in India has been thrust sharply under the spotlight in recent months after a 23-year-old woman was gang raped on a bus in New Delhi, sparking a rape crisis that has shaken the country to its core . Groundswell: Indian women march to mourn the death of a gang rape victim in New Delhi. The brutal case has caused uproar in India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for the suspects in the case to be hanged . Heavy security: The decision in Khedar comes as five men appeared in court today accused of gang-raping a 23-year-old physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi. She later died of her injuries . Arrival: A police officer directs the van carrying the five suspects - named as Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur . Rape is the one of the most common crimes against Indian women. So common, in fact, that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women. In reference to the biblical 'Eve', 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average every 18 hours. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. Shanti . Devi, a middle-aged woman present at the panchayat, said: 'The decision . of the panchayat is good and will check the harassment of girls. Poor . dressing is the main reason behind rapes.' Mahaveer Singh, a resident of the village, added: 'We welcome the decision of the panchayat and anyone organizing a DJ party in the village will be fined Rs 11,000. Our main purpose is to close the alcohol shops in the village as liquor is the main reason behind attacks on women.' Meanwhile, a judge has ordered the trial of . the five men accused of the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old . student in Delhi be held 'in-camera' for the suspects' own safety after . chaotic courtroom scenes. More . than 150 people tried to cram into a courtroom meant to fit just 30 . people for the first hearing of the men charged with the abduction, gang . rape and murder. The . 23-year-old physiotherapy student died in a Singapore hospital 13 days . after being attacked as she made her way home from the cinema in New . Delhi. The woman - who . has not been named for legal reasons - was thrown naked from the moving . vehicle into the street where she lay for up to half an hour before . anybody called emergency services. Days later she died from her . injuries. Protest: A man pictured performing an indefinite hunger strike at Jantar Mantar to protest against the recent gang rape in New Delhi .

A 99-year-old woman was killed when a delivery van crashed into her mobility scooter as she was leaving a hotel, a coroner heard. Mary Rawes died three months after being struck by the slow-moving UPS Mercedes Sprint vehicle. The partially-sighted widow suffered a head injury when her scooter was tossed over in the collision. Collision: Mary Rawes, 99, died when she was knocked off her mobility scooter by a slow-moving UPS Mercedes van . Invesigation: Coroner Ian Smith said he would write to 109 fellow coroners and wanted to find out whether there was a wider problem with the 'unregulated' vehicles . An inquest into her death heard that Mrs Rawes died from a 'combination of natural causes and an accident'. A post-mortem examination found that underlying health problems had also contributed to her death after the crash outside the Stonecross Manor Hotel on Milnthorpe Road, Kendal, Cumbria in December 2011. Mrs Rawes, who lived in Bellingham Road, Kendal, died in March last year, while residing in a local nursing home. Concern: Mr Smith, South and East Cumbria Coroner, said Mrs Rawes' death was his third inquest involving a mobility scooter . During the inquest into Mrs Rawes' death, the coroner said that he would investigate deaths on mobility scooters on a national level after encountering three such incidents. Ian Smith, South and East Cumbria Coroner, said he would write to 109 fellow coroners and wanted to find out whether there was a wider problem with the 'unregulated' vehicles. Mr Smith . urged mobility scooter users to take ‘extreme care’, pointing out their . similarity to cars. He added: 'They give vulnerable people . enormous independence and can be beneficial, both mentally and . physically, but there are consequences and people really do need to be . extremely careful on them.' Van driver Michael Nugent, who was . leaving the hotel after making a Christmas delivery, told the inquest: 'I was going slowly. Visibility was pretty poor because of the bushes . and ‘for sale’ signs. 'I can’t honestly say whether I had stopped or whether I was slowing down at the point of impact. 'I looked left as I approached the . junction, and saw traffic coming from the right and, as I looked left . again, I felt the bump.' Police reconstructed the sequence of events before the impact as part of the investigation. PC Kevin Jackson told the Kendal . County Hall hearing: 'The conclusion was that I either couldn’t see the . scooter or it was a very short glimpse of it - and that was with me . looking for that and nothing else.' He explained that the scooter was set to its maximum level - around 4mph - at the time of the accident. Caution: The coroner told the court that mobility scooters can give 'vulnerable people enormous independence' but that people need to be 'extremely careful on them' Tests showed that at a scooter travelling at that speed, while moving slightly downhill, would have taken two metres to stop. PC Jackson said Mrs Rawles was . ‘partially sighted or blind’ in her right eye and that a pair of glasses . was found in the basket of the scooter. Collision investigator PC Richard . Wiejah said the a pillar in part of the van’s window frame - would have . ‘substantially obscured’ Mr Nugent’s view.

Many people intending to get fit this year will have already seen their resolution crumble as the effort to actually get to the gym proves as exhausting as a workout itself. But help is at hand in the form of the irrepressible 80s Lycra legend Mr Motivator who has come up with a way for people to get fit quick in the comfort of their own homes. With the assistance of Denise Van Outen, the fitness guru has created a series of two minute workout videos - one of which you can view below - which can be done every morning in the time it takes to cook your breakfast porridge in the microwave. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Putting her through her paces: Mr Motivator shows Denise Van Outen how his two minute workouts can be done in the kitchen . Denise, who recently made it to the final of Strictly Come Dancing, told MailOnline the routines are a great way to incorporate exercise into your life if, like her, you don't enjoy going to the gym. She said: 'I'm not a gym bunny, I don't have time and I find the gym a bit boring. But I can't use the excuse that I can't get to the gym with this workout because you can do it in your kitchen. 'It's free and a good way to . kick start your day. You can even do it in your pyjamas before you have a . shower and get dressed.' Specialist equipment not needed: Water bottles can double as weights . The 38-year-old, who is mother to daughter Betsy, aged two, said she finds gym workouts too time consuming. 'I've always tried to keep fit, especially since I became a mum,' she admitted as she teamed up with Mr Motivator for the campaign for Quaker. 'But going to the gym can take half the day by the time you've got there, worked out, showered and changed afterwards. 'I try to incorporate fitness into my daily routine instead. For example, I power walk up a steep hill with the pram when I take Betsy to nursery rather than driving.' The TV presenter admitted she needed to be in shape for her stint on Strictly - and the upcoming arena tour - because of the skimpy costumes she has to wear. Working up a thirst: Mr Motivator said the workouts are perfect to do before breakfast . 'I felt really exposed in the Charleston costume because it was cut away,' she said. 'I'm pushing 40, standing against Dani Harmer who is 23! My legs are quite toned from exercising but I didn't want to show off my stomach.' Now thanks to her training for Strictly, she admitted she's the fittest - but also the most exhausted - she's ever been. As she doesn't have a nanny, her and husband Lee Mead had to juggle care of Betsy around her Strictly training and his work commitments. Denise said while she enjoyed every minute of Strictly, she had 'mother's guilt' for the time it took her away from her little girl. Now she has more free time again, Denise said the two-minute exercises are a great way for her to spend time with Betsy while also teaching her about the benefits of exercise. Mr Motivator - real name Derrick Evans - agrees it's important for both young and old people to keep fit, and his two minute workouts are a great way for people to begin. Revealing: Denise said she's glad she's currently in shape given the skimpy outfits she had to wear in Strictly . He said: 'Two minutes is no time at all. It won't get you super fit but it will give you a start and that could be the start to a new you. 'If you can do two minutes of exercise that you have never done before, you'll feel great about that and then you'll want to build upon it.' He said it's important to make exercise a habit and then it will become as second nature as personal hygiene. 'When people ask me if I have days when I don't want to exercise, I ask them, ""do you have days when you don't want to brush your teeth?"". 'If I went out and forgot to brush my teeth, I wouldn't feel same, I'd have to go and buy . a toothbrush or some chewing gum. And until I brush my teeth, I don't feel right. It's the same with exercise if you get into that zone and . make it second nature.' Mr Motivator said his 'message from 20 years ago is still the same - let's get moving', but admits they 'haven't re-invented the wheel' with the two-minute routines. 'There's burpies, star bursts, press up . and sits ups, it's about keeping the intensity for 30 seconds without specialist equipment,' he said. He added that he loved working with Denise. 'She was great. If I wasn't married and she wasn't married, we could become an item!' he joked. 'She picked it up quite easily which goes to show you can do it even if you haven't done this kind of exercise before.'

Daring moves are being taught to members based in Little Stanion, Northamptonshire, as they want to revamp aspects of the conservative organisation. The newly formed group held its first meeting on Tuesday, where they were treated to a kinky display of pole dancing from instructor Sinnead O'Donnell. Modern WI: These members in Northamptonshire wanted to spice up the experience - so brought in a pole dancing instructor . After demonstrating a few moves at village's primary school, flexible Sinnead then invited WI members to have . a go at their own sexy routine. And it appears that the women went wild and it brought in curious new members. Member Irene Screen, 33 said: 'It was the pole dancing . that brought me here.

Karen Attrill, 53, added: 'I've never been to a WI meeting before but I'll definitely consider coming back now.' President of the branch Rachel MacAllister, 28, said: 'It's not all jam and Jerusalem, the reality is different. 'We're planning to set up a book club and to hold pamper evenings and . wine-tasting sessions, as well as the more traditional activities.' The pole dancer said it is a sign that the WI is moving into the modern age, as the activity is fun and good for the health. Mother-of-two Ms O'Donnell, 24, said: 'Pole dancing is a great laugh and a fantastic way to get into shape and keep fit. 'I took it up after I had my second child and I taught pole dancing for a year. 'It's lost its seedy image now and is just a great way to build up body strength, have fun and meet new friends. 'People can either go to classes, or buy their own pole and do it at home. It's brilliant. It's physically and mentally challenging and women of any age can enjoy it.' Women's Institute HQ in London today welcomed the news. Ruth Bond, Chair of the National Federation of Women’s Institute, said: 'We are delighted to hear about every new WI and Little Stanion WI is no exception.  Women are attracted by the chance to try exciting and unusual activities; informal learning and new skills; and getting involved in campaigning on a wide range of issues.

Junior Seau, one of the NFL's best and fiercest players for nearly two decades, had a degenerative brain disease when he committed suicide last May, it has been revealed. Results of an NIH study of Seau's brain revealed abnormalities consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The NIH, based in Bethesda, Maryland, conducted a study of three unidentified brains, one of which was Seau's. Diagnosis: Results of a study of Junior Seau's brain revealed abnormalities consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) Degeneration: A recent study of CTE shows a comparison between normal brain tissue, left, compared with that of an NFL player, center, and a 70-year-old former boxer, right . Dominating: Seau, right, was one of the most feared linebackers in football . It said the findings on Seau were similar to autopsies of people 'with exposure to repetitive head injuries,' the Associated Press reported. Seau's family requested the analysis of his brain, which was overseen by Dr Russell Lonser. Seau was a star linebacker for 20 NFL seasons with San Diego, Miami and New England before retiring in 2009. He died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. He joins a list of several dozen football players who had CTE. Boston University's center for study of the disease reported last month that 34 former pro players and nine who played only college football suffered from CTE. 'I was not surprised after learning a little about CTE that he had it,' Seau's 23-year-old son Tyler said. 'He did play so many years at that level. I was more just kind of angry I didn't do something more and have the awareness to help him more, and now it is too late. Sportsman: Seau played in the NFL for 20 seasons . with three teams: The San Diego Chargers, left, Miami Dolphins, right, . and New England Patriots . 'I don't think any of us were aware . of the side effects that could be going on with head trauma until he . passed away. We didn't know his behavior was from head trauma.' That . behavior, according to Tyler Seau and Junior's ex-wife Gina, included . wild mood swings, irrationality, forgetfulness, insomnia and depression. 'He . emotionally detached himself and would kind of 'go away' for a little . bit,' Tyler Seau said. 'And then the depression and things like that. It . started to progressively get worse.' He hid it well in public, they said. But not when he was with family or close friends. Months after Seau's retirement, he was arrested on suspicion of abusing his . live-in girlfriend at their home in Oceanside in San Diego County. Hours after being released from custody, the 41-year-old drove his car over a beach-side cliff in Carlsbad, California. Honoured: Seau was awarded a volunteer service award by President George W. Bush in 2005 . Officials said Seau's injuries from the car crash were not life-threatening. There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol involved in the crash and Seau told authorities he fell asleep while driving. He started the Junior Seau Foundation . in 1992, which is dedicated to raising money for education and . awareness campaigns for young people. Seau . is the eighth death among members of the 1994 AFC champion Chargers, . which lost the Super Bowl that year to the San Francisco 49ers. Triumph: Seau came out of retirement to play . with the Patriots in search of a Super Bowl ring and was with the team . when they lost to the New York Giants in 2008 . He amassed 1,524 tackles, 56 1/2 sacks and 18 interceptions in his career. The NFL faces lawsuits by thousands . of former players who say the league withheld information on the harmful . effects concussions can have on their health. Seau is not the first former NFL player to have had CTE before killing himself. Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling are others. Duerson, a former Chicago Bears defensive back, left a note asking for his brain to be studied for signs of trauma before shooting himself. His family filed a wrongful death suit against the NFL, claiming the league didn't do enough to prevent or treat the concussions that severely damaged his brain. Easterling played safety for the Falcons in the 1970s. After his career, he suffered from dementia, depression and insomnia, according to his wife, Mary Ann. He committed suicide last April. Height: 6' 3"" Weight: 248 pounds . Games played: 268 . Drafted: 1990 (First round, fifth overall) Sacks: 56.5 . Interceptions: 18 . Total yards: 238 . Tackles: 1,524 . Pro bowl appearances: 12 . Mary Ann Easterling is among the plaintiffs who have sued the NFL. 'It was important to us to get to the . bottom of this, the truth,' Gina Seau said, 'and now that it has been . conclusively determined from every expert that he had obviously had it, . CTE, we just hope it is taken more seriously. 'You can't deny it exists, and it is . hard to deny there is a link between head trauma and CTE. There's such . strong evidence correlating head trauma and collisions and CTE.' Tyler Seau played football through high school and for two years in college. He says he has no symptoms of any brain trauma. Gina Seau's son, Jake, now a high . school junior, played football for two seasons, but has switched to . lacrosse and has been recruited to play at Duke. 'Lacrosse is really his sport and . what he is passionate about,' she said. 'He is a good football player . and probably could continue. But especially now watching what his dad . went through, he says, 'Why would I risk lacrosse for football?' 'I didn't have to have a discussion with him after we saw what Junior went through.' Her 12-year-old son, Hunter, has shown no interest in playing football. 'That's fine with me,' she said.","Tests on Seau's brain find that he had degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)

"By . Helen Pow and Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 01:44 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:50 EST, 9 January 2013 . A 24-year-old charged with providing guns to a felon who later used the weapons to savagely kill volunteer firefighters on the morning of Christmas Eve has pleaded not guilty to her alleged crimes. Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York is accused of filing a false business record when she bought two guns later used by ex-convict William Spengler Jr. to kill two firefighters and wound three other first responders to a fire he set in Webster. Prosecutors said Nguyen indicated on a . form that a 12-gauge shotgun and AR-15 semiautomatic rifle she bought at . a Gander Mountain store in Henrietta in 2010 were for her, but they . were really for Spengler, an ex-convict who wasn't allowed to have them. Accused enabler: Dawn Nguyen, seen arriving at Henrietta Town Court in New York on Tuesday, is accused of illegally supplying two firearms used by a Christmas Eve gunman that killed two volunteer firefighters . Authority: Police say Nguyen, left of one of her attorneys, lied by claiming the two firearms were for her before giving them to 62-year-old ex-convict William Spengler Jr . Plea: Neither Nguyen nor her lawyer spoke to reporters after the brief court appearance in Henrietta Town Court where she pleaded not guilty to her crime . With her state charge of filing a falsified business record, Nguyen faces the same charge in federal court. Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother . Neither Nguyen nor her lawyer spoke to reporters after the brief court appearance in Henrietta Town Court on Tuesday. Nguyen, who previously lived next door to Spengler and called him 'Uncle Billy,' according to her lawyer, had Spengler accompany her to the store where they picked out the deadly weapons. It was then on Christmas Eve Spengler set his Webster house on fire and shot four volunteer firefighters, killing Michael Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka, as they arrived on the scene. Two other firefighters and a police officer were wounded. Spengler, 62, who had served 17 years in prison for killing his grandmother with a hammer, then killed himself. The blaze destroyed seven homes on the narrow stretch of land on Lake Ontario. 'She's very sorry that this individual chose to use the guns 2 1/2 years later in this way and really shocked about what happened,' Nguyen's lawyer John Parrinello said on Monday. 'I hope for her benefit that everybody understands how tangential, if at all, any role she had and how it is totally unrelated to what this maniac did on Christmas Eve,' Parrinello said. Nguyen, of the Rochester suburb of . Greece, is free on the condition she not leave Monroe County except to . attend college classes in a neighboring county. Bushmaster: Nguyen allegedly bought the Bushmaster rifle, pictured, for William Spengler and he used it to shoot two firefighters . Home: Dawn Nguyen was arrested at her home, pictured, at 249 Alpine Road in Rochester, New York . The gunman also had a .38-caliber revolver in his possession on the day of the shootings, but Nguyen is not connected to that gun. Police used the serial numbers on the weapons to trace them to Nguyen. 'She told the seller of these guns, Gander Mountain in Henrietta, N.Y., that she was to be the true owner and buyer of the guns instead of William Spengler,' U.S. Attorney William Hochul said. 'It is absolutely against federal law to provide any materially false information related to the acquisition of firearms.' During an interview late on Christmas Eve, Nguyen told police she had bought the guns for personal protection and that they were stolen from her vehicle, though she never reported the guns stolen. The day after the shootings, however, . Nguyen texted an off-duty Monroe County Sheriff's deputy with . references to the killings and later admitted to him that she bought the . guns for Spengler. Police said that information was consistent with a suicide note found near Spengler's body after he killed himself. Trap: This billowing inferno in Webster, New York, was lit by William Spengler, before he opened fire on the firefighters who responded to the blaze . There to help: Webster police Lieutenant Mike . Chiapperini (left) and . Tomasz Kaczowka, (right) a 911 dispatcher, both volunteered for the West . Webster Fire Department. They were gunned down on Monday morning . The .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, . which had a combat-style flash suppressor, is similar to the one Adam . Lanza used to shoot dead 20 children and six female staff at Sandy Hook . Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, earlier this month. Nguyen and her mother, Dawn Welsher, . lived next door to Spengler in 2008 - when Nguyen was just 20 years old. Her brother, Steven Nguyen, told the . Democrat and Chronicle newspaper of Rochester that Spengler stole the . guns from Dawn Nguyen. Spengler set a car on fire and . touched off an inferno in his Webster home on a strip of land along the . Lake Ontario shore, took up a sniper's position and opened fire on the . first firefighters to arrive at about 5:30am on Christmas Eve, . authorities said. He wounded two other firefighters and an off-duty . police officer who was on his way to work. A Webster police officer who had . accompanied the firefighters shot back at Spengler with a rifle in a . brief exchange of gunfire before the gunman killed himself. Spengler spent 17 years in prison for . killing his grandmother in 1980. His neighbors said he confessed his . criminal past within 15 minutes of them meeting, and even pointed to the . staircase where he committed the crime. Burning: A bystander watches while seven homes in a street in Webster, New York, burned . Accessory: Nguyen is pictured after her arrest on charges connected to the guns used in the Christmas Eve ambush slaying of two volunteer firefighters . 'He said, ""I was on drugs and I . wanted money for drugs and my grandmother wouldn't give it to me,""' Amy . Warner, who bought the cottage next to Spengler's home with her . boyfriend this summer, told New York Magazine. She said they tore out the staircase . 'because it was creepy,' but didn't think twice about buying the house . because Spengler had served his time. Her home was one of seven destroyed by the fire Spengler started. Investigators still haven't released the identity of remains found in William Spengler's burned house. They have said they believe the remains are those of his 67-year-old sister, Cheryl Spengler, who also lived in the house near Rochester and has been unaccounted for since the killings. The Spengler siblings had lived in the home with their mother, Arline Spengler, who died in October. Police found a rambling, typed letter laying out Spengler's intention to destroy his neighborhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.' He had been released from parole in 2006 on the manslaughter conviction, and authorities said they had had no encounters with him since. Nguyen faces a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, a fine of $250,000 or both.","Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, was a former neighbor of William Spengler, 62, and allegedly purchased the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and 12-gauge shotgun used in the shooting on his behalf .

A jilted fiancé knifed his ex-girlfriend in a frenzied attack after discovering she had met up with an old flame through Facebook. Jealous Liam Jones, 22, was jailed for 13 years today at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court for attempting to murder Rebecca Williams just days before the couple had been due to wed. Ms Williams, 21, had ended their four-year relationship and sent Jones a text message saying she had 'rekindled' her relationship with ex-boyfriend Gary Thompson. Violent: Liam Jones, left, attacked Rebecca Williams, right, with a carving knife, in a fit of rage . Kitchen worker Jones got the largest knife he could find and drove to the house where Ms Williams was living with her parents, the court heard. He stabbed her 10 times in the chest before slashing her throat and shouting: 'I can't let Gary have you.' Prosecutor Paul Hobson said the couple had been due to tie the knot on June 27 last year. He added: 'But just a month earlier, Ms Williams ended their relationship and moved back into her family home. 'Police were later called to the address after Jones came to believe that she was going to move to London after meeting someone on Facebook. 'It is plain that Jones was very upset and emotional about the end of the relationship. 'Matters came to a head when Ms Williams sent a text message to Jones telling him she had rekindled a relationship with old flame Gary Thompson and saying: ""I've got my own life now.""' Jones, 22, was jailed for 13 years today at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court for attempting to murder Ms Williams . The court heard Jones stormed out of the kitchen where he worked at the Army's Infantry Battle School in Brecon, South Wales, and drove the 15 minutes to Ms Williams's home. Mr Hobson said: 'She was in the garden when he arrived and he asked her questions about Mr Thompson. He was becoming more and more angry. 'He was there only for a few minutes before threatening Ms Williams, telling her: ""You and Gary had better watch your backs because I'm coming for you."" 'He raced home to fetch the largest kitchen knife he could find before returning to Ms Williams's home. Hurt: Jones stabbed his former fiancée at her parents' home days before they had been due to wed . 'All the while he was exchanging texts with her, demanding to know if she had had sex with her new boyfriend.' The court heard Ms Williams was expecting Jones to hand over some of her belongings from their former home. But instead he reached into the boot of his car and pulled out the carving knife. Mr Hobson said: 'He attacked her. He was stabbing out at her to the area of the abdomen. He pushed her to the floor and tried to continue to attack her. 'He drew the blade across her neck in a wiping movement causing injury to her neck.' Neighbours came outside to find Ms Williams lying on the floor, her body jerking as she struggled to breathe. The court heard Jones drove off, texting friends saying: 'I've just stabbed Becky'. Rebecca underwent life-saving surgery to repair damage to her liver and other wounds. When Jones was arrested he told officers: 'I'm sorry I didn't mean it. If I could not have her then nobody can.' Tom Crowther, defending, told the court that Jones's life had centred on his relationship with Ms Williams. He told the court that Ms Williams's text messages on the day of the attack had extinguished any hope Jones had of them getting back together. Mr Crowther said: 'He is very, very sorry for what he did on that night.' Jones, of Brecon, admitted attempted murder. Judge Wyn Williams told him: 'Having discovered that Rebecca Williams had taken up with another man you stabbed her in fit of jealous rage. 'One stab had penetrated her liver and the probability is that, but for medical intervention, she would have died.'","Liam Jones attacked Rebecca Williams, 21, at her parents' home .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 05:57 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:02 EST, 9 January 2013 . A chain of clinics has been found guilty of misleading women by claiming it could detect early signs of breast cancer with its thermal imaging screening service. Breast Angels, based in Liverpool, operates seven clinics across the country offering thermal image body scans to detect a range of abnormalities. The firm’s website highlights the fact that at least one woman used the breast screening results to opt for homeopathic treatment for cancer rather than surgery to remove a tumour. Breast Angels, based at the Homeopathic Clinic in Crosby, Liverpool, claimed its thermal scans could detect breast cancer, but an advertising watchdog says it has no evidence to support it . The firm ran an advertisement for its Medical Thermal Imaging, which offered  ‘100% Safe Breast Screening’. The text added: ‘Thermography can detect active breast abnormality before it’s possible with mammography ...  Medically recognised’. The advertisement in the What Doctors Don’t Tell You magazine backed up its message for worried women by carrying a banner which stated ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’. The company claims that its thermography screening is more effective than the mammography used by NHS doctors to detect cancer. Its ad also boasted it is a safer because it does not involve using radiation to screen the breast. The company said abnormalities associated with an early cancer releases nitrous oxide into the body which can be picked up by its thermal image scanners. The firm argued that because this process occurs early in the development of a cancer it would not be picked up by mammography. However, the company was unable to provide any medical evidence or studies to back up its claims. Scan: Breast Angels claims that its thermography screening is more effective than the mammography (pictured) used by NHS doctors to detect cancer. However, leading breast cancer surgeons say it is ineffective . The ASA said: ‘Because the advertiser did not provide robust evidence to substantiate the claim that thermography could detect active breast abnormalities which also compared its efficacy with mammography or that it was medically recognised, we concluded the ad was misleading.’ It ruled: ‘The ad must not appear again in its current form.  We told Medical Thermal Imaging Ltd to hold robust evidence before making efficacy claims.’ Medical Thermal Imaging charges women £195 for two breast screening sessions three months apart which are designed to measure any changes. The results are sent to doctors in the USA to be assessed. Phillip Hughes and his wife Rosa, who are both trained as clinical thermographers, travel to seven clinics around the country to carry out screenings. Mr Hughes rejected the ASA assessment process as ‘unfair’. He said: ‘We provided them with a long list of medical studies and papers demonstrating that thermal imaging for breast screening works, but they do not have a single medically-qualified expert who can properly assess these.’ Mr Hughes insisted his company has successfully identified early onset of cancer in women who would be too young to be given the mammograms normally carried out by the NHS. Routine mammograms are offered to women over 50. Leading breast cancer surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel said ‘Based on research to date, there is no evidence whatsoever that thermal imaging is effective in screening for breast cancer and it should be discouraged.’ Prof Mokbel, who works at St George’s Hospital, London and the London Breast Institute, said there was a danger that women would be falsely reassured by negative results and deterred from using proven screening methods. ‘The scientific community regard this as an invalid tool in screening for breast cancer’ he added.","Breast Angels offers thermal scans and claims they can detect abnormalities .

The former guardians of one of the two high school football stars accused of raping a 16-year-old girl while she was drunk and unconscious have revealed they are standing by him. Greg and Jennifer Agresta welcomed Ma'lik Richmond, who had played sports with their sons, into their home for two years when he was eight and living in a troubled home. In a case that has sparked protests in Steubenville, Ohio, he now stands accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing the unnamed girl after carrying her to multiple parties in the town last August. He was even photographed carrying the victim by her wrists and ankles with his co-defendant, fellow student and high school football player Trenton Mays, as other teenagers looked on. Scroll down for video . Defiant: Jennifer and Greg Agresta appeared on the Today show to say they would be standing by Ma'lik Richmond, who is accused of raping an Ohio teen. He previously lived with the Agresta family . But speaking on the Today show, the Agrestas said they love Richmond whatever he might have done - and have not even asked him if he is guilty of the crimes of which he is accused. 'It doesn't matter to us,' Mrs Agresta said. 'We love him, . irregardless of what happened that evening. We want him to know that we . support him. 'When he left our home as a young child, the last thing I . said to him when I dropped him off was, ""Ma'lik, if you ever need anything, . good or bad, we are a phone call away"". And when he called us, we were . just that phone call away. We had to be there for him.' The Agrestas became Richmond's legal guardians after his own parents were unable to take care of him. He has now returned to their home and is under house arrest there. Accused: Richmond, left, is pictured carrying the unconscious drunk girl the night of the alleged rapes . Love: Speaking to Matt Lauer with their lawyer present, the Agrestas said they love Richmond regardless . When they learned that he was implicated in the alleged sexual assaults, they were stunned. 'I think everybody was surprised,' Mrs Agresta said. 'It's out of character for Ma'lik. I think everybody just was in shock.' Her husband added: 'It's completely out of Ma'lik's . character. That's not the type of person that he is.' Mr Agresta added that, while it was a struggle for him and his wife to step forward, they knew it was the right thing to do for the teenager. 'Too many . people want to share the good times and when individuals and family . members run across difficult times, right or wrong, they want to bail,' he said. Richmond’s attorney, Walter Madison, joined the Agrestas but declined to discuss the accuracy of the charges. He did admit that Richmond is in the picture of the girl being carried by the two teens. Part of the family: Richmond lived with the Agrestas and their two sons for two years when he was younger . 'Out of character': They claimed that their friends were shocked by Richmond's alleged part in the attack . Nearly 1,000 people gathered in Steubenville over the weekend to protest the . handling of the alleged gang rape. The two teenagers say all sexual contact that occurred was consensual. The case has sparked fury both in the . rural town and across the country as those involved have  effectively . been accused by social media, even though police have only arrested the pair. The . backlash has echoes of the international outrage triggered by the death . of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh Pandey, who died as a result of the massive . injuries sustained during a brutal gang rape at the hands of six men in . Delhi, India. In Ohio, only the two teens have been charged, though many believe . that there is a cover up underway to keep more players from the beloved . high school football team from being arrested. Over the weekend, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said officially that no further suspects would be charged. Tension: Many in the community believe police have failed to fully investigate an allegation of rape. Two high school football players have been arrested following the alleged sex attack . Picking sides: Members of 'hacktivist' group Anonymous- seen wearing . their trademark masks- have taken on the Steubenville case because they . feel there is a police cover up protecting other people involved . Anger: Up to 1,000 people protested at Jefferson County Courthouse in Steubenville, Ohio, today. They believe local police have failed to fully investigate a 16-year-old's rape allegations to protect the local football program . 'There . was more than two kids involved. The kids who have money in this town . have not been arrested,' demonstrator Lisa Waxler said. Beliefs like that have prompted . defense attorneys to call for serious changes in the case before any . trial takes place. Lawyer Walter Madison wants to move the trial to a . different town because activists simply want to draw blood and have less . concern for what is truly justified. ' What we have in this county is a legal lynching and I can't stand for that on my watch,' he told NBC. The party where . the alleged rape took place dates back to just . before the school year began at Steubenville High School - but the case . did not garner national attention until recently. A sect of the . hacker group Anonymous took on the case and have scoured the internet . for various photos and videos posted by students who were at one of the . three parties. Laughing: A video from the night of the alleged attack shows Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student, laughing callously and referring to a girl getting raped because she is so drunk . One video shows an 18-year-old man laughing and joking over the fate of the alleged rape victim in a leaked YouTube video. Abdalla, who said he first saw the video three days ago, commented: 'It's a disgusting video. It's stupidity. But you can't . arrest somebody for being stupid.' The attorney for the 18-year-old man in the video, Michael Nodianos, called the teenager's behaviour 'disappointing, insensitive and unfortunate' on Monday night. Speaking at a brief press conference . Dennis McNamara sought to distance his client from the horrific events . alleged to have taken place in Steubenville. Mr . McNamara said, 'After some sober reflection he is ashamed and . embarrassed himself. He's sorry to victims and his family. He was not . raised to act in this manner.'

Three company bosses swindled thousands of music lovers out of tickets in a £3million scam, a court heard. Andrew Lagan, 49, David Rolls, 48, and Gary Agar, 44, allegedly ripped off fans of acts including Kings of Leon, Jay-Z and Sir Paul McCartney. The trio offered non-existent tickets for sale over the internet and processed the payments through the account for their company, Good Time Entertainment (GTE), Harrow Crown Court heard. Andrew Lagan allegedly ripped off thousands of music lovers . David Rolls is alleged to have sold non-existent tickets online . Gary Agar belonged to Good Time Entertainment with the other men . Other events targeted included the T in the Park festival in Balado, Kinnross-shire, Scotland, the V Festivals, in Staffordshire and Essex, and the Benicassim festival in Spain. After payments were made to the Allied Irish bank account, the money was either siphoned off into accounts in Budapest or Thailand, or withdrawn in cash, jurors were told. Prosecutor Toby Fitzgerald said: 'Together the defendants operated Good Time Entertainment Ltd and through the use of this company and websites associated with it, the defendants offered tickets for sale to members of the public over the internet. 'They created 100 per cent profit for themselves because they took the money without providing anything in return. 'Having had the money transferred into a bank account controlled by the defendants the money was removed from the bank account. 'It was removed to make very sure that when the inevitable time of reckoning came, when it became clear that the tickets were not provided and people were after their money back, the money had disappeared,' he added. He said transfers were made to the Link FX money exchange in Victoria where more than £2m was withdrawn during the course of a year. GTE was first set up in June 2003 with Agar the sole shareholder, the court heard. The accused allegedly ripped off fans of acts including Kings of Leon (pictured), Jay-Z and Sir Paul McCartney . Ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney (pictured) was one of the musicians who fans paid to see and were allegedly ripped off by Lagan, Rolls and Gary Agar . By 2006 the company's profits were dwindling and Agar formally resigned as its director. The prosecutor said Rolls and Lagan became involved in the business and the offences were committed between November 2009 and October 2010. Jurors heard in the autumn of 2009 Agar informed the company's accountant that it had effectively ceased trading, but was going to continue processing credit cards for a company in Budapest. 'There was no trade involved, it was simply a deception of members of the public,' said Mr Fitzgerald. He explained that when customers did not receive their tickets, they contacted their credit or debit card issuers, who in turn contacted First Data International (FDI), who handled the purchases. Jurors heard that First Data International had provided GTE with a 'merchant terminal' through which they would take payment for the bogus tickets. After receiving a large number of requests from banks for reimbursement for 'charge backs' that they had had to pay, FDI stopped transferring money from customers into the company account. The combined loss to customers who paid by debit card and First Data International was said to be in excess of £2.9m. Rolls, of Poplar, east London, Lagan, of North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, and Agar, of South Ruislip, west London, each deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of converting or transferring criminal property.

She lived at the home with the father of her child, Aaron Greene, 31, who is reportedly also an addict. Inside the apartment, officers found . seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the . substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings. The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive. Police . also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting . shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a . replica of an M203 grenade launcher. In court: Gliedman and her lawyer Gerald Shargel in Manhattan Criminal Court as she was granted bail . Moving on: She was ordered to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet and to go to rehab .

Dangerous: The NYPD bomb squad was called in to remove the explosive that was discovered in the couple Greenwich Village apartment . Friends revealed to the New York Post that Gliedman, a former student of New York prep school Dalton, was on a safe track to success until she met Greene, who has a series of felony weapons charges to his name. She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing. 'She comes from a great family, raised on Park Avenue, went to a great school, but then this guy introduced her to drugs,' a friend told the Post. They added that Gliedman stopped doing heroin when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby was born drug-free. Baby daddy: Her boyfriend, Aaron Greene, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court last week . The newborn is now being cared for by .

'Disgraceful': Boxing writer and broadcaster Steve Bunce used a BBC radio spot to accuse a Northampton schoolboy of swearing at him and spitting at his wife . One of Britain's most high profile boxing journalists has accused a leading school of 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour' - claiming on live BBC radio that a student swore at him and spat at his wife. Steve Bunce used the popular 5 Live show Fighting Talk to give a verbal battering to Northampton School for Boys, following an incident during a rugby match involving his son. The state secondary's alumni include Matt Smith, the current Doctor Who, and several international rugby players. The pundit, known as 'Buncey', said one of its teenage students walked up to them on the sidelines, swore at him and then spat in his partner's direction. Mr Bunce's son was playing for Denstone College, a private school in Staffordshire with fees of up to £21,000 a year. 'I was standing there and suddenly this kid, a 17-year-old, called me the second worst word you can use on the BBC and spat at my wife,' he said on 5 Live's most . popular show, listened to by more than one million people. 'I have discussed it with a number of people in the rugby world and they cannot believe it. 'I have been to six Olympic Games and thousands of sporting events . during the 25 years I have been covering sport and I’ve never seen . behaviour like it from a player.' He added it was 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour' and said Northampton should be placed in the dictionary to represent everything 'naughty, outrageous or disgusting in . sport'. But after the school denied his . version of events and accused him of 'provoking' their student, 5 . Live's acting controller Jonathan Wall has today apologised to headteacher Rod Goldswain. Mr Goldswain, a former rugby player for Northampton Saints, says the boy spat at the ground, . not at Bunce's wife, and although he called him a 'stupid t***' the school . denied the boy called him a 'c***' or a 'p****'. The pupil had been given a 'dressing down', he said. After hearing his version of events Mr Wall wrote in an email seen by MailOnline: 'I have spoken to Steve Bunce today to tell him this was a private matter that he shouldn’t have raised on BBC Radio 5 live. It is not an issue he will discuss again on this radio station. 'As you know from our conversation, I’m sorry for the inconvenience this has subsequently caused you. Thank you for accepting my apology.' Scroll down for video . Denial: Northampton High School for Boys (pictured) has demanded Steve Bunce apologises and says he 'provoked' the boy by shouting at him . Mr Goldswain said: 'I am happy to accept the apology, it would, of course, be good if Mr Bunce responded in a similar way. 'Unfortunately he (Mr Bunce) has used his privileged position as a BBC radio presenter to create what he sees as entertainment by criticising and naming a school and attempting to disparage both this school and our town,' he said. Unsavoury: The incident happened during a schools rugby match as Mr Bunce watched his son (file picture) 'This is grossly unfair based, as it was, on one isolated incident. Those who know the school will not recognise the presenter’s comments applying to Northampton School for Boys. 'I would hope that Steve Bunce regrets the comments he made in the name of so called entertainment.' Mr Bunce denies shouting at the boy but admitted today he should not have brought it up on Fighting Talk. 'I don't want the kid to get in trouble. I want him to be reprimanded,' he told the Daily Telegraph, adding: 'Perhaps I should have written to the school and not mentioned it on Fighting Talk. 'But perhaps some little kid shouldn't have gobbed or sworn at two people standing on the sidelines on a fantastic winter's afternoon in Northampton.' A spokesman for the BBC told MailOnline this morning: 'This is a matter between Steve and the school.' The school's local MP, Tory Michael Ellis, has also stepped in to slam Steve Bunce. 'It is ridiculous to use a national radio broadcast to launch a personal tirade against a teenage school boy and his school,' he said. 'Unlike Mr Bunce I know Northampton School for Boys to be an excellent school with strong standards of discipline. 'Mr Bunce’s broadcast comments about the worst behaviour he had seen in 25 years were, in my opinion, absurd and melodramatic.'","Boxing writer Steve Bunce made claims on 5 Live show - listened to by more than a million people each week .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 20:52 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:52 EST, 9 January 2013 . Six-figure bids are expected when an auction house sells a rare 148-year-old baseball card that was discovered at a yard sale in rural Maine, the auction house manager said today. A man found the card by chance in a photo album he bought while antique hunting in the small town of Baileyville, Maine, said Troy Thibodeau of Saco River Auction Co. in Biddeford. It's not the same as a modern baseball card, which became commonplace beginning in the 1880s. Instead, it's an original photograph from 1865 of the Brooklyn Atlantics amateur baseball club mounted on a card. The card shows nine players gathered around their manager. Strike! The rare 1865 baseball card of the Brooklyn Atlantics, discovered in a photo album bought at a yard sale in Baileyville, Maine, is expected to raise $100,000 at auction . Thibodeau said he's aware of only two such cards in existence, the other at the Library of Congress. Putting a dollar-figure value on it is difficult, he said, but he expects it to fetch at least $100,000 at the February 6 auction. 'There hasn't been another one that's sold,' he said. 'When there are only two known in the world, what's it worth?' Last summer, the auction house sold a rare 1888 card of Hall of Fame baseball player Michael 'King' Kelly for $72,000. The priciest baseball card ever is a 1909 Honus Wagner card, which sold for $2.8 million in 2007. The Library of Congress has had another copy of the Brooklyn Atlantics photograph since the late 1800s, when it took possession of it from a New York court where the photographer, Charles Williamson, had submitted it for copyright. In its book Baseball Americana, the Library of Congress calls it the first dated baseball card, handed out to supporters and opposing teams in a gesture of bravado from the brash Brooklynites, who were dominant and won their league championships in 1861, 1864 and 1865. Lucky find: A man found the card while looking for antiques in the town of Baileyville, Maine . It's not known how many were produced, . but the Library of Congress is aware of only the two copies. A trading . card grading firm, Sportscard Guaranty LLC, has authenticated the card . as the real thing, said Bob Luce, senior grader at the New Jersey . company. One to watch: Cards of Babe Ruth in the 1920s normally draw a high price at auction . The Maine man bought the card by happenstance. While at a yard sale, he bought a photo album, old Coca-Cola bottles and a couple of oak chairs for less than $100, Thibodeau said. While looking through the album, the buyer came across the baseball card. He later mailed it to Saco River Auction, having read about the auction house's sale of the 1888 card last summer. Thibodeau did not release the man's name, saying he did not want to be identified. The rarest card around came from a 1923 promotional set of 30 cards, each with a black-and-white likeness of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, or some other baseball star. The cards were distributed by the Maple Crispette Candy Co. in Canada, and the person who collected all 30 could claim a prize, said Jim Gates, librarian at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. But only one Casey Stengel card was produced among the entire bunch, Gates said, and that card is located in the Hall of Fame archives.","Card found by chance by antique hunter in old photo album in  Baileyville, New York ."
"Wolves could die out in just a few years . Scientists are debating whether to intervene . By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 16 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 16 March 2012 . Gray wolves are at grave risk of extinction in a Michigan national park, scientists have warned, with just nine of the animals left and their numbers likely to dwindle. Isle Royale National Park’s gray wolves are at their lowest ebb in more than half a century, and could die out within just a few years. Only one of the nine wolves still wandering the wilderness island chain in western Lake Superior is known to be female, raising doubts that the animals will bounce back from a recent free-fall. Diminishing numbers: A pack of gray wolves in Isle Royale National Park in northern Michigan . They are at grave risk of extinction unless people lend a hand, wildlife biologist Rolf Peterson and John Vucetich from Michigan Tech University have warned in a report. The dramatic drop in numbers seems to have been caused by a run of bad luck, rather than one single catastrophe. A shortage of females has cut the birth rate, while a breakdown of several packs has boosted inbreeding and weakened the gene pool. Other troubles include disease and starvation from a drop-off of moose, the wolves’ main source of food. Although wolf sightings are rare, their presence is treasured by park visitors who hope to catch a glimpse on a backcountry trail or hear their eerie howls at night. Beautiful habitat: Just nine gray wolves still live in the Isle Royale National Park . ‘People like to know the wolves are there,’ said Mr Peterson. ‘It could be argued that this is the wolf's greatest refuge in the world. It's the only place they've never been killed by human beings.’ Because Isle Royale is a federal wilderness area, hunting and trapping are prohibited. Unless the wolves rebound quickly, the National Park Service will face the difficult question of whether to intervene. Officials could either bring in wolves from the mainland to salvage the existing population or let nature take its course and start with a new group if the wolves do die out. Some scientists prefer not to interfere with nature, even if it has serious consequences. Mr Peterson and Mr Vucetich would prefer to let nature take its course and airlift in more wolves should the current inhabitants become extinct, in order to prevent moose from running rampant and damaging the ecosystem. Otherwise, ‘we'd be taking a vital wilderness and turning it into an overstocked barnyard,’ Mr Peterson said. Prey: The gray wolves have traditionally kept the moose population in the park under control . They added that while some believe it unethical for humans to manipulate wildlife populations in wilderness areas, Isle Royale’s environment has already been considerable modified. The primary consideration, they contend, should be protecting the ecosystem, for which wolves are essential as they keep the moose population in check. The wolves' best hope may be that the female will bear a healthy litter of pups next month and help form a new pack, Peterson said. Another positive sign: moose numbers rose from an estimated 515 last year to about 750. But a shortage remains of elderly moose that are easiest for wolves to kill. Prospects are increasingly remote that more wolves will find their way to Isle Royale without help, Mr Vucetich said. A male is believed to have made the crossing on an ice bridge in the late 1990s and sired offspring, temporarily reinvigorating the gene pool. But a study published last week found that Great Lakes ice cover has declined 71 per cent over the past 40 years. Biologist began observing interactions between the gray wolves and moose in 1958, beginning what became the world’s longest-running study of predators and prey in a single ecosystem, Mr Vucetich explained. Restoring wolves would enable continuation of the study, which has yielded a wealth of discoveries about both species, he said. David Mech, a wolf expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, advocated a hands-off policy unless the wolves die out. Even in their diminished state, they could last a decade or more and may pull a surprise comeback, he said. ‘This is a really unique opportunity to see what they can do,’ Mr Mech said. ‘If there's any intervention, it destroys that potential.’","Wolves could die out in just a few years .

Manohar Lal Sharma told the BBC that one of the men had been tortured for 10 days. Mr Sharma said he plans to represent bus driver Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh as well as a third man Akshay Thakur and they planned to plead not guilty.

'All these people have been tortured badly. It's under pressure that they have made statements in court.' Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat refused to comment, citing legal restrictions.

Today's hearing was expected to result in the case being sent to a special 'fast-track' court, but a decision was not made as the court ruled that the charge-sheet needed more scrutiny. The case has now been adjournted until January 14 and although India's legal system is slow and inefficient, but officials are eager to make sure the high-profile case moves quickly. 'They are innocent,' said Mr Sharma, who added that he took the case in part to confront the police over 'how manipulated evidence is placed for fixing the innocent people.' A sixth suspect, who is thought to be 17, will be tried separately in a youth court if it is confirmed he is a minor. Five men have been charged with attacking the 23-year-old woman and her male companion on a bus as it was driven through streets of India's capital. The woman was raped and assaulted with a metal bar on December 16 and eventually died of her injuries. Indian TV station NDTV has shown footage understood to be the suspects charged in the gang-rape case . Rape victims are not identified in India, even if they die, and rape trials are closed to the media. Another lawyer, VK Anand, says he also represents the two Singh brothers. It is not yet clear if the other defendants have lawyers. Large protests have taken place across India since the attack, with women telling relentless stories of abuse - from catcalls to bus gropings to rapes - and of a police and judicial system that does little to stop it. Authorities have charged the men with murder, rape and other crimes that could bring the death penalty. Heartbreak: Badri Singh, father of the woman who was gang-raped and murdered in India, has said that he had been hopeful that his daughter would make a full recovery from her horrific injuries . Outspoken: Mr Singh spoke to ITV1's Daybreak show in India this morning. He said that he hopes his daughter's death will 'awaken' the country .

She was identified when her father decided to break his silence and speak out . Outrage: Protestors hold candles in New Delhi last month as they took to the streets in anger following the 23-year-old students gang-rape and murder . Badri . Singh said that although he knew that his daughter was 'in a bad state' after she was attacked by six men in Delhi last month, he still . believed she might recover after she was taken to hospital in Singapore. But the 23-year-old physiotherapy student was to die after sustaining horrific injuries during the assault. Speaking to ITV1's Daybreak, Mr Singh said: 'When we went to Singapore she was not conscious but she had tears in her eyes. Then I realised she was in a really bad state. 'I couldn’t think what to do at that time, I was like a bird without wings, I was neither here nor there. 'So . when I thought she might get better, I used to get filled with some . hope. When I was told that she might not get well and might have to have . an operation I felt uncomfortable. 'It . was difficult for me, but when she was put on a ventilator it gave me . some hope that she would get better. I thought she might get better and . she would live.' Mr Singh . said that his daughter's death 13 days after the horrific attack has . 'brought an awakening' to Indian society and called for his country to . no longer turn a blind eye to attacks on women. He added that he would like to see a new law or a hospital named after his daughter. Describing . his daughter, Mr Singh said: 'When she was born my aunties and uncles . always used to carry her around, those were really lovely days. 'Right . from the start her ambition was to be a doctor. Her main aim was that . our family wouldn’t have to suffer any more, she wanted to put the . difficult life behind us, wipe out our poverty. 'She also wanted to make sure I didn’t have to keep working hard late in life.' The young student was attacked . on an illegal bus in Delhi on December 16 and her and a male friend were . left for dead on the road. She eventually died in a hospital in Singapore after having 90 per cent of her intestines removed. Her death sparked anger across India. Meanwhile, the victim's companion on the night of the attack, 28-year-old software engineer Awindra Pandey, has spoken out about the terrible ordeal and his friend's horrific injuries. Treatment: The rape victim was taken to intensive care at a Singapore hospital but died of her injuries . Poignant: White lilies could be seen in the back of the ambulance as the body was transported through the city . He told The Times that his efforts to flag down help from passing motorists after the pair had been dumped in the road were ignored for 20 minutes. Mr Pandey said that police were reluctant to help his friend despite her injuries. 'She was asking for water and complaining of pain in her stomach,' he said. 'She was bleeding heavily. They (the police) asked me to put her in the van.' He said that the pair, who were not dating, had been to a cinema in the city to see Life of Pi but were unable to persuade a rickshaw driver to take them all the way back to the Dwarka suburb where the woman lived with her parents. They were dropped halfway home, when a phone call from her mother asking her to hurry home prompted them to board an illegal bus with blacked out windows. Mr Pandey confronted other passengers when they began insulting the pair but they soon produced iron rods, he said. He said that he was beaten and fell to the floor of the bus. After up to 20 minutes, the gang believed the student to have died and dumped the pair in the road .","The case has now been adjourned until January 14 .

An initial court appearance was expected on Tuesday. Last year, the two brothers and their sister had been indicted over a scheme where they allegedly stole $150,000 in welfare benefits. One neighbor Miles Jones spoke highly of his friend who was a skilled auto-mechanic. He told Fox 19: 'He was a good guy, a family man. He was real good with cars, he would go out of his way to help you. 'I really didn't think it would happen but I heard it was in the family... I guess it must have been something personal.'

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . PUBLISHED: . 12:58 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:50 EST, 11 January 2013 . A row has erupted after claims a Russian orphan wrote to Vladimir Putin begging him to allow his adoption by an American family - a move barred by a controversial new Kremlin law. The plea from Maxim Kargapoltsev, 14, apparently highlighted how dozens of Russian children have had their hopes of a new life in the US crushed by new legislation which has turned them into 'political footballs.' But Russian officials yesterday denied any letter had been received by the Kremlin. Plea: Maxim Kargapoltsev, 14, (centre) has asked President Vladimir Putin to allow his adoption by American couple Mil and Diana Wallen of Virginia (pictured) The boy, who is reported to have a debilitating genetic disease, has communicated with the Wallen family in Virginia for seven years. He proudly posted pictures of himself with his US 'parents' and is evidently distraught that he has been banned from becoming their child. His adoption from a grim orphanage in . Chelyabinsk was going through its final hurdles when the Russian . parliament slapped a ban on all adoptions to America - in apparent . revenge for new US curbs on visas for Moscow apparatchiks involved in a . corruption scandal. Maxim reportedly asked President Putin to 'come out in favour of children,' in his letter . 'I . would be very grateful if you come out in favour of children,' said . Maxim's emotional letter, according to reports disputed by officials. 'Put everything under strict control, but do not deprive children of their right to obtain a family,' he said, 'I beg the State Duma (parliament) and Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] to approve this adoption.' In December Maxim posted a map of Woodstock, Virginia on a social site saying with apparent  delight: 'This is where I'm going spend my next Christmas!' In Tweets before the ban, he wrote to the Wallen's (whose first named are believed to be Mil and Diana): 'I remember you every day! I miss you very, very much!!!' He wrote in November: 'I love you to the moon and back!!!' The disease from which he suffers was not identified but the US family had agreed to pay for his treatment which is not available in Russia. 'Maxim has strong relations with his American family and I do not think those bonds should be broken,' said Margarita Pavlova, the regional children's rights envoy in the region. 'It is hard to say how the situation will develop from here.Perhaps they will adopt some amendments to the law.' But she warned that Mr Putin was unlikely to bend. 'The probability is very low,' she said. Loving: In Tweets before the ban Maxim wrote to the Wallen's - 'I love you to the moon and back!!!' 'There . is a chance to treat Maxim in America and the Wallens are willing to . pay,' she said, 'he could get a good education in that family.' Denis Matsko head of Maxim's orphanage yesterday claimed the boy did not have a genetic disease. 'He has certain health problems -- just like we all do,' he said. Supporters of Mr Putin's United Russia Party claimed Maxim was coerced into writing the letter while others said he must have been aided by an adult. Hopes: In December Maxim posted a map of Woodstock, Virginia on a social site saying 'this is where I'm going spend my next Christmas!' 'This is all being done in order to make Russia look bad again,' said MP Yekaterina Lakhova. 'To provoke a child like that -- I just cannot imagine how someone could do that.' Kremlin children's ombudsman Pavel Astakhov said the story amounted to 'shameless speculation' and said the US family could still pay for the child's treatment - but could not adopt him. The US curbs on Russia were imposed after claims that senior officials were involved in a corruption scandal that led to the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail, and a subsequent cover up. Moscow hit back by banning any US adoptions of Russian children. Around 1,000 orphans a year - many seriously disabled - have been adopted by caring US parents and dozens were in the final stages of approval. Some 60,000 children have been adopted to the US since the Soviet Union collapsed over two decades ago. Such adoptions are now banned, sparking an outcry that the children involved are now being used as 'political footballs' caught in a diplomatic war between Moscow and Washington. Thousands of Russians are expected to protest the adoption ban this weekend.","Maxim Kargapoltsev, 14, asked for ban on US adoptions to be lifted .

A prosecutor says he plans to seek the death penalty for an Arkansas man accused of killing a 6-year-old girl who lived next door. Prosecutor Van Stone told The Associated Press Monday he plans to pursue the death penalty for 28-year-old Zachary Holly. Stone said Holly pleaded not guilty Monday to capital murder, rape, kidnapping and residential burglary charges in Bentonville, about 215 miles northwest of Little Rock. Zachary Holly is escorted to his November hearing in Bentonville, Arkansas, where he was charged with killing 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman . Authorities arrested Holly several days after Jersey Bridgeman was found dead November 20 in a vacant home next to Holly's. Stone says Holly is due back in court . February 28. Jersey's death came about a year after her father admitted to . chaining her to a dresser. He is serving an 18-year prison sentence in . that case. Jersey disappeared from her bedroom in her home in Bentonville, Arkansas - after babysitter Holly had put her to bed. The little girl had just started kindergarten after moving back in with her mother DesaRae Bridgeman and died of asphyxia or lack of oxygen, and physical evidence also showed signs of her being sexually assaulted, according to court documents. These undated pictures show Jersey Bridgeman, whose body was found in a vacant house two days before Thanksgiving in Bentonville, Arkansas . Zachary Holly's former home in Bentonville, next door to where Jersey Bridgeman lived . This booking photo provided by the Benton County Sheriff's office shows Zachary Dwayne Holly, who was booked on Monday, Nov. 26, 2012, on charges of residential burglary, kidnapping and capital murder in the Nov. 20 death of 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman . Jersey's death comes after a short life marred by abuse. Last year, her father, David Bridgeman, and stepmother, Jana Bridgeman, were arrested on child abuse charges in the nearby town of Rogers. David Bridgeman told investigators that he restrained the girl to keep her from getting into medication and other things in the house. He is serving an 18-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in June to false imprisonment, permitting the abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. The stepmother is serving a 12-year sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation, after pleading guilty to the same charges. Jersey's body was found in a vacant house adjacent to Holly's and two doors down from where the girl lived with her mother. The night before her body was found, Jersey had been next door, where Holly and his wife, Amanda Holly, would often baby-sit Jersey and her younger sister, according to the court document. Tragic: Jersey pictured with her biological mother DesaRae Bridgeman. It is not clear where she was when Jersey was reported missing . The document said Jersey's mother, . DesaRae Bridgeman, told police she went next door to visit the couple . after she came home from work around 11 p.m. on November 19. 'Afterwards, Zachary Holly carried Jersey home to DesaRae's house, while DesaRae carried Jersey's younger sister, and they placed the two children in the same bed,' Bentonville Detective Sgt. Kris Moffit wrote in the court document. When DesaRae Bridgeman woke up the next morning, Jersey was missing from the bed where her 2-year-old sister was still sleeping, the court document said. DesaRae Bridgeman looked around the house and then asked Zachary and Amanda Holly to help her before calling 911 to report Jersey missing, according to the court document. Police searched the Bridgeman and Holly homes before an officer noticed the back door of a nearby vacant house was open. Officers entered the house and found the girl's body. Jersey Bridgeman was chained to a dresser last year by her father and stepmom before moving to live with her biological mother . During an interview with authorities . that day, Zachary Holly denied having anything to do with Jersey's . disappearance or death, police said in the court document. Behind Bars: Bridgeman's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chained the girl to a dresser as punishment . They said he . was cooperative and agreed to give detectives swabs of his check for DNA . tests. He also agreed to give detectives the clothes he wore the night before Jersey's body was found, according to the court document. Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving. 'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.' The woman who first contacted the police about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar. Bridgeman's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house. 'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. Relatives carry the casket of 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman to her gravesite at Bentonville Cemetery in Bentonville in November . The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead. 'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added.","Zachary Holly, 28, has been charged with capital murder, kidnapping, rape and residential burglary .

One of the oldest shops in Britain is being kept alive by a community who value it so much that half the village work there for free. The village shop has been at the same premises in Itteringham, Norfolk, for 370 years, but was beginning to struggle to compete with rock-bottom prices offered by supermarkets.

At any one time four members of the village will be working in the small store stacking shelves, pricing products, cooking, cleaning and delivering orders. The volunteer workers at the community shop, which still sells the same locally grown produce first stacked on its shelves in 1637, saves around £350-a-week off the wages bill. The saving represents 20 per cent of the shop's £2,000-a-week turnover, which allows the store to break even. And if the historic grocers ever has a rough patch in trading the whole village takes part in garden parties, pop-up restaurants and film clubs to subsidise the losses.

The BBC has been accused of fostering a 'macho' culture after interviewing fewer women experts on its news programmes than rival broadcasters. Radio 4's Today programme invited an average of five male experts for every woman in November, while the Ten O'Clock News featured more men by a ratio of four to one. By comparison, ITV's News at Ten had a ratio of three to one in favour of male guests and Sky News achieved parity on nearly half of its broadcasts. Researchers from City University in London counted the number of male and female experts invited onto news programmes for ten months last year. Under fire: Today has been criticised for having a disproportionate amount of male guests . Critics have accused the Corporation of failing to make enough effort to book women on its programmes. In November, the Today programme came under fire for inviting only male experts for a discussion of breast cancer. At one point, presenter John Humphreys even asked a male contributor to imagine he was a woman. The programme has also been criticised for relying on male journalists. Of its five regular presenters, just one, Sarah Montague, is a woman. Miriam O'Reilly, who won an ageism case against the BBC last year after she was dropped as a Countryfile presenter, said: 'The BBC newsrooms are quite macho, in that there are more male producers than women. 'But they need to make an effort to change their ways. If other broadcasters can improve, I don't see why the BBC can't do better.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Everyone can agree there should be better gender balance in the media but, like all broadcasters, we have to reflect the world as it is. 'It's a fact there are fewer women than men at senior levels in business, politics and world affairs.That is bound to be reflected in our output but we are aiming to increase the number of female contributors across BBC News and we are making headway. 'We feel this relatively small snapshot doesn’t represent the range of well-known female presenters and correspondents that work across BBC News but nonetheless it continues to be a priority for us to improve the representation of women on our programmes.' City University’s director of broadcasting Lis Howell, who conducted the research, said the results were 'dire’. Call for change: Miriam O'Reilly, who won an ageism cases against BBC, said its newsrooms are 'macho' She said: 'The Ten O’Clock News has been the worst performer at all. Its ratio of male to female guests is terrible. There have been no recent signs of change on this issue by the BBC. 'They don’t seem to be taking it seriously at all, whereas other broadcasters cave certainly improved over the year. The BBC should be ashamed of itself. 'When women are invited on the BBC they tend to be the victims of diseases or crimes rather than authority figures. On hard news stories about the economy or politics, the BBC resorts to men. 'But this is not because women are not interested in appearing on TV or be interviewed on the radio, or because there are not enough female experts. 'It is a matter of making an effort to change the same old faces and bring in new talent.'","Radio 4's Today invited five male experts for every one woman .

Lovers Steven Dedman and Lizzie Andrews were just 18 when they began carrying out the audacious burglaries on high-end retail stores such as Apple, Dolce & Gabbana and Christian Dior. The duo organised their friends into a 'smash and grab' gang who would use stolen motorcycles to ram raid the shops before speeding off at up to 100mph, a court heard. Scroll down for video . Dedman, pictured left, was yesterday found guilty of two counts of robbery and cleared of three. His girlfriend Lizzy Andrews, 19, right, pleaded guilty to her part in the conspiracy before the trial . The youthful thieves, who were well-trained and often knew exactly which items were the most valuable, drew comparisons with Fagin's gang of pickpockets in the Charles Dickens' classic Oliver Twist. They are estimated to have stolen up to £1million worth of goods during nearly 50 robberies last year. ‘The gang mainly, but not always, stole handbags or computer equipment,’ said prosecutor Tim Clark. ‘Their method, known and “smash and grab”, was dramatic but also amazingly efficient and quick.’ The . gang would arrive on the scene on up to four stolen motorbikes with two . people on each, often using the bikes to smash stores’ windows. Targeted: Fashion designer Anya Hindmarch had her boutique raided by the gang days after her handbags has been worn by guests at the Royal Wedding . They armed themselves with sledgehammers and crowbars for some raids, while other times they claimed to be carrying knives and one passer-by was warned off with a handgun. Mr . Clark said: ‘As the riders waited with the engines running on the . bikes, with them pointing away from the shop, the pillion passengers . would run into the store and seize valuable items before running back . and jumping onto the bikes.' They would then speed off through the streets of London jumping red lights and going the wrong direction down one-way roads to evade police. But the gang drew too much attention to . themselves after targeting a boutique owned by well-connected designer Anya . Hindmarch - days after bags were worn by guests at the Royal Wedding. Ms Hindmarch, a friend of David and Samantha Cameron, told The Times newspaper: 'They knew exactly what they were doing, they took all of our bestsellers and our most expensive pieces.' Scotland Yard launched an undercover police operation to bring down the thieves before they did any more damage to London's retail sector. When officers raided Dedman’s home he fled across rooftops but was tracked down several weeks later. In his home they discovered a cake decorated with a motorcyclist crafted from icing sugar, surrounded by handbags bearing the Louis Vuitton logo. The cake was complete with the words ‘Happy Birthday Steven’ around the edge. Southwark Crown Court heard the gang’s other targets included the flagship Apple Store in Covent Garden, as well as Hush Jewellers and a Dior outlet between April and October 2011.

Dedman, now 20, was found guilty of two counts of robbery and cleared of three yesterday. He had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary and admitted he was present at nine smash-and-grab raids last year. Fellow raiders Reece Jackson, 19, and Paul Fearn, 22, were also convicted alongside Grant McCarroll, 19, who was found guilty of helping Dedman evade capture for two weeks.

Dedman’s girlfriend Lizzy Andrews 19, Bradley White, 22, and Dean Cole, 24, pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy before the trial. The gang will be sentenced together on January 11 next year. Damage: A window at the flagship Apple store was boarded up following the raid last year . Judge Anthony Pitts told them: ‘I am not making any promises whatsoever. ‘I want to find out more about you before deciding what the appropriate sentences will be.’ A total of 46 raids were carried out between April and October last year, with nearly £1m-worth of merchandise stolen. Detectives probe the scene outside the Chanel store in Old Bond Street after the raid last year . The gang would arrive on the scene on up to four stolen motorbikes with two people on each, often using the bikes to smash the windows . ‘The bikes would then speed away. We have evidence from CCTV, police helicopter footage, and eyewitnesses, that these bikes would travel at very high speeds, up to 100mph, and go through red lights to get away at speed’. During one robbery at video agency Adjust Your Set, in Charlotte Mews, Soho, on August 22, five raiders on three bikes broke into the shop and one shouted at two security guards: ‘I’ve got a knife, get in the f***ing corner.’ The gang escaped with a computer, a laptop, and three Apple monitors. When the gang struck at the offices of Overbury, near Tottenham Court Road, they caved in a glass door. Security guard Rachid Elkhamlichi confronted one of the robbers but he shouted: ‘Stand back, stand back or I’ll do you.’ Fearn was one of six men who raided the Apple store. When he was caught by police he had a bag containing an iPad, pictured, a MacBook Air and two MacBook Pros . Fearn was one of six men who raided the Apple store, stealing 37 items totalling £49,893. He was caught when officers discovered his abandoned moped outside Wyclif Court, Clerkenwell, central London, and found him hiding inside. He had a bag containing an iPad, a MacBook Air and two MacBook Pros. Bradley White and Cole were caught when undercover police rammed into their high-powered bike as they attempted to flee from a raid on Chanel, in Bond Street, and Cole suffered injuries to his leg. The judge heard Cole may still be unfit to appear in court for sentencing next month, and ordered a medical report to be delivered if he cannot be in the dock. Police discovered a photo on Andrews’ phone of a person holding a newspaper cutting about the raid at Anya Hindmarch's boutique. Dedman, of Wharton Street, Bloomsbury, central London, denied five counts of robbery and one count of possession of an imitation firearm. He was convicted of two counts of robbery, but cleared of three and found not guilty of possession of a firearm. Jackson, of Holly Park Estate, in Finsbury Park, north London, denied one count of robbery but was found guilty by the jury. Both have already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary between April 1 and October 11, 2011, and Dedman has admitted conspiracy to possess criminal property. Fearn, of Turnpike House, Goswell Road, Clerkenwell, denied one count of burglary. McCarroll, of Drummond Way, Offord Road, Islington, north London, denied doing an act intended to pervert the course of public justice. Both were found guilty by the jury yesterday.

The pod of 12 whales have now swum to safety after tides caused the ice to shift opening up a channel to the open sea . Dire situation: Desperate for oxygen, the whales were seen surfacing from the small . hole in the thick ice. The animals normally stay underwater for between . three and eight minutes at a time . Help: The local mayor has asked the government to intervene and send an ice breaker. The trapped orcas appeared to be in distress . Local businessman Tommy Palliser said . two hunters reported that the waters had opened up around the area . where the cornered whales had been bobbing frantically for air. He said: 'They confirmed that the . whales were no longer there and there was a lot of open water. It's . certainly good news - that's good news for the whales.' Locals said the whales had been trapped around a single, truck-sized . breathing hole for at least two days. A recent sudden drop in . temperature may have caught the whales off guard, leaving them trapped . under the ice. Palliser said the winds seemed to shift overnight, pushing the floating ice further away from the shore. The cornered animals were first seen Tuesday and appeared to have less energy by late Wednesday, Palliser said. Inukjuak Mayor Peter Inukpuk has said Canada's Department of Fisheries . and Oceans informed him that government icebreakers were too far from . the area to smash the ice to free the whales. Palliser said locals had agreed to try to enlarge the existing breathing . hole and cut a second opening using chainsaws and drills. 'We certainly had our prayers with them last night during our meeting,' he said. Ice-trapped marine mammals are not unusual in the region. Mayor Peter Inukpuk had urged the . Canadian government on Wednesday to send an icebreaker as soon as . possible to crack open the ice and help them find open water. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans had been preparing to send officials to assess the situation. Location: The whales became trapped under the sea ice some 30km from the . coast in Hudson Bay by the small fishing village of Inukjuak 1,500km . north of Montreal . Hollywood: Drew Barrymore played an animal activist in the film 'Big Miracle,' who works to free trapped whales in Alaska . Operation Breakthrough: In the film, which is based on a true story, Barrymore's character launches a massive media campaign to encourage politicians to support a rescue effort . Dozens of villagers had made the one-hour . snowmobile ride on Tuesday to see the unusual spectacle. They snapped . photos and shot video footage of the killer whales surfacing in the . opening - and even thrusting themselves skyward while gasping for air. Like . all marine mammals killer whales don't breathe underwater and get their . oxygen through their blowhole when they rise to the surface. They . normally stay underwater for between three and eight minutes but have . been known to stay submerged for up to 30 minutes at a time. By comparison sperm whales and bottlenose whales can stay under for as long as 90 to 120 minutes respectively. Killer whales are among the fastest swimming marine mammals and can reach speeds of up to 28 mph but only for short periods. They normally cruise at around 8 mph and can sustain such speed for long periods of time. Unlike . narwhals, belugas and bowheads, they are not an ice-loving species and . generally head north to hunt during the summer months but return before . the ice moves in. Mr Inukpuk believed the sudden drop in temperature recently caught the orcas off guard, leaving them boxed in under the ice. He suggested that the pod, which . consists of two adults and a number of younger whales, could be a single . family and that they were clearly in trouble. Speaking before the whales were able to make their break to safety, he said: 'It appears from time to time that they panic. 'Other times they are gone for a long time, probably looking for another open space, which they are not able to find.' Locals said the killer whales were seen thrusting themselves skyward while gasping for air. One woman who made the journey to the gap in the ice said even a curious polar bear approached the hole amid the commotion. Siasie Kasudluak said the bear was shot by a local hunter for its meat. Martha Asudluak, 21, had hitched a ride . on a snowmobile on Wednesday morning to go out to see them and got to about . three metres from the water's edge. She told Canada's CBC news: 'I saw the big head popping out of the waters ... I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 'They kind of looked like they needed . help. They're sharing this small little hole. They were probably . searching for a way to go out, but at the moment they have no other . choice but to stay there because it's all ice — all over.' Kasudluak said the hole appeared to . be shrinking in the freezing temperatures. Inukpuk believes the sudden . drop in temperature recently caught the orcas off guard, leaving them . boxed in under the ice. The whale's plight mirrored that of three gray whales which became packed under ice in the Beaufort Sea near Point Barrow in northern Alaska in 1988. That incident was the inspiration for last year's film Big Miracle starring Drew Barrymore as a Greenpeace . environmental activist who led to effort to bring media and political . attention to the matter while John Krasinski portrayed a local . television reporter. Local villagers, who came to watch, had called for help from the Canadian government to free the pod . Plight: The trapped pod were first spotted surfacing by a local hunter .

Locals were concerned that the freezing weather was actually making the hole smaller and said they need help urgently . The killer whales were seen thrusting themselves into the air in order to breathe . The effort to free the whales, dubbed Operation Breakthrough, gained national attention and eventually the State Department enlisted the help from the Soviet Union to use two ice breaker ships. One of the whales died while the effort was underway but the two remaining were able to escape after the Soviet ships cleared away a path through the ice.","The whale pod has gathered around single hole in the ice to breathe about 30km off the Canadian coast .

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally joined the rest of the Royal Family for a belated Christmas celebration, after choosing to spend the festive season with the Middleton family instead. William and Kate arrived at Sandringham House, the Queen’s private estate in Norfolk, early on Boxing Day just in time for Prince Philip’s annual pheasant shoot. It was the first time the Duchess had been seen in public since she attended her office party before Christmas. She was seen going to church with the Middleton family on Christmas Day but the Palace bizarrely requested that no pictures take of her were published. Pregnant Kate and William, pictured outside hospital earlier this month, joined the rest of . the Royal Family for a belated Christmas celebration on Boxing Day . The couple were driven the 155 miles . from Kate’s new family home in Berkshire to East Anglia, a journey which . takes around three and a half hours, by their Scotland Yard police . protection officers. William, 30, then joined his grandfather and other relatives for a morning’s hunting while Kate, who is in the early stages of pregnancy, opted to remain at the house with the Queen as it was pouring with rain. The monarch has herself only just got over a heavy cold. But they did join their menfolk for a slap-up lunch at Wood Farm, a small lodge on the 20,000 acre estate, for a hearty lunch, chauffeur driven in a fleet of Land Rovers. The meal was laid out in a conservatory area to the rear of the house and included cold meats, soup and flasks of steaming hot toddy, although clearly the Duchess stuck to soft drinks. It is believed that Kate may have re-joined the shooting party after lunch, however, watching from the warmth of one of the cars. Other members of the Royal Family present included the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke of York and his daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and Prince Charles. Charles’s wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who has two children and five young grand-children of her own, is believed to have left to spend time with them at her own home in Wiltshire. Sources have told the Mail that William and Kate stayed at the royal residence overnight after the shoot and are likely to remain on the estate for at least another day before they are expected to fly to Scotland for the New Year.

The couple’s surprise decision to skip the royals’ annual get-together in Norfolk in favour of a family Christmas at the Middleton’s new £4.85 million mansion in Berkshire was a distinct break with tradition. Royal aides said the couple had the full backing of both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and suggested that the decision had been taken in order to give Kate, who was hospitalised for three nights earlier this month with severe pregnancy-related vomiting and dehydration, the opportunity for a quiet family break. They also asked members of the media to respect their privacy and not use any photographs taken of them, even when they attended a public service on Christmas Day at the Middleton’s village church.

But the Mail now understands that the couple had always planned to spend the festive season with Michael and Carole Middleton at their new home, a Georgian manor set in extensive grounds. This suggests that the Cambridges may join other modern couples in spending alternate Christmases with their families in future – one of a series of changes the young Windsors are likely to ring in. Next month St James’s Palace is to announce whether William plans to stay in the RAF, for whom he works as a Search and Rescue Pilot, after his tour of duty ends in September or leave to become a full-time working royal. They are also due to reveal when the Cambridge’s new son or daughter, who will become third in line to the throne, is due. Assuming the child was conceived after their return from the South Pacific at the end of September, the child is likely to be born in early summer, a busy time for the couple who will be overseeing the final renovations to Apartment 1A, their new royal residence in Kensington Palace.","William and Kate arrived at Sandringham House early on Boxing Day .

Coleen is accompanied by her parents Tony and Colette, Rosie and her son Kai . Rett syndrome is a rare and incurable genetic disorder that causes severe physical and  mental disability. Affecting about 1 in every 12,000 girls – and only much more rarely seen in boys – it is usually diagnosed in early childhood when infants fail to develop normally or begin losing basic skills they have already learned. Sufferers can live to the age of 40 but about 95 per cent survive only until they are 25. The condition involves a mutation in a specific gene which affects  the way the brain develops and prevents other genes from working in the correct way. Initially symptoms can be vague, but include speech problems and losing the use of the hands. Some children stop using eye contact and lose interest in toys. A period of rapid degeneration follows which can last several months. Children will usually need round-the-clock care and will be unable to do even the simplest tasks on their own. Many will be unable to walk, talk or focus and some will develop symptoms not unlike autism. A third stage, where symptoms plateau, can then last for many years. Some will remain in this state for the rest of their lives. Many will suffer regular seizures and severe motor problems but their condition will not deteriorate. There is no cure, and treatment involves managing the symptoms. Medication may be needed for breathing problems and motor difficulties, and anti-epileptic drugs may be used to control seizures. Those at risk of dying from the syndrome will usually have experienced severe seizures, swallowing difficulties and greatly reduced mobility. Other sufferers can die from pneumonia. Because the condition is so  rare – and because the majority  of sufferers do not go on to have children – it is not known if it is hereditary. However, it is thought the chances of parents having a second child with the condition are about one per cent.","Rosie suffered with Rett Syndrome, a brain disorder which affects development and hits one girl in 12,000 .

She reportedly locked herself in a bedroom on their wedding night before fleeing . A 70-year-old Saudi Arabian man has been divorced from his teenage bride - thought to be only 15. The . terrified youngster locked herself in a bedroom on their wedding night and two days . later she fled back to her parents’ home. But the elderly man caused outrage when he claimed that the youngster's family had tricked him into paying a $20,000 (£12,479) dowry. According to local reports, the man said: 'I feel that there is a conspiracy by . her mother against me.' He claimed he would go to court to retrieve the dowry from the young girl’s Saudi mother and Yemeni father and said the payment made the marriage . ‘legal and correct’. Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission however said a meeting had taken place . between the man, the girl and her parents and that the dispute had been . 'resolved amicably'. The commission said the couple had been divorced. The marriage came to light when the man complained to local officials that he had been ripped off. After learning of the marriage the Human Rights Commission sent an investigator to the girl's home in the village of Al-Hurath in Jizan province. There is no law outlining a minimum age for marriage in Saudi Arabia, with human rights campaigners claiming that child marriage is a problem in the Muslim country. The man has since disputed reports that the girl is a teenager. In an interview with CNN he said: 'She is not 15 as everybody claims. She's 25 years old and she's mature enough to make her own . decisions... I was fooled by the girl's family.' Escape: The girl, who is thought to be 15, fled to her home in the village of Al-Hurath in Saudi Arabia's Jizan province following the marriage . Despite claiming to be 70, members of the commission said they believe he is 86. News of the marriage has caused an outcry on in the internet, with campaigners describing the incident as child prostitution and trafficking. Dr. Suhaila Zein al-Abedin, of government-backed group the . Saudi National Association for Human Rights, said he was concerned about the marriage's circumstances, as well as the age difference. He said: 'When you consider the very large . difference in age, it looks more like this was not a marriage, but like . the girl was sold. 'The girl's parents need to be held . responsible for this.' While some groups have called for the introduction of a minimum age for marriage in Saudi Arabia, religious scholars have opposed such a law. Yemeni activist NoonArabia wrote: 'ChildMarriage is a violation of human rights', while Egyptian campaigner Mona Eltahawy wrote: 'It's only when there's enough public . outrage that we can fight #childmarriage.

In an age of foul-mouthed and cruel  comedy, he is the funnyman known for his family-friendly jokes. Now Michael McIntyre has certainly had the last laugh at the expense of critics who labelled his giggly, bouncy persona ‘too middle class’ – by being named the most successful stand-up in the world. According to figures from ticket sales tracker Pollstar, the 36-year-old’s latest tour made him £21million. More than 600,000 fans flocked to venues around the UK and Ireland to see Showtime!, McIntyre’s 71-date 2012 tour, which included 10 gigs at the massive O2 Arena in London. His takings from live shows put him alongside the likes of the Rolling Stones, whose five-gig farewell tour netted £22million . McIntyre is the only comedian in the top 50 of Pollstar’s top 100 Worldwide Tours of 2012 list, making him the global stand-up king. He was 36th in the list, which was headed by Madonna, who made £184million from her world tour. His box-office earnings outstrip those of rival British comedians, such as Peter Kay, whose 2011 gigs netted just over £20million, and Lee Evans, whose ticket sales hit nearly £13million the same year. McIntyre lives in a £3.7million home in Hampstead, North London, with his wife Kitty and their sons Lucas and Oscar. But he  struggled on the comedy circuit for ten years, earning £160 a gig, before breaking through in 2006 with a successful appearance at the Royal Variety Performance . He has won over audiences with his brand of humour, much of it based around jokes that involve digs at himself or his family. Top-earners: McIntyre earned more than the likes of Peter Kay, Alan Carr and Russell Howard . In one gag, he mocked his wife’s love of expensive handbags, saying he told her: ‘For £500 I can hire a human being to walk alongside you holding your lipstick, your keys and your phone.’ To his £21million in box-office takings last year, he can add earnings from his autobiography, regular television appearances and DVDs of his live performances. The Showtime! DVD was a sell-out over Christmas, topping HMV’s comedy chart.

Crackdown: International Development Secretary Justine Greening ordered an 'emergency audit' of her department's spending on consultants in September . The amount of British overseas aid money lavished on consultants jumped by 45 per cent in just one month – despite a high-profile ‘crackdown’ on the practice being launched at the same time. International Development Secretary Justine Greening ordered an ‘emergency audit’ of her department’s use of consultants last September following a public outcry. But figures reveal that spending on so-called ‘technical and advisory services’ jumped from £31.7million in September to £45.9million the next month. A Whitehall task force has been set up to monitor spending at the Department for International Development, which is in line for a 30 per cent budget increase this year. The Treasury is concerned about the department’s capacity to handle the vast increase without presiding over millions of pounds of waste. Miss Greening is considering whether more of the consultants’ work could be done by civil servants. She has also demanded to see any contract worth more than £1million. Previously officials could wave through contracts worth up to £40million without seeking ministerial consent. The latest figures will also underline concerns about the decision to pour billions more into foreign aid, with the budget to rise from £8.65billion to £11.3billion this year. Dfid sources last night insisted the department had already mapped out exactly how the influx of cash would be spent. A source also stressed that the spending on consultants in October had already been in the pipeline before the crackdown was launched. Much of it is said to be a legacy of Labour’s profligate years in office, when spending on consultants soared to £1billion a year. Big spender: But the DfID's spending on consultants jumped from £31.7m to £45.9m in October . Official figures show how some firms are making millions from Britain’s aid budget. The so-called ‘poverty barons’ include PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which was paid more than £4million in October alone, while Adam Smith International pocketed £5.8million. Large payments also went to a number of major foreign consultancies, such as the US-based ABT Associates, which was paid £2.1million. Tory MP Peter Bone said he was ‘appalled’ by the amount of money spent on consultants. He said: ‘The public are told overseas aid goes on building water wells in Africa and other worthy projects. I think people will be shocked to learn so much of it is going into the pockets of large consultancy firms. ‘It does also raise further questions about the huge increase planned in overseas aid.’","International Development Secretary .

An astonished Mrs Williams, 54, watched in bewilderment as she was surrounded by naked men and women from a naturist club. Furious: Norman Williams, and his wife Helen, whose session in the sauna at Chepstow Leisure Centre was interrupted by a group of 40 local nudists . First, two naked bathers climbed into the sauna alongside her. Then, when she headed to the changing room to get away from them, she found yet more in there. Bosses at the council-run leisure centre have now apologised after admitting the nudists should not have been able to mix with regular customers. Mrs Williams’ husband Norman, 70, said: ‘She went in as normal to the gym and swimming pool for her regularly weekly session. ‘She was then in the sauna when men and women came in with no clothes on at all. ‘They were all in the swimming pool as well. Helen went into the changing room to get away but there were naked men and women in there as well. ‘She changed quickly and came home. I was furious – what if there were children about?’ Mr Williams phoned the leisure centre in Chepstow, South Wales, to complain and was told his wife had accidentally witnessed a regular meeting of 40 local naturists. Leisure centre spokesman Ian Saunders said: ‘We have two sauna areas, one downstairs and one upstairs. The naturist group privately hire the swimming pool each Friday evening and use the upstairs sauna area to change. Astonished: A spokesman for the council-run sauna in Chepstow, South Wales, said that the group had privately hired the sauna where Mrs Williams 'unfortunately' found herself . ‘Unfortunately a lady booked a sauna and found herself in the upper sauna area. ‘Usually our staff clear the public from the areas used by the naturist group. ‘We are naturally very disappointed that on this occasion the lady concerned was left in the sauna as the group entered. ‘This is the first problem we have encountered in 25 years that the club has hired the pool. We have apologised to the lady concerned and wish to assure the public that we will look into this incident.’ But Mr Williams added: ‘My wife didn’t know whether it was a culture thing.

Louise Bundy, who was a staunch defender . of her serial killer son Ted Bundy before he made a series of . death-row confessions, has died. She was 88. She died last month in her hometown of Tacoma, Washington after a long illness, the local News Tribune reported today. Her death was confirmed by the Rev. Melvin Woodworth, pastor of Tacoma's First United Methodist Church, which she attended from 1951 until a few years ago, when her health deteriorated. Passed away: Louise Bundy, the mother of serial killer Ted Bundy, has died at the age of 88 in her hometown of Tacoma, Washington . Death stare: Ted Bundy at his 1987 murder trial in Florida after he bludgeoned to death two sorority sisters. Bundy murdered more than two dozen women before being sentenced to death . In the mid-1970s, Louise Bundy was a married mother-of-five working as a secretary at the University of Puget Sound when authorities across the nation began to accuse her eldest son in a series of gruesome killings. For years, she refused to believe the charges. 'Ted Bundy does not go around killing women and little children!' she told the Tribune in 1980 after Bundy was convicted in the Florida killings. 'And I know this, too, that our never-ending faith in Ted - our faith that he is innocent - has never wavered. And it never will.' Her stance softened after Ted Bundy made a number of death-row confessions. He ultimately confessed to murdering . more than two dozen women and was executed in 1989 after being convicted . of killing two Florida State University sorority members and a . 12-year-old girl. At the end: In 1989, in her dining room, Louise Bundy wipes away a tear as she tells her son Ted: 'You will always be my precious son.' He was executed minutes later . Face of evil: Ted Bundy, convicted murderer at court in Miami in 1979, had the enduring support of his mother Louise . Louise Bundy spoke with him twice on his execution day, telling him at the end of the second call: 'You'll always be my precious son.' She remained in Tacoma following her son's execution and was an active member of the First United Methodist Church. Her son's troubles took a toll. Louise Bundy and her husband John endured jokes and dirty looks over the years and often changed their telephone number to avoid angry calls. Mrs Bundy gave birth when she was still Louise Cowell at an unwed mothers' home in Burlington, Vermont to a son Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946. She . raised Theodore at her parents' home in Philadelphia, allowing the boy to . believe that his grandparents were his parents and his mother was his . sister. Evil inside: Ted Bundy, pictured at Florida State Prison, and (right) one of his many victims 21-year-old Margaret Bowman after she was murdered at the Chi Omega sorority house, July 11, 1978, in Tallahassee, Florida . When Ted was five years old, Louise moved to Tacoma, Washington to marry John Bundy, a military chef. It was not until many years later when he was in college that the truth was revealed about his family circumstances. Although she quietened in later years, Mrs Bundy on occasion sprang to her son's defense. In 1999, Ted Bundy was linked to the 1961 disappearance of eight-year-old Ann Marie Burr in Tacoma who was never seen again. Mrs Bundy told the News Tribune: 'I resent the fact that everybody in Tacoma thinks just because he lived in Tacoma he did that one, too, way back when he was 14. I’m sure he didn’t.' The name Ted Bundy is synonymous with serial killer after the shy and attractive psychology major embarked on a killing spree in the 1970s that left more than two dozen women dead. There is speculation he could be responsible for up to 100 murders. In 1974, witnesses saw a young man, who introduced himself as Ted, approach two young women at Seattle State Park and ask for help with his sailboat. They were never seen alive again and became his first known victims. It was in the same year that several young women disappeared from college campuses in Washington and Oregon - including a 21-year-old radio announcer called Lynda Ann Healy. Later that year, Bundy relocated to Utah to attend law school in Salt Lake City. In November, Carol DaRonch was attacked by a man she described dressed as a police officer but escaped. She gave the first clear description and a blood sample from her jacket. Miss DaRonch also told police that he was driving a tan VW Beetle. As Miss DaRonch was giving her statement, 17-year-old Debbie Kent disappeared. A short time later, hikers found the bones of missing women in a Washington forest. A rough sketch was drawn - a tall, thin attractive man who approached young, white women looking for help and called himself 'Ted'. Police also noted common factors among the victims - they were all thin and had long hair parted in the middle. All the women were targeted in the evening and bludgeoned with blunt objects. The victims had also been raped or sodomized. At the beginning of January 1975, Caryn Campbell vanished from a Colorado ski resort. Her naked body was found a month later in a ditch by the side of the road. Five more women were founded murdered in a similar manner in the following months. In August, police pulled Bundy over for a driving offense. When Miss DaRonch picked him out of a line-up, he was charged with attempted kidnapping. He was sentenced in 1976 to 15 years in prison and later police connected him to the murder of Caryn Campbell. On December 30, Bundy escaped from prison and turned up in Tallahassee, Florida renting an apartment near Florida State University under a false name. On January 14, 1978, Bundy struck again. He broken into the Chi Omega sorority house and bludgeoned and strangled to death two women, raping one of them and viciously biting her body. He almost murdered two others by beating them over the head with a log before a roommate interrupted his spree. Almost a month later on February 9, Kimberly Leach, who was 12, was kidnapped and mutilated by Bundy. The serial killer was picked up a week later while driving a stolen car before witnesses placed him at both the sorority house and outside Kimberly's school. Charged with three murders -  killing the two sorority women and another Kimberly LaFouche - Bundy believed he could beat a guilty verdict and turned down a plea bargain of three life sentences. He went on trial in Florida on June 25, 1979, found guilty and sentenced to death. Prior to his execution, Bundy gave the details of the murder sites of more than 50 women. He also said that he kept the heads of some women at his home to engage in necrophilia. Bundy was electrocuted on January 24, 1989 at 7.13am.","Louise Bundy passed away in her native Tacoma, Washington .

Pensions minister Steve Webb warned everyone will have to work longer and no-one knows when people in their thirties can retire . Taking early retirement must become a thing of the past, pensions minister Steve Webb has warned dismissing complaints from people who hoped to stop working their fifties. With Britons living longer adding to a ballooning pensions bill, Mr Webb said anyone who predicted when people in their thirties could retire was ‘lying’. Campaigners have warned that government plans to link the state pension age with average life expectancy will mean making people work into their seventies. Ministers will unveil a raft of policy for older people in the coming weeks, including a flat-rate weekly pension of around £155-a-week and reforms to social care to stop people having to sell their homes. By 2018 the state pension age for women will be raised to 65, in line with men, before rising to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028. The Coalition Mid-Term Review this week stated: 'We will put in place a new mechanism to ensure that the state pension age reflects future changes in life expectancy so that the state pension system continues to be sustainable and affordable.’ Mr Webb insisted the era of retiring early on large pensions was over. ‘People sometimes write to me who are aggrieved at our raising the state pension age,’ he said. The option of retiring early will not be available to future generations, Mr Webb warned . ‘For us, if people are going to live on average to late 80s and beyond, retiring in late 50s is just never going to make the sums add up. ‘I had a police officer who came to me the other day and complained that we had stopped him retiring at 52. We just can’t do this any more,’ he told a House of Lords inquiry. Mr Webb also admitted that it was too early to predict what future rises in the state pension age will be. ‘If someone tells a 30 year old what their state pension age is going to be, they are lying,’ he said.","Lib Dem minister Steve Webb dismisses complaints that retiring in fifties is no longer an option .

An embittered blonde who had her playboy ex-lover murdered by a team of hitmen after she hatched a revenge plan to steal his secret stash of cash has been jailed. Maureen Smith, 38, of Toxteth, Liverpool, had vowed to get her own back on businessman David Corridon, 32, after they split up over his flings with a string of other women. The mother-of-two recruited a gang of three men to break into Corridon's home to steal a £35,000 haul of money he kept hidden in his loft - then split the cash with them. Guilty: Maureen Smith, who hired three men to steal from ex-boyfriend David Corridon, who was stabbed to death when the trio raided his home in Liverpool . But the bungled raid turned to tragedy when the gang stabbed the victim six times with a knife and screwdriver during a violent confrontation when they discovered he was at home. Corridon suffered fatal wounds which pierced both his lungs and died at the scene within minutes. On the day of the killing itself on February 27 last year, Smith found a TV had been taken from her parents' caravan and she blamed Corridon for its disappearance. She called him a 'robbing c***' via text and added: 'Watch yourself'. He replied: 'Y whos cummin?' and 'How much did you pay them?' Police who investigated the killing found Maureen had sent fitness fanatic Corridon several menacing texts in the run up to the tragedy saying: 'Tell your bird if anything happens to this house or me and the kids I will kill you and her.' In others she said: 'I'll never forgive you for this. I will tell my baby you are dead.' Further messages said: 'It's f****** worth spending money to get you f*****'. Drop dead. Watch yourself s*** bag, I f****** mean it.' Today Smith was jailed for 23 years and her sister Kelly was ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years after both were convicted of . murder, conspiracy to rob and burglary after a two-month trial. Kelly Smith, sister of Maureen Smith, and Tyrone Griffiths were also convicted of murder and conspiracy to rob . Crime: Nicholas Nelson (left) and Willis Nelson (right) were members of the gang who were behind the fatal stabbing of David Corridon . Tyrone Griffiths, 34, was convicted of murder, conspiracy to rob and burglary along with Nicholas Nelson, 30, and Nelson's brother Willis Nelson, 31. Each got life with a minimum of 28 years. Passing sentence, judge Mr Justice Robin Spencer told Smith she was guilty of 'selfish deviousness'. He said: 'This was a tragic and senseless loss of life which has had a catastrophic impact on the lives of many other people. 'David Corridon was a loving, caring and devoted father and I find it incomprehensible that you could have even dreamt of planning this to someone who had done so much to help you. 'You believed he was seeing other women behind your back and became obsessive. You probably couldn't accept the relationship was over. 'I accept that you still loved him and nursed the hope he would come back but the line between love and hate can be a fine one. 'I accept that you are racked with remorse for what you did although some of the remorse that you have displayed I have no doubt a feeling that it is sorrow for yourself.' Laughs: Corridon (centre) with ex-girlfriend Maureen Smith (far right) and friends . Liverpool Crown Court was told . Corridon and Maureen had been dating for 14 years and she affectionately . nicknamed him 'Jelly Tots' but they split up in November 2011 due to a string of arguments about his womanising. Corridon, . a motocross enthusiast who ran a removals and house clearance business, . moved out of the family home in Toxteth in Liverpool and went to live . in his mother's house in nearby Norris Green. Despite . the split Maureen hoped to reconcile their romance and put a Valentine . Day message in their local newspaper inviting him to a 'rendezvous'. But days later the ex-lovers had a huge bust up in the street after she was told he was dating a neighbour. During the argument Maureen rammed his works van with her own car and threw a brick through the windscreen while kick boxer Corridon grabbed her by the the throat and tried to choke her. She later sent him angry text messages about having been 'strangled' and 'battered' and he apologised saying he had 'lost it'. The court heard the plan was initially to rob the money while Corridon was doing a workout at his local gym but it ended in murder when the hitmen discovered he was at home. But Brian Cummings QC told the court: 'Maureen Smith wanted David Corridon not just to have his money taken from him but he be given a taste of his own medicine. 'The telephone evidence, in particular some of the text messages, shows the level of hostility between them and also demonstrates Maureen Smith was expecting David Corridon to be confronted. Jump: Mr Corridon was a keen motorocross enthusiast, kickboxer and keep-fit enthusiast . 'It started as a conspiracy to rob. It ended in murder.' Father . of two Corridon was at his parents' house when there was a knock at the . front door and a man asked if 'Joey' was in. The caller and two other . masked men then barged into the house and set about Corridon in the hallway. One witness said one hitman who demanded to know the whereabouts of the money was overheard saying: 'If you don't do it I will', while the victim responded: 'I can't breathe'. Corridon was then dragged upstairs before being seen lying dead on the floor. A silver BMW 1 series was driven away from the scene and found burned out later that afternoon. Police also found £35,000 in the attic. Mr Corridon's father called him 'mild-mannered, sincere and a devoted father, big brother and son' Officers arrested and charged the two sisters three weeks later but the following July, while they were awaiting trial, cards written by Maureen and Kelly were mysteriously found at Corridon's grave by his family. Maureen's card read: 'I think about you all the time. You are always on my mind. You are the love of my life. Things are not the same without you. I wish could send this card up to you. 'My heart is hurting without you. Love you lots jelly tots.' Kelly's card said: 'To my brother David. Happy birthday godfather. I miss you so much it kills me. I pray to you every morning and night. 'I am so sorry for the way things turned out. I never wanted this to happen. You are always in my heart.' Maureen initially made a statement to police saying she and Corridon were the 'best of friends'. She added: 'I was in a relationship with David Corridon for about 14 years. 'Around November or December 2011 we separated due to numerous arguments we had begun having about my suspicions he was sleeping with other women. 'When we met I had my son, who was still a baby, but David accepted him as his own and brought him up with me. 'I would say David and I had a good relationship and we were the best of friends. Our relationship was not violent.' In court she admitted planning to steal the cash but denied murder. She confessed: 'I just wanted the money to be stolen so I would get David back. 'I told them to mess the whole house up so it didn't look like they were just going straight to the loft. 'He might have thought it had something to do with me then.' After the case Corridon's father, also called David, said: 'David was a young, fit, healthy man, who was taken from us in the prime of his life. 'He was mild-mannered, sincere and a devoted father, big brother and son - he was everybody's friend. 'Greed played a major role in this case and we have been shocked, appalled and devastated by the events. 'However, the total lack of remorse and common decency from the defendants and some of their family members has hurt us the most. 'Not only did these people murder David, but they also assassinated his character.'","Maureen Smith arranged for gang to steal from ex-partner David Corridon .

A three-year-old boy who needed 100 stitches in his face and suffered a fractured eye socket after he was mauled in an horrific dog attack at a pub has asked his mother: 'Am I still cute?' Trafford-James Jackson-Poole could be left scarred for life after he was attacked by a Japanese Akita at his family's local pub in Newbold, Derbyshire. His distraught mother Gemma Jackson says that her young son was lucky not to lose an eye in the mauling. Mauled: Three-year-old Trafford-James Jackson-Poole needed 100 stitches after he was attacked by a Japanese Akita dog at his family's local pub in Derbyshire . She told the Daily Mirror yesterday: 'He's usually a really smiley boy but now when he smiles the left side of his smile turns down. 'Trafford keeps saying to me ""am I still cute, Mum?""' Doctors stitched up a four inch gaping wound which stretches from Trafford-James's left ear to his mouth but the youngster could be left with a permenant scar. Gemma, 28, and Trafford-James had been at the Nag's Head pub in the village just north of Chesterfield and were about to leave when he wandered off into another room and was attacked by the dog. Ms Jackson heard screams and seconds later her son emerged with blood pouring from his face. He was rushed to Chesterfield Royal Hospital, but later needed treatment at a specialist unit at Sheffield Children's Hospital because of the extent of his injuries. The mother-of-three is now demanding that the dog be destroyed. Subdued: Mother Gemma Jackson says that Trafford James, pictured before the attack (left), and with his wounds (right), has been 'very quiet' since the attack and is not the 'lively little boy' he usually is . She added: 'We had a lovely time at the pub and we were just about to leave when Trafford-James wandered off while my back was turned. 'He was gone in a flash and then I heard a dog barking. Trafford James suddenly appeared, he was screaming and holding his face, there was blood everywhere. 'I was in complete shock, I did actually think ""is he going to die?"". Doctors hope that Trafford-James has not suffered nerve damage but will not be able to tell for sure until swelling completely dies down. Ms Jackson added: 'The doctors have been marvellous and they are hopeful he will make a full recovery but they won't know for a few weeks. Distraught: Mother Gemma Jackson,far left, pictured with (left to right) Imogen-Grace, Jordan-Lee, and brave Trafford-James, is now calling for the dog to be destroyed . 'I realise now that he is a lucky little boy because it could have been so much worse, it's frightening to think what could have happened because those dogs have a a bad reputation. 'Trafford-James has been very quiet since he was attacked and has not really been the lively little boy he normally is. 'He used to like dogs but he won't go near them now and he is terrified when he hears them barking. 'As far as I know the dog is still around but I think it should be destroyed straight away. 'It is dangerous, it has bitten one child and it could easily happen again and next time the consequences could be even worse.' A Derbyshire police spokesman said of the most recent attack: 'A child was bitten on the face in the Nag's Head on December 30 and inquiries into the incident are ongoing.' Attack: Japanese Akita dogs can grow to weigh more than nine stone but are not considered dangerous under the Dangerous Dogs Act . The pub refused to comment. Marston's, the brewery which owns the Nag's Head, said: 'This matter is currently in the hands of the police.' Japanese Akita's are powerful dogs that can grow to weigh more than nine stone. They are not included in the Dangerous Dogs Act, but there has been several attacks by the breed. Last July seven-year-old Shannon Rennie needed 10 stitches in her face after she was attacked by one of the dogs. And in May 2012, Simon Hryhoruk watched in horror as his daughter Amy was knocked to the ground by a Japanese Akita which clamped its jaws around her head. When Mr Hryhoruk went to the aid of his daughter, the eight stone dog turned on him and he needed two operations and dozens of stitches to recover from his injuries.","Trafford-James Jackson-Poole was attacked in Newbold, Derbyshire .

A French teacher has been fired from a $40,000-a-year Manhattan prep school for allowing her 18-year-old students to have a glass of wine during a school trip to France. Daniele Benatouil was let go from the prestigious Calhoun School on the Upper West Side for letting six girls enjoy the traditional French beverage, despite getting their parents’ permission beforehand. The rule breaking was discovered when the girls presented a video to their fellow students, which depicted them sipping red wine. Breaking rules: The teacher allowed six 18-year-old girls to have a glass of wine with a meal during a school trip to France (file photo) Ms Benatouil, French native who had worked at Calhoun for 13 years, was fired as the glass of wine broke the school’s zero tolerance policy. Ms Benatouil sued the school for wrongful termination but the school’s decision was upheld by Manhattan State Supreme Court as she had failed to also get permission from the school board, Judge Shlomo Hagler ruled. The teacher, who now works at a public school nearby, defended her decision, saying a glass of wine with a meal is a vital part of exploring French culture and cuisine, the NY Daily News reported. Sacked: Ms Bentouil was fired from the Calhoun School on Manhattan's Upper West Side for breaking the zero tolerance policy on alcohol . ‘Having a glass of wine with a meal is absolutely a big part of the French cultural experience,’ she said. ‘It’s very traditional - like having a hamburger in New York.’ However, the school board did not feel the same and reacted strongly to the video being displayed in front of students upon their return from the 2010 trip. ‘It was very difficult to witness the children having alcohol, given the expectations of our school,’ one administrator at the $39,900-a-year school had told Ms Benatouil, according to court papers. Ms Benatouil had sought $120,000 in compensation, representing one year’s salary and benefits from Calhoun, and her lawyer Preston Leschins is now considering an appeal.","Teacher fired from $40,000-a-year Manhattan school .

Nick Clegg made his debut as a radio talk show host today and faced a barrage of criticism from angry callers. The Deputy Prime Minister was challenged on his new LBC 97.3 show over axing child benefit for high earners, capping increases in state handouts and raising tuition fees. LBC presenter Nick Ferrari said the Lib Dem leader was making ‘radio history’ in signing up to the weekly phone-in, which concluded with the revelation that Mr Clegg owns a 'big green onesie'. Nick Clegg hosted his first radio phone-in on LBC 97.3 and faced questions on benefit cuts, tuition fees and whether owned a onesie . In one of the first calls Mr Clegg came in for heavy criticism from a former Lib Dem county councillor who had quit the party after 39 years in protest at cuts to the welfare state. The caller, John Doran from Woling in Surrey, told MailOnline he thought the party should stage a 'special conference' to get rid of Mr Clegg as party leader. Nick Clegg struck a blow for the cool reputation of onesies when he became the most high profile politician to date who owns an all-in-one. In the final question on his radio phone-in the Mr Clegg disclosed that he owned a 'big green' onesie - but he had never worn it. 'I . was given a big green onesie which I have kept in its packaging. I have . got one but I haven't worn it yet. It will be something I do in the . privacy of my own home,' he added. He later joked he was a 'Onesie Nation politician'. The Prime Minister's spokesman declined to say whether David Cameron owned a onesie. Earlier on the radio phone-in, Mr . Doran told Mr Clegg: ‘I’m a Liberal Democrat who has just torn up his . membership card.""I'm a Liberal Democrat who's just torn up his . membership card. 'I joined . in 1973 and I'm afraid I can't now say I want to represent the Liberal . Democrats. I'm an ex-county councillor in Surrey and I am ashamed of . what the party's doing.' He asked Mr Clegg if he had got his membership card with him, but the Lib Dem leader admitted he had not. Mr . Doran read out the wording from the card which states that the Liberal . Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in . which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality . and community, and in which no-one shall be enslaved by poverty, . ignorance or conformity.’ He . said the party’s stated mission could not be reconciled ‘with this . government’s attacks on the most vulnerable people in society’. Mr Clegg insisted the party had . delivered on promises to raise the income tax threshold and introduce a . pupil premium for poorer children. 'I . am immensely proud that, facing the biggest crisis this country has . seen in a generation, the Liberal Democrats took a big, collective and . brave decision - at some political cost - to say we are going to step up . to the plate ... and fix this mess while also trying to make society . fairer.' Later Mr Doran told MailOnline he had not been able to tackle Mr Clegg over claims he made about the cuts being fair. ‘He didn’t cover all the things that the coalition is doing to damage people on benefits.. This is the moment John Doran told Mr Clegg why he had torn up his Lib Dem party membership card . Mr Clegg revealed he had been given a 'big green onesie' but insisted he had not worn it . John Doran told MailOnline the Lib Dems should get rid of Mr Clegg as Lib Dem leader . Mr Doran added: ‘I . am not talking about the proverbial scrounger.

We have lost a bit . around the edges but compared to people who are struggling, worrying . about feeding their kids, heating their homes.’ Later Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle described listening to the show as 'half an hour of my life I will never get back'. The . shadow Commons leader accused Mr Clegg of refusing to take part in a . show in his constituency, claiming he was 'hiding from the people of . Sheffield'. She told MPs: . 'Strangely, while the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to do a London . phone-in, yesterday he refused to appear on a Radio Sheffield show to . answer questions about the impact of Government cuts on his own . constituency.' Mr Clegg was also tackled over increases in tuition fees, defence cuts and which top Tory who would like to have a drink with . LBC 97.3 presenter Nick Ferrari said Mr Clegg was making 'radio history' as the first senior Cabinet minister to host a regular radio phone-in . In the final question the Mr Clegg disclosed that he owned a 'big green' onesie - but he had never worn it. 'I . was given a big green onesie which I have kept in its packaging. I have . got one but I haven't worn it yet. It will be something I do in the . privacy of my own home,' he added. The Prime Minister's spokesman declined to say whether David Cameron owned a onesie. 'I . know there was a Men's London Fashion Week event this week but I'm not . not going to get into the habit of discussing those kinds of things,' he . told reporters. Asked . whether Mr Cameron listened to his deputy on the radio, the spokesman . said: 'He was scheduled to be in meetings at that point.' Lib Dem strategists hope the weekly show will help turn around the party's dire poll ratings . Mr . Clegg was also asked if pledging to cut tuition fees was 'the biggest . regret of his political life'. But he would only concede it is . 'certainly' a big regret. Another caller, a Sheffield University student called Lauren, dismissed measures like the pupil premium as 'tokenistic' and accused the Government of discouraging young people from gaining qualifications by abolishing the educational maintenance allowance and increasing tuition fees. 'It seems as if the coalition is trying to tell them that higher education is not for them,' said Lauren - a charge Mr Clegg did not accept. The Deputy Prime Minister repeated his apology for committing the Lib Dems not to raise tuition fees when they were not in a position to deliver on the promise. And he admitted that coming eighth in the Rotherham by-election was 'woeful'. Mr Clegg admitted that his party's result in the Rotherham by-election, coming eighth, was 'woeful' but insisted the Lib Dems were right to join the coailtion . But he said it was always going to be 'monumentally controversial' for them to enter coalition with any other party, and said voters were willing to give their support when they had a chance to explain their actions. 'Where we can get on to people's doorstep or in front of a radio mike and explain to people what we are doing, why we are sticking to our guns on some of the big decisions, why the country has to go through this difficult process, I'm finding that people - perhaps not with bunting and wild-eyed enthusiasm - recognise that what we are doing is the right thing,' he said. 'What I'm trying to do is build a strong economy and a fair society.' In a wide-ranging 30-minute slot, Mr Clegg also revealed Ken Clarke to be the top Tory he would most like to go for a drink with. His first phone-in comes in the week of . the Government's Mid-Term Review, which was seen as an attempt to . relaunch the coalition at the halfway point in its planned five-year . term. He emerged largely unscathed from the first encounter but party strategists will be worried if every week is dominated by angry former Lib Dems.

When you advertise for a nanny offering a princely $15-an-hour, most parents aren't expecting Mary Poppins to waft through the door. However one New York couple are setting the bar high after posting a Craigslist ad this week accompanied by 65 highly personal and detailed questions for the future caretaker of their children. The nanny ad was posted online on January 5 by a couple who live with their two sons in the Sunnyside area of Queens, New York. Dream job: A couple in Queens, New York have advertised for a 'magical Mary Poppins' - with a grueling, 65-question survey about the potential employee's drug and hygiene habits . The couple demand full disclosure with an online Spanish Inquisition that covers everything from marijuana smoking to the use of hand sanitizer. The ad opens: 'Grab your umbrella! You are a magical Mary Poppins, a wizard, or a giant spiky Triceratops. 'You love to play, pretend, create, teach, and nurture. You are reliable, . warm, and fun, but also know how to say ""no"" when necessary.' The job description requires the nanny to take care of two boys, aged two and five, two days a week, between the hours of 11.30am and 5.30pm. Tasks include picking up the two children from school, preparing lunch, setting nap times, organizing games, activities and reading. The nanny may also be asked by the parents to work on an occasional 'date night', according to the Craigslist post. So far, so normal - but the slightly off-beat introduction gives no indication of the grilling to come. Welcome to the neighborhood: The part-time nanny job is based in the Sunnyside area of Queens, New York . The opening question of the survey asks: 'Are you an American citizen?' followed up by: 'If your family is from outside America, do you see yourself becoming homesick and needing to return to them? From there, the questions take an even more personal turn. 'Will you be able to provide a letter from your primary care doctor stating that you are in good health and able to perform the rigorous job of caring for two small children?' the couple ask. They add: 'Will you provide a letter from your doctor listing all your current prescription drugs?' This segues into an inquiry over drug use that a narc squad officer would be proud of. Question 25 reads: 'How often do you smoke weed?' The interrogation doesn't end there - . the follow-up question asking: 'If you ever smoke weed, how many smokes . do you typically have on a social occasion?' The topic then branches out to ask . potential nannies how often they use all recreational drugs (with the . helpful description of 'all drugs you can't buy at the supermarket'). A check-box list is then included . which runs the gauntlet of legal and illegal substances from Percocet . and cough med to meth and heroin. Help wanted: A couple with two young sons posted an ad looking for a nanny on Craigslist earlier this week . The future employers also want to know if the prospective nanny has ever smoked cigarettes and whether he or she is prone to a hangover. Hedonistic habits aside, personal hygiene is also a grave concern of this couple. The employee is asked a rigorous set of questions about how often they shower, when they wash their hands, their length of fingernails and whether they use perfume.

Officers performing a routine probation check on a northern California man yesterday were shocked to find that he had some 34 pounds of marijuana in his rented house. But they were more startled to discover the animal guarding it – a five-foot alligator named Mr Teeth. The Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies arrested Assif Mayar, 32, and took his illegal pet to the Oakland Zoo. Scroll down for video . Shock: Alameda County deputies performing a routine probation check found this alligator, Mr Teeth, in a Plexiglas tank in a California man's bedroom guarding 34 pounds of pot . Rental: Assif Mayar, 32, lives in this two-story rental house in Castro Valley, California, where he lives with his wife and two small children . Seized: Deputies recovered 34 pounds of processed marijuana, worth an estimated $100,000 or more . Put away: Assif Mayar, shown in this undated mug shot, was arrested after an alligator named Mr Teeth was discovered in his home in Castro Valley, . According to KTVU, deputies stopped by Mayar’s two-story rental home in Castro Valley on Wednesday afternoon to perform a probation compliance check. Alameda County Sgt. J.D. Nelson said yesterday in a news conference that while inspecting the house, officers discovered 34 pounds of dried, processed marijuana in Mayar’s bedroom. Next to the pot was a Plexiglas tank containing the alligator. Sgt Nelson said that the massive reptile was likely used as a deterrent for would-be marijuana thieves. The sheriff’s department called in backup from the Fish and Game department, NBC Bay Area reported. The sergeant said that stumbling upon an alligator was highly unusual. ‘We come across guard dogs like pit bulls quite frequently, but a guard alligator is very unusual,’ he said. KTVU notes that the married father-of-two has several dogs, including a pit bull, in his rental house. Mayar purchased Mr Teeth in 1996 to ‘commemorate the death of rapper Tupac Shakur,’ Sgt Nelson said.

A pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties will not be forced to have an abortion after the High Court ruled she has the mental capacity to decide if she wants the baby. Doctors applied for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy claiming the child is endangering her life. But the judge ruled the mother, who is 18 weeks pregnant, must still have the right to decide despite having a 'significant learning impairment'. The woman, who is not named for legal reasons, is described as being in the 'bottom one per cent of the UK population' in terms of cognitive ability. Case: The mentally disabled woman should be forced to have an abortion, the High Court was told, but the judge today refused to allow it . Mr Justice Hedley said even if the pregnant woman did not have the capacity to care for the baby, society does. She suffers from sickle cell disease and had a series of strokes when she was young, which left her mentally impaired and for which her family won damages from a hospital for negligence. Medics said she does not have the ability to make the decision herself and have described the need for an abortion as 'urgent'. But Mr Justice Hedley, sitting in the Court . of Protection at London’s High Court, said it was 'in her best interests' if the woman, who from the south of England, was 'to . continue with the pregnancy'. The judge said it was very important to bear in mind that even if people with . severe learning difficulties do not have the mental capacity to take part in legal proceedings, they 'may very . well retain the capacity to make deeply personal decisions about how . they conduct their lives'. These could include decisions about choice of partners, the extent of . sexual activity, making permanent relationships 'and decisions about . their own medical care including, as in this case, the continuation or . termination of pregnancy,' he said. He said courts and health officials should in the main stay out of decisions about whether people with learning disabilities can have children. He said: 'My instincts are that (her limited mental function) has nothing to do with the issue of whether a pregnancy should continue simply because once the child is born, if the mother doesn't have the ability to care for a child, society has perfectly adequate processes to deal with that. 'I'm anxious about there being brought into capacity assessments... the ability to care for a child in the future', he was quoted in The Independent as saying. The judge added that people with reduced mental capacity should still be allowed to make decisions - whether they are bad or good - as the majority of the population do. There was a belief that the alleged . father was known but it would not be right for the court to make any . observations about that, he added. Condition: The unnamed woman has sickle cell disease, where red blood become deformed (pictured) and can clog blood vessels causing breathing problems and even strokes . The judge decided this after independent expert in psychiatry, Dr Stephen Tyrer, expressed the . view that she did have capacity 'to decide whether or not to continue . with, or terminate, pregnancy'. The woman's sickle cell disease is very serious and the baby must be . terminated very soon to reduce the risk of her losing her life, doctors claimed. Her condition means that her red blood cells develop abnormally, preventing oxygen being supplied around the body properly. The cells' shape can also clog blood vessels, affecting . breathing and leading to anaemia, severe respiratory problems, strokes . and in some cases death. Around 250,000 people in the UK are believed to have it, and it is more prevalent among ethnic minorities. The case to force the abortion was argued by an NHS trust in southern England, in the Court of Protection, sitting at the High Court in London today. Until recently the Court of Protection sat in secret and is charged with ruling on 'life and death' cases where patients are deemed incapable of making a decision themselves. But it has also been criticised for some of the rulings it has made. The authorities have previously stopped a dementia patient going on the holiday of a lifetime because it was deemed too dangerous and forced another individual to use contraception.","Mr Justice Hedley said if she could not care for the baby then society could .

Angry: Peter Rees, 62, pictured with his partner Annie Brown, claims he was discharged from the West Wales General Hospital at 2am on New Years Day and left to walk the 23 miles home . A 62-year-old hospital patient who was suffering with breathing difficulties was told he would have to walk 23 miles home after being discharged in the middle of the night. Peter Rees was rushed to West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen West Wales after he was hit by a fit of uncontrollable coughing and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with a chest infection after tests and told he could go home at 2am. The father-of-three had arrived at hospital without his wallet and asked staff for help with transport home explaining that he lived 23 miles away in Llanwrda and had no one to collect him. But he claims that he was offered no help and was told to leave the hospital for being aggressive by a nurse. Having walked around 12 miles along pitch dark roads despite feeling unwell, Mr Rees was picked up by a passing police car and arrived home at 6.30am on New Year's Day. He said: 'It was dreadful - the most horrible night of my life. 'I had dark clothing on, I was feeling most unwell and I had to walk on unlit roads on one of the most dangerous nights of the year. 'Hospitals are supposed to be caring places but the nurse sent me packing knowing my only way home was to walk.' Mr Rees, who spent a week recovering in bed, has since made a formal complaint to the hospital. He had become unwell while at home on New Year's Eve and was examined by a paramedic at home who took him to a&e at the 391 bed NHS hospital. He was later told he was allowed to go home following an examination, X-rays and a blood test. Mr Rees said: 'They told me I had a chest infection and released me with a course of strong antibiotics. Distressed: Peter Rees, pictured, had been admitted to hospital suffering breathing difficulties and walked 12 of the 23 miles along pitch dark roads home to Llanwrda in the early hours of the morning . Long walk: Mr Rees lives in the village of Llanwrda 23 miles from the West Wales General Hospital . 'When I explained that I lived 23 miles away and had no way to get home, the nursing sister told me to walk. 'When I said I couldn't believe what was happening, I was accused of being aggressive. 'I was very tired, but I didn't raise my voice or swear. I was not aggressive, but they said I had to leave. 'There were ambulancemen there who saw my predicament but said they were not allowed to drive patients home. He added: 'Even if I had money I would not have been able to get a taxi at that time on New Year's Eve. 'I would have been happy to sleep in a chair until daybreak when I could have arranged a lift home. 'But I was virtually shown the door - the attitude of the nurse is something I will never forget. 'It was heartless and no way to treat a man of my age who had just been diagnosed with a chest infection.' Emergency: Mr Rees was rushed to the West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen . Dropped off: Mr Rees eventually made it home to the village of Llanwrda at around 6.30am, four-and-a-half hours after he was discharged from hospital, having been picked up by police . Mr Rees, whose partner Annie was unable to pick him up as she does not drive, walked ten miles before a passing police car stopped him and told him it was dangerous to be walking along the road. He said: 'The officers urged me not to walk any further because it was too dangerous, but I had no choice. 'I was literally clinging on to bramble bushes as I edged along the hedgerow in the face of oncoming traffic. 'I was shattered, freezing, I felt giddy and I lost my footing more than once.' He walked a further two miles before a second police car stopped him and offered him a lift home. Mr Rees is now considering taking legal action against the hospital claiming that it failed in its duty of care. A spokesman for the Hywel Dda Health Board which runs the hospital said: 'We regret to hear about the situation Mr Rees found himself in on New Year's Day. 'The Health Board has now received a formal complaint and, as the investigation is ongoing, we cannot comment further at this time. 'We'd like to reassure the public that there are a range of innovative transport schemes currently in place, or being piloted, for patients who require assistance with non-emergency transportation. 'Improving access to transport is a key priority.'","Mr Rees had been rushed to hospital suffering breathing difficulties .

A fraudster has been jailed for four years after stealing nearly £32,000 from the charity he worked for and spending the money on Viagra and 'extreme dating'. David Field also spent the brain injury charity's funds on buying flowers for his wife and a hotel rendezvous with a mystery woman. He was put in charge of the finances at a regional branch of Headway after lying about his qualifications and covering up two previous fraud convictions. During four months at the charity's offices in Credenhill, Herefordshire he managed to swindle £31,713 thanks to his privileged position, Hereford Crown Court heard this week. Field, 56, used Headway's debit card to withdraw £15,000 in cash and spend £16,713 on the internet between August 2010 and January 2011. His online shopping included shipments of erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, which he had shipped to the charity's offices. He also spent £150 on a subscription to a so-called 'extreme dating' website - thought to be dating between those who share a love of outdoor sports - and bought his then wife £100 worth of flowers. Field paid for a woman known only as 'Rachel' to go on holiday, and used the charity's money to pay for a meeting with her at a Travelodge hotel in Hereford. While he told colleagues she was providing the charity with IT services, judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins said 'the relationship was clearly more than that'. In addition, Field used Headway's cash to pay off gambling, council tax and credit card debts. Victims: Field was in charge of the finances at a branch of Headway in Credenhill, Herefordshire (pictured) The scam came to light when a lawyer working for one of Field's previous employers got in touch with Headway to warn them about his fraud convictions. When confronted by staff at the centre, Field admitted being jailed for 12 months in 1992, and again for three years in 1999. Jailed: Field had previously served two separate prison sentences for fraud in the 1990s . He tried to shrug off the sentences, telling colleagues he had been jailed on a 'technicality' - but charity bosses became suspicious and called the police. During police interviews Field claimed he had been 'stitched up', but on the first day of his trial last November he changed his plea to guilty. On Monday, he was sentenced to four years in prison. The court heard that the charity paid Field a £13,000 salary, meaning he had cost Headway £45,000 in total - and because he has since declared bankruptcy, the charity will be unable to reclaim the money. Speaking after the sentencing, a spokesman for the charity criticised Field's 'brutal betrayal'. 'There is no winner in this situation,' he said. 'This was a callous and calculating act, a brutal betrayal of trust and that is why we welcome the tough sentence. 'Fraud is often described as a victimless crime but the human impact is certainly very real - the charity has been left on the brink. 'The money taken will never be recouped - that is £45,000 we will never see again.' Headway works to rehabilitate people with brain injuries, and offers support to their carers and families.","David Field was in charge of funds at branch of brain injury charity Headway .

Amanda Sorensen, 21, is now being held on $1 million bail after the death of two-year-old Joileen Garcia at the family's home in Apple Valley, California on Sunday. She has been charged with one count of murder and another count of child abuse causing death, according to the complaint filed by the San Bernardino district attorney's office. Arrest: Amanda Sorensen, pictured left, has been arrested after her boyfriend's two-year-old daughter Joileen, right, . suffered a seizure after the woman allegedly gave her chilli powder . Police were called to the home at 4.16pm on Sunday as the girl suffered a seizure after ingesting the chilli powder. Authorities have not revealed why the . young girl was allegedly forced to eat the powder, but the criminal . complaint notes she acted with 'malice aforethought'. The toddler was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. An investigation is ongoing, a . sheriff's spokeswoman said, and an autopsy will be carried out to . determine the exact cause of death. She is scheduled to return to court January 17. Sorensen, who is believed to have her own young daughter, is being held at the West Valley Detention Center. Arrest: Sorensen, who has her own daughter, left, allegedly gave the little girl chilli as a punishment . Victim: Two-year-old Joileen was remembered as an intelligent, energetic child who loved animals . Pursuing charges: On Thursday prosecutor Kathleen DiDonato, far right, spoke with reporters after an arraignment hearing for Amanda Sorensen who pleaded not guilty to her charges . Chilli's . main ingredient Capsaicin is an irritant in humans and other mammals, . causing a burning sensation in the tissues with which it comes into . contact. Airway resistance increases following inhalation of capsaicin in both mild asthmatics and non-asthmatic people. Capsaicin . can be fatal in large quantities. Symptoms of overdose include . difficulty breathing, convulsions, and changes in skin colour. 'We felt the evidence supported the . charges,' said Kathleen DiDonato, a prosecutor with the San Bernardino . County district attorney's office. DiDonato's boss, District Attorney Michael Ramos, recently formed a unit focused on prosecuting major crimes against children. Ramos cited the difficulty in . prosecuting such cases because often there are no witnesses and children . sometimes are unable to testify. There were more than 30 crimes against . children last year in San Bernardino County that includes murder, . assault and torture. In 2011, there were more than 50 such crimes. 'It's sad to say we need a major crimes against children unit for this reason,' DiDonato said of the chili powder case. In court on Thursday, a man identifying himself to NBC Los Angeles as the boyfriend of Joileen's biological mother said she was devastated. 'She's just broken down,' Manuel Lopez said. Happier days: Sorensen, who is being held in jail, is pictured with her boyfriend and her baby daughter . Lopez added that he had raised the young girl since she was 18 months old and thought of himself as her father. 'Early in the morning, she would . always jump into bed with us. She went with us everywhere,' Lopez said. 'Bright kid, smart, intelligent, running around. ... She loved animals . and horses.' Neighbors told KTLA that they have . previously witnessed abuse at the home, which was scattered with toys . when police took the mother away. 'They fight like crazy,' one man told the channel.

Search: Police searching for missing boy Jordan Cobb, last seen leaping from a ferry, believe he may have jumped into the icy waters of Cornwall for a £100 bet . Police searching for a missing boy last seen leaping from a ferry into a freezing river believe he may have jumped into the icy waters over a £100 bet, it emerged today. Jordan Cobb, 16, was intending to take part in a New Year’s Eve street party in Torpoint, Cornwall, after catching the ferry from Plymouth in Devon. But the alarm was raised shortly after 9pm when Jordan disappeared beneath the surface of the River Tamar, around 70 yards from the shore. Police say they are still trying to track a handful of people who are believed to have been with Jordan in the moments leading up to his disappearance. They have been scanning social media and speaking to other witnesses, and say they believe the incident may be a 'prank gone wrong'. Detective Inspector Nick West said today: 'We know that there was a discussion between the group about something - we’re still waiting for some people to come forward and clarify what went on - but we understand that for some reason Jordan has given his bag to a friend, he’s jumped up on to the front of the ferry and then jumped into the water. 'There is information in the public domain that suggests this is all a prank, that someone within Jordan’s group has engaged with them in relation to a bet. 'We do understand that the figure of about £100 has been discussed, but that hasn’t been confirmed. That’s one line of inquiry that we’re keeping an open mind on.' Specialist dive teams, the coastguard . and the Ministry of Defence took advantage of low tides today to . continue the search for the Stoke Damerel Community College student. Jordan’s friends had previously scanned sections of the coastline from the shore in an attempt to find him, as well as bombarding social media sites with calls to keep up the search. Devon and Cornwall Police said today they maintain hope of finding the teenager alive, despite the hunt for him entering a 10th full day. Missing: Jordan had been on the Tarpoint ferry when he was believed to have jumped off into the River Tamar . Desperate: Divers are pictured looking for the missing 16-year-old in the river's icy waters. Police say they believe the incident may be a 'prank gone wrong' Mr West added: 'It is still a missing persons inquiry. Obviously, we will keep all hope that Jordan is out there alive and well. 'If this is a prank that’s gone not wrong, he’s jumped into the river and he’s embarrassed to the fact he’s caused all this commotion and all this activity, his friends’ involvement and his family’s distress - (if) he’s just hiding low somewhere, then I would appeal for him to come forward. 'As time goes by, we have to be realistic. We will never forget that he is missing. If this is a tragic act that’s gone wrong, then lessons need to be learned from it.' He said Jordan’s parents and two brothers were trying to come to terms with the schoolboy’s disappearance. 'Jordan’s family is obviously very distressed and distraught,' said Mr West. 'Collectively the family are all staying together and trying to give themselves support internally.' Positive: Devon and Cornwall Police said today they maintain hope of finding the teenager alive, despite the hunt for him entering a 10th full day . Operation: Police divers are pictured during a search for the youngster . Police involved in the case met the coastguard this morning for a briefing ahead of their latest search, which had previously been made even more difficult by the fast flow of the river. Speaking at the briefing at Devonport police station, Chief Superintendent Chris Singer said: 'The quiet determination that has been shown here to try and find Jordan and take him home to his loved ones is testament not only to the fact that this tragedy has touched a large number of people, but also to the professionalism displayed by the partner agencies involved. 'I’m sure, in due course, our efforts will be rewarded.' Mr West said officers would continue to search Facebook and Twitter for clues about Jordan’s disappearance. He said: 'There is always an appeal for anybody who might have been there on that night who has information, maybe about the reason why Jordan jumped in. 'Are they able to shed any light on the idea that this is a prank gone tragically wrong? 'I would appeal for them to come forward and speak to us, or pass on the information to Crimestoppers. Our main purpose is to try and find some closure for Jordan’s family.'","Jordan Cobb jumped off a ferry and into the freezing River Tamar in Devon .

Desperate: Jobless Martin Bailey from Nottingham who has resorted to wearing with a sandwich board to try and attract potential employers . There's no doubt that many people are finding landing a job difficult in the current economic climate. But one down-on-his-luck job hunter is resorting to desperate measures in a bid to find work and avoid claiming benefits. Martin Bailey, 50, has taken to standing on a busy roundabout each morning wearing a sandwich board asking for someone to employ him. He hopes that his unorthodox way of looking for an income will not only win him a job but also help him win back the love of his life with whom he split last year because he was unable to offer her a stable life. The divorced father-of-two dresses in his suit and heads out in Nottingham each day wearing the board which reads: 'Quality worker seeks job; honk if you can help'. Dedicated Martin, who worked for more than two decades as a civil servant at the Land Registry until he was made redundant last year, has gone the extra mile in his bid to get a new job after dozens of application forms and more than 50 speculative CVs failed to find him work. He even attempted to set up his own business in an attempt to make an honest crust, running a fancy dress store until it was forced to close on Saturday due to a lack of business. He said: 'I was made redundant a year ago from my job in the civil service. So I used the money to set up my own business. 'But it was a struggle since the day we opened and I had to shut up shop last Saturday. 'Unfortunately the day we opened a massive fancy dress centre opened in the city centre and, while our business did gradually improve, we just didn't get the visitors in. 'I don't want to be unemployed and I don't want to claim benefits. Hopeful: Martin Bailey says that the response to his quest for work has been positive so far and that he has handed out business cards to several motorists . Out of luck: Martin hopes to find work after closing his business on Saturday. He is also looking to win back the love of his life by offering her 'something stable' 'I hate the idea of not being productive, I'm prepared to do anything, I'd love to do customer services but I can do driving jobs, admin, and jobs with anti-social hours don't bother me. 'I thought I would show my initiative, get up first thing in the morning in the cold and get myself out there rather than standing in the dole queue. 'I felt a bit stupid to start with and it was bitterly cold, but I handed out at least half a dozen business cards yesterday and hopefully this will all end in a job. 'So far I've had a great response, loads of people honking so it's pretty loud round there, but I've been given some fantastic business cards by people who want my CV and like my pro-activeness.' Martin is also determined to get back on his feet in order to win back a woman he broke up with last year. Graduate Adam Pacitti also went to drastic measures in a bid to get a job, spending his last £500 on this billboard . He added: 'I do have another slight push to do this, I met the love of my life last year called Joan and we split because I couldn't offer her anything stable. 'I am hoping that if I get a job I can win her back.' Martin is not the only job seeker to take such drastic action to find work. Unemployed Adam Pacitti, 24, spent his last £500 on a giant billboard asking for a job after sending CVs for more than 250 posts. Adam, who has a first class honours degree in Media Production from the University of Winchester, also set up a website with a video CV and posted pictures of the billboard on Twitter.

Mr Hussain, who was found guilty of falsely claiming at least £35,000 in benefits, was handed a nine month suspended sentence . An Iraqi immigrant who falsely claimed at least £35,000 in benefits has been spared jail today. Majid Hussain claimed income support, housing benefit and a council tax reduction for more than a decade - despite having more than £35,000 stashed away in a bank account. He had denied three counts of benefit fraud but was found guilty at Exeter Crown Court. Hussain walked free from court however, when he was handed a nine month suspended sentence. The court had heard during the trial how Hussain, of Exeter in Devon, arrived in the UK as a mature student in the 1980s funded by Saddam Hussein's government. He was left around £18,000 by his father but said that the money had been put into a Royal Bank of Scotland account for use as a trust fund to pay for his children's education. But the unemployed 62-year-old signed forms saying that he did not have any undeclared savings when claiming benefits . He said that under Sharia law he did not consider the money to belong to him. While claiming benefits, the account grew to be worth £36,000. Hussain, who has never worked since he arrived in the UK, received at least £35,000 in benefits between 1997 and 2010 - though the precise figure can never be determined because records do not go back far enough. The father of four stopped receiving income support after the existence of the account was revealed in 2010 - at which point he immediately began withdrawing money from it. However, he is still receiving disability living allowance because he suffers from Crohn's Disease, kidney problems and muscle pain. The jury was given a dossier of forms signed by the defendant in which he declared that neither he nor any of his children - aged between nine and 18 - had any savings affecting the means test for their benefits. His defence statement read: 'He did not notify the DWP of some of the money under his control because it was left to him on strict Islamic terms by a relative for the sole use of his children. 'In accordance with Islamic belief and law, there was no possibility or option for it ever to be used for his own use and as such there was no intention to deceive.' Sentenced: Majid Hussain claimed he did nothing wrong because he was acting under the rule of Islamic law . Testifying in court yesterday, Hussain said: 'I read the Koran and in the Koran it commands you to honour your parents. 'You have to respect them. In the Koran we call them the ""Second God"".' He continued: 'I have an article of the Koran here - it says, ""Allah commands you to render back your trust to those to whom they are due and not to break your oath. For Allah knows all that you do."" 'That's what we've been taught - always obey your parents. I was just going to keep the money for my children and not touch it. I had no right to the money.' He added that his father had 'worked so hard' to save the money he gave his son, working in heat of up to 56C (133F). Hussain initially told investigators he had saved the money from the scholarship he received from the Iraqi government while studying at the University of Exeter from 1986 to 1996, according to prosecutor Gareth Evans. When an official asked him if he knew his benefits would be withdrawn if he had declared the account, he said 'yes', the court heard. Home: The defendant has lived in the UK since moving from Iraq as a mature student in the 1980s . He then allegedly started withdrawing large sums of money from the RBS account, reducing it by £24,000 over seven months. Mr Evans told jurors: 'I am afraid that his declarations that he had no bank accounts or savings with his wife or any children he was claiming for was a lie. 'If he would have disclosed this account then he would not have been entitled to benefits at all. 'He has been dishonest claiming his benefits, he knew that he should have declared the account and he failed to do so dishonestly in order to claim benefits.' Sentencing Hussain, Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said: 'The jury rejected that this money was held in trust for your children's education. 'The (benefit) forms you filled in when making your claims made it perfectly clear that you had a duty to tell the authorities (of the money). 'The real extent of how much money (paid in benefits) can never be obtained because your fraud has gone on for such a long period of time.' He made no order for costs, although confiscation proceedings are expected to be taken against Hussain.","Unemployed Majid Hussain given money by father to spend on his children .

Inspiring: Peter Deal's victim came forward after hearing former England rugby star Brian Moore, pictured, talk about his own childhood abuse . A former boxing coach was jailed today for raping and abusing a schoolboy 40 years ago, after the victim was prompted to break decades of silence by former England rugby star Brian Moore’s disclosures that he was sexually abused as a child. Peter Deal, 74, was jailed for five years at Inner London Crown Court after previously pleading guilty to seven charges, ranging from buggery to indecent assault, between 1969 and 1973. The court heard his victim, now 54, had not told anyone about the abuse he endured from the age of 10 to 13 until he heard a radio interview with former Harlequins player Moore, nicknamed Pitbull, about the abuse he endured at the hands of one of his teachers. In his autobiography Beware of the . Dog, Moore, now 50, said the abuse began when he and three other boys, . aged nine and 10, were lured into a tent and sexually abused by a . teacher while on a field trip in Yorkshire. He . said the childhood traumas made him ferociously competitive on the . rugby field and contributed to the breakdown of two marriages. Today . Inner London Crown Court heard how a radio interview with Moore . prompted Deal’s victim to break 40 years of silence - telling his wife . and then the police that he had been abused as a boy by his then-boxing . coach. Sentencing Deal . to five years in prison, Judge Roger Chapple told him: 'The offences to . which you have pleaded guilty reflect a course of conduct, a course of . persistent sexual abuse of a child, conduct which fills any . right-thinking person with revulsion.' He said Deal’s victim had to live with his abuse 'for the best part of 40 years'. Judge Chapple continued: 'For my part, I find it not remotely difficult to understand that he did not feel able to report that systematic abuse that he suffered at your hands.' Brian Moore, pictured in the centre of the scrum playing for the British Lions in 1993, revealed in his autobiography Beware of the Dog that he was abused by a teacher . The court heard Deal was previously . jailed for eight years in 2006 for abusing two boys he met at the same . boxing club involved in today’s case. His sentence was reduced to seven . on appeal and he was released in 2011. Judge . Chapple added: 'In July 2006 you were convicted of five offences of . indecent assault upon two boys, aged 10 to 11 and 13 to 15. 'These offences took place in 2000 or thereabouts but there are many similarities, particularly your abuse of your position as a coach at a sports club to commit these offences.' He said if the judge in Deal’s last case had known about these offences, he would have been given a far longer prison term. He went on: 'You are 74 years of age, plainly in ill-health. Taking these matters into account, the right sentence in my judgment is an overall sentence today of five years in prison.” In court: Deal was today jailed for five years at Inner London Crown Court for indecent assault and buggery charges between 1969 and 1973 . He said Deal was already subject to a lifetime Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Prosecutor Chris Stimpson today told . the court that Deal was a coach at Rippleway Newham Football Club - the . youth team that produced England and Arsenal star Sol Campbell - when he . first met his victim. He . first indecently touched the boy when he gave him a lift home after . training, then went on to repeat the abuse on future occasions in his . car, Mr Stimpson said. Deal introduced the boy to East Ham . Boxing Club, where he also coached, taking him to training and . collecting him from his house, as well as taking the boy - then aged 12 - . to his own home. England rugby player Brian Moore, pictured in 1995, said the childhood trauma made him ferociously competitive on the rugby field . The court heard that during the . summer holidays he even persuaded the boy’s parents to allow him to stay . with him before a five-a-side tournament, when he raped him. Mr Stimpson said the victim estimated he was raped by deal about 50 times in total. 'The . allegations came to light in August 2011 when the victim was listening . to an interview with the former rugby international Brian Moore on 5 . Live radio, who was talking candidly about the sexual abuse he . experienced, the prosecutor told the court. 'He therefore told his wife on August 19, 2011. He had previously decided never to tell anyone about what happened as he was so ashamed and he refers in his statement to planning to kill himself on two occasions prior to coming forward to the police.' Mr Stimpson said the victim, now 54, had said: 'All my life I have felt dirty and not a real man. I now look back at things I have done and still do. 'I constantly shower, sometimes even twice a day,' he said, something the court heard his wife had also noticed. Deal originally denied the charges, but pleaded guilty to seven of an original 17 charges in October last year. In a statement issued through his lawyers, Deal’s victim said today: 'I am relieved that I have finally been able to face the events of the past and that my tormentor is to be punished by the court for his crimes. 'My fear, though, is that other boys were abused by this man and, if they were, I would urge them to do as I have done and to contact the police and seek legal advice.' Molly Whittall, abuse case specialist solicitor from law firm Pannone, confirmed they are advising him on a possible civil action against East Ham Boxing Club, which has since moved from the area. She said: 'It is by no means uncommon for the memories of abuse to be suppressed for many years until something acts as a trigger to reawaken them. 'In this case it was the brave admission of a former sportsman, Brian Moore, that brought back past events, possibly striking a chord with our client because he was himself a keen sportsman in his youth and was at one time on the books of a Premier League football club. 'We are currently attempting to trace where the club moved to, what its new name is or who the club merged with. 'I would be grateful if anyone with any information could contact me here at Pannone on 0161 909 4606.'","Peter Deal started abusing the boy, then aged 10, at East Ham Boxing Club .

As survivors and victims' families are forced to relive the grisly details of the night James Holmes allegedly went on a gun rampage at a Colorado movie theater, one woman sits quietly, taking notes. Misty Benjamin is unlike any other at the trial - the 30-year-old sits in the overflow section of the  Arapahoe County courthouse in support of the man who is accused of shooting dead 12 people and injuring 70 more. Benjamin has even dyed her hair a shocking red in support of Holmes, of whom she says: 'I don’t think he is a bad guy. What he did was bad.' Besotted: Misty Benjamin, 30, has been attending pre-trial hearings in support of suspected Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes . Supporter: Benjamin, 30, said that she does not believe that Holmes is a bad guy but 'what he did was bad' The University of Phoenix graduate said that she made the decision to dye her hair so that 25-year-old Holmes would know that he had her support. She added: 'Tons of people are hating me because I’m deciding to be compassionate and show compassion for a person that committed a horrendous crime.' Benjamin lives in the town of Aurora which was changed forever on July 20 last year when a gunman entered a midnight showing of the Dark Knight Rises and sprayed bullets into the audience. Over three emotional days of pre-trial hearings, a succession of police and federal agents testified that Holmes spent weeks amassing guns and ammunition, concocted explosives to booby-trap his apartment and scouted the movie theater where he would allegedly unleash a horrific attack on hundreds of terrified people. On Wednesday, prosecutor Karen Pearson showed a series of photos that investigators said Holmes took of himself hours before the massacre. Deranged: James Holmes, 25, will face trial for the murder of 12 people and injuring 70 others in a Colorado movie theater last July . In one, he glares through black contact lenses, sticking out his tongue, as two locks of his orange-dyed hair curl out on either side of his head like horns. Despite the horrifying details, Misty Benjamin told the Daily Beast: 'When they showed photos of him, everything I saw were cries for help. She added: 'When I first saw him, I was physically attracted to him. I thought, oh crap. I think he is cute.' Benjamin, who joined the Church of Latter Day Saints in 2004 when her dentist committed suicide, admits that she keeps pictures of Holmes in her wallet and writes messages for him in the yellow notebook she carries to court. She also wears a plastic bracelet to court inscribed with the word 'besties' - her best friend in Michigan has the same. The pair met through a 'James Holmes is Innocent' Facebook group. For the women are not alone - Holmes has developed a bizarre fan base who call themselves 'Holmies', revere plaid clothing and Slurpees - which the suspected killer once mentioned a liking for. On Facebook, thousands of people have joined fan pages for Holmes where court sketches, memes and messages of support are written. Tumblr accounts have also been created, encouraging Holmes supporters to write to him in prison to 'let him know you care'. Misty, however, is keen to distance herself from these 'groupies', saying that she doesn't believe Holmes is innocent, just that he is in need of support as a human being. Without emotion: Holmes is pictured in a court sketch from the last day of his pre-trial hearing . Joker: One of James Holmes' self-taken photos is pictured in a court sketch from the third day of his pre-trial hearing in Centennial, Colorado . A judge ruled late on Thursday that there’s enough evidence for Holmes to face trial for the murdered 12 people and 70 injured. Judge William Sylvester said prosecutors have established probable cause to proceed with 166 felony counts, including murder and attempted murder. Holmes is due to be arraigned on Friday, but his defense attorneys filed papers on Thursday afternoon saying he’s not ready to enter a plea. They are likely to appear in court on Friday to ask for the arraignment to be delayed. Defense attorneys did not explain why they are not ready for arraignment. Their filing also objected to media requests to bring cameras into the courtroom. Other than during his brief initial appearance in July, cameras have been barred from court during Holmes’ case. Ordeal: Crowds of family members and survivors enter the court room this week in Centenneial, Colorado for the pre-trial hearing of James Holmes . Sylvester’s ruling came after a . three-day hearing earlier this week, in which prosecutors laid out their . case against Holmes, 25. The officers also described a hellish . scene inside the theater on July 20, when 12 people were shot to death . before their families and friends’ eyes and scores of others were . wounded amid a din of gunshots, screams and the blaring soundtrack of . the latest Batman movie. Holmes’ lawyers called no witnesses . and cross-examined only a few of those summoned by prosecutors during . the hearing. But they pointedly raised the issue of Holmes’ sanity at . strategic moments, possibly foreshadowing a defense that some believe is . his best hope to avoid the death penalty. 'You’re aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?' defense attorney Daniel King asked one witness. The . preliminary hearing, which ended Wednesday, was designed to determine . whether prosecutors’ case is strong enough to put Holmes on trial. Holmes’ lawyers haven’t said if he will plead not guilty by reason of insanity, . but since his arrest outside the theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora . immediately after the shootings, they have portrayed him as a man with . serious mental problems prone to bizarre behavior. Many legal analysts have said they expect the case to end with a plea bargain rather than a trial. Tom . Teves, whose son Alex was among the dead, said he would rather see . Holmes plead guilty to first-degree murder, avoiding a traumatic trial, . bringing a life sentence and closing the door to an insanity defense. Trauma: The scene outside the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado after a mass shooting last July 20 which left 12 people dead . Details: There was a thermos full of glycerin leaning over a skillet full of another chemical. Flames and sparks are created when they mix, and a trip wire linked the thermos to the door . If found not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes could conceivably be released someday if he is deemed to have recovered. 'Don’t pretend he’s crazy,' Mr Teves said Wednesday. 'He’s not crazy. He’s no more crazy than you and I.' Prosecutors developed twin themes at the hearing: the horror and devastation of the attack, and a weeks' long process in which they alleged Holmes planned and prepared for the assault. Two officers were overcome by emotion when they testified about the chaos in the theater and the race to get victims to hospitals by police cars until ambulances could arrive. Other testimony included the names and injuries of the victims, read out one by one. Prosecution witnesses also testified that Holmes started assembling an arsenal in early May and by July 6 had two semi-automatic pistols, a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle, 6,200 rounds of ammunition and high-capacity magazines that allow a shooter to fire more rounds without stopping to reload. In late June he began equipping himself with a helmet, gas mask and body armor, the witnesses said. In early July, they testified, he began buying fuses, gunpowder, chemicals and electronics to booby-trap his apartment in hopes of triggering an explosion and fire to divert police from the theater. The bombs never went off. Also in early July, he took some interior and exterior photos of the theater, witnesses said. 'He picked the perfect venue for this crime,' prosecutor Karen Pearson said. Caren Teves, mother of Alex and wife of Tom Teves, said she saw Holmes smile when his self-portraits were shown in court. 'He just sat in the courtroom pretty much delighted. He was smiling. He was smirking,' she said .","Misty Benjamin, 30, lives in the town of Aurora where shooting took place .

Adrian Rose, 36, made contact with the girl and arranged to meet up with her before having sex . A Royal Military Police sergeant who had sex with a 12-year-old girl after befriending her on his mobile phone is facing prison. Adrian Rose found the girl through the BlackBerry Messenger network popular with youngsters, posed as a 19-year-old, and then drove to her home city of Norwich to have sex with her. The 36-year-old, of Aldershot, Hampshire, arranged to meet up with her and drove up from his barracks to have sex with her. The army sergeant denied seven counts of rape, six charges of abducting the girl and meeting a child following sexual grooming. The trial heard how the relationship was discovered when police saw Rose with the girl in a parked car at a Norwich business park last February. Prosecutor Clare Matthews told the jury that officers noticed the girl's trousers were unzipped and there were condoms in the car. When challenged, Rose told police: 'As if I would do anything with a 16-year-old'. Police took the girl home and found that her mother was completely unaware she had met up with Rose and thought she had been with friends her own age . Rose's DNA was later found on the girl's bra. Miss Matthews said the girl admitted to police that she had sex with Rose on several occasions including a hotel after meeting him through BlackBerry messaging. Police discovered the pair in a parked car in Broadland Business Park with the girl' trousers unzipped . She said he told her he was 19 and paid her compliments and made her feel special. The girl added that Rose 'made it all sound cool'. Rose denied having sex with the girl or knowing that she was 12. In a statement he said he was shocked to be arrested and was unaware of her age. But the prosecution claimed he did know her real age and that she was at school . BlackBerry Messenger allows instant messaging between BlackBerry users by using a unique PIN for their devices. Messages are sent over the internet, and can be sent to just one person or through chat groups. People can swap PIN numbers so that they can message each other. There is no charge, it is similar to sending emails. The service was blamed for allowing rioters to communicate with each other and co-ordinate groups during the UK riots in 2011 . A jury took less than two hours to find him guilty of all the charges at Norwich Crown Court. He is due to be sentenced on February 1 after reports. Rose was charged with rape as the girl was unable to give consent due to her age. He faced abduction charges as he did not have the permission of her parent or guardian to take her away. Judge Stephen Holt commended the two officers who discovered Rose with the girl for a 'brilliant piece of good old fashioned policing'. He said their actions had potentially prevented more children from being 'damaged' by Rose. Detective Constable Steve Graves of Norfolk Police said: 'The victim in this case is a very shattered young girl, but she is determined to get on with her life. 'Rose is a predator who has denied his actions throughout, which meant the girl had to relive the traumatic events which have happened to her in order to bring him to justice.'","Adrian Rose posed as a 19-year-old after finding the girl on the BlackBerry Messenger network .

Prosecutors in the murder trial of Jodi Arias have displayed a grisly photograph they say was accidentally taken as she dragged her ex-lover's body through his home after stabbing him 27 times. The dark image apparently depicts the back of Travis Alexander's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck. A large dark obstruction in the foreground of the picture is a leg in sweatpants, the jury in Phoenix heard. The prosecution alleges the picture was taken as Arias, who they say flew into a rage after learning her ex-boyfriend wanted to date someone else, dragged Alexander's body through his Mesa, Arizona home. The image was apparently snapped as a camera was dropped. Scroll down for video . Caught: An image apparently shows the back of Travis Alexander's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck. A leg in the foreground obstructs most of the image . They claim Arias repeatedly stabbed . Alexander in his shower before dragging him to his bedroom and slicing . his throat. She then allegedly took him back to the bathroom to shoot . him in the head. Two friends found his body in the shower on June 9, 2008, five days after he was killed. Yet the defense says the trickling blood in the image is from Arias shooting Alexander in the head in self defense, HLN reported. The prosecution alleges he was already dead when this wound was inflicted. Investigators found the grisly image on Alexander's camera, which had been thrown in the washing machine and put through a washing cycle with blood-soaked towels and clothes after his murder. In court: Arias' murder trial, pictured Wednesday, is underway in Maricopa County Superior court in Phoenix . 'Obsessed': Arias, 32, stabbed Travis Alexander, pictured, 27 times and shot him in the head . It is just one of many photographs . shown by prosecutors in the murder trial of the 32-year-old photographer . accused of killing her one-time boyfriend, a Mormon motivational . speaker. In the opening days of the trial last . week, the jury also saw blood-splattered scenes inside his home, as well . as blood stains in his bedroom carpet. They were also shown images of his horrifying wounds, including defensive wounds across his hands, and a neck wound so deep as she sliced his neck that it hit the bone. Arias wiped away tears as the . Maricopa County . medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she . shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death . penalty. If . she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a . 'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona. Mess: Prosecutors said it appeared as if someone had tried to wipe the blood away after the murder . Blood-soaked: Another image shows blood stains on the carpet near his bathroom in his bedroom . Blood soaked: Another image shows pools of blood. Some has been soaked up into a box in the closet . Yet the medical examiner said he could . not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the . body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the . killing. With the delicate brain tissue also . decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or . how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander . was still alive. While at first denying that she had even . seen him that day, Arias now admits to killing him but says she did so in self . defense after he had been abusive and possessive throughout their . relationship. Other images . on the camera show the pair, whom had kept up a sexual relationship . since breaking up after five months of dating in 2007, in sexually . explicit poses on the day of his murder. On Thursday, the prosecution attempted . to paint Arias as a serial liar by playing segments of interviews with . police and on Inside Edition where she protested her innocence. Scene: A pool of blood is seen in the bedroom; the prosecution is alleging this is where she slit his throat . Evidence: Another image apparently shows marks along the wall where Alexander's body was dragged . In the program, she claims she saw two men attack him, adding: 'No jury will convict me. Mark my words.' The portrayal builds on that suggested on Wednesday when another former flame, Ryan Burns, revealed Arias had lied about cuts to her hands when she arrived at his home 24 hours later. Burns testified on Wednesday that he had exchanged long emails and . phone calls with Arias after they met at a business conference in the spring of 2008. He invited her to his home in West . Jordan, Utah in June 2008 - and she arrived a day later than planned, . telling Burns she had got lost, driven the wrong way and slept in her . car for a while, he said. In fact, she had spent the previous day with Alexander, eventually murdering him out of 'self defense', she claims. New love: On Wednesday, Ryan Burns, left, . testified that Arias visited him at his Utah home 24 hours after she . killed Alexander - but she never mentioned the killing, despite claiming . it was out of self defense . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . Yet . when she visited Burns the day after the murder, she never once . mentioned the ordeal she had supposedly been through the previous day, . he said in court. They kissed and joked, he said. When she arrived at his home, Burns noticed that she had bandaged hands, but she told him she had sustained the cuts after breaking a glass at her job at a Margaritaville, he said. But Det. Nathan Mendes, who worked at the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office, said there was no Margaritaville in the county where she lived with her grandparents at the time. Burns added that he did not know Arias was still seeing Alexander when the two began talking and making plans to visit each other, ABC News reported. Prosecutors also exposed other lies . told by Arias after playing interviews with Mesa detective Esteban . Flores in which she said she last talked to Alexander on Tuesday night, . June 3, 2008. 'Last photo': Among the images on the camera was this one showing Travis in the shower before his death . Possessive: The jury was shown a picture of Arias in a t-shirt Alexander made reading 'Travis Alexander's' She claimed she had been in Los Angeles and was about to go to Utah. 'It was brief though, . 10 o'clock maybe,' she said. 'I'd say 10 p.m. or 9 - 9:30. I was calling people . because I was bored on the road. He was nice and cordial, but kind of . acting like he had hurt feelings. 'I may have called . him Wednesday, from the road, and I sent him a couple of text messages, . and a couple of pictures,"" she said, though Alexander didn't pick up because he had a full voice mailbox. 'That's unusual. He deletes all of his . messages. I didn't want to be obsessive about it because we're not . together anymore and I didn't like to call too much.' She added that she was shocked to learn of Alexander's death from one of his friends, and thought it must be a mistake. Suspect: Travis Alexander's friend and roommate who found his body in June 2008 told a 911 dispatcher that Jodi Arias had been stalking and threatening the man . Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days. Arias originally claimed she had not . seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two . men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense. The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be . baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.

The uninsured driver, who has never had a licence, refused to stop because he thought he would fail a breath test. Curt Lodge, posing outside court, walks free despite driving without insurance or a licence in a police chase while smoking cannabis . Police tried and failed to stop his . BMW with a stinger twice and was eventually stopped when he jumped out . of the car at a petrol station in Gloucester and tried to escape on . foot. However, when he was . breathalysed he was found to be under the drink drive limit but admitted . he was smoking cannabis during the chase. After walking free from court, Lodge admitted he was 'a lucky boy' Lodge . was spared an immediate jail sentence at Gloucester Crown Court. Recorder David Bartlett said he 'agonised' over the decision but said . Lodge needed help to reform. Outside court, Lodge said: 'I'm a lucky boy' after being given a ten month jail term, suspended for 18 months. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy told the court Lodge lost control at a roundabout in Cheltenham in June last year, sparking the chase. She said: 'It went onto the roundabout and crashed into a signal post. It then made off.' He . then refused to stop for police and instead went on a ten mile drive . hitting kerbs, running red lights and driving the wrong way down the . dual carriageway. Andrew Hobson, defending, said: 'This was an impulsive and stupid act when he knew the police were following him. 'He tells me he got a buzz out of it. Those are his words. 'He has an entrenched propensity to act stupidly and not to think through the consequences of his actions.' Car obsessed Lodge admitted driving dangerously, failing to stop for police, having no insurance and having no licence. Police twice tried to stop Lodge during the ten-mile chase using a stinger but failed . Recorder Bartlett told him: 'When I . came into court I thought I would have to pass a prison sentence you . would serve immediately. 'You have breached community orders, bail, and driving orders. 'But your solicitor has made the telling point that people with your history of bad driving and bad criminal behaviour don't reform overnight. 'They need a lot of help and encouragement and they get that from the probation service - long may it remain so. 'In the circumstances, having agonised about this - and I don't think anyone could criticise me for giving you a ten months sentence to serve straightaway - I am going to suspend it.' He added: 'I am not all that confident that you are going to make it work but I hope so.' Lodge, who posed for photographers outside court, was also banned from driving for three years, ordered to do 60 hours unpaid work and attend a 22-day 'thinking skills' programme.

Hundreds of mourners turned out to pay tribute today to Gerry Anderson, beloved creator of television shows such as Thunderbirds. The visionary puppeteer, who also created Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and Stingray, died last month at the age of 83. His funeral was full of references to his most famous work, as the congregation heard the Thunderbirds theme tune and saw the original puppets from Mr Anderson's shows. Hero: The replica car was a two-year labour of love for Mr Jarvis, a huge fan of Thunderbirds . Farewell: Hundreds gathered on Friday for the funeral of Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson . Coffin: Mr Anderson's hearse contained a flower display in the shape of Thunderbird 2 . A flower arrangement of Thunderbird 2, the iconic green aeroplane, sat on top of his coffin as it arrived at Reading Crematorium in a black hearse. The hearse was accompanied by a replica of FAB1, the pink car belonging to the show's Lady Penelope, and a flower display spelling out the word 'FAB'. Mr Anderson, who lived in nearby Henley-on-Thames with his third wife Mary, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease around two years before he died. His youngest son, Jamie, delivered a touching eulogy at the humanist service. 'My dad made a huge impact on the lives of millions and left a phenomenal legacy behind him,' he said. Ceremony: The TV legend was laid to rest during a humanist ceremony at Reading Crematorium . Relatives: Mr Anderson's son Jamie, left, and wife Mary, right, were among the 300 mourners at his funeral . Tribute: Shane Rimmer, who voiced Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds, delivered a eulogy to Mr Anderson . He added that his father's dignified response to his Alzheimer's diagnosis - including raising £1million for the Alzheimer's Society by taking part in a 'memory walk' last year - gave him more pride than his TV career. 'Dad decided to speak out about his condition despite the social stigma and the debilitating effects of the disease,' Jamie said. 'Beyond all of his achievements in television and film, I feel most proud of him for making this incredibly brave decision and the manner in which he threw himself into being an ambassador for the society despite his worsening condition.' Actor Shane Rimmer, who voiced the character of Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds, offered a glowing tribute to Mr Anderson's 'groundbreaking energy and vision'. He said: 'Gerry was an exceptional man - not only to those who began the studio work with him, and they were all terribly talented and so easy to work with - but also to the hundreds of thousands of young, and maybe a little older, viewers who watched that magic flow across television screens all over the world.'

Procession: The funeral party arriving at the crematorium for the humanist service on Friday . Broadway producer John Gore, the man behind the Thunderbirds stage show, said: 'The legacy of Gerry is going to continue in a way that is going to go on for generations.' Nick Williams, chairman of official Gerry Anderson society Fanderson, said: 'To those who met him, Gerry was a quiet, unassuming but determined man. 'His desire to make the best films he could drove him and his talented teams to innovate, take risks and do everything necessary to produce quite inspirational works. 'Gerry's legacy is that he inspired so many people and continues to bring so much joy to so many millions of people around the world.' He added: 'Gerry's unique style of film-making influenced the imaginations and careers of countless creatives who succeeded him and his productions continue to be shown around the world to new generations of fans.' Iconic: The Thunderbird 2 aircraft is one of Mr Anderson's most recognisable creations . Slogan: As well as the aircraft, one floral tribute spelled out 'FAB', another reference to the show . The Thunderbirds March, performed by the Band of the Royal Marines, played moments before the 300 mourners filed out following the 45-minute service. Outside the chapel stood a full-size replica - complete with an extendable rocket - of FAB1, the pink Rolls Royce belonging to Lady Penelope. Owner Melvin Jarvis said he had driven the car, which he built himself, down from his Leicester home out of respect for his hero. 'Ever since being a child I remember watching Thunderbirds and saying, ""I'll have one of those one day,"" and it's never left me,' he said.

Filmmaker Tyler Perry is offering a $100,000 reward for information in the decade-old case of two men who went missing after crossing paths with a sheriff's deputy in southwestern Florida. Perry joined the Rev Al Sharpton and NAACP president and CEO Ben Jealous at a news conference on Thursday in Naples to discuss the missing-person investigations of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos. Santos and Williams disappeared three months apart in the Naples area in 2003 after crossing paths with Collier County Sheriff's Deputy Steven Calkins. Mystery: Filmmaker Tyler Perry, left, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, center, look on as an unidentified man comes forward during a news conference to discuss the missing person investigations of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos . Missing: Felipe Santos, left, has not been seen since he was arrested by Steven Calkin in October 2003. Terrance Williams, right, disappeared under similar circumstances in January 2004 . Secrets: Santos and Williams disappeared three months apart in the Naples area in 2003 after crossing paths with Collier County Sheriff's Deputy Steven Calkins, pictured . He was never charged but was fired the next year. Perry said the media was not paying enough attention to missing-person cases involving minorities. Williams was black and Santos was an illegal immigrant from Mexico. When he announced the reward, a man stepped from the front of the crowd to tell Perry something, indicating he had information to offer. 'Wow. I have been praying for an answer for this family and I wasn't expecting this moment,' Perry said after the encounter. 'I am beyond overwhelmed by it. And just like this man has come forward, I am sure there are others. You do not have to be afraid. The sheriff here has assured me that he will be safe and anyone else that wants to say anything or speak out about this will be safe.' Sharpton said Perry called him to admonish him and others about the cases. Donation for a cause: Perry is offering a $100,000 reward for any information in Santos and Williams[' disappearance . Mom: Marcia Roberts, the mother of Terrance Williams, speaks at a news conference to discuss the special missing-person investigations . 'Why aren't you civil rights leaders dealing with cases of missing people?' Sharpton said Perry asked him. 'And he began telling me the story of Terrance Williams, saying if we fight for what's right, how do we forget about people who just disappeared? And I felt guilty, because he's right. All of us have not done all we should.' Investigations by local, state and federal authorities went nowhere. Calkins, who is white, denied doing anything more than dropping off the young men at different convenience stores. He was never charged but was fired after he stopped cooperating with investigators. Santos, who did farm work and construction, was 23 when he vanished in October 2003. He had been driving with his brothers to work when he got into a fender bender. He didn't have registration or insurance, and Calkins arrested him, put him in the back of his patrol car and drove away. Pain: The Rev Al Sharpton consoles an unidentified man who came forward at a news conference to discuss the case . When his brothers went to the jail to bail him out, he wasn't there. Later, Calkins told investigators that because Santos was so cooperative, he decided not to arrest him and dropped him off. Williams was 27 and had moved to Naples from Tennessee to be closer to his mother after trouble with the police. His white Cadillac broke down in January 2004. Calkins spotted it and called in to the Collier County Sheriff's Office to run the vehicle number and have the car towed. In the recorded conversation, Calkins and the dispatcher both talked in exaggerated black dialect. Later, Calkins told investigators that Williams asked him for a ride to a store and he let him off there. Police reports said Williams was last spotted by witnesses near a cemetery. Don Hunter, the Collier County sheriff at the time, said Calkins' patrol car was tested for blood and signs of a struggle, but nothing was found.

A phone number listed for Calkins was not in service. 'I think in this community, people are afraid to speak up,' Marcia Williams said after the news conference. 'They don't want to get involved.' Williams said she has shown news reports of her son's disappearance to his four children. The youngest, a 12-year-old, told her: 'Now I understand,' the youngest said to her. A brother and friend of Santos attended the event but declined comment. Both cases remain open and active, current Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk said. 'We have vetted all tips received thus far and continue to monitor and update national databases,' he said.

Cruel: Callous Rob Davey, left, shaved the prized pet Shih Tzu dog belonging to his former girlfriend Zoe Ashman, right, and then boasted of his crime on Facebook . However, despite his court punishment the . remorseless lout today taunted Miss Ashman when he updated his Facebook status . to read: 'Coming soon to stores near you after shave by rob davey ""hair . of the dog"".' He then added: 'Also coming soon rob's dog grooming service', as well as adding a post which appeared to reference his court appearance hitting the headlines and read 'Fame ay? So easy to come by'.

Bragging: Rob Davey boasted of shaving Shih Tzu Franklin just days after he was sentenced for the cruel crime . Joking: Davey also appeared to joke about how his court appearance had hit the headlines on his Facebook page . Friends told how she had eventually . dumped Davey because of his wild, loutish behaviour - which they said . was often linked to him drinking too much. They also said that Miss Ashman, who owns six dogs which she grooms for competitions, had been devastated by the attack which had ruined her dreams of rearing a grand champion. Terry Fryatt, 24, said: 'She rang me crying saying he had cut the dog. 'She was really upset.' 'They broke up because they were always arguing. 'You know it's an argumentative relationship when the police are coming round on a weekly basis. 'There must be otherwise ways to go about it, rather than shaving her dog.'

Devastated: Miss Ashman's friends said that Davey's actions had dashed her dreams of rearing a Crufts champion . A 62-year-old grandmother, who lives close to Miss Ashman's home also criticised Davey's callous behaviour towards his former partner and her beloved pet. 'It's terrible,' she said. No animal deserves to be treated like that. 'He has to learn to control his temper. Bragging about what he has done is just wrong.' Happier times: Zoe Ashman cuddles up to Rob Davey before they separated. Neighbours said that the pair had often argued . Davey was sentenced at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Tuesday after he admitted damaging a dog by cutting its fur to the value unknown without lawful excuse. The court heard that the separated couple had met up at Miss Ashman's house on the evening of December 5. Davey contacted Zoe the next day and she told him that she had gone to work. However, angry Davey, who was still at her house, did not believe her and in revenge for her 'lying' used clippers and scissors to cut the fur off her tiny dog. Lout: Davey was sentenced to a 12-month community order and told that he must pay £2,000 in compensation by magistrates in Stevenage . Davey, also of Hertford, was aware that Miss Ashman had been hoping to enter the dog into the famous Crufts dog show. He then scrawled the word 'liar' across the walls of Miss Ashman's house. The court heard that Davey already had a history of convictions relating to motor crime, criminal damage, alcoholism and drugs. Davey, who was representing himself, told the court: 'I'm deeply apologetic. 'This is not something I make a habit of doing. 'Most of my convictions are down to alcoholism. 'I'm a nice person, believe it or not.'","Cruel Rob Davey, 26, poked fun at court sentence with bragging status update .

Originally, 303 men were sentenced to be hanged, but President Abraham Lincoln granted all but 38 a reprieve. Some Native Americans believe he was wrong to order any hangings, however, and that several of the men were . innocent of wrongdoing. The names of those killed have now been inscribed on the new Reconciliation Park monument, along with a poem and a prayer.

Sidney Byrd, a Dakota/Lakota elder . from Flandreau, S.D., read out the names of the . 38 men who were hanged in the native Dakota language, according to The Free Press of Mankato.

Families left behind: Some Native Americans believe Lincoln was wrong to order any hangings at all, and that several of those found guilty were innocent of all wrongdoing . Past and future: The Dakota 38 are now remembered every December during the ceremony. Mankato Mayor Eric Anderson yesterday declared this the year of 'forgiveness and understanding' The 'Dakota 38' were executed at the end of the US-Dakota war (pictured right), which took place along the Minnesota River in the autumn of 1862. The native Dakota people had ceded 24million acres of land in Minnesota to the US government in one of the most significant Indian treaties in history, signed in 1851. Such treaties were instrumental in opening the American west to European settlement. In exchange, they were promised reservation lands and $3,075,000, to be paid over a 50-year period in annual annuities of goods and money. This came to about 12 cents an acre for some of the richest agricultural land in the country. The treaties were later amended to weaken the position of the 7,000 Dakota, who were left with just two reservations, each 20 miles wide and about 70 miles long, . Delayed and skipped payments drove the Native Americans to increasing desperation. In 1862, the Indians seized an opportunity, with most able-bodied US men away fighting the Civil War, and very nearly succeeded. Before the US-Dakota Conflict  (or Sioux Uprising, as it is often called) could be brought under control, at least . 450 white settlers and soldiers were killed and considerable property . was destroyed in southern Minnesota. There were uncounted numbers of Dakota . casualties because of the Indian custom of removing all dead and dying . warriors from the battlefield. The conflict launched a series of Indian wars on the northern plains that did not end until 1890. A five-man military commission was appointed to try the Dakota who had participated in the outbreak. The commission settled up to 40 cases in a single day. Some were heard in as little as five minutes. In all, the commission tried 392 prisoners, sentenced 307 to death and gave 16 prison terms. President Abraham Lincoln heard there had been injustices and was urged to show compassion by Episcopalian Bishop Henry Whipple. Lincoln reviewed the cases and then wrote a letter to Minnesota Gov. Alexander Ramsey, listing 39 men who should be hanged, including one who was later given a reprieve. Those who were spared were sent from a prison in Mankato to one in Davenport, Iowa, where many died from squalid conditions. Some Native Americans believe Lincoln was wrong to order any hangings at all, and that several of those found guilty were innocent of all wrongdoing. A further 1,600 Dakota were held at a . camp at Fort Snelling until being sent out of Minnesota, and virtually . all others fled the state. After the war, Minnesota's second governor, Ramsey, said the Dakota should be exterminated or driven from the state. This August, Gov. Mark Dayton marked the 150th anniversary of the start of the war by asking Minnesotans to 'remember the dark past' and by repudiating Ramsey's comments.","Around 500 paid tribute to those hanged in Mankato, Minnesota, in 1862 .

A student was fighting for his life tonight after overdosing on illegal hallucinogenic drugs bought on the internet. Police said he was taken to hospital with five others early today having taken 2CB, which is similar to ecstasy. The group of students, some from Newcastle University, were found at 3am when police raided a house in Jesmond, a suburb of Newcastle. Raid: Raid: Police are investigating after six students were rushed to hospital after taking the illegal hallucinogenic drug 2CB . The six men – aged between . 19 and 22 – are at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, with the most . seriously affected student described as ‘critical but stable’. Some eight people were at the house . when officers arrived and neighbours said they heard revellers coming . and going into the early hours. It appears there may have been a party at . the terraced house in Ripon Gardens, a street popular with students at . the elite university. Bev Faulder, a teaching assistant, . said: ‘I heard them running around, shouting and carrying on. We’ve had a . lot of trouble with noise at night but they are a lovely bunch of lads . when you see them during the day and I hope they’re all right.’ A total of eight people were at the property when officers arrived at about 3am during an apparent party at the house . Another, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn’t sleep last night because there was a lot of noise. At around 2am I heard some taxis coming and going. There was a lot of boys’ banter.’ In November last year, the government banned mexxy and black mamba and made class B drugs. Mexxy, which is sold as an . alternative to ketamine was linked to two deaths and police have warned . of the 'life-threatening effects' of black mamba. A record 57 new legal highs were detected last year alone. An European Union report said it had found that more than one new psychoactive drug went on the market every week. Drug experts say while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs. A third added: ‘I thought they were that sort of thing because there were often strange smells coming from the house.’ 2CB is a Class A drug which often comes in purple capsules and is an hallucinogen related to ecstasy popular in Europe. It is also sold as white powder or small pills and is particularly dangerous when mixed with other substances. On the street, it is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox or Cloud Nine. A team of ten police officers were seen searching the house and appeared to be looking in the drains. A . Northumbria police spokesperson said: ‘At this stage police believe . they have taken an hallucinogenic drug called 2CB which at this stage is . believed has been bought over the internet. ‘The exact reason for hospitalisation . is unclear at present and could be due to a suspected overdose or mixing . the drug with another substance, or a bad reaction.’ Neighbours said they had heard revellers coming and going from the house into the early hours .

An international surf firm has come to the rescue of a featherless penguin by creating him a designer wetsuit. Bald humboldt penguin Ralph, 14, was at risk of sunburn after all his body feathers fell out in just one day - rather than the usual few weeks of moulting. With nothing to protect him from the weather, the two-foot-tall bird faced a depressing three weeks indoors as he waited for them to grow back. Custom fit: International surf firm O'Neill came to the rescue by making Ralph his own wetsuit . Unusual: Ralph lost all his feathers in a single day instead of the usual few weeks, leaving him at risk . Great outdoors: Instead of a miserable three weeks indoors, Ralph is splashing around thanks to his wetsuit . It would have meant staying away from his friends, partner, and young chicks at Marwell Wildlife, near Winchester, Hants. But California-based O'Neill has given Ralph a sponsorship deal - usually reserved for international surf and snowboarding stars. The firm has made a warm and protective wetsuit that offers a snug custom-measured fit and includes holes for his head and wings. Ralph is now swimming, eating, and playing with the other penguins as usual. The rubber wetsuit is extremely flexible and does not restrict his movement. It even has his name on the back in large white print. It was made from the leg of a suit donated by a member of park staff, but three years of swimming and grooming took its toll, leaving it 'tatty', freyed at the edges and coming apart at the seams. 'The warm and protective wetsuit offers a snug custom-measured fit and includes holes for his wings' Show off: Ralph is the envy of his fellow humboldt penguins thanks to his new designer gear . Protection: Keepers had thought about covering Ralph in suncream but feared it would quickly come off . Special customer: The water-loving mammal has been given a sponsorship deal usually reserved for surf stars . His keepers put out an appeal for a new suit and were delighted when O'Neill heard of his plight and responded. Anna Ing, from Marwell Wildlife, said: 'Ralph was in desperate need of a new wetsuit as his old one was starting to fall apart. 'His wetsuits see a lot of activity with him constantly on the go, swimming, climbing rocks and preening. 'He certainly looks the part with his custom made O'Neill wetsuit. 'He has been preening his wetsuit just as he would if he had feathers and his partner Coral has joined in too.' Anna added: 'Ralph is a very healthy bird, but for some reason his feathers drop out very quickly, before the new feathers grow back in time. Comfortable: The 14-year-old penguin has been preening the wetsuit just as he would if he had feathers . Bite to eat: Marwell Wildlife keepers say Ralph is constantly on the go - swimming, climbing and preening . Watchful eye: Every year is different for Ralph, with keepers never sure when he will lose his feathers . 'Every year is different for Ralph and we can never be sure when he will lose his feathers but as soon as he starts looking bald we put the wetsuit on him. 'Ralph has had a wetsuit before so he is used to wearing them and acts just like any other penguin in the colony.' When penguins moult over a period of around three weeks every year their old feathers are replaced with a new, clean set.But Ralph has baffled keepers by losing all his feathers in just one day, leaving him strangely bald apart from his head. Keepers initially thought about covering the bird in suncream but reasoned it would quickly come off in the water. The suit has the added benefit of keeping him warm on cold nights. Visitors are already flocking in to his enclosure to see Ralph parading around in his special gear. Snug: The wetsuit has the added benefit of keeping Ralph warm during cold nights .

Generous gift: 'It was an absolute pleasure for us to provide Ralph with a new wetsuit' Steve Peters, from O'Neill, said: 'It was an absolute pleasure for us to provide Ralph with a new wetsuit. 'In celebration we would like to invite him onto the O'Neill team. After all, he is the ultimate coldwater specialist.' Humboldt penguins live along the coasts of Peru and Chile within the reaches of the Humboldt Current. It is a cold current of water running from the Antarctic to the equator, from which they take their name. Humboldt penguins are thought to be declining in number, possibly due to increasing water temperatures and reducing food supply. They can live up to 30 years in captivity.","The humboldt penguin moulted in one day instead of the usually few weeks .

When a pub landlord disappeared with a £30,000 Christmas fund raised by families just before the big day, it came close to ruining village festivities. But generous strangers restored local faith in the season of goodwill, by replacing the money within days. The savings club cash vanished along with Malcolm Levesconte, 59, who is thought to have fled the country and then jumped into the sea while on a ferry to France. More than 60 families had spent all year paying money into the 'thrift' fund at Levesconte's Royal Oak pub in Shrewton, Wiltshire. They were horrified when it disappeared, with many relying on the . annual pay-out to help with expenses in the run-up to Christmas. But the cash has now been replaced thanks to a rush of donations from kind-hearted members of the public - including one anonymous benefactor who gave £10,000. Victims of the theft launched an online appeal at 4pm last Thursday and by Monday at 10.30pm, they had raised their target of £29,000. Donations came in from all over the world, including South Africa, Australia and America. Carole Slater, chairperson of Shrewton Parish Council, said she was 'overwhelmed' with the public's generosity. She said: 'This has been truly humbling. The generosity of strangers at Christmas has been remarkable. 'People who don't know us, people who have never been to our village, logged on and sent money. It brings a tear to my eye.

Shocked: Ian West, right, Wiltshire councillor for Shrewton, was appalled when the fundraising scheme he helped set up was exploited by the pub landlord . 'Such a terrible event has brought people together - a real Christmas spirit that is making millions of people smile.' Pete Elston, the man behind the online campaign, added: 'It has been an astonishing team effort. This is far more than anyone expected. 'It has touched people's hearts in the week before Christmas. We can now give our neighbours the Christmas they had saved all year to pay for. It is astonishing.' Levesconte was last seen on December 9 and is believed to have boarded a ferry to France from Southampton. Relief: Incredibly, victims of the theft managed to raise their target within just four days - with one benefactor donating a huge £10,000 . Police say they are still hunting him in connection with the theft, but believe he may now be dead. Officers are working on the theory that Levesconte did not disembark from the ferry in St Malo, France. Det Sgt Mike Standing said: 'We continue to treat Malcolm Levesconte's disappearance as a missing person inquiry but at this stage we do have to accept there is a possibility that he did not make it to France and may have taken his own life by jumping into the sea from the ferry. 'I would like to appeal to anyone who has information to come and speak to us - his family are facing the terrible prospect that he may have committed suicide. 'It is therefore imperative that we hear from anyone if they have heard from Mr Levesconte.'","One kind-hearted anonymous benefactor gave the villagers £10,000 .

Ms Javell attacked Mr Wallin, a father-of-two, in the early hours of Midsummer's Eve, a major Scandinavian holiday, in June this year.

The couple had met earlier the same year and bought the house together shortly before Mr Wallin's murder on June 22. After the violent attack, Ms Javell went to the bathroom to wash the blood off the knife, and then used her mobile phone to photograph her partner’s dead body. The two pictures, taken at 02.50 and . 02.58 on the night of the murder, were later found on her phone. She . said she took the photos so the police would believe her story.

Ms Javell claims to have acted in self-defence but police found no evidence of struggle in the house and the coroner's report stated that Mr Wallin may have been asleep or had just woken up at the time of the attack. In a letter to Aftonbladet, Ms Javell claims she was ‘confused’ and that she ‘blacked out during a state of total delirium’. She describes the furious attack as ‘an unfortunate event I wish could be undone’ and indicates that she does not see herself as a murderer.

The son of assassinated Pakistan prime minister launched a political career with a fiery speech today - despite still being too young to stand as a candidate. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, 24, addressed thousands of cheering supporters on the fifth anniversary of his mother's assassination in southern Sindh province, beside the family mausoleum. His speech comes just months before national elections are due to be held. The minimum age for candidates is 25 so he cannot stand, but is likely to be a key asset for the ruling Pakistan People's Party. Rallying cry: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, left, addresses a crowd of thousands of Pakistan People's Party supporters on the fifth anniversary of his mother's death . Shocking story: Zardari, who has just finished studying at Oxford, is too young to stand in the elections - but his family history makes him an asset to the party . Fight on their hands: Zardari's father Asif Ali Zardari, right, rode a wave of sympathy to become president after his wife's death - but the ruling party is losing its hold . The party's popularity has plummeted since it took power nearly five years ago, as the country has struggled with a weak economy and bloody Taliban insurgency. Before dawn today, dozens of militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked two tribal police posts in Pakistan's northwest, killing two policemen, with a further 21 officers missing and presumed kidnapped. Zardari was made chairman of the party after his mother's death but has remained largely in the background until now while he completed his studies in Britain, at Oxford University. His father, President Asif Ali Zardari, also addressed the crowd in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh village today. 'I want to tell you that thanks to God he has completed his studies, but now is the time of his training,' he said. 'He has to study Pakistan, he has to learn from you and he has to work according to your thinking,' The Bhutto family has played a prominent role in Pakistani politics for much of the country's 65-year history. Not forgotten: Pakistani policemen stand guard on a roof at the site where former premier Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in 2007 . Born to lead: Zardari was made chairman of the party after the death of his mother, who twice served as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s . Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, founded the Pakistan People's Party and served as both the country's president and prime minister in the 1970s. He was eventually hanged in 1979 after General Zia ul-Haq seized power in a military coup. Benazir Bhutto twice served as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s but never completed a full term. Her governments were dismissed both times under the cloud of corruption allegations by presidents who were close to the country's powerful army. She was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on December 27, 2007, shortly after returning from self-imposed exile to participate in national elections. After her death, the Pakistan People's Party rode a wave of public sympathy to garner the most seats in the 2008 elections, and Asif Ali Zardari was elected president. But the popularity of both the party and the president has fallen significantly since then as the government has failed to address pressing problems, such as Pakistan's shortage of electricity and stuttering economy. Complex: Benazir Bhutto never completed a full term - her governments were twice dismissed under the cloud of corruption allegations by presidents who were close to the country's army . The government has also struggled in its fight against the Pakistani Taliban, who have killed thousands of people in attacks throughout the country. Rasul Bakhsh Rais, a political science professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said it was not a surprise that the Pakistan People's Party had unveiled Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in an attempt to boost its fortunes in the elections, which are expected by June at the latest. 'This is Pakistan and dynastic politics is the norm,' said Rais. 'Bilawal is perhaps the only card left in the chest of the Pakistan People's Party.' Both Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and his father sought to whip up the emotions of the crowd by shouting 'Long live Bhutto' and 'Bhutto is alive.' Supporters waved the red, black and green flag of the Pakistan People's Party and held pictures of Benazir Bhutto and her father. 'If you kill one Bhutto, one thousand more Bhuttos will emerge,' said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Shocking: Benazir Bhutto was killed just weeks after she returned to Pakistan after years in self-imposed exile to participate in the elections . He took a swipe at the judiciary, which has clashed with the current government, by asking why people arrested for suspected involvement in his mother's murder have yet to be convicted. But some critics have questioned why Zardari has not done more to push forward the investigation during more than four years as president. The president at the time of his mother's death, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, blamed the Pakistani Taliban for the attack, and five suspected militants are facing trial for alleged involvement in the killing. The Pakistani Taliban have denied the claims. A Pakistani court issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf last year over allegations he played a role in the attack, which he has denied. Arrest warrants were also issued for two senior police officials accused of negligence in the assassination. Prosecutors accused one of the officials of failing to provide proper security for Bhutto and the other of cleaning the crime scene before evidence could be collected. Rhetoric: Father and son tried to whip up the emotions of the crowd by shouting 'Long live Bhutto' and 'Bhutto is alive' A UN investigation into the assassination said it could have been prevented and blamed all levels of government for failing to provide adequate security. It also accused intelligence agencies and other officials of severely hampering the investigation into those behind her murder. The attack on the tribal police posts before dawn today took place in the town of Darra Adam Khel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, government officials said. The town is near Pakistan's tribal region, the main sanctuary for Taliban militants in the country. Security forces have launched an operation to try to recover the 21 missing policemen, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion will likely fall on the Pakistani Taliban.","Fifth anniversary of his mother's death in gun and suicide bomb attack .

Mr Morris, from South Shore, Blackpool, Lancashire, was walking his dog with two friends when he and another men both ended up in the water from the steps of the South Pier shortly after midnight. The second man was able to get to safety and raise the alarm. A search was carried out overnight by RNLI and Coastguard crews from Blackpool and Lytham St Annes, assisted by the Lancashire Police helicopter and the search and Prince William's rescue helicopter from RAF Valley on Anglesey. Mission: After 90 minutes of searching for the man, who had reportedly been thrown a lifebelt, the prince's helicopter was ordered to stand down . Several searches carried out since yesterday's tragedy have been unable to recover Mr Morris's body and no further searches are planned, Lancashire Police said today. A spokeswoman said: 'A man who was swept into the sea at Blackpool just after midnight on New Year's Day has been named as 41-year-old Paul Morris. from South Shore, Blackpool, previously from Barrow-in-Furness. 'Sadly, despite shoreline searches, his body has not yet been recovered from the water. 'There are no further searches planned.'

'The rescue helicopter from RAF Valley was also there providing lighting assistance for the search teams.

'We do believe a life ring was thrown to him and a football. We have located the football but not the life ring.' Mr Atkinson said the search operation was hampered last night due to very strong, westerly gale-force winds. Ready to help: During a 'readiness state' the Duke of Cambridge and his fellow crew members are never to be further than 60 seconds from their helicopter on RAF Valley, Anglesey . He said: 'As you can imagine, westerly winds are aimed straight at the sea shore at Blackpool and it made it quite difficult for the lifeboat crews to search.' The current search was focusing on an area of the Irish Sea around the South Pier and the Blackpool sea wall. A Lancashire Police spokeswoman said: 'The man and a friend were walking a dog along steps leading from the Promenade to the sea, close to the Central Pier on South Shore, when a wave washed them into the sea.'

Scam: Richard Lowery stole £56,000 from his great grandmother - who brought him up after he was abandoned by his parents . A 'son' who robbed the great-grandmother who brought him up of her £56,000 life savings has been jailed for 18 months. Richard Lowery, 24, was abandoned by his parents at the age of four and given a roof over his head by Brenda Lowery, 91. He repaid her kindness by systematically dipping into her bank account over a seven-year period for living expenses and even to pay £575 in court fines, Sheffield Crown Court heard. His great-grandmother even wrote a letter to the court asking for leniency and hoping that her 24-year-old great-grandson would not be jailed. But Judge Michael Murphy told Lowery: 'I can understand her views because to her you must be like a son. She stepped up to the mark to care for you when you needed it and has been caring for you but there are some situations which transcend the wishes of victims. 'The courts have a duty to the public to mark the repugnance society feels at such conduct. This was a breach of a high degree of trust. It was a despicable course of conduct and it was exploitation not borne of desperation but borne out of sheer greed.' Only last week the same judge gave Jayne Godsmark, 41, an eight-month suspended jail term for stealing £6,000 from her ailing 98-year-old grandmother's life savings. Louise Gallagher, prosecuting, said Lowery, who was responsible for his great-grandmother's financial affairs, stole the cash from an account she had with the HSBC for 40 years. She loaned him her bank card and he was the only one who knew her PIN number and used it at cash machines to withdraw money directly from the account or simply wrote out cheques payable to himself. His thieving came to light after his great-grandmother took out an equity release policy on her home with insurance company Aviva and Lowery attempted to obtain £30,000 in three tranches over four months in 2011. The company called in the police and the discrepancies were discovered. Ironically, Lowery used to collect his great-grandmother's pension for her without taking any of it. When interviewed by police, Lowery said he became 'addicted' to taking the money and did not realise just how much he had stolen. Plea: Despite the theft, his great-grandmother Brenda begged the judge not to jail him, Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) heard . Lowery, of Beauchief, Sheffield admitted theft of £56,427 from December, 2005 to May, 2012. Vanessa Saxton, for Lowery, said she needed her great-grandson's help with managing her finances. He apologised for his behaviour but had not told anyone, even his own family, why he did it. 'His attitude has been one of putting his head in the sand, he is a very quiet individual,' said Miss Saxton. He had made frequent small cash withdrawals over a long period of time and was astonished when confronted with the total. 'Until now he seems to have led a perfectly respectable life and cared for his great-grandmother all his life,' said Miss Saxton. He still lived with Mrs Lowery but no longer had access to her bank account. Judge Murphy told Lowery he had used the account as a cash dispenser 'to dip into whenever you wanted.' In sentencing he had taken into account Lowery's guilty plea, his previous good character and the views of his great-grandmother which helped reduce the sentence he handed down. A proceeds of crime hearing is expected to take place later in the year to reimburse Mrs Lowery for her losses.","Richard Lowery was dumped by his parents aged 4, and great-grandmother Brenda stepped in .

Ian Watkins, lead singer of Lostprophets and ex boyfriend of Fearne Cotton, was refused bail today and remanded in custody after being accused of plotting to rape a child last year . The singer of top rock band Lostprophets was refused bail today and remanded in custody after being accused of plotting to rape a child. Frontman Ian Watkins, 35, is facing six child sex offences - including conspiring with a woman fan, 24, to rape a girl under the age of 13. The singer and two women are also accused of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child under 13. Watkins - a former boyfriend of TV presenter Fearne Cotton - spent Christmas in Parc Prison in Bridgend, South Wales, after being arrested in December last year. He yesterday appeared before Judge Eleri Rees in Cardiff Crown Crown Court via video link from the jail. In a short hearing his application for bail was rejected and he was remanded in custody ahead of a plea hearing later this month. Watkins, of Pontypridd, South Wales, is charged with conspiring to rape a girl under the age of 13 and to engage in sexual activity with a child under 13. He is also charged with three separate charges of possession, making and distribution of indecent images of children, and stands accused of possession of 'extreme pornography' - some involving animals. An earlier court heard 40 images of children and child abuse were being investigated by police. Two women - one aged 20 from Doncaster and the other 24 from Bedford - are also remanded in custody on similar conspiracy charges involving children. A statement from fellow band members posted a statement on their website in December said: 'Following charges made today against Ian Watkins, we find ourselves in a state of shock. We are learning about the details of the investigation along with you. 'It is a difficult time for us and our families, and we want to thank our fans for their support as we seek answers.' Rock: Ian Watkins (left), with band members Stuart Richardson and Jamie Oliver of at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Wales . Mr Watkins dated TV presenter Cotton for almost a year in 2005 and in 2007 he was romantically linked to model Alexa Chung. Tattooed Watkins formed Lostprophets in 1997 with friends from the small former mining town of Pontypridd. They started playing gigs around South Wales and were eventually signed, releasing breakthrough single Shinobi vs Dragon Ninja in 2001. The band were at the forefront of the popular 'Nu Metal' sound and attracted thousands of fans. Debut album The Fake Sound of Progress achieved Platinum status selling more than 300,000 copies. The band began to make high profile appearances at UK music festivals and on TV shows and before long they were selling out large arenas. In 2004 they released second album Start Something which went Gold in America - with more than 500,000 copies bought. The band embarked on a world tour before recording Liberation Transmission, which was released in 2006. Lead single Rooftops got to eight in the UK charts - their joint best performance with Last Train Home.

Ashley Jordan has been jailed for two years after police used the photo to help link him to the theft of the Saab as well as a BMW and £26,000 of goods stolen from a couple's home as they slept. The 22-year-old kept the incriminating images on a memory stick, which he desperately tried to flush down the toilet when police raided his home in Leeds. 'Arrogant': Ashley Jordan sitting behind the wheel of a Saab convertible he had just helped to steal . Jordan wept in Leeds Crown Court yesterday as he was sentenced to two years in prison for the thefts. The court heard that he was a member of gang who targeted a house in the suburb of Barwick-in-Elmet on March 19 last year. They removed the lock on the door and took the keys to a BMW and Saab convertible as the couple who lived there slept upstairs. The gang also stole cash, a 60-inch television and iPhones, with the total value of the goods adding up to £26,000. Caught: Police used this BMW's licence plate to link it to a burglary from a house in a suburb of Leeds . Police visited Jordan's house after he was seen trying to carry the giant TV inside. When they arrived, they found Jordan trying to discard a memory stick in the toilet, according to the prosecution, but officers managed to retrieve the data. Images on the stick showed Jordan posing with the two vehicles, which police were able to link back to the burglary thanks to the number plate on the BMW - which has not been recovered. Jordan told officers his friends had decided to carry out the burglary after they spent the evening in the pub. He claimed he did not take part in the raid, but admitted helping to move stolen items afterwards. Jordan pleaded guilty to burglary and two offences of theft. His lawyer said in court that he was ashamed of his actions, and no longer associated with the other members of the gang. After the sentencing, a police spokesman said: 'The incriminating images that led to Jordan being caught illustrate the arrogance and disregard for the victims that burglars like him have. 'They proved to be very useful in linking him to the crime and we are grateful to him for inadvertently providing such valuable evidence.'","Ashley Jordan sentenced to two years in prison for burglary and theft .

Anger: Stormont Justice Minister David Ford said today the attempted murder of a police officer in Belfast was an attack on all of Northern Ireland . A second viable pipe bomb-type device has been discovered near a police station in Northern Ireland. Elderly residents were evacuated from their homes in Tandragee, Co Armagh, but have been allowed to return as the security alert has ended. Army technical officers examined the object close to the gates of the town's Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station, a short distance south of Portadown. Newry and Armagh DUP Stormont assembly member William Irwin condemned those responsible. 'This is a very concerning incident especially in a rural town like Tandragee and it is especially concerning when so many residents, many of whom are elderly, have had to leave their homes whilst this suspect device is dealt with,' he said. 'No one in Tandragee wants this type of disruption and indeed considering the threat to our police officers remains so high at the moment, having devices left at police stations is extremely reckless and totally abhorrent. 'Young families also go for walks out the Armagh road and pass the station gates, which only adds to the risk this suspect device could have posed.' It comes after a booby trap device was discovered under an officer’s car in east Belfast. Police have said the unexploded but viable bomb, which was discovered by the off duty policeman on Sunday afternoon, was clearly intended to kill him. The constable was about to take his wife and two young children out for Sunday lunch yesterday when he checked under his car outside his house in the city and discovered a viable device. Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said: 'If that officer had not checked under his car we would have been looking at a murder or multiple murders.' Scroll down for video .

They need to recognise the futility of their campaign and respect the wishes of the vast majority of our community who want an end to all violent acts.' The car was parked off Newtownards Road is one of the busiest . arterial routes into Belfast. The officer's home is close to Police Service of Northern Ireland headquarters at Knock and the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont. Residents of nearby homes were evacuated to a local church while army technical officers worked to make the scene safe. Assassination attempt: Police evacuated residents and closed Upper Newtownards Road whilst army technical experts dealt with a 'viable bomb' found under the police officer's car outside his home . Police believe the murder attempt is the work of rebel republicans who 'don't care who they attack and don't care who they kill,' Hamilton said. 'They are simply anti-peace and determined . to carry on bringing pain and devastation to families and communities . by maiming and killing.' He said it was very fortunate that the device was detected in time so that no-one was killed or seriously injured. Dismantling: It is believe the policeman discovered the viable bomb himself around 2pm yesterday afternoon after which security forces were called . 'Initial investigations would . indicate that this was a viable device placed below an officer's car . sometime in the last 48 hours. 'It was clearly intended to kill the . police officer. His family and neighbours in the vicinity were also put . at risk of serious harm. 'Obviously there are people out there who are still intent on causing murder and mayhem.' Terry Spence, chairman of officers' representative body the Police Federation, said the device was planted by 'cowardly thugs'. ‘This was an attempt to murder an off-duty police officer,’ he said. ‘But this attack is no great . surprise. Scores of police officers have been forced from their homes in . the last 12 months because of terrorist incidents. This is just the . latest of many. ‘It reinforces the need for officers to be extra vigilant.’ Democratic Unionist Assembly member for East Belfast Robin Newton condemned those responsible. ‘Those who placed this potential bomb have nothing to offer the community except heartache and sorrow,’ he said. ‘The thugs who carry out this type of . an action are rejected by the vast majority of the community as being . wicked and evil ... who care nothing for innocent life. ‘I pay tribute to the PSNI officers . and the bomb squad officers who risked their lives to make the area safe . not only for the intended victim but all who live in close proximity.’ Moving in: After police evacuate the street, an army bomb disposal expert prepares to examine the bomb on Newtownards Road in east Belfast . Breathing out: The bomb expert examines and secures the booby trap bomb found underneath the car . East Belfast Alliance MLA Chris . Lyttle said: ’My immediate thoughts and prayers are with the officer and . family directly affected by this cowardly and futile act and the people . working to restore safety to all residents in the area. Northern . Irish dissidents have repeatedly targeted security force members in . recent years in a bid to destabilise the peace process. In November long-serving prison officer David Black, 52, was shot dead in a motorway ambush in Co Armagh as he drove to work. The attack was claimed by a group styling itself the 'new IRA' which was formed in the summer when a number . of splinter groups joined forces. In April 2011 newly qualified police . officer Ronan Kerr (top right), 25, died when a booby trap car bomb . exploded under his vehicle at his home in Omagh. ‘Those behind this incident have . absolutely nothing to offer the local community and are only intent on . taking Northern Ireland back to a time of deep division through violent . attacks. ‘Anyone, from whatever background, . considering an attack on the PSNI should remember that officers have the . full support of the vast majority of people across Northern Ireland. 'Any attack will only serve to risk misery to families and resolve the . will of this community to reject violence in favour of peace.’ SDLP Policing Board member Conall McDevitt said the murder bid was a 'cynical and deplorable act'. ‘Those seeking to target police . officers are undermining not only the stated will of the people of . Ireland who have long since rejected violence, but also the desire for a . new beginning for policing in the North, which is shared by the . majority of citizens,’ he said. Chief Constable Hamilton appealed for anyone with information on the latest murder bid to come forward. 'Attacks on police officers are attacks on the entire community and cannot be allowed to continue,' he said. 'We know there are people within our communities who know who did this, we know there are people out there who know exactly what is being planned. Double threat: The bomb was discovered yesterday afternoon close to the policeman's home which is located near the Police Service of Northern Ireland Headquarters . 'The community can be assured that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will do everything possible within the law to bring those responsible to justice. 'However it is very important that we get information about this incident quickly. We need support from members of the public in bringing those responsible to justice.' Police want to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity on the Upper Newtownards Road between the junction of Cabinhill Park and Knock Road between Friday afternoon and lunchtime today . Detectives can be contacted on 0845 600 8000 or information can be passed anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555111.","First bomb found underneath car parked near off-duty policeman's home .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 09:44 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 10 January 2013 . Vandals have sparked outrage by defacing historic graves in a major cemetery, painting the words 'No God' on monuments and headstones. Glasgow residents and tourists spoke of their fury at the thuggish graffiti covering parts of the city's Necropolis. One of the monuments targeted was a memorial to famed religious reformer John Knox, at the cemetery's highest point overlooking the rest of the city. Graffiti: Historic graves in the Glasgow Necropolis have been defaced with the message 'No God' Around a dozen gravestones near the statue were also defaced with the anti-religious scrawls. In addition, the lodge at the entrance to the Victorian Necropolis had swastikas scrawled into its wooden doors. Glasgow City Council has sent a team of workers to clean up the mess - and is now being urged to take further steps to secure the cemetery. Local resident Lesley Naughton said: 'I think it is disgusting. There are people buried in there, so it is absolutely disrespectful for people to be vandalising or spray painting on the gravestones. 'It is such a nice place for the public to visit. We need to get the message out that it is not OK for people to act like this. I think there should be more patrols looking out for this sort of thing.' Well-known: The statue of religious reformer John Knox was one of the memorial targeted . Fury: Locals and tourists have called for greater action by the city council to safeguard the graves . Student Keiran Kerr said he was worried that tourists would be more likely to remember the vandalism than the historic charms of the cemetery itself. 'It's mindless vandalism,' he said. 'I don't think there's any point of it. It's one of the things that people will remember. 'And the tourists will think about the graffiti over anything else. It's just thoughtless.' Jennifer Link, who was visiting Glasgow with her husband, said: 'It's a shame. 'We think it's a beautiful place. It spoils it a bit and we're sad to see it but it's how things are these days.' Sick: This is not the first time the historic cemetery has been hit by malicious vandalism . Picturesque: The beautiful site was ruined by the actions of the unknown vandals . Around 50,000 people have been laid to rest at the 37-acre Necropolis, which is behind Glasgow Cathedral, and 3,500 tombs have been built there. Some of the monuments were created by renowned designers including Alexander 'Greek' Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. In July 2011, it was reported that Nazi symbols and racial abuse were spray painted on to gravestones in the cemetery. Crucifixes, stone angels, graves and other stone monuments were also thrown over and smashed in the wrecking spree. The Necropolis has also been targeted more than once by vandals on quad bikes, turning it into a dirt track. A Glasgow City Council spokesman said the graffiti removal team immediately dealt with the vandalism. 'It is always extremely disappointing when anyone wilfully vandalises any part of our city,' he added.","Monuments in Glasgow Necropolis defaced by anti-religious graffiti .

Freddie Starr yesterday denied being the ‘third man’ abusing schoolgirls in Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room with Gary Glitter. His extraordinary statement came 24 hours after a High Court battle in which he lost an injunction granted to prevent publication of a libellous allegation. No details of the allegation had been revealed but Mr Starr, 69, yesterday chose to make clear that he was falsely being linked to the sex scandal surrounding Savile. Denial: Freddie Starr (left, pictured at home today) said it was wrong for anyone to suggest he groped a girl aged 14 at a seedy dressing room party hosted by Jimmy Savile (right) and Gary Glitter . Mr Starr said . he was responding to claims made by Karin Ward, who told an ITV . documentary she saw Glitter raping a girl of 13 in Savile’s BBC dressing . room in the 1970s. Miss Ward, who was 14 at the time, . also claims Savile had his hand up a third girl’s skirt and that, on a . separate occasion, she was groped by a drunken Starr in Savile’s . dressing room. The comedian pictured in his hey-day . She initially made her claims to . BBC’s Newsnight last year but the documentary was shelved. In the ITV . documentary, Miss Ward only mentioned Glitter and Savile. The comic, who lives in Studley, . Warwickshire, said he hadn’t even met the girl who accused him of . drunkenly molesting her at the bash and went on to brand Savile - whom . he claims to have only met twice - as a ‘phoney’ and a ‘boring, boring . man’. Describing the moment he found out . about the allegations, comedian Starr said: ‘The first we heard of all . this was when Dean, my lawyer, called us up yesterday after getting an . email from ITV. ‘He was panicking, because he’s my mate as well as my QC. He said it was alleged I was in a room with Jimmy Savile, and these two alleged 14-year-old girls. ‘I’ve only met Jimmy Savile maybe twice. He came to see me with his mother at one of my shows. I always thought he was a flash b*****d, but I wanted to meet him before I cast aspersions on his character. ‘He said to me: “Now then young man, I’ve brought the duchess to meet you” - that was his mother. They stayed for 15 or 20 minutes before he left me so I had time to plan what I was going to do in the show. ‘The other time was when he came into . mine and my partner’s men’s clothing shop in Leeds. We were sat in the . shop and he walked past, looked in and came in. ‘In he comes and he starts to show us . his bus pass. We just sat there taking the p***. We said: ""Surely you . have enough money, you’ve got a roller."" ‘He . sat in his normal pose in the chair, taking up all the chair. I asked . him if he wanted a drink, he said he just wanted a cup of tea, and he . used all of those sayings he had off TV when he was talking to you. Claims: Gary Glitter, pictured in 1991, also allegedly had sex with another under-age girl at the party . Denial: Freddie Starr (left) was speaking from his five-bedroom house in Studley, Warwickshire (right) ‘He demeaned you, by talking a bit . down to you. I couldn’t wait to get him out of the shop. He was a . boring, boring man. I used to see him on television, and I always . thought to myself: “You’re phoney - there’s something not right about . you”. ‘I feel deeply sorry for them (his . alleged victims) for having to go through what that scumbag put them . through, I really do care for them. 'Don’t f******g tar me with the same brush as Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter. If there is one thing I’ve always hated it’s paedophiles' Freddie Starr . ‘But don’t f******g tar me with the same . brush as Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter. If there is one thing I’ve . always hated it’s paedophiles. If I see something on the TV about a kid . getting hurt, I just have to turn it off. ‘I can’t stand that sort of bloke. I’ve always been against paedophiles and always will be. I’ve never touched any under-aged girl in my life. Paedophiles are a pet hate of mine, so I refute it completely.’ Starr denied he was at any party with Savile. He added: ‘She’s claiming I made advances to her, it didn’t happen. She says she rebuffed me because my breath smelled of alcohol. Couple: Freddie Starr (left) - engaged to Sophie Lea (right), 34, who fell pregnant with his fifth child last November - spoke out after losing an injunction to prevent the press from printing the shocking claims . ‘Well that can’t have happened . because I’ve never drunk, I’m teetotal. I have never been in any . situation with Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter, and I have certainly never . been with this woman. 'When I read that I had made advances towards this woman - that never happened' Freddie Starr . ‘A mate of mine has said it wasn’t only Jimmy Savile who did this, there’s more to come out, but I don’t know more details. But when I read that I had made advances towards this woman - that never happened. ‘It could have been some other poor . b*****d, it’s horrible to be faced with this. I think there are more to . come forward - and I think there should be a police investigation into . it now.’ Looking younger: Freddie Starr, pictured at the late comedian Benny Hill's memorial service in 1992 . The 68-year-old - engaged to Sophie . Lea, 34, who fell pregnant with his fifth child last November - spoke . out after losing an injunction to prevent the press from printing the . shocking claims. His . comments came as it emerged police child abuse officers have met with . BBC officials to discuss the allegations made against late television . presenter Sir Jimmy Savile. A . Met Police spokesman said tonight that officers were contacting all . individuals who have made claims about Savile, and hoped to have a . 'clear picture' of how many woman may have suffered abuse by next week. Speaking from his five-bedroom home, . Starr went on to say that he had only met Gary Glitter once at an . England football match - where he contemplated stealing the rock . singer’s wig. 'It could have been some other poor b*****d, it’s horrible to be faced with this. I think there are more to come forward - and I think there should be a police investigation into it now' Freddie Starr . He added: ‘I was only in the same room as him at an England game in the Eighties against Greece. ‘I was there with (publicist) Max Clifford and he was sat in front of me.

Bowles was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after admitting possessing cocaine with intent to supply, possessing an offensive weapon, possessing and concealing criminal property and benefit fraud, while Miller got 18 months after admitting possessing criminal property and benefit fraud. Now, the couple has been ordered to hand over nearly £60,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act, which is designed to strip criminals of their ill-gotten gains. Manchester Crown Court heard that in order to pay back his £36,536 share of the bill, Bowles must arrange for the sale of an Audi A3, a Volvo, eight gold pocket watches, a gold wristwatch, a ladies' Cartier watch, two gold chains, 15 Stone Island designer jackets and six CP Company designer jackets.

"Many . pensioners have annuities linked to RPI - scrapping it could have cut £10,000 off a pension over 20 years . By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 18:12 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:46 EST, 11 January 2013 . Pensioners and savers were the big winners yesterday following a shock decision by the Office for National Statistics  not to scrap a key measure of inflation. In a move described by one expert as ‘a mess’ and ‘a fudge’, the ONS said it will continue to produce the retail prices index method of calculating inflation even though it is inaccurate. It did reveal plans to publish a new measure of inflation, but this will not be used as a benchmark for any significant purpose. Pensioners and savers were the big winners yesterday following a shock decision by the Office for National Statistics not to scrap a key measure of inflation . This means that RPI will continue to be used to calculate a huge number of things which affect the lives of every Briton, even though the ONS admits that it is not a reliable measure and is consistently higher than it should be. Many pensioners have annuities which are linked to RPI and scrapping this link could have cut £10,000 off a pension over 20 years, experts had warned. The interest paid on certain index-linked investments is also linked to RPI. But the fact that RPI will continue to be used to calculate price increases  – such as for water bills and train fares, as well as the interest students pay on their loans – is likely to trigger huge political embarrassment and fury among consumers. In a move described by one expert as 'a mess' and 'a fudge', the ONS said it will continue to produce the retail prices index method of calculating inflation even though it is inaccurate . Yesterday the Campaign for Better Transport called on the Government to switch to the new index, known as RPIJ, as a step towards getting rail fares ‘under control’. And Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘The ONS has come to a real fudge which doesn’t solve anything. ‘What was already a mess has  now become messier.’ He said the calculation of the RPI index is ‘fatally flawed’. RPI was introduced in 1947  and uses a way of working out  average prices known as the Carli method. Every country, including America, which used to adopt this method has scrapped it, apart from Britain. RPIJ will begin to be published  in March and uses the alternative Jevons’ method from which the  J in the index title is derived. The method is named after English economist William Stanley Jevons who died in 1882 and  proposed a different way of calculating indexes. But RPI will continue to be  used for the interest on National Savings and Investments’  index-linked savings certificates  in which some 905,000 savers have more than £25billion invested. Jil Matheson, the National Statistician, yesterday admitted that RPI ‘does not meet international standards’ and that ‘RPIJ uses a better method’. But the Treasury said yesterday it will continue to use RPI for index-linked gilts, although Sajid Javid, economic secretary to the Treasury, hinted that this policy might change in the future. Pensioners should welcome this brave decision . Alex Brummer, ANALYSIS . Among those who will be regretting the ONS determination to stick with the old formulation will be the Chancellor George Osborne . It is a long time since a decision against change had such a big impact on all our lives. A brave ruling by the National Statistician Jil Matheson to leave the formula for the calculation of the retail prices index (RPI) unchanged has been given an enthusiastic welcome by financial markets and pensioner groups. It had been feared that Matheson would cave in to political pressure for a new modern approach to RPI that would have lowered the measure of inflation, the level of annual increases to state pensions and therefore the bill to the Exchequer. But when it turned out the opposite was the case, the price of British government stocks or gilts, which offer returns linked to inflation, climbed sharply and people dependent on state pensions or in company schemes also required to uprate each year by the retail prices index, can breathe much easier. If the Office for National Statistics had chosen to replace RPI with something based on a more modern statistical formula then the annual increase in these pensions could have been cut by as much as 0.9 per cent a year. By holding the line on RPI, at a time when faith in pensions and the savings culture has been undermined by constant tax changes and government interference, Matheson has struck a rare blow for stability and the independence of the statistical service. A change in the retail prices index at present might have destroyed the nation’s faith in savings.This does not mean that the ONS ruling will be regarded as an unalloyed success for everyone. One consequence is that utility and rail prices, that are currently set on the basis of a formula based on the retail prices index, will increase more speedily than would otherwise be the case. Paradoxically, some elderly people could be particularly affected by this in that fuel bills tend to eat up such a large proportion of their disposable income. he ONS has, however, built itself an escape route. It plans to create a new measure of retail prices, RPIJ, that includes the same items as in the current retail prices index, but is calculated using a different mathematical formula. This will be published alongside the old RPI and, if divergence is significant over several years, the pressure for a new approach may become too much to withstand. Among those who will be regretting the ONS determination to stick with the old formulation will be the Chancellor George Osborne. A change to a less generous measure of inflation would have saved the government an estimated £3billion a year in the interest it pays on index-linked gilts and other products. Another group likely to be dissatisfied are companies locked into supporting final salary pension schemes that are adjusted upwards by RPI each year. At a time when the Government is constantly changing inflation adjustments, for everything from benefits payments to pensions and wages in the public sector, the chief statistician has seen off the Governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King, the politicians and some of the experts.","Pensioners and savers will see the benefits after the Office for National Statistics not to scrap a key measure of inflation .

A 13-year-old girl whose disappearance this week without shoes or a coat in the chilly Salt Lake City area caused widespread concern was found unharmed, police said early Friday. Brooklyn Gittins telephoned her grandmother late Thursday night from a Wal-Mart store in South Jordan, Unified Police spokesman Lieutenant Justin Hoyal said. The woman then contacted police and officers located the child. Found: Brooklyn Gittins, 13, who went missing . Tuesday night after going to bed in her house, was found unharmed, police said Friday . ‘Brooklyn was not injured and is fine,’ Hoyal said. ‘She was still wearing the grey T-shirt and black pajama pants. She did not have on shoes, a coat.’ Hoyal said authorities suspect that she was harbored by someone and police are trying to find out who. She disappeared Tuesday evening wearing only pajamas and a t-shirt. It was not be the first time that Gittins ran away so her parents feared that she had done so again. A major snowstorm Thursday prompted some 1,000 volunteers to join police in searching 17 square miles in the area near Gittins' home in Herriman, a Salt Lake City suburb about 18 miles southwest of downtown. A key concern had been the frigid winter weather. ‘Investigators believed she could have been a victim of the elements; it's been extremely cold,’ he said. The storm was expected to dump as much as 7 inches of snow and bring freezing temperatures. Police, who used canine units, a . helicopter, and on-the-ground volunteers to canvas the nearby areas to find Gittins,  have been interviewing the child, trying to determine where she was. There were no signs of forced entry at the Herriman home where Brooklyn was last seen at bedtime Tuesday. Scene: Police say there is no sign of forced entry at her home in Herriman, Utah . ‘We believe she left her home through her bedroom window and was picked up and harbored by a person or persons,’ Hoyal told The Associated Press in an interview. Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder said Thursday before she was found that the circumstances surrounding the case concerned authorities, especially because it appeared her departure was unplanned. Gittins' grandfather Craig Hiller made a plea at the news conference for her to come back. He said she's a typical teenage girl who is very outgoing in some cases and very subdued in others. The first time she ran away, she came back a short while later, Hiller said. He said at the time that he could not think of any clear . reason why she would have run away. There were no arguments in their . family of late and her friends did not know of any plans that she had to . disappear, he said. To many locals, the search for Gittins had echoes of . Elizabeth Smart's horrific 2002 kidnapping, which took place nearly 30 . miles away. However, that abduction had a clear suspect. Fortunately for her and her family, Gittins did not endure the same fate, though it remains unknown if anyone else was involved in her disappearance. ‘This was a successful investigation and we appreciate all the efforts by the community, public safety personnel, and the media in response to Brooklyn's disappearance,’ Hoyal said.

Guilty: Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, pictured today, who got into the Olympic Stadium without a ticket then threw a beer bottle at competitors lining up for the men's 100m final has been found guilty of public disorder . A man who got into the Olympic Stadium without a ticket then threw a beer bottle at competitors lining up for the men's 100m final has been found guilty of public disorder. Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, hurled abuse at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt then threw a plastic beer bottle on to the track before the race on August 5. Gill-Webb, from South Milford, near Leeds, was today found guilty at Stratford Magistrates' Court, east London, of public disorder. Gill-Webb, who suffers from bipolar affective disorder, pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area at the stadium and started shouting: 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an a***hole,' Stratford Magistrates' Court heard last week. He then threw the plastic beer bottle as the race - which Bolt won in 9.63 seconds - started on August 5 last year. The 34-year-old was confronted by Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch, then escorted from the stadium and arrested. The court heard that he used an old ticket to get into the Olympic Park, and then the stadium. Police never found a ticket on him. Gill-Webb was suffering from a manic episode at the time, with an urge to be 'involved' in the Olympics, the court heard. His lawyers argued that his mental state meant he could not have intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress, but the Crown said that, although he was unwell, he knew what he was doing. The court heard that Gill-Webb pushed his way to the front of the exclusive seating area after getting into the stadium. Prosecutor Neil King described him . mingling with members of the Dutch Olympic team, but his 'shouting and . jostling', then throwing the bottle, led to a confrontation with . Ms Bosch. In a statement, she described how he pushed past her to get to the front of the seating. Scroll down to watch . Foolish: The bottle can be seen landing on the track yards from Usain Bolt, far left, after being thrown by Gill-Webb, circled top . Disorder: Gill-Webb threw the bottle, which can be seen bottom centre of this image, onto the track at the start of the Men's 100m Final . 'He was shouting specifically at Usain Bolt. Things like 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an arsehole',' she said. 'He repeated these taunts over and over - it went on and on for about two minutes.' She saw Gill-Webb move his arm behind his head, then forwards in a throwing motion, then saw the bottle hit the track, she said. Ms Bosch confronted him, saying 'Dude, are you crazy?' 'He was trying to walk away so I pushed him hard to stop him,' she said. 'I was angry with what he had done, which was so disrespectful.' Restrained: Gill-Webb is pictured being detained by security after he threw a bottle onto the track just before the men's 100-metre final at the London 2012 Olympic Games . Abusive: Gill-Webb, who suffers from bipolar affective disorder, pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area at the stadium and started shouting at Usain Bolt . Other witnesses saw Gill-Webb shouting at finalists including Bolt, fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake, and US sprinter Justin Gatlin. Student Farzin Mirshahi heard him yell: 'Believe in Blake, no Usain' while her brother, Kiya Mirshahi, heard: 'Usain, no, Justin, you are a druggie, believe in Blake, no Usain, no.' After the incident, Gill-Webb - who the court heard has since lost his job - was escorted from the stadium and then arrested. His behaviour in police custody was said to be 'somewhat unusual', and he told officers that he was Scottish actor Alan Cumming, signing a statement with the star's name. Gill-Webb, who did not give evidence during his trial, originally denied throwing the bottle, but his DNA was later found on it. He later said he could not remember the incident. Guilty: Ashley Gill-Webb, left, is pictured leaving the court earlier in his trial . Champion: Despite the bottle and the abuse he suffered, Jamaica's Usain Bolt still went on to win the 100m final . Summing up his case, prosecutor Neil King said video footage showed Gill-Webb looking left and right, 'shuffling' behind other people, then surreptitiously throwing the bottle, suggesting he knew what he was doing was wrong, and clearly had intent. But Rhiannon Crimmins, defending, said Gill-Webb was mentally ill at the time and the video just showed a man behaving 'oddly'. Finding Gill-Webb guilty of both charges, District Judge William Ashworth said today: 'The video, in my view, clearly shows Mr Gill-Webb checking to see if he is under observation before taking the risk of throwing the bottle. 'I am sure that he was at that point weighing up the chances of being caught.' He said Gill-Webb's actions were 'rational and wrong' and intended to cause harassment, alarm and distress. Gill-Webb is due to be sentenced next month.","Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, hurled abuse at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt .

The clay walls of the low buildings that make up Tiebele, Burkina Faso, have been decorated with elaborate frescoes and geometric patterns, turning each of the circular structures into a striking work of art. The isolated village is home to the royal court of the Kassena people, one of the oldest ethnic groups in Burkina Faso, who first settled the region in the 15th Century. Scroll down for video . Striking: The extraordinary village of Tiebele in Burkina Faso, Africa, is made up of intricately embellished earthen architecture . Tiebele's 'Cour Royale' is a complex of earthen huts covering roughly 1.2 hectares and lying within circular, walled confines at the base of a hill overlooking the surrounding West African savannah. It serves as the official residence of the pe, or community leader, of the Kassena tribe. The clay walls of the buildings are covered with patterns to differentiate them from the homes of the common people, with the chief's heavily decorated residence the Tiebele equivalent of a royal palace. But not all of the striking structures are lived in. Some of the most elaborately patterned buildings are actually mausoleums for the dead, who are laid to rest in the same compound.

Police searching for two missing Georgia brothers who are believed to have been abducted by their father have released surveillance photos Friday showing the trio in a Tennessee Walmart earlier in the week. The images from a surveillance camera inside the Chattanooga store depict Daniel Cleary, 46, and his two sons, nine-year-old Ben and seven-year-old Henry. The boys spent their Christmas break with their father in Roswell and were supposed to be back with their mother in Suwanee on Wednesday, but police say Daniel Cleary failed to return them to his ex-wife. First clue: This image from a surveillance camera inside the Chattanooga, Tennessee, Walmart, shows Daniel Cleary with his two sons, who are believed to have been abducted by their father . Hunt: The images were captured last Sunday and Monday while Cleary and the two boys, seen wearing blue vests, were on a planned trip to the Tennessee Aquarium . Wanted: Daniel Cleary, left, is believed to have abducted his two sons, Henry and Ben, right, after failing to return the boys to his ex-wife at the end of their weeklong stay . On Thursday, Roswell police issued the nationwide Amber Alert, known in Georgia as Levi’s Call, after discovering that Mr Cleary violated a court order by not communicating with the boys' mother, Theresa Nash, for several days about the whereabouts of their children. Officials believe Clearly is armed and may pose a danger to his sons . 'He bought a Glock a month ago,' Theresa Nash told WTVM. 'He is drinking. He is under extreme stress because he probably realizes that he's kidnapped the kids and there's now an Amber Alert.' The CCTV images released Friday afternoon showing Mr Cleary with his children shopping at the Chattanooga Walmart were captured on December 23 and 24. The boys' distraught mother sounded optimistic that the surveillance video will help police track down her children and ex-husband. 'I'm so hopeful, and i have not been hopeful until this moment,' Theresa Nash tearfully told WSBTV. Ben Cleary is described as 4 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 66lbs, with brown eyes, and brown medium length hair. He was last seen wearing a light blue winter vest. Henry Cleary stands at 4 feet 5 inches and weighs 60 lbs, with green eyes, brown medium length hair. He, too, was last seen wearing a light blue winter vest. Their father picked the kids up on December 19 and was supposed to return them to Nash by 2pm on December 26, but never made it. Distraught: The boys' mother, Theresa Nash, said her ex-husband, a recovering alcoholic, had recently bought a Glock hangun, and she fears for her son's safety . Getaway car: Police believe that Cleary ditched his car and switched to a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee, similar to this one, with temporary Georgia license plate No 10742627 . The woman said that she last heard from her ex-husband on December 22 when he called her to say that he and the boys will be spending a night at a Quality Inn motel in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after visiting the Tennessee Aquarium in town, according to 11Alive. Cleary made one final call from his cell phone on December 23 from Nashville, after which the device was shut off. With mounting concern, Theresa Nash drove to Roswell and went to Cleary’s home at 285 Crab Orchard Way, only to discover that the house had been cleared out of TVs and other electronics, leading police to believe that the man planned the abduction. 'He definitely doesn't look like he's coming back and he's doing some things overtly to say he's gone,' said Lt. James McGee, of the Roswell Police Department. McGee said his agency is working closely with Tennessee authorities because evidence suggests the trio could be in and around the Nashville area. Troubled relationship: Cleary regained joint custody of his sons only in October after a stint at a rehab facility, and the Christmas break was the first week the kids spent alone with their father . Cleary’s car was later found abandoned in a restaurant parking lot, leading police to believe that he may have switched vehicles to travel in a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee with temporary Georgia license plate No 10742627 on Interstate 40 west of Nashville, Tennessee. Theresa Nash said her ex-husband does not have any family in Tennessee, but he does have relatives in Nevada, Florida and California. Nash said that a friend of Cleary's confirmed to her that the 46-year-old man purchased a Glock handgun last month, and she said that police said that the firearm was on him. The mother also added that Cleary, whom she described as an alcoholic, had recently undergone treatment at a rehab facility in California, KOLO8 reported. The man regained shared custody of Henry and Ben only in October, and the Christmas break was their first week alone with their father. Nash said her ex-husband is volatile and that she cannot be certain he won’t cause harm to the children. ‘I can’t predict his behavior with logic. It always defies me when I try, so I don’t have certainty that he wouldn’t,’ she said. “He loves them very much but he is not of sound mind.’ According to court records obtained by Channel 2, Nash filed a petition for contempt against Cleary last November. The document stated  that the woman smelled alcohol on his breath when he went to pick up the children, so she refused to let Cleary take them. The petition, however, was denied.","Ben and Henry Cleary, aged nine and seven, respectively, have stayed with their father, Daniel, since Dec. 19 .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 11:33 EST, 5 January 2012 . Iraq has today been hit by another wave of bomb blasts - killing at least 72 people. The explosions, which struck two Shiite neighbourhoods of Baghdad, have intensified fears Iraq is about to implode as insurgents step up attacks after the U.S. troop withdrawal last month. A suicide bomber also killed 45 Shiite pilgrims heading to the holy city of Karbala. All the blasts bore the hallmarks of Sunni insurgents linked to Al Qaeda, although there was no immediate claim of responsibility. It follows the killing of at least 69 people on December 22 - when a wave of 16 co-ordinated bombs, claimed by Al Qaeda in Iraq, went off across the capital. Scroll down for video... High alert: Iraqi soldiers stand at the scene after a bomb exploded in Sadr City . Damaged: A car's window is shattered after a booby-trapped motorcycle exploded near a group of day labourers in Sadr City . The attacks began when a bomb attached to a motorcycle blew up near a bus stop where day labourers gather to look for work in the Sadr City neighbourhood. Iraqi police said it killed at least eight people. That was followed by a roadside bomb nearby that killed another person. Police found a third bomb close by and defused it. Less than two hours later, two blasts struck the neighbourhood of Kazimiyah in the north of the Iraqi capital, killing at least 14 people. And, a few hours after, a suicide attack hit Shiite pilgrims heading to the holy Shiite city of Karbala, killing 45. The explosions took place near Nasiriyah, about 200 miles southeast of Baghdad. Officials said the Kazimiyah blasts occurred almost simultaneously, with at least one caused by a car bomb. Hospital officials confirmed the causalities, which included about 60 wounded. Tariq Annad, a 52-year-old government employee who lives near the scene of the first blast, said: 'I was heading to my work when the strong blast took place. I saw thick black smoke coming from the area. Now, people have real fears that the cycle of violence might be revived in this country.' Implosion: The bomb attacks have increased fears Iraq is going to descend into chaos following the withdrawal of U.S. troops last month . Signs of battle: An Iraqi walks past blood on . the pavement in Sadr City (left) as people grieve outside a morgue . before claiming the body of a relative killed in a bomb attack (right) The blasts occurred in the run-up to Arbaeen, a Shiite holy day which marks the end of 40 days of mourning that follow the anniversary of the death of Imam Hussein, a revered Shiite figure. During this time, Shiite pilgrims from across Iraq make their way to Karbala, south of Baghdad. Baghdad military spokesman Major General Qassim al-Moussawi said the aim of the attacks is 'to create turmoil among the Iraqi people'. Iraqi leaders have warned of a resurgence of Sunni and Shiite militants and an increase in violence following the departure of U.S. troops. The early morning blasts followed deadly attacks yesterday that targeted the homes of police officers and a member of a government-allied militia. Those attacks, in the cities of Baqouba and Abu Ghraib outside Baghdad, killed four people, including two children. The latest violence comes as Iraqi politicians remain deadlocked in a festering political crisis that threatens to reignite simmering sectarian tensions in the country.

Crime scene: Sen was struck by the train and killed at the 40th Street station near Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, pictured . Police reportedly tried in vain to question a muttering Menendez, who at one point inquired after the R train's location. 'All I know is that she's bipolar and as far as seeing the footage, I'm pretty sure it was her,' a cousin of the suspect told the Post. The doorman at the Rego Park building where Menendez’s mother and stepfather live said she visited her folks regularly. 'I know her. . . . You could tell that something was not right, like she needed medication or something,' the anonymous doorman told The New York Daily News. 'It’s just very sad what happened.' Menendez later confessed at the 112th Precinct House in Forest Hills, Queens that she did, indeed, push Sen, 46, a Calcutta native, . into the 7 train's path.

As of Saturday evening, she awaited formal arraignment, and could not be reached for comment. It was unclear if she had an attorney. The New York Daily News reported Sen had lived in the U.S. for the past 20 years and currently resided in a Queens apartment with at least two roommates. It was not clear if he was Muslim or Hindi. 'I think she's crazy,' Sen's shocked roommate, Ar Suman, told the New York Post. 'I can't believe this right now.' Suman said Sen, who . was single and childless, had just opened a copy shop, the New Amsterdam . Printing Co, with another man on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

Investigation: Officers, pictured, quizzed witnesses after the shocking incident . According to NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly,. officers identified Sen using his wallet and laptop, both of which were recovered at the scene. The NYPD's chief . spokesman Paul Browne said Menendez fled the station after the attack. Meanwhile, Kelly has said Sen was looking . westbound as the train pulled into the station and likely didn't . see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last, possible moment before the train arrived. Sen was struck by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said. The NYPD chief added Sen, who was . pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing . a description difficult at this time.' It also has not been determined if anyone tried . to help the man up before he was struck by the train. However, according to witnesses, there wouldn't have been time. 'I . heard the train screech as it was stopping and then heard this loud . scream,' Linda Santini-Tripodis, who was beneath the 40th Street station . at the time, told the newspaper. 'I'm never going to forget that scream for as long as I live.' Sen's death marks a second time this month that someone has been killed in such a gruesome fashion. However, Browne added there was 'no trend' of . such horrific occurrences. 'It's the urban nightmare,' Browne told Bloomberg. 'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he added. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly said during his weekly radio address Friday he understood that the extraordinary nature of the tragedy did not diminish its impact upon the victims' families. 'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.' Crime scene: The shocking incident occurred at around 8pm at the station, pictured, and is the second horrific case this month . Shocking: Sen was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks . Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizzeria located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times. 'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives. He said he did not recognize the woman but that a restaurant regular was on the train and said they felt a bump as it ran over the man. On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square. A photograph of him on the tracks a . split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New .

Apparently . no one else tried to help up Han, either. Charged: Homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, pictured, was charged with murder after pushing a man under a train on December 3 . Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square . A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before. Service was suspended tonight on the 7 train line, which connects Manhattan and Queens, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been using buses to shuttle riders while police investigate. Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare. Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient. After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety. On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 13:43 EST, 28 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:54 EST, 28 December 2012 . Police in Georgia issued an Amber Alert on Thursday for two young brothers believed to have been abducted by their father, who is considered armed and dangerous. Ben Cleary, aged nine, and his seven-year-old brother, Henry, spent their Christmas break with their father, 46-year-old Daniel Cleary, in Roswell. The children were supposed to be back with their mother in Suwanee on Wednesday, but police say Daniel Cleary failed to return them to his ex-wife. Wanted: Daniel Cleary, left, is believed to have abducted his two sons, Henry and Ben, right, after failing to return the boys to his ex-wife at the end of their weeklong stay . Roswell police issued the nationwide Amber Alert, known in Georgia as Levi’s Call, after discovering that Mr Cleary violated a court order by not communicating with the boy's mother, Theresa Nash, for several days about the whereabouts of their children. Officials believe Clearly is armed and may pose a danger to his sons . 'He bought a Glock a month ago,' Theresa Nash told WTVM. 'He is drinking. He is under extreme stress because he probably realizes that he's kidnapped the kids and there's now an Amber Alert.' Ben Cleary is described as 4 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 66lbs, with brown eyes, and brown medium length hair. He was last seen wearing a light blue winter vest. Henry Cleary stands at 4 feet 5 inches and weighs 60 lbs, with green eyes, brown medium length hair. He, too, was last seen wearing a light blue winter vest. Their father picked the kids up on December 19 and was supposed to return them to Nash by 2pm on December 26, but never made it. Distraught: The boys' mother, Theresa Nash, said her ex-husband, a recovering alcoholic, had recently bought a Glock hangun, and she fears for her son's safety . Getaway car: Police believe that Cleary ditched his car and switched to a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee, similar to this one, with temporary Georgia license plate No 10742627 . The woman said that she last heard from her ex-husband on December 22 when he called her to say that he and the boys will be spending a night at a Quality Inn motel in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after visiting the Tennessee Aquarium in town, according to 11Alive. Cleary made one final call from his cell phone on December 23 from Nashville, after which the device was shut off. With mounting concern, Theresa Nash drove to Roswell and went to Cleary’s home at 285 Crab Orchard Way, only to discover that the house had been cleared out and there was no one there, MyFoxAtlanta reported. Troubled relationship: Cleary regained joint custody of his sons only in October after a stint at a rehab facility, and the Christmas break was the first week the kids spent alone with their father . Cleary’s car was later found abandoned in a restaurant parking lot, leading police to believe that he may have switched vehicles to travel in a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee with temporary Georgia license plate No 10742627 on Interstate 40 west of Nashville, Tennessee. Theresa Nash said her ex-husband does not have any family in Tennessee, but he does have relatives in Nevada, Florida and California. Nash said that a friend of Cleary's confirmed to her that the 46-year-old man purchased a Glock handgun last month, and she said that police said that the firearm was on him. The mother also added that Cleary, whom she described as an alcoholic, had recently undergone treatment at a rehab facility in California, KOLO8 reported. The man regained shared custody of Henry and Ben only in October, and the Christmas break was their first week alone with their father. Nash said her ex-husband is volatile and that she cannot be certain he won’t cause harm to the children. ‘I can’t predict his behavior with logic. It always defies me when I try, so I don’t have certainty that he wouldn’t,’ she said. “He loves them very much but he is not of sound mind.’ According to court records obtained by Channel 2, Nash filed a petition for contempt against Cleary last November. The document stated  that the woman smelled alcohol on his breath when he went to pick up the children, so she refused to let Cleary take them. The petition, however, was denied.","Ben and Henry Cleary, aged nine and seven, respectively, have stayed with their father, Daniel, since Dec. 19 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 12:47 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:46 EST, 28 December 2012 . A former star rower for University of Michigan who aspired to compete in the Olympics was shot and killed by his girlfriend’s former partner in a murder-suicide last week, according to police. William Schnittman, 25, a Bloomfield Hills native, died Friday. He rowed for Michigan’s national championship squads in 2008-10, moving to Oklahoma City after graduation to train with the National High Performance Center. Police Capt. Dexter Nelson said 36-year-old Darrell K. Wilson shot Schnittman, then took his former lover who was dating the 25-year-old rower hostage and sexually assaulted her before letting the woman go. Tragic end: Police say William Schnittman, left, was shot to death by his girlfriend's former life partner, Darrell Wilson, who then took his own life following a high-speed chase . Nelson said Wilson fled police and fatally shot himself after a car chase. According to reporting by NewsOK, both Schnittman and his 32-year-old girlfriend had sought protective orders against Wilson. The Olympic hopeful was denied the order earlier this month. In a statement, USRowing chief executive Glenn Merry expressed ‘shock and sadness’ at Schnittman’s death. 'He was consumed with rowing, it is fair to say, and completely dedicated himself to it,' according to his letter. 'I was extremely proud to have coached him, and his unique personality always kept coaches and teammates on their toes. Anyone who coached or rowed with Bill has many, many stories to tell about him,' Hartsuff's statement read. Police responded to a home on NW 39th Street in Oklahoma City at around 3am after receiving reports about a home invasion. Big dreams: Schnittman, seen with his hand in the air, rowed for University of Michigan's championship squads in 2008-10, and then moved to Oklahoma City to train with the National High Performance Center in hopes of making the national team . Officers who arrived on the scene saw Wilson holding Schnittman's girlfriend hostage in a Jaguar outside the house, but convinced him to let the woman go. The suspect then sped away. When police searched the home, they discovered Schnittman, who suffered two gunshot wounds to the head. He was later pronounced dead. His girlfriend told investigators that Wilson had sexually assaulted her. The woman's four children, aged one, two, five and nine, were found unharmed inside the house where the deadly confrontation took place. A high-speed chase ensued, coming to an end on Interstate 35 when the 36-year-old driver appeared to have lost control of his car. When police approached the vehicle, they discovered that Wilson had shot himself to death. Three weeks before the tragedy, Schnittman had filed a protective order against Wilson, claiming that the man had threatened him multiple times since September, and had been stalking him and sending death threats, according to court records cited by NewsOK. 'He again told me that his problems were my fault, that he was going to kill himself, and that his death was on my conscience,' Schnittman wrote, adding that Wilson told him he would 'take care of me” before he killed himself.' Center of attention: Schnittman, pictured with his mother, was described by those who knew him as a loveable character who was consumed by rowing . However, Oklahoma County Special Judge Lisa K. Hammond denied Schnittman's request because he had not failed a police complaint about being stalked by Wilson. Such a complaint is needed for protective petitions when the person seeking protection does not have a relationship with the person the order is directed against. Schnittman's girlfriend also filed a protective order against Wilson, claiming that he had been harassing and stalking her for five months. The mother of four wrote that he had become obsessive and made attempts to kill himself in front of her kids. ‘While I don't think anyone could have predicted he would do this,’ the woman told Fox25 in the aftermath of the tragedy, ‘everyone who knew him, knew that he was unstable.’ Police confirmed to News9 that since March of this year, they had been called out to that house on NW 39th Street 26 times over various complaints. According to Wilson's brother Kevin, the 36-year-old was distraught about being away from the children, and his estrangement from his life partner had taken a severe emotional toll on him. Darrell Wilson had worked at Tinker Air Force Base for a defense logistics company, but had recently taken time off to address his mental health issues. 'He left a note at the home saying he was sorry he ruined Christmas and had left food and water for the dog,' Kevin Wilson said. Fears: The 25-year-old filed an order of protection against Wilson in early December, claiming that the man had been harassing and threatening him, but his petition was denied . The suspect's sibling added, 'My family is devastated that Schnittman's life was taken. He's definitely a victim in this situation and we feel horrible about this.' Schnittman, described by those who knew him as a star rower and a 'character,' had been training at the OKC National High Performance Center in the Boathouse District on the Oklahoma River for two years in the hopes of making the national team. He also coached young boys for the Oklahoma City Riversport Chesapeake Junior Crew program this past spring and had worked at two national team development camps, AnnArbor.com reported. Between 2006 and 2010, Schnittman was an oarsman for University of Michigan's rowing team and served as a team officer for two years. Disturbed: Those who knew Wilson said he had been struggling with mental problems associated with separation from his partner and the four children . According to Coach Hartsuff, the rower 'pulled the 4th best Freshman 2K ever his freshman year, and Bill was the 5-seat in one of the fastest varsity eights I have coached here.' 'Anyone who coached or rowed with Bill has many, many stories to tell about him,' Hartsuff wrote. OKC Riversport coach Jim Andersen said in a statement, 'Bill was a lovable character with his wild hair and goofy smile. He did a fantastic job coaching the kids and everyone loved him.' Schnittman is survived by his parents, Arthur and Virginia, and his identical twin brother, Bob, who also briefly rowed for UM.","William Schnittman, 25, was killed with two shots to the head in Oklahoma City .

Josh Powell will never be buried next to the two young sons he killed in a blistering inferno, after police intervened in his family's plans to lay him to rest near their shared grave. Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor and . Detective Ed Troyer, who heads the anti-crime organization Crimestoppers . of Tacoma-Pierce County, Washington, have bought two plots . at Woodbine Cemetery on either . side of the boys. A grave selected by Powell's relatives, just . across a road, about 80 to 100ft away, has been on hold because the parents of Powell's missing wife, Susan, have promised legal action. Happier times: Josh Powell blew up the property when he found out he was not getting custody of his two sons . The cost of the burial plots next to the Powell boys is being paid by Crimestoppers, other organizations and private donations. Troyer said Crimestoppers would allow . Susan Powell's family to use the plots as they saw fit, and if . Crimestoppers raises money beyond the cost of the plots, any extra could . be spent on memorials. 'We might not be able to keep Josh . Powell out of the cemetery, but it's way better than having him right . next to the boys,' Troyer said. Josh Powell's grave has already been dug and was covered with plywood on Wednesday. The Powell family has not paid for it yet,  Puyallup, Washington City Manager Ralph Dannenberg said. 'We don't have any rules or procedures regarding refusing plots to anyone,' said Dannenberg. 'We're going to wait to see what the outcome is in court.' Powell was a suspect in Susan . Powell's 2009 disappearance from their home in West Valley City, Utah. He attacked his sons with a hatchet and exploded his house in a . gas-fuelled blaze, killing himself and the two boys on February 5. Preventative measure: Crimestoppers has purchased the plots on either side of the gravesite of Charlie and Braden Powell (shown still covered by a cemetery canopy) Empty plot: A cement cover is placed on top of an empty grave that has been reserved for Josh Powell up the hill, but not alongside the boys' grave, shown left under the canopy . The boys were laid to rest in a . single casket at Woodbine on Saturday, with more than 1,000 mourners in . attendance, and the Coxes hope to bury Susan Powell there too if her . remains are ever found. Attorney Anne Bremner, who represents . Susan Powell's parents, Charles and Judy Cox, says she will seek a . temporary restraining order to block Josh Powell from being buried . there. She said she could pursue claims against the city for emotional . wrongs and outrage on behalf of the Coxes if the burial goes forward. 'For him to be buried near those kids is just unthinkable. For God's sake, for them to lose Susan first, and then the boys, and now this? Just give these people a break.' - Attorney Anne Bremner, representing Susan Powell's parents . 'For him to be buried near those kids . is just unthinkable,' Ms Bremner said. 'For God's sake, for them to . lose Susan first, and then the boys, and now this? Just give these . people a break.' Powell's sister Alina did not return an email seeking comment. Steve Downing, another attorney for . the Coxes, said his office received a series of anonymous calls on . Tuesday afternoon reporting that Josh Powell's relatives had visited the . cemetery. Concerned, he emailed the city of Puyallup, south of Seattle, . on Tuesday night and asked to be notified of any plans to bury Josh . Powell there. 'Same cemetery, different . destinations,' was what he initially told his clients about the matter. But after speaking with the Coxes further, he said, they feared 'they . couldn't go see their daughter or their grandsons with any peace at all' if Powell's remains were nearby. Josh Powell had always claimed that . he didn't know what happened to his wife. He took the boys – then two . and four – on a midnight camping trip in freezing weather in the Utah . desert, he said, and when he returned home the next day authorities were . at the house looking for her.

Support: Chuck Cox, centre, hugs family and mourners after the casket bearing his grandchildren, Charlie and Braden Powell, was placed in a hearse outside Life Center Church . Weeks later, he moved the boys to his . father Steve's home in Puyallup. After Steve's arrest on voyeurism and . child pornography charges last fall, the boys were removed from the . house and turned over to the Coxes. On February 5, a social worker . brought them to Josh Powell's rental home for what was supposed to be a . court-sanctioned supervised visit. Powell let the boys inside, locked . the social worker out, and killed them. A judge had recently ordered . that Powell undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation if he hoped to regain . custody, and in a last-minute message to his sister he said he couldn't . live without his boys. Sergeant Denny Wood Wood of the Pierce . County Sheriff’s Department described what police believe occurred on the day of the explosion. 'The . little boys come in,' he said. 'He takes them to the back and hits them . with the hatchet. Josh Powell scatters gas. He walks around the house, . tossing it on the walls and floor. Sham: The house that Josh Powell blew up to kill himself and his two sons was used as a ruse for social workers. He did not live there but placed photographs around to give the impression he did . Inferno: At a meeting for residents, police said Powell slashed the boys with a hatchet before lighting gasoline . Destroyed: The house, which neighbours thought was empty and abandoned, exploded within seconds . 'He puts the five-gallon gas can by the front door. He sits with the other can between his knees.' The social worker, who survived the attack, said the boys had been . excited to see their father because he told them he had something . special for them. Graham, Washington house was also a sham home set up for social worker . visits, Wood said. Questions: Powell was the sole person of interest in the case of his missing wife Susan, who disappeared in 2009 . Powell, who was a person of interest . in the disappearance of his wife Susan in 2009, did not live there, but dotted photographs on surfaces to give the . impression he did. Wood . divulged the details at a meeting held for residents to ask law . enforcement officials for information and advice on how to cope with the . tragedy. It was attended by around 50 people. Many wished to hear that the boys did . not suffer, the News Tribune reported. Wood said they had soot in their . lungs, which showed they were still breathing, but he believes they had . already been knocked unconscious. Detective . Gary Sanders added: 'He committed the most evil act. And he gave them . the greatest gift, which is to be in their mother’s arms.' Since . the explosion, police have found new evidence relating to Susan . Powell's disappearance. They discovered a blood-stained comforter, which . they are testing, in his storage unit. Investigators . also found toys and kids' clothes in garbage bags in the unit, as well . as framed pictures. Those items were given to Susan Powell's family. Steve Powell remains in custody, and . authorities are interested in knowing whether he has information about . Susan Powell's fate. On Tuesday, he filed a written notice in Pierce . County Superior Court asserting his constitutional right to remain . silent and not discuss any matters with Utah, Washington or federal law . enforcement.","Relatives selected plot at Woodbine Cemetery in Puyallup, Washington 80ft away .

A seven-year-old girl from New York had her Christmas ruined by a Grinch who stole her dog, but thanks to a Good Samaritan, the young owner was reunited with her beloved pet. Mia Bendrat was completely heartbroken after her Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Marley, was snatched by an opportunist dog thief on Christmas Eve. But the crime was caught on camera and a campaign to catch the thief was launched by the family, police and the media. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Adorable: Marley, who was snatched from a Washington Heights, NYC, street corner on Christmas Eve, has been reunited with its seven-year-old owner . A Good Samaritan subsequently saw a man trying the sell the dog and paid $220 out of her own pocket to buy Marley, a ginger spaniel. The woman, Tena Cohen, took the dog to a vet to be scanned for a microchip and, as suspected, found that Marley belonged to Mia, whose Christmas had been ruined by his disappearance. The emotional moment when Mia and her mother were reunited with Marley is shown by ABC News, on its website. DNAInfo.com reported that Mia, her mother, Angie Estrada, and the mother's boyfriend all went to La Rosa Fine Foods at 176 . on Broadway in New York City's Washington Heights at around 10.30am Monday to pick up groceries for their Christmas dinner. They would usually have someone stay . outside with their pet, but that day they decided to all go in together, . leaving Marley tied to a pole outside. The family were gone for about eight minutes, and when they came out, the pooch was gone. 'Our world changed at 10 o'clock,' said Estrada. 'I was horrified, but I'm trying to hold it together for Mia.' ABC later released . CCTV footage of the dog being stolen from outside the store by a man wearing headphones. Marley, who was a Christmas present for Mia two years ago, at first greets the man with a wagging tail. But . as he detaches Marley's collar and then unties the lead from the pole, . the dog's behavior changes. He clearly looks scared with his tail . between his legs. The man is then seen picking Marley up and casually walking off down the street. Passersby do not even notice the crime. Reunited: This is the moment Marley was reunited with her seven-year-old owner, Mia, after being dog-napped two days earlier .

The anonymous good Samaritan, pictured right, paid $220 of her own money for the spaniel which she suspected as being stolen; the thief, left, was arrested by police . Realizing her dog had been stolen on . Christmas Eve, heartbroken Mia, in interview with ABC News, questioned . who would do such a thing. Mia, . who described Marley as 'really fluffy' and 'adorable' said: 'I feel . like they are going to get coal in their stocking... it's really sad.' Speaking to the New York Post, . Estrada said that her daughter was so distressed over losing Marley that . she would not even trim the tree . Her mother asked anyone who may have . bought Mia's dog to return it. 'We'll pay you,' she pleaded on TV. Luckily for the family, Tena Cohen . was at the right place and the right time. The Good Samaritan told the . New York Post that at around 1.30pm Monday, she was on her way to the . Union Square when she heard a man yelling, 'Dog for sale!' The woman described the pooch looking . nervous and sad which led her to believe that it was stolen.  Cohen . offered the man holding the animal $100 in exchange for the spaniel, but . was told that it was not enough. CCTV footage of the thief, left, was released by the police and ABC News, as 'heartbroken' Mia, right, questioned who would do such a thing . Ruined holiday: Angie Estrada, right, said her heartbroken daughter, Mia, left, would not even decorate the Christmas tree because she was too upset over losing her dog . Cohen said that the man posing as the spaniel's owner looked high on drugs. He told her that he paid $3,200 for the pet and had it for years. The woman then went to get more cash and returned with $220. After a brief negotiation, Cohen managed to convince the suspected thief to sell her the distraught pooch. Cohen took the animal to a vet, who checked it for free and found a microchip. She also contacted the group Cavalier Rescue USA, which ultimately helped reunite Mia with her beloved pet. 'I can’t believe a grinch would steal our Marley,' Estrada said. 'But the grinch didn’t win.' Mia added, 'I’m not going to let Marley go now, no matter what!' The suspected dog thief, identified . as 29-year-old Brad Bacon, has since been arrested on a grand larceny . charge. He entered a not guilty plea, claiming that it was a case of . mistaken identity. Even though Assistant District . Attorney Jamie Kleidman asked for $7,500 bail, Bacon was released . pending his next court date on March 11, the New York Post reported. Mia's mother was stunned by the judge's decision to release Marley's suspected kidnapper. 'He could go and do this again anywhere else in any neighborhood,' she said. The footage shows the thief approaching Marley who is tied to a pole on a street in New York City, on Christmas Eve . Snatched: The dog, which looks distressed, is untied and scooped up by the man .

Desperate search: Marley was dog-napped outside La Rosa foods, at 176 on Broadway, in New York City's Washington Heights, left, prompting the owners to distribute posters in an effort to find it . According to the Post, just three days before police say Bacon stole the spaniel, he was released from jail for allegedly scamming a pair of Manhattan deli owners earlier this month. On December 2, the 29-year-old allegedly approached the owner of Energy Kitchen on West 17th Street posing as a refrigerator repairman, and later demanded $255 for a deposit on his 'work.' Half-an-hour later, Bacon went into another Energy Kitchen several blocks away and allegedly pulled the same scam, walking away this time with $188.","Woman paid $220 for dog after she suspected it was stolen .

The couple's son, Frank Hayward III, survived the attack but suffered severe burns and cuts to his neck and was rushed to hospital in Washington D.C where he is fighting for his life. Another woman, believed to be Ms Hayward's great-aunt, was at home but escaped uninjured, according to The Washington Post. 'We are deeply saddened by this tragic event,' Calvert Sheriff Mike Evans said during a news conference.

Police have identified the man who was viciously pushed to his death onto the subway tracks in New York City as a hardworking immigrant from India who had only recently launched his own business. Sunando Sen, 46, a native of Calcutta, was shoved into the path of an approaching 7 train in Queens by a muttering woman who then fled the 40th street station. New York city Police commissioner Raymond Kelly said that Sen was looking westbound as the train was pulling into the station and likely didn't see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last moment. SCROLL DOWN FOR SURVEILLANCE VIDEO . Innocent: Sunando Sen, 46, a native of Calcutta, India, has been identified as the man who was shoved onto the subway tracks in front of an oncoming train . Crime scene: The man was struck by the train and killed at the 40th Street station near Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, pictured . The New York Daily News reported that Sen had been in the U.S. for the past 20 years and lived in Queens in an apartment with at least two roommates. 'I think she's crazy,' Sen's shocked roommate Ar Suman, told the New York Post. 'I can't believe this right now.' Suman said that the 46-year-old, who . was single and childless, had just opened a copy shop, the New Amsterdam . Printing Co, with another man on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. 'My heart is broken because this guy was so nice and quiet,' added Sen’s other roommate, Md Khan. On Friday, Sen's business partner was trying to reach the victim's relatives in . India to deliver them the bad news. Meanwhile, police sounded optimistic . about the prospect of identifying Sen's attacker in the near future, . saying that they are following some hotline tips. ‘We’re reasonably confident that we’ll identify the suspect. We are properly deployed in transit areas,' Kelly said. According to the commissioner, . officers were able to identify Sen using his wallet and laptop that were . recovered at the scene. On the run: The suspect, described as a Hispanic woman in her 20s, was captured on a surveillance camera fleeing from the train station after the incident . Clue: Police obtained grainy surveillance footage from a nearby pizzeria showing a woman said to be wearing a blue, white and gray ski jacket and Nike sneakers running away . The unidentified woman, seen fleeing on video, was reportedly muttering to herself . It has been reported that the man's body was severely disfigured after he became wedged under the second car of the train. Sen's death marks a second time this month that someone has been killed in a such gruesome fashion. He was standing on the elevated . platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when the woman, who . witnesses said had been following him closely and muttering to herself, . shoved him onto the tracks. The victim hadn't appeared to notice her before falling to his death in front of the barreling train. New York Police Department chief . spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her. She . was described as Hispanic, in her 20s, heavyset and about 5-foot-5, . wearing a blue, white and gray ski jacket and Nike sneakers with gray on . top and red on the bottom. The man was hit by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said. According to witnesses, at around 8pm a woman was seen pacing and muttering to herself. She then sat down on a wooden bench at the end of the platform, where she waited until the last possible moment before pushing a man in front of the approaching train. The NYPD chief added that the victim, who was . pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing . a description difficult at this time.' Hunt: New York Police Department chief spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene, pictured, after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her . Investigation: Officers, pictured, quizzed witnesses after the shocking incident . Police said it . was unclear if the man and the woman knew each other before the tragic incident. 'We haven’t determined whether it was random or if there was some connection yet,' Browne said. 'But there was nothing from what the witnesses could see to indicate that they knew each other and he did not, according to the witnesses, appear to realize that she was approaching.' It also has not been determined if anyone tried . to help the man up before he was struck by the train. However, according to witnesses, there wouldn't have been time. By 10:30, the victim's mangled body was still on the tracks, according to The Sunnyside Post. Officers from the Emergency Services . Unit planned to lift the train carriage using specialised inflatable . bags to recover his remains. 'I . heard the train screech as it was stopping and then heard this loud . scream,' Linda Santini-Tripodis, who was beneath the 40th Street station . at the time, told the newspaper. 'I'm never going to forget that scream for as long as I live.' Browne said there was 'no trend' of . such horrific occurrences despite the incident being the second of its . type in the space of a month. 'It's the urban nightmare,' Browne told Bloomberg. 'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he said. During his weekly radio address Friday morning, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that while such attacks were extremely rare, he understood how statistics did not diminish the tragedy for the families of the victims the New York Times reported. 'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.' Crime scene: The shocking incident occurred at around 8pm at the station, pictured, and is the second horrific case this month . Shocking: The man, who hasn't been identified, was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks . Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizza restaurant located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times. 'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives. He said he did not recognise the woman but that a restaurant regular was on the train and said they felt a bump as it ran over the man. On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square. A photograph of him on the tracks a . split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New . York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the . photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to . help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image. Apparently . no one else tried to help up Han, either. Charged: Homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, pictured, was charged with murder after pushing a man under a train on December 3 . Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square . A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before. Service was suspended tonight on the 7 train line, which connects Manhattan and Queens, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been using buses to shuttle riders while police investigate. Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare. Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient. After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety. On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.

Contestants from ITV dating show Take Me Out were thrown out of a country hotel after a weekend long party got out of hand and police were called. The party, said to have been attended by some 100 revellers who had taken part in the ITV1 show, decended into a drink-fuelled orgy as contestants played strip pool ran riot. Former contestants from all five of the show's series paid £55 each to attend the weekend long bash at Castle Hill House in Tutbury, Staffordshire. But their fun was cut short on Saturday morning when police were called and the owners of the house decided to evict them. One party-goer told The Sun: 'Everyone got really drunk early on and it started to get out of hand. 'Things heated up when some lads and girls decided to play strip pool. 'The girls were naked within minutes and just parading around.' Organised by two contestants, the £1.5million eight bedroom house, which is situated close to the banks of the River Dove, had been privately rented for the party. The ITV show, fronted by Paddy McGuinness, was first aired in 2010, with series five starting its run last night. The show averaged just over three million viewers during the fourth series. Police confirmed that they were called to Castle Hill House, but no one was arrested in connection with the incident. The show is no stranger to controversial headlines.

Last year, contestant Charles Sherwin was subjected to a barrage of vile abuse on Twitter after appearing on the show. One Twitter user even threatened to bottle the unpopular contestant. Another contestant, Aaron Withers, who appeared on the show in January last year, was revealed to be a £50-an-hour male escort, with a profile on website Platinum Select, an agency which features the profile of more than 5,000 escorts. Mr Withers insisted that he never offered any services to clients beyond escorting. It was also revealed that he had been convicted of assaulting a woman in a bar in 2010. It was reported last January that around 90 former contestants of the show trashed a £4.5million mansion in Chepstow, South Wales.

A Minnesota man has admitted to shooting his wife, sawing her body into pieces and hiding her remains in plastic bins in a friend's garage after she threatened to leave him and take their toddler. Steven Roger Johnson, 34, of St. Paul, is charged with second-degree murder after prosecutors say he shot his wife, Manya Jewel Johnson, 32, in the head before trying to dispose of her body in the presence of their 18-month-old son. Johnson told police he had been drinking when he shot his wife in the head on Sunday and 'used a saw to dismember her body in the shower and he placed her in several plastic bins,' the criminal complaint read. Tragic end: Steven Roger Johnson, left, is charged with shooting his wife Manya Jewel Johnson, right, before dismembering her body with a saw and hiding it in a friend's garage . Deadly fight: Steven Johnson told police his 32-year-old wife, pictured with him here, threatened to leave him and take their 18-month-old son before he pulled a gun on her . Johnson said he then cleaned up his home to hide any evidence and took the bins to his unsuspecting friend's garage in the St. Paul suburb of White Bear Lake. The friend didn't know what had happened until Johnson told him later, and the friend called authorities. Johnson was in custody on Wednesday and unavailable for comment. It was unclear if he had an attorney. According to the charges, St. Paul police went to the Johnson home on Monday to check on Manya Johnson when she failed to show up for work. When officers arrived, they were told that White Bear Lake police had received a call from Johnson's friend, who reported that Johnson told him Manya Johnson was dead after slipping in the shower, a neighbour told the Post Bulletin. Dark secret: Johnson told police he hid his wife's remains in his unsuspecting friend's garage, pictured here . Violent past: Johnson, seen at the age of 18, was previously convicted of felony criminal sexual conduct in 1996 that imprisoned him from December of 1996 until February of 2008 . He then admitted to hiding her body in . his garage but asked for help renting a storage unit for its holding, . according to the source who asked not to be named. While . St. Paul police were at Johnson's home, he showed up with a woman who . worked with Manya Johnson, and they both told police they were looking . for Manya. Johnson told police he had left his job to look for his wife after getting a text message saying she hadn't shown up for work. Manya's co-worker and Johnson told police they found her car at a park-and-ride lot. As . an officer was talking with Johnson, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal . Apprehension called the officer and said authorities had found the . dismembered body. Johnson was then arrested, the complaint said. 'This . horrific crime is an unfortunate example of how quickly domestic . violence can turn into homicide,' Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said . in a statement. Johnson was convicted of first-degree . criminal sexual conduct in 1996, after he and an accomplice allegedly . handcuffed a stranger in a car and raped her. Authorities alleged Johnson threatened to kill the woman and claimed he had a gun. Broken home: The couple's St Paul home is seen centre, after they moved into the neighbourhood in 2010 and had a son . He was on supervised release until 2018. When . the couple moved into the neighbourhood in 2010, neighbour Cherste .

We welcome you to the neighborhood,”’ Mrs Eidman said. ‘That night, Manya and Steve showed up at our doorstep, holding the card and almost in tears.

Charities warn that deep spending cuts for councils have harmed the potential of voluntary groups to provide public services . David Cameron’s Big Society is dead, leading charities declared today. The Prime Minister is warned his early enthusiasm for involving voluntary groups in running Britain is ‘going nowhere’. The Big Society concept was widely ridiculed when floated by Mr Cameron before the 2010 general election, with even supporters of the idea complaining that the PM had failed to explain what it actually meant. The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, which represents 2,000 charities, claims reforms designed to hand power from Whitehall to communities and good causes are moving ‘glacially slow’. Criticism of government reforms comes as Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg today launch a Mid-Term Review of the coalition’s progress and set out new policies for the next two and a half years. Mr Cameron had boasted that the Big Society was his ‘great passion’ but critics said it was vague and was being used as a cover for cuts to public services. Councils which provide huge levels of income for charities have seen funding from Westminster slashed. Charities also warn that people who rely on state are seeing support eroded. In a letter to the Prime Minister, head of the ACEVO Sir Stephen Bubb claimed major changes to the way services were provided have been abandoned, leaving the Big Society 'effectively dead'. David Cameron has pushed the Big Society agenda, despite critics saying it was vague and a cover for spending cuts . ‘As Prime Minister, you described . building a Big Society as your 'great passion' and 'central to my vision . for our country',’ Sir Stephen wrote, according to The Times. ‘You spoke eloquently of your desire to reform public services, with a significantly greater role for charities.’ Potential for charities to become involved in providing public services ‘remains largely untapped, with reforms in too many areas glacially slow’, he added. ‘The mood music across Whitehall has been that reform is off the agenda. The reality many charities now face is crippling spending cuts.’ Sir Stephen Bubb, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, used a letter to the PM to warn his Big Society vision is 'effectively dead' A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘From day one of the coalition Government, we have worked to help charities and social enterprises do more good. ‘Red tape has been cut, new incentives for giving have been introduced and the world’s first social investment institution, Big Society Capital, has been delivered.’","Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations representing 2,000 charities warns pace of reform is 'glacially slow'

Violent biker gangs from Australia, Canada and the US have arrived in Europe prompting fears of a battle for organised crime markets throughout the continent. Britain has been warned that turf wars could break out as 'Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs' fight for control over the drugs, weapons and human trafficking criminal markets. The European Union's law enforcement agency has now warned of a repeat of the 1990s biker wars that left at least 11 dead. Warning: Hells Angels are among the biker gangs that are expanding, according to Europol . The EUs law enforcement agency says tensions are increasing as gangs arrive from US and Australia (file picture) Europol said the arrival of notorious gangs including Comancheros and Rebels from Australia, Rock Machine from Canada and Mongols and Vagos from the US has exacerbated tensions with established clubs. It has informed police forces across the continent that established gangs are expandings and said there are already ongoing territorial battles with organised crime groups. Football hooligans from Britain and the continent, as well as former military personnel, right-wing extremists and prison gangs are among those expected to be targeted for recruitment. Europol said the four main groups - Outlaws, Hells Angels, Bandidos and Gremium MC - were all increasing their membership, particularly in north east and south east Europe. Outlaws (left) and Bandidos (right) has also increased its membership in recent years . Gerry Tobin, a Hell's Angels member, was murdered by a rival gang . It has warned that gang members are known to use 'extreme forms of violence' including automatic rifles such as Kalashnikovs and grenades 'indiscriminately'. Europol said the number of biker gang chapters in Europe has increased significantly since 2010 and there are now more than 700 chapters across the continent. Experts fear the new wave could lead to a repeat of the Nordic Biker Wars in the 1990s. Eleven people were killed and dozens more injured during a three year battle between the Hells Angels and Bandidos in Scandinavia that involved the use of car bombs and machine guns. Biker gang violence has also been seen in Britain more recently. In 2008 seven members of the South Warwickshire Outlaws were jailed for the murder of Hell's Angel Gerry Tobin, who was shot as he rode his Harley Davidson on the M40 after leaving a biker festival. A Europol spokesperson said: 'The main threat to public safety associated with OMCGs stems from their propensity to use extreme forms of violence... and the indiscriminate nature with which this violence is often used in open conflicts between rival groups.' The spokesperson added: 'Merely establishing a chapter on the ‘turf’ of another OMCG is interpreted as an act of provocation and is likely to result in violent confrontations and retaliation. 'Given the significant expansion of OMCGs and charters in Europe, Europol has informed its law enforcement partners that dedicated monitoring and analysis is needed because of the risk of clashes and the possible impact on the general organised crime situation.'","Gangs from Australia, Canada and the US have travelled to the continent .

The court heard the two women later planned to sell the story in a series of BBM (Blackberry Messenger) messages. In one Twitter posting an unidentified . user sent a tweet to Miss Cochran about Dappy, including the message: . 'Send the c*** down.' Miss Cochran replied: 'Hahaha in the process.' In a BBM message, sent on Monday evening, Miss Burton said to Miss Cochran: 'hahaha oh my f***. Someone's dad works in media. 'He told her that apparently we can get like a grand for that kind of story from The Sun or something.' She added: 'Let's ring them tomorrow when we leave court to be fair.' In another message read to the court, Miss Burton said: 'Didn't they say we can do what we want when the trial is over? 'Let's literally ring Heat and stuff and get rich and sell our story.' Asked at at the hearing yesterday at Guildford Crown Court why she had said that, Miss Cochran replied: 'I think we are . both 19-year-old girls. Any attention is good attention.' Witnesses: It is alleged that Dappy spat at Grace Cochran, right, and Serena Burton, left, after they rejected his advances . Dappy, real name Costadinos Contostavlos, who is a former bandmate of his cousin X . Factor judge Tulisa, denies two counts of common assault on the two . women, one of assault by beating, of Mr Jenkins, and one of affray. Miss . Cochran said she told the star to leave them alone and claims he then . flew into a rage, which sparked a 'mob attack' on bystander David . Jenkins and his friend. Mr . Jenkins had walked over to protect them, Guildford Crown Court heard, . and he and another man were then attacked, leaving Jenkins with nine . smashed teeth and the other with a broken nose. However, Dappy claims three men attacked him and his friends after he approached the women to tell them about his next single. The incident - captured on eight CCTV . cameras from various angles - was at a Shell garage, in Guildford, . Surrey, at 3.30am on February 28 last year.

Hearing: Serena Burton (left) and Grace Cochran (right) leave Guildford Crown Court during lunch at the trial . As they sat on the kerb . outside the petrol station and chatted to a group of men, two other . men, including Dappy, approached them, said Miss Cochran. 'Their manner was chatting us up, saying ""All right girls"" and ""All right sexy girls"" - something like that.' Prosecutor Brian Stork asked: 'Were you interested in these two men?' Miss Cochran replied: 'No, we didn't know who they were. 'We told them to leave us alone.' At this point, Miss Cochran claimed Dappy described them as 'sluts'. Mr Stork then asked: 'Did you say anything back to that?' Miss Cochran said: 'I said ""You're boring"".' When asked if that prompted a reaction, Miss Cochran said: 'Yes, he then spat at me - on to the floor, it didn't land on me.' Miss Cochran said her friend Miss Burton then told the rapper: 'That's disgusting.' Describing the events which then unfolded, she added: 'One of the boys who we were talking to previously at the cash point came to stand in and stuck up for us. 'He said ""Just leave them"" or something along those lines. 'I remember they were head to head, they had their heads against each other. Accused: Dappy and three other men are charged with affray after an attack on a man at a petrol station in February 2012 . 'People came out from cars which were parked up on the forecourt. 'Serena ran inside. She was calling my name but I just stayed sitting down. 'I can't really remember seeing much of the fight. 'I remember looking at my feet and seeing someone laying on the floor and they were being kicked as they were laying there.' In the aftermath Miss Cochran said she saw the group of three men she and her friend had been chatting to before the fight erupted. 'One of them had a lot of chipped teeth on his bottom jaw. 'One had a broken nose or a bleeding nose and one had a swollen-up eye.' Violent: Dappy is alleged to have sparked a mass brawl at this Shell Garage, in Guildford Surrey . Vassell and Stewart all deny a charge of affray. Co-accused Alfred James Miller pleaded guilty to a single charge of affray at Guildford Crown Court ahead of the start of the trial of the remaining three defendants. The tattooed performer was sporting a . pair of dark glasses and carrying a bottle of Lucozade as he arrived at . court. He removed the sunglasses before entering the dock, where he wore . a white shirt and dark blue tie as he listened to the evidence. Under cross-examination from Paul Greaney QC, representing Dappy, Miss Cochran denied using the case to gain fame. Mr Greaney asked about the messages posted on Twitter by Miss Cochran and Miss Burton this week. In one, on Monday evening, Serena wrote: 'Ha ha ha love life now we're famous', to which Miss Cochran replied: 'Buzzing to be papped'. Mr Greaney asked: 'Did that message mean you were excited to be photographed coming in to court?' Miss Cochran answered: 'Yes, I suppose, in a way.' Assaulted: David Jenkins says he lost or broke teeth after being hit in the mouth during the fight . As he listened to the answers from the dock, Dappy was seen to shake his head and also place his head in his hands. Mr Greaney then asked whether Miss Cochran intended to sell her story following the conclusion of the trial, to which she replied: 'Me and Serena have discussed it, yes.' Police seized both Miss Cochran and Miss Burton's BlackBerry smartphones this week following the Twitter postings. The court heard that Dappy had previously pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court to two offences of battery in an earlier and unconnected incident. These charges related to an incident on November 18, 2008, where he spat at a woman and the spittle hit her in the face as well as another woman, the court heard. Detective Constable Alex Boxall, of . Surrey Police, said that when he arrested Dappy at his recording studio . after the Guildford incident, the singer said to him: 'I was the one who . was assaulted.' When interviewed by police, Dappy denied spitting at anyone and said he had only spoken to the girls about his new single. Old times: Dino 'Dappy' Contostavlos with his N-Dubz bandmates, cousin Tulisa and Richard 'Fazer' Rawson . He said he has been 'victimised' and was the 'happiest man on earth' on the night of the incident as he was out to celebrate the release of his impending album. He said: 'I walked over to the girls and said my new single Rockstar with Brian May is out on Monday, go and buy it.' He added: 'They were just being rude to me, I just said hello, promoting my single, I said 'Hi, my single (with) Brian May is coming out. 'Two guys coming out, being put in a headlock, bam, that's all I remember.' He continued: 'Someone put me on the ground, in a headlock straight away. 'One of my security tried to get him off me, we all fell on the ground and I get put in a car after that.' Speaking to Mr Boxall in the interview, Dappy denied starting the violence or hitting anyone and said: 'Come on officer-man, who attacked who?' Dappy said during the interview that he was drunk on that night having had six or seven shots of Jack Daniel's and sambuca in a local nightclub called Casino. He said: 'We just went there to celebrate because my second single had just been released.' Denying spitting at the two women and the man, he said: 'No way would I spit, I don't spit. I have two kids, my mum didn't bring me up that way.' The trial, before a jury of eight men and four women, continues.

Andrew Mitchell was forced to quit as chief whip over claims he called police 'plebs', something he always denied . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood came under fire from MPs yesterday after admitting he had been ‘too busy’ to conduct a proper inquiry into the so-called ‘Plebgate’ incident. David Cameron asked Britain’s top mandarin to investigate the affair last September, in which the former Tory chief whip swore at a policeman at the gates of Downing Street. He was drafted in after an off-duty policeman claimed in an email to his local MP that he witnessed the incident and supported the allegations of two officers that Andrew Mitchell had been aggressive towards them and called them plebs. Sir Jeremy admitted having suspicions that Mr Mitchell might have been the victim of a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ by the police but decided to do nothing about it. And he admitted he had not even sought to ascertain whether Mr Mitchell used the word plebs, as police claimed. Sir Jeremy said he concluded the email was unreliable and there were ‘inconsistencies’ between the email and CCTV footage of the incident . But he didn’t bother to look at the police log, published as he began his inquiry, and said he ‘can’t recall’ whether a note by the Prime Minister’s principal private secretary, who interviewed the officers on duty, had contained the word pleb. ‘I didn’t look at whether the word pleb was used,’ he said. ‘I haven’t attempted to assess the veracity of the police account against the CCTV footage.’ Sir Jeremy said he was ‘mildly suspicious’ of the email but failed to uncover the truth. Asked whether the police were guilty of a ‘massive fabrication’, he said: ‘We accepted there were unanswered questions including the possibility of a gigantic conspiracy. Those were unanswered questions. ‘But we decided, on balance, to let matters rest, decided to stick by Andrew Mitchell, keep him in post and move on.’ Sir Jeremy recommended that Mr Cameron support Mr Mitchell, but the crucial CCTV footage which might have exonerated the chief whip was not published until after Mr Mitchell had been forced to resign. He left the Public Administration Committee astonished at his failure to probe apparent lies by diplomatic protection squad members. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood admitted he had not investigated whether Mr Mitchell used the word 'plebs' Sir Jeremy sought to defend himself against the charge of incompetence by repeatedly saying it was ‘not in my remit’ to look at the police log. He claimed: ‘It’s not my job to investigate the police. I don’t have the powers, I don’t have the expertise, I don’t have the time.’ He also admitted routinely ignoring public complaints about ministers. But MPs, including committee chairman Bernard Jenkin, told Sir Jeremy he should have referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission or Sir Alex Allan, who is supposed to probe ministerial wrongdoing. A report by MPs, due out next week, is expected to condemn No10’s handling of the affair. Mr Jenkin told Sir Jeremy: ‘You weren’t asked to get to the bottom of it, you didn’t think it was your obligation to get to the bottom of it and because of your failure to get to the bottom of it, the Government lost its chief whip.’ A friend of Mr Mitchell said: ‘For Heywood to say it wasn’t in his remit is risible. He’s the Cabinet Secretary. He tells Cameron what to do.’","Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood defends handling of inquiry .

Liam Fox, pictured here with wife Jesme, has become the most prominent Conservative yet to announce that he will vote against gay marriage . Liam Fox has become the most prominent Conservative yet to announce that he will vote against gay marriage. The former defence secretary dismissed David Cameron’s ‘absurd’ plans as a form of ‘social engineering’ that is ‘divisive, ill-thought-through and constitutionally wrong’. In a letter seen by the Daily Mail, Dr Fox said same-sex unions will alienate Conservative Party members and weaken the Church. He warned that pressing ahead with plans to introduce gay marriage is enraging ‘sections of the British public who are not normally stirred to political anger’, and called for a rethink before ‘things get out of hand’. The one-time Tory leadership contender said the determination of Mr Cameron and other senior ministers to push through legislation this spring ‘smacks of a form of social engineering of which Conservatives should be instinctively wary’. Of the consequences of the policy, he wrote: ‘It has led to the alienation of many loyal and, in many cases lifelong, supporters of the Conservative Party.’ He added that the claim by Downing Street that European courts would not be able to force religious groups into conducting same sex weddings ‘carries little credibility with those of us who have watched similar assurances trounced in the past’. Dr Fox also issued a coded criticism of Mr Cameron for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters. ‘What makes the position worse is the way that the legislation increasingly looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jour,’ he wrote. Dr Fox, who quit the Cabinet in October 2011 over his close friendship with lobbyist Adam Werritty, delivered his warning in a letter to constituents who have inquired about his views on gay marriage. He said that as a medical doctor he believes that ‘same sex relationships are a variant of the spectrum of human sexual behaviour’ and should be treated ‘with tolerance and respect’. However, he denounced proposals to ‘change the definition of marriage for all’, claiming that there is no ‘clamour’ for the change from homosexuals. He also said plans to allow gay marriage in some religious denominations while exempting the Church of England were ‘anomalous and absurd’. ‘The idea of making certain practices illegal for one Christian church, but not others, risks further weakening and splintering Britain’s traditional religion at a time when many Christians feel that they are under threat on a number of secular, political and cultural fronts,’ he continued. ‘To fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent.’ Dr Fox also issued a coded criticism of Mr Cameron for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters . Dr Fox rejected the charge levelled at Mr Cameron by some Tories that he has deliberately pursued gay marriage to antagonise the Right of the party as ‘far-fetched’, but concluded: ‘I believe these proposals are divisive, ill-thought-through and constitutionally wrong. 'That is why I will vote against them in the House of Commons.’ Dr Fox’s letter emerged as Energy Minister John Hayes, who has also said he will vote against gay marriage, used a magazine interview to press his case. He told Westminster publication The House that the best way to raise children is within a traditional union. ‘The relationship between my parents and [the one] I have had with my parents was built around a long-term, secure set of commitments, bonds,’ he said. ‘And it’s that secure environment which gives children the best chance of prospering.’ He added: ‘Society has a duty to create the circumstances in which those civil institutions can flourish.’ A spokesman for Mr Cameron said: ‘The Prime Minister is a strong advocate of gay marriage and this doesn’t change everything. We’re going to press ahead with it as planned.’","Former defence secretary Liam Fox is the most prominent Conservative to announce he will vote against gay marriage .

The oldest working fish smokehouse in London is facing closure after the owners were told they can only use smoke-free wood because of a single complaint from a neighbour. Walter Purkis & Sons has been serving customers with smoked fish at the back of its Crouch End shop for 130 years, prepared in a Victorian smokehouse. But Haringey Council say the practice must stop until issues with the smoke are resolved, after a neighbour in a modern apartment block lodged a complaint. Family business: Pictured in 1941, Sam Purkis,  Walter's great uncle, ran a fish shop in Woodford, north-east London . Angry: John Purkis (pictured), who runs Walter Purkis & Sons in Crouch . End, north London is disappointed that he can no longer smoke fish in the . smokehouse . Walter Purkis and his son John, who were handed the notice on December 21, face a fine if they do not comply. They believe booming house prices and over-development in what had previously been a down-at-heel area of town was killing off its history and traditions. Six years ago, flats were built above a nearby supermarket and during the summer last year, a wooden studio-type building was put up next to the shop's chimney. The council now claims the property - which had it chimney knocked off during the Blitz by a Luftwaffe bomb - is in breach of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Clean Air Act 1993. The family believe the complaint to the Labour-run Haringey Council in north London had originated from someone living in the apartment blocks. John Purkis, at the entrance to the fish smokehouse, which is in the backyard of his fishmongers shop . Not in stock: Empty spaces in the shop counter where the smoked fish used to be sold before the traders were ordered to stop smoking it . Referring to the residents, Mr Purkis, 65, said: 'We have never had a problem and we have been here 130 years. These flats are only six years old. 'We have been doing this the same way for five or six generations back, and so did the people who had shop before me, they also did it for five generations. 'If we can't do this anymore we will have to pack up.' His son John Purkis, 42, added: 'It's really disappointing. I have been here 20 years and no one ever said anything about health inspections so this was a shock. 'The last e-mail we got was yesterday from Haringey Council. 'We smoke with oak chip, which is pure wood. But they are saying it's an unauthorised fuel and they want us to use a smoke-free wood, which is chemically enhanced. 'But if it's smoke free, it's not smoked fish. There is no product. 'We use nothing but natural wood with no chemicals added. This goes against our principles. 'To do what they are suggesting, we would need to have a completely different system put in.' John at work in his shop, although he is no longer able to use his smokehouse (pictured right) Hidden away: The smokehouse, which prompted a complaint from a resident of a nearby property, is situated under the building with the green roof . Mr Purkis' father added the cost of the new equipment was in the region of £48,000, and even then he was not sure the council would approve its installation. The family bought the shop in 1982 from the Green family and also have a branch in Muswell Hill. Not happy: Councillor David Winskill for Crouch End is fighting the case for the now unused smokehouse . John Purkis said he were initially unaware that council officers had started to monitor the business since October, leading to the ban beginning on December 21. He added he had no idea how the monitoring had taken place, and they had not received any data. The family were able to complete their Christmas orders, but the ban has lost them 40 per cent of their turnover. 'To afford the rents and rate, we have got to have our turnover,' Mr Purkis added. 'We employ local people and have got six staff working for us. We are local people ourselves.' He added little smoke was emitted anyway as it was contained in the smokehouse so that it could be absorbed by the fish. Customer Martin Bailey was also furious. He said: 'A supplier of excellent, healthy, locally-processed, traditional foods - commended by Rick Stein and popular across north London- is being put out of business without consultation by ill-judged council action that can only be described as heavy-handed. 'And, not so far away, near the Olympic Park, a big new smokehouse has recently been opened. 'But that was in a different borough, where perhaps ""pollution"" means something different. 'What next? A Haringey ban on summer barbecues? Will firework parties fall foul of officialdom?' Crouch End councillor David Winskill has also backed the business, and is campaigning for the practice to be allowed again. Traditional: Inside the front of Walter Purkis & Sons, where smoked fish used to be for sale . The furious Liberal Democrat said: 'I'm going to be working with Mr Purkis and officers to make sure there is a speedy resolution to this and to see whether the order which has been served actually reflects the intention of the law.' A council spokesman said advice on appropriate smoking appliances and approved fuels had been provided to the owner. He said: 'We are working closely with them to resolve the issue. 'Until then the owner has been asked not to use the smokehouse.' Lance Forman, of H Forman & Son, has a smokehouse in East London and uses oak logs. He said: 'We have a special system that prevents smoke from being emitted into the atmosphere. 'The system is closed when we are producing the smoke.' Not on the menu: Thanks to a council ban, smoked kippers are not . currently served at the family-run Walter Purkis & Sons fish shop (file picture) Fish has been smoked throughout . history for the purpose of preservation, although the invention of . fridges means the practice is mainly used just for flavouring in . developed countries. The market for smoked fish underwent a major change in the mid to late nineteenth century. The . use of transport by railways and steam ships from the 1840s allowed the . transportation of perishables, so large quantities of fresh fish could . be moved from one place to another. This caused a decline in the popularity of heavily smoked products. In . the same period (the mid-1800s), the smoked fish products recognisable . in today's market came into being. These are mildly smoked and dried . and contain minimum salt as condiment. The kipper, for example, was invented in 1843 after considerable experiment, and remains popular today. Traditional smokehouses served both as meat and fish smokers and to store the food afterwards. They are usually small enclosed outbuildings with a vent, a single entrance and no windows. Inside them, smoke is absorbed into the meat during a process that lasts between five and six hours.","Haringey Council said the historic custom of fish-smoking at a north London shop must stop until problems with the smoky smell were resolved .

Evidence: There is enough evidence for James Holmes to face trial on charges that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a Colorado cinema . A judge ruled that there was enough evidence for James Holmes to face trial on charges that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a Colorado cinema last summer. Judge William Sylvester said prosecutors have established probable cause to proceed with 166 felony counts, including murder and attempted murder. Holmes is due to be arraigned today, but his defence lawyers filed papers saying he is not ready to enter a plea. They are likely to appear in court today to ask for the arraignment to be delayed. Defence lawyers did not explain why they are not ready for arraignment. Their filing also objected to media requests to bring cameras into the courtroom. Other than during his brief initial appearance in July, cameras have been barred from court during Holmes' case. Mr Sylvester's ruling came after a three-day hearing earlier this week, in which prosecutors laid out their case against Holmes, 25. A succession of police and federal agents testified that Holmes spent weeks amassing guns and ammunition, concocted explosives to booby-trap his apartment and scouted the cinema where he would allegedly unleash a horrific attack on hundreds of terrified people. On Monday, . the first responders to arrive after Holmes waged the shooting rampage . gave harrowing accounts of the massacre in court. Without emotion: Holmes is pictured in a court sketch from the last day of his pre-trial hearing . The first to speak was Officer Jason Oviatt from the Aurora, Colorado Police Department. He . was the one who ordered Holmes onto the ground and handcuffed him after . he spotted the alleged shooter 'just standing there' in full swat gear. Officer Oviatt said: 'He seemed very detached from it all. Very, very relaxed,' according to NBC. Oviatt was among several officers who spoke in court on the first day of pre-trial hearings for Holmes. The policeman had been working the late shift when 911 calls came through. Joker: One of James Holmes' self-taken photos is pictured in a court sketch from the third day of his pre-trial hearing in Centennial, Colorado . Account: Officer Jason Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was wearing a helmet and gas mask and 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze . Cops: Officers Justin Grizzle, left, and Jason Oviatt, right, gave emotional testimony during the pre-trial hearing on Monday . Grief: Family members of victims arrive for a court appearance of James Holmes . Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of . blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was . wearing a helmet and gas mask. He said at first he thought Holmes was a fellow cop, because he was . dressed in body armor, but he grew suspicious as he noticed Holmes was sitting calmly, and not running toward the murder scene. Oviatt said he pointed his gun at Holmes, who 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze. He then handcuffed him and searched him. He . said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes' car, adding that an ammunition magazine also fell out of Holmes' pocket . and he found another one on the ground. Officer Justin Grizzle testified that Holmes had a 'smirk' on his face as the carnage unfolded around him. Fighting . back tears, Officer Grizzle recalled today how he saw 'several' bodies - . and slipped on blood that was on the floor as he entered the theater. Dark night: Defense attorneys have not said whether Holmes will enter an insanity plea . Horror: Authorities say Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and propped open a door, went to his car and returned with weapons . Grizzle . recalled taking some of the wounded to the hospital and said he had to . stop one man who was worried about his seven-year-old daughter from . jumping out of the moving patrol car. He said there was so much blood in his car that he could hear it sloshing around. The officers also described a hellish . scene inside the cinema on July 20, when 12 people were shot to death . before their families and friends' eyes and scores of others were . wounded amid a din of gunshots, screams and the blaring soundtrack of . The Dark Knight Rises. Holmes' lawyers called no witnesses and cross-examined only a few of those summoned by prosecutors during the hearing. But they pointedly raised the issue . of Holmes' sanity at strategic moments, possibly foreshadowing a defence . that some believe is his best hope to avoid the death penalty. 'You're aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?' defence lawyer Daniel King asked one witness. The preliminary hearing, which . ended on Wednesday, was designed to determine whether prosecutors' case . is strong enough to put Holmes on trial. Holmes' lawyers have not said if he will plead not guilty by reason of . insanity, but since his arrest outside the cinema in the Denver suburb . of Aurora immediately after the shootings, they have portrayed him as a . man with serious mental problems prone to bizarre behaviour. Many legal analysts have said they expect the case to end with a plea bargain rather than a trial. Rigged to blow: James Holmes set booby traps in his apartment that included homemade napalm and nutrite . Plot foiled: Police investigated the apartment after Holmes had admitted to the officers who arrested him that he had set booby traps . Investigation: Police examine Holmes' car behind the theatre where the shooting took place in Aurora, Colorado July 2012 . Tom . Teves, whose son Alex was among the dead, said he would rather see . Holmes plead guilty to first-degree murder, avoiding a traumatic trial, . bringing a life sentence and closing the door to an insanity defence. 'Don't pretend he's crazy,' Mr Teves said. 'He's not crazy. He's no more crazy than you and I. If found not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes could conceivably be released someday if he is deemed to have recovered. Such a defendant is deemed not guilty . because he didn't know right from wrong and is therefore 'absolved' of . the crime, said former Jefferson County District Attorney Scott Storey. Last . year, Bruco Strong Eagle Eastwood was acquitted by reason of insanity . of attempted first-degree murder in the wounding of two eighth-graders . outside a school not far from Columbine High School. Eastwood is spending time in a mental hospital. His case will be reviewed every six months until he's deemed sane and released.","Judge ruled that there was enough evidence for James Holmes to face trial on charges that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others in Colorado .

The carriage has been built to look exactly as it would have in 1980 . Mr Shron estimates it has cost him around £6,300 to build the replica train carriage . And the labour of love is authentic down to the finest details including genuine seat numbers, chairs, timetable racks, coat hooks and the 1970s carpet. Mr Shron, who spent several years studying for a PhD in Birmingham, recovered many of the original parts from a VIA train which was due to be scrapped. But he also went to extraordinary lengths to make his train car feel realistic such as installing a photo mural at the end of the carriage so it appears as if it carries on into another car as well as playing a soundtrack of a train clicking along the tracks. Mr Shron has even salvaged a welcome to sign to greet visitors before they enter the train carriage . The chairs have all the original features including magazine racks and timetables from the 1980s . Mr Shron says it was his dream to build a replica train in his basement since he was a child . Mr Shron estimates the project cost him around 10,000 Canadian dollars - around £6,300 - and he had to scrap everything and start again at least three times. 'I've always wanted to have a VIA train in my basement since I was a kid,' said Mr Shron, from Vaughan, Ontario. 'In fact, when me and my wife were looking to buy a house I would say 'no' if the basement wasn't big enough for me to build it. 'I still have the letter from when I wrote to VIA in 1987 to ask them if they would sell me their seats in 1987. They said they couldn't. But then my friends and I find out about VIA train 5647 - it was going to be scrapped. 'So we got a hold of it before it was gone and took all these original parts.' Mr Shron began building the train in 2008 doing much of the work himself . The project took four and a half years and Mr Shron said he had to start from scratch at least three times . The train carriage has provided great entertainment for Mr Shron's three young children who he says love playing in it . The obsession with trains stems from Mr Shron's childhood and he now runs the largest model train business in Canada . Mr Shron (top centre) with friends who helped him salvage parts from a VIA train that was due to be scrapped . Mr Shron, who runs his own model train company Rapido Trains Inc. for a living, said the construction of the rail carriage has been a struggle, but worth it in the end. 'The train is where I feel most at home,' he said. 'It's where I feel most at peace. Especially when it's hurtling along at 85mph with the snow and rain pelting down outside - it's the perfect place to be. 'And my kids love it.

A cancer research boss at a leading university has been jailed for embezzling nearly £32,000 and spending it on drugs and alcohol. James Cleary posed as a woman to submit fraudulent invoices for services, and used part of the proceeds to buy BlackBerry phones and laptops for himself. He was jailed for nearly two years for the scam, which diverted funds away from the search for a cure for Britain's biggest killer disease. The 40-year-old was research business manager at the University of Manchester's School of Cancer and Enabling Science, which has been named the top cancer research centre in the country. The department, which works with scientists across the globe doing research into various cancers, was left struggling to pay some bills after Cleary's fraud came to light. An investigation revealed that 25 forged claims for repayment had been authorised by the manager over a period of three and a half years. The forms were completed under the name 'Michelle Roberts', but the bank account and sort code numbers on them matched those known to belong to Cleary. The Salford resident pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to fraudulently obtaining £31,984 and was jailed for 20 months. Cleary worked at the University of Manchester in various positions from May 1996 to August 2010. When he took up the job at the cancer institute he became authorised to sign payment claims, leading him to spend university money on his own drug habit. Victim: The prestigious University of Manchester was defrauded of thousands of pounds by Cleary . 'Cleary was employed in a position of trust by the university, and was given a lot of responsibility to process claims for reasonably large amounts of money,' a police spokesman said today. 'Sadly, he completely abused the trust the university placed in him and defrauded them to the tune of £31,984. 'He admitted during interview he had a drug and alcohol addiction that he needed to fund, and freely volunteered he spent some of the embezzled cash on BlackBerry mobile phones and computers. 'However, he did express remorse and I am sure now that he has been jailed he is even more sorry for his actions.' The university declined to comment. On its website, it boasts that 'the government-led Research Assessment Exercise 2008 has officially ranked cancer research in Manchester as the best in the UK.'","James Cleary spent thousands feeding drug and alcohol addiction .

An Illinois bank robber who escaped from custody and went on a 27-hour crime spree has been convicted thanks to a bragging love letter he wrote to his girlfriend. Robert Maday, 42, was already a convicted bank robber when he wrestled two Cook County state's attorney investigators as they drove him to court in 2009, getting away with their guns and one of the men's pants. He used the guns to commit separate hijackings against two women in Chicago's suburbs before robbing a bank, all while being hunted by police. After his 27 hours on the lam, Maday was re-captured and penned the detailed letter to girlfriend Lisa Barruzza in custody, according to WLS-TV. It was used today to convict him of all five escape, bank robbery and weapons counts he was facing. In the letter, Maday boasts of his 'so elaborate, so enticing' plan to evade the authorities after making his getaway but bemoaned how it was foiled before he made it out of the state. 'What does one say to the person you love most at the end of yet another failure?' he wrote to Barruzza. 'I had a plan so thorough, so elaborate, so enticing, so...I won't tease you with it now.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:43 EST, 11 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:46 EST, 11 January 2013 . The Food and Drug Administration has announced that it will require manufacturers of zolpidem, a popular sleeping pill commonly sold as brands including Ambien and Edluar, to reduce recommended dosages amid concerns about morning drowsiness caused by the pills. New research released Thursday shows that the drugs remains in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with alertness and coordination, which increases the risk of car accidents. Regulators are ordering drug manufacturers to cut the dose of the medications in half for women, who process the drug more slowly. Hidden dangers: New research shows that zolpidem remains in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with alertness and coordination . The FDA has recommended drug companies reduce the recommended dosage of Ambien because it causes morning drowsiness . Doses will be lowered from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams for regular products, and 12.5 milligrams to 6.25 milligrams for extended-release formulations. The FDA is recommending that manufacturers apply these lower doses to men as well, though it is not making them a requirement. A Scripps Health study published in the British Medical Journal last year found that sleeping pill usage may have contributed to as many as 500,000 'excess deaths' in the United States in 2010,  and noted that sleeping pill users have a fivefold increased risk of 'early death.' The new doses apply to all insomnia treatments containing the drug zolpidem, which is sold under different brands including Ambien, Edluar, Zolpimist, Stilnox, Sublinox and in generic forms. It is the most widely prescribed sleeping aid in the U.S. The changes don't affect other popular sleeping medicines like Lunesta and Sonata, which use different drugs. FDA officials pointed out that all sleeping drugs carry warnings about drowsiness. Morning drowsiness caused by sleeping pills containing zolpidem has been found to interfere with alertness and coordination, increasing the risk of car accidents . Ambien has been blamed for high-profile driving accidents involving Tom Brokaw and Kerry Kennedy . ‘All sleep drugs have the potential . to cause this, so health professionals should prescribe - and patients . should take - the lowest dose that is capable of preventing insomnia,’ said Dr. Ellis Unger, a director in FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation. Unger added that the FDA will begin requiring developers of sleep drugs to conduct driving simulation studies going forward. Ambien . has been blamed for several recent high-profile driving accidents in . the past year, including Tom Brokaw in September and Kerry Kennedy in . July. The FDA has received more than 700 reports of driving-related problems connected to zolpidem over the years. ‘But in most cases it was very difficult to determine if the driving impairment was actually related to zolpidem,’ Unger said. ‘Usually the reports did not contain information about when the accident happened or how much time had lapsed since taking the drug.’ The agency decided to take action after recent driving simulation studies showed that, in some patients, drug levels remained high enough to cause difficulty driving. The data came from company studies of Intermezzo, a new form of zolpidem which was approved in 2011 for people who wake late at night and can't get back to sleep. The data showed that 33 percent of women and 25 percent of men taking extended-release zolpidem had enough of the drug in their blood to interfere with driving as much as eight hours later. Zolpidem is present in sleeping aids including Zolpimist and has been found to have a much stronger effect on women than men . When the dose was cut in half only 15 percent of women and five percent of men had those same drug levels. FDA analysis was unable to determine why women metabolize zolpidem so much more slowly than men. According to FDA staff, the difference cannot be accounted for by usual factors like size and weight. For now, patients should continue taking their currently prescribed dose until they can talk to their doctor about the best way to proceed. ‘We really don't want people to change the dose they're on. We want them to talk to their health care provider,' Unger said. Ambien is marketed by Sanofi, Intermezzo by Purdue Pharma LP and Zolpimist by NovaDel Pharma Inc.","The FDA is forcing manufacturers of zolpidem, commonly sold as Ambien, to reduce recommended dosages after tests found it stays in the bloodstream .

The Florida college professor who is promoting conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook shooting refuses to stand down from his outrageous statements. 'I think that the entire country mourned about Sandy Hook and yet, once again, the investigation that journalistic institutions should have actually carried out never took place as far as I'm concerned,' James Tracy told a local television reporter on Wednesday. The . 47-year-old professor bases his outrageous allegations largely on the . flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the . shooting was released throughout the tragic day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Still at work: James Tracy, 47, has been teaching at Florida Atlantic University for 10 years and refuses to lessen his stance against the official version of events regarding the Sandy Hook shooting . 'While it sounds like an outrageous . claim, one is left to inquire whether the Sandy Hook shooting ever took . place -- at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the . nation's news media have described,' he wrote in his blog post. Now he adds that the confusion and so-called acceptance of the main stream version of events is telling of a larger problem. 'Well, I think that we need to as a society look at things more carefully. Perhaps we as a society have been conditioned to be duped,' he told Boca Raton's CBS 12. This interview comes just one day after a Newtown official called for the professor to be fired his incendiary statements. Patricia Llodra, the town selectwoman who has been helping Newtown deal with the logistics of the aftermath from the shooting, slammed Florida Atlantic University professor James Tracy after he made outrageous claims about the December 14 massacre. Placing blame: Tracy says that the national media has not done enough to unearth the 'truth' Outrages: Patricia Llodra (center), the town selectman for Newtown, says that Professor Tracy should be fired for his outlandish and insensitive claims . 'Shame on you, FAU, to even have someone like this on your payroll,' she said of the tenured communications professor. 'It . is outrageous and an insult to all caring people to think that this man . would chose this event as a stage for his outlandish conspiracy . theories,' she told FoxNews.com. Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the timeline of the Sandy Hook tragedy shows that there was a coordinated effort to hide the 'real' story . 'Professor Tracy is an embarrassment to me as an educator and should be to you as well,' Ms Llodra said. 'I can assure you, sadly, that the . events here in Newtown unfolded exactly as are being reported, with the . horrible outcome of the violent death of 26 innocent people, including . 20 children.' Mr Tracy, however, appears to think that what he was saying was in keeping with his role as an educator and asking both his students and the general public at large to review the events critically. 'I describe myself as a scholar and public intellectual interested in going more deeply into controversial public events. Although some may see (my theories) as beyond the pale, I am doing what we should be doing as academics,' he told the Sun Sentinel. As with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies, this is far from his first foray into the world of the unproven. Mr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations. On his blog, however, he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and Fukishima have all been topics of interest. Shut down: Sandy Hook Elementary School is now closed, seen here on January 3, but a professor in Florida argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed . Tragic: One of the points of professor James Tracy's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers . Even though he is paid to teach a class called Culture of Conspiracy which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas, Florida Atlantic University appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far. 'James Tracy does not speak for the university. The website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with FAU in any way. As for any previous disciplinary actions at FAU, we do not comment on personnel matters,' school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel. Though his ultimate end goal is unclear, he says that the end goal of the 'supposed' shooting was political in nature. Political ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns . Predictably, his statements have sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the still-grieving Connecticut town where much of the last three weeks has been spent picking up the pieces. 'Is there something in the water in Florida that makes for idiocy,' commented Ray Gillies on the story by the local ABC affiliate WPBF. 'How dare you suggest this was a hoax and entertain that this didn't happen,' said a Sun Sentinel reader with the username JimNasium1. 'I'm afraid that you do not seem to be worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my kids students of yours, I'd withdraw them from your roster within the hour.You are NOT good at what you do and you suck as a human being.' The moment he heard: Mr Tracy believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at Sandy Hook, and theoretically then this may not be the moment President Obama was told . Instead, he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog, memoryholeblog.com, and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory. 'As documents relating to the Sandy Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers, there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote. He argues that Senator Dianne Feinstein was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s, and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker. It is unclear if Mr Tracy has any vested interest in the gun control debate or if he himself owns any guns. Calls to Mr Tracy were not immediately returned.","Professor James Tracy asserts the shooting may have happened differently, if at all .

And after one of the family suitcases - containing nearly £2,000 of valuables - was lost during a coach transfer, the Byfords have spent months complaining to Thomas Cook and have finally been offered compensation for their holiday from hell - a £35 voucher. Michelle, 34, said: 'It was an absolute nightmare and we are disgusted with Thomas Cook. We are not snobs, we are just a normal family and £4,000 is a lot of money. 'All we expect is cleanliness and the actual holiday that we were sold. 'I can't put into words how angry I am and I will never ever use Thomas Cook again. 'What . hurt me most of all is that it was meant to be our last holiday all . together as a family and the place was just disgusting. Hellish holiday: This was the family's walk to the private beach after they thought they had bought a luxurious trip set in beautiful surroundings .

'My young daughter was really shaken up and crying, and she couldn't enjoy her holiday because she was so upset.' Ian, 43, took his family to Tunisia in 2011. While on holiday, his sons Jack, 17, Sam, 16, and daughter Charlie, 10, and the family planned to return to the area the following year - but wanted a hotel with spacious grounds and thrilling water slides. Michelle went into Thomas Cook's . Barnsley shop the following year and paid nearly £4,000 to book her . family's last holiday together. Michelle said: 'We explained to the in-store rep that we wanted to stay in the Soviva hotel because it was next to the port. 'She said she knew which hotel we meant, showed us the brochure and booked us two rooms for two weeks. 'We were told there was a sea view and that the door of the hotel lead onto the beach, which was privately owned by the hotel.' But when the hotel transport took the . Byford family miles past the port, it began to sink in that their . luxury break was not all it seemed. This was the view that greeted the Byfords, and Thomas Cook have only given them £35 compensation . The advertised Soviva Resort on the Thomas Cook website boasted an 'extensive and spacious resort' that was popular with families . The Byfords claim when they arrived at the hotel, they were shocked to see stray cats wandering through the hotel. Michelle said: 'The rugs in the hotel . corridor were wet through and as we walked in, the stench of cat wee . hit us. It was so strong that it made our eyes stream. 'The hotel's pool was filthy. The water was black and there was all sorts of mud and rubbish in it. 'That's when we saw the poo floating in the pool.' 'We then went to look at our private . beach and were horrified. We came out of the hotel and we had to walk . through all of the rotting toilets and rubbish. Charlie was really . distraught. 'There were dirty nappies and a sewage pipe on the beach, spilling out onto the sand. 'There was no way that I could have my kids staying there. It was obvious that I had been sold a false holiday.' The Byfords reported their disgust to the Thomas Cook rep who tried to get them moved to another hotel. They claim that the rep told them . that another family had been moved after complaining that morning - but . allegedly refused to move the Byfords unless they paid £300 for the new . hotel and £10 for a taxi to take them there. Michelle said: 'We were so angry, we should have been moved for free. 'The rep told us that all we could do was wait until we got home and go and make a complaint to the Barnsley shop staff. 'We managed to get a complaints form eventually after another rep listened to our story. 'She said it was disgusting that we had been charged to move hotels.' Michelle and Ian Byford, with their sons children Jack and Sam, say their luggage was lost and they have spent an extortionate amount ringing Thomas Cook . Michelle and Ian Byford say that they have spent weeks trying to get a refund from the holiday operator . Incredibly, in an email sent from . Thomas Cook in response to the family's complaint in December, they . state: 'We are careful to document that the areas surrounding your . holiday accommodation do not form part of your package holiday and are . therefore not inspected. 'As this is that case, we are unable to accept any responsibility for the condition of these areas. 'After reviewing your case and all of . the information available to me, I would like to offer you a . compensation payment in light of the disappointing conditions you were . greeted with on arrival at the Soviva Resort.' The Byfords tried to enjoy the rest . of their stay in the new hotel, but the money they had spent moving . meant they did not have any money for activities. The Soviva resort is rated as a . four-star establishment and is described on Thomas Cook's website as: 'A . popular choice for families with children or those seeking a lively . holiday, this extensive and spacious resort enjoys a wide range of . facilities as well as a varied animation programme.' On the day the Byfords were due to . leave, the family went to reception to wait for their airport transfer . bus which was due to arrive at 7.30am. By 8.30am they said the transport had not arrived and the Byfords began to panic. After more calls to Thomas Cook and . complaints to the reps, a 48-seater coach arrived at 9am to take them to . catch their 10am flight back to the UK. 'All we expect is cleanliness and the holiday that we were sold' Michelle said: 'We could not believe . it when this massive coach arrived. The driver was really rude and . rushed us all onto the coach and threw our suitcases on.' But when the family arrived at the airport, sons Jack and Sam could not find their suitcase. The suitcase contained a £399 . camcorder, three £30 toothbrushes and hundreds of pounds worth of new . clothes that the two boys had saved up to buy. The Byfords were forced to fly home on the 10am plane without the missing suitcase, or face paying for new flights. Michelle said: 'We made our first . complaint on 16 September and it wasn't until the end of November that . we found out we wouldn't be getting the suitcase back. 'We had to provide receipts for . everything in the case or we wouldn't get our money back. Luckily I had . the receipt for the camcorder, but who keeps receipts for clothes? 'We claimed £1,700 back for the case and only received £1,100 so are yet again, another £600 out of pocket.' As well as the charge for changing . hotels, the taxi and the lost items, the family have also spent huge . amounts on phone bills calling Thomas Cook every day to claim their . compensation. The family had an email confirmation of their complaint on 6 December which offered them £35 in compensation. Michelle said: 'We are absolutely . disgusted, our holiday was ruined and we are out of pocket by hundreds . and hundreds of pounds. It's been a living nightmare.' Initially Thomas Cook offered the couple £35 compensation for their ordeal. After the MailOnline contacted them, the tour operator said they contacted the family to arrange compensation and were investigating the issue. A Thomas Cook spokesman said: 'The hotel is closed for the winter and undergoing refurbishment. 'The family have this afternoon agreed to a refund of the £288 and a goodwill gesture of compensation of £500.'","Family saw human excrement floating in hotel's pool .

Wood used as a biofuel could make air pollution worse and cause almost 1,400 deaths a year in Europe, scientists have warned. Trees grown as a biofuel have been seen as a greener, cleaner alternative to fossil fuels but could be having a detrimental effect on air quality. According to a new report they release a chemical into the air that, when mixed with other pollutants, can damage human health and reduce crop yields. The red hotspots show where deaths are expected to rise the most as a result of trees planted as biofuel crops. ‘Growing biofuels is thought to be a good thing because it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,’ said Nick Hewitt, who worked on the study with colleagues from at Lancaster University. ‘What we're saying is “yes, that's great, but biofuels could also have a detrimental effect on air quality. ‘Large-scale production of biofuels in Europe would have small but significant effects on human mortality and crop yields. ‘As far as we know, no one has looked at the air quality of growing biofuel crops before.’The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looked into the impact of a European Union scheme to slow climate change by producing more biofuels. A similar impact would be expected wherever biofuels were produced in large quantities in areas suffering air pollution, including the United States and China. Poplar, willow or eucalyptus trees, all used as fast-growing sources of renewable wood fuel, emit high levels of the chemical isoprene as they grow, the study said. Isoprene forms toxic ozone when mixed with other air pollutants in sunlight. The report estimated that ozone from wood-based energy to meet the European Union's 2020 goal would cause nearly 1,400 premature deaths a year, costing society £4.4 billion ($7.1bn). The European plan would also reduce the annual value of wheat and maize production by £900 million ($1.5bn) since ozone impairs crop growth, the study added. Changes in monthly mean ozone levels in July caused by trees grown for biofuel. Red shows the highest rises. Air pollution from extra isoprene is likely to reduce wheat and maize crops. Red indicates the worst hit areas. Other scientists said the findings showed that the impact of biofuels on human health needs to be taken into consideration when planning crops. But they said it is one of many factors and that the advantages of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels should not be ignored. Dr Angela Karp, Scientific Director of the Cropping Carbon Institute Programme, Rothamsted Research, did not see the study’s findings being a reason to reverse the UK’s biofuels policies. ‘It is well known that many trees emit isoprene and efforts have been placed on reducing this,’ she said. ‘We have flagged this up as a target for research, pointing out that reducing isoprene emissions from willow would not only reduce greenhouse gases but reduce loss of carbon from the plant. ‘Having said that, at least one previous publication I know of does not suggest that the levels harm air quality. ‘For all these reasons we do not see that the UK needs to reconsider its interest in biofuels.’ Wheat is one of the crops likely to suffer a fall in yield. Prof Ottoline Leyser, of the University of Cambridge, added: ‘There are many different biofuel crops, cultivation methods, production and processing systems post-harvest, and different final biofuels. ‘Each one has advantages and disadvantages, which must be compared to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative options. ‘The key is to ensure that the policies driving biofuel development and adoption are properly formulated to take account of these complexities.’ Siting new biofuel plantations far away from polluted population centres would help limit ozone formation, the study suggested. Genetic engineering might be used to reduce isoprene emissions, it said. Ozone can cause lung problems and is blamed for killing about 22,000 people a year in Europe. Overall air pollution, mainly from fossil fuels, causes about 500,000 premature deaths in Europe a year, according to the European Environment Agency. He noted that the main reason to shift to biofuels was to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, mainly from fossil fuels, that U.N. studies project will become ever more damaging this century. The United Nations' World Health Organization estimates global warming has caused more than 140,000 deaths annually worldwide since the 1970s. The biggest impact was recorded in developing nations where floods, droughts and other disasters blamed on climate change left millions of people suffering from diarrhoea, malnutrition, malaria and dengue fever. Burning biofuels is viewed as neutral for climate change because plants soak up carbon when they grow and release it when they burn or rot. Fossil fuels, by contrast, add carbon to the atmosphere from underground stores millions of years old.","Isoprene released by trees can produce oxone in the atmosphere .

Reforms to stop elderly people having to sell their homes to pay for care will be passed into law before 2015, Nick Clegg revealed today. The Deputy Prime Minister sought to diffuse growing anger about coalition delays in overhauling the social care system, two years after a commission called for a cap on the amount individuals are expected to pay. The move comes amid warnings that elderly people have suffered ‘an abominable betrayal’ over social care. Every year, at least 20,000 people have to sell their homes to pay for care but the coalition is to legislate to cap costs in the future . The coalition’s Mid-Term Review, published yesterday, did little to suggest any progress was likely to be made soon. But Mr Clegg today told MPs the government would ‘enshrine’ in law the principle of capping care costs, with the taxpayers picking up the rest of the tab. Under England’s current system, pensioners with assets of £23,500 or more – including the value of their homes – have to pay unlimited care charges. It means that every year, at least 20,000 have to sell their homes to pay for care. Deputy PM Nick Clegg revealed the government would legislate before 2015 . Two years ago an independent commission led by economist Andrew Dilnot suggested these charges should be subject to a lifetime cap of around £35,000, with the state paying the rest. The measure is designed to stop pensioners being forced to sell their homes to cover costs. It is understood the coalition is likely to opt for a cap of around £75,000. Mr Clegg revealed the government will set out legislation on introducing a cap within weeks which ‘will address this issue of how to avoid individuals and households facing catastrophic costs in funding their care’. Speaking in the Commons he added: ‘We have said all along that we believe in the principles and basic models set out by Andrew Dilnot. ‘Of course there is an issue about how we pay for this in future, but as you quite rightly identify the first step is to enshrine this approach in legislation which we will be seeking to do during this parliament.’ Treasury opposition to a multi-billion pound reform of the care system has been blamed for the lack of progress to date. Last week care minister Norman Lamb pleaded with the Chancellor George Osborne to ‘get on with it’. ‘My absolute determination is to get the principle in legislation so we have that debate rather than it remaining in the long grass,’ he told MailOnline. It came after his predecessor, Paul Burstow, suggested curbing the winter fuel allowance for all but the poorest pensioners to raise £1.5billion-a-year to help pay for the reforms. In the Commons today, Mr Burstow said the Mid-Term Review only committed to the principles of a cap and reform of means-testing ‘to end the care lottery that we have in this country’. He called on Mr Clegg to ‘now go further than just looking at principles and commit the Government to introducing the legislation during the life of this parliament… to give people the peace of mind they deserve’. Meanwhile Professor John Ashton, incoming president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the generation who established the welfare system were being let down by a lack of funding. The number of elderly people receiving daycare from their councils has fallen by nearly a quarter since 2009 . ‘The elderly are frightened of what is going to happen to them. There is a debt of honour we owe the elderly. ’They fought in World War Two or contributed to the war effort and wanted to create a secure environment that came to be known as the welfare state which is now being portrayed as dependants and layabouts. It is an abominable betrayal,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘Social care has to be properly funded and all parties are avoiding this issue. Without proper funding we are going to have more and more care scandals.’ Yesterday Prime Minister David Cameron insisted that the coalition Government would set out reforms to cap ""the potentially huge cost"" of social care, but Prof Ashton claimed ministers were ‘fiddling while Rome burns’.","Nick Clegg reveals legislation will be introduced in this Parliament .

Scientists have developed a synthetic 'poo' that could cure nasty intestinal infections caused by the superbug Clostridium difficile. C. Diff is a toxin-producing bacteria that can multiply in the gut when healthy bacteria have been wiped out by antibiotics. It causes severe diarrhoea and other intestinal disease and can be fatal. Faecal transplants may be an uncomfortable subject, but stools from healthy people have been used for some time to treat patients suffering from the hospital infection. The bacteria from a stool transplant can effectively ‘reset’ the gut, allowing the body to overcome the infection. Emma Allen-Vercoe looks at her stool substitute being created in the Robogut . But while the transplants have been successful, the 'ick' factor makes it difficult for many patients to accept them. There is also a small risk of passing on unknown pathogens from the donor that could later cause disease. Now scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada have developed a substitute called RePOOPulate to replace human faecal matter. They tested it on two elderly patients with chronic C.Diff infections, in a study published and also tested negative for the superbug six months later. 'It's an exciting finding,' said microbiologist Emma Allen-Vercoe, who developed the treatment. Interestingly, the two patients didn't see the return of C. Diff despite taking further antibiotics later on for other infections. Unusual experiment: The Robogut at the University of Guelph . Clostridium difficile can overtake the guts of hospital patients .

Tragic: Banker Nico Lambrechts, seen in a holiday snap with wife Adele, fell to his death at London's Coq d'Argent restaurant in October last year . A banker who jumped to his death from the terrace of an exclusive London restaurant was under 'enormous pressure' at work and struggling to pay his children's school fees, an inquest heard this morning. Nico Lambrechts fell seven floors from the Coq d'Argent restaurant, a notorious suicide spot, just months after starting a job at investment bank Investec. City of London Coroner's Court heard how the father of three became stressed over a forthcoming move back to South Africa, and had been unable to transfer money from his home country to fund his children's education. Mr . Lambrechts died of multiple injuries last October after climbing over . the wall surrounding the restaurant's terrace, minutes after a long . phone conversation with his wife which was captured on CCTV. The restaurant has now taken steps to deter suicide attempts after four people died there in the past five years. Mr Lambrechts' GP, Mark Jenkins, told the hearing that the banker was largely healthy. 'I . understand from his widow that he was under an enormous amount of . pressure from his new work which must have become unbearable,' the . doctor said. The . inquest heard that when the South African first moved to London he had . been given a lot of help by his firm, but that when he was scheduled to . move back he had to make most arrangements himself. Suicide: Mr Lambrechts jumped to his death in the internal atrium of the building in the City of London . Site: Police stand at the spot where Mr Lambrechts fell to his death . Domenico Ferrini, who hired Mr . Lambrechts at Investec in June last year, said that the banker had . joined the company shortly before it was due to move its headquarters to . Cape Town. 'He was very interested to start with and it was a wonderful opportunity within our growing business,' he said. 'I . think there were a few things he was worried about. Relocating back to . South Africa concerned him and the political climate there - was it the . right thing? 'The . transition of being very successful in his previous job, and having to . re-establish himself at Investec. I tried to help him find his feet, . that kind of thing.' 'Pressure': An inquest heard Mr Lambrechts, who fell to his death from the terrace of the restaurant at the top of the No1 Poultry in the City, had become stressed over a forthcoming move to South Africa . Another colleague, Duncan Coombe, said Mr Lambrechts had expressed concerns about his financial arrangements ahead of the move. 'He . couldn't claim access to his salary as he was being paid in South . Africa,' he said. 'He had school fees for his children to pay and this . was causing him concern.' PC Trish Robinson, who investigated the death, told the inquest that CCTV footage made it clear the death was 'a very deliberate act', and suggested that Mr Lambrechts had been 'at a very low ebb'. She added: 'On one occasion he had said he was going to be home and he hadn't turned up. His wife had been trying to get hold of him. 'Later on he said he had felt very low, he had been sitting somewhere and contemplated suicide.' Coroner Roy Palmer said: 'I don't think there's any suggestion it was an accident. It was plainly a deliberate act. 'I think on the totality of the evidence I have to ensure, and I am sure that he intended to die by his actions. You do not go down seven floors and over a wall without that.' A spokesman for the City of London said that authorities were in talks with Coq d'Argent to raise the barriers surrounding the terrace to around 2m, and added that a security guard was now being deployed on the roof to deter future suicide attempts.

The distraught parents of a child who died in hospital just eight hours after she was born have called for changes after claiming staff failed to respond to warning signs. Simon and Mary-Jayne Harrison are not pursuing compensation, but they want Southend Hospital, Essex, to apologise and admit liability over the death over their daughter Jessica. They want to ensure staff are properly trained to assess when a heart monitor flags up an issue so that no more parents have to suffer the agony of losing a child like they did. Simon and Mary-Jayne Harrison and their 21-month . old daughter Rebecca: They want Southend Hospital to apologise . and admit liability over the death over their daughter Jessica, who died . at just eight hours old . Complications during labour meant Jessica wasn’t breathing when she was born and had inhaled meconium - a baby’s first stool passed when in distress in the womb. She also had a second infection from the placenta and had to be revived, but she died when she was just eight hours old. Mr and Mrs Harrison claim warning signs of their baby's distress weren’t taken seriously by staff, and that they waited so long for an emergency caesarean that Jessica instead had to be delivered using forceps. 'The cord was around her neck and she had inhaled meconium so it was pouring from her nose and mouth,' said Mrs Harrison, 28. 'If the caesarean section had been done at 3am when we signed the papers, or earlier if they’d listened to our concerns about the warning bleeps on the monitor, my daughter would have stood more of a chance to fight the infections.' Jessica lies in intensive care at Southend Hospital: Complications during labour meant Jessica wasn¿t breathing when she was born and had inhaled meconium - a baby¿s first stool passed when in distress in the womb . Mr Harrison, 29, a teacher at St . Thomas More School, Westcliff-on-Sea Essex, said: 'The monitor was . flashing up concerns, but we were told there might be something wrong . with the machine and they reset it. 'They should’ve taken it more seriously. 'Though . the waters broke at 8pm and there was no sign of meconium, the monitors . and also Mary-Jayne’s high temperature were indications of a problem.' Looking forward: Mr and Mrs Harrison are not looking for compensation but they want to make sure staff are properly trained to potential problems . Mrs Harrison was told her fever was a . side effect of the epidural, but she had no problem with her first . child, Rebecca, who is now 21 months. Her husband added: 'There must be a point where they have to take all these problems seriously.' An emergency caesarean was decided at 3am, but another woman considered more urgent was admitted to theatre first. The . parents, from Leigh, were told a second theatre could be opened if . there was no more progress in an hour, but nothing happened until 6am . when Mrs Harrison needed to push. Staff worked for half an hour to get Jessica breathing and she was rushed to the special care baby unit. However doctors warned the couple their child may be brain dead or severely brain damaged. Mr and Mrs Harrison made the heartbreaking decision to turn off Jessica’s life support at 3.15pm on September 30 last year. She weighed a healthy 7lbs 12oz. 'We were distraught. Jessica should’ve survived if things were taken seriously and they had acted sooner,' said Mr Harrison. Mrs Harrison added: 'It was so unexpected. She was a healthy baby. 'This Christmas was horrible but we had to make it special for Rebecca. I went to a cold grave to see my baby girl when it should’ve been her first Christmas. 'I feel so sad for Rebecca to never know her sister. It’s so wrong.' Pupils where Mr Harrison teaches have been busy fundraising for Great Ormond Street Hospital in memory of his daughter. St Thomas More have held two charity weeks raising money for the hospital where Jessica was due to be transferred to for specialist treatment, but sadly never made it. Mr Harrison was also treated there as a four-year-old boy for a non-malignant tumour behind his eye. Students have raised about £3,000 from a charity seafront walk and other events held in school and an online page has £1,360 donations. To make a donation visit www.justgiving.com/jessicaharrison . Mr and Mrs Harrison have called for the hospital to apologise and admit liability, but they are not pursuing a compensation claim. The couple want to ensure changes are made so that staff are properly trained to assess when potential problems appear on heart monitor monitors, so no other parent has to go through the the grief they have suffered. They also called for high risk pregnancies to be scanned towards the end of a birth to show difficulties with the placenta, and the cord and blood tests to be done to check for infection levels. An inquest is yet to be held into Jessica’s death. Southend Hospital says it has supported the family with meetings with clinicians and the head of midwifery and set up counselling for them. Sue Hardy, director of nursing, said: 'We fully understand the distress the loss of a baby brings and once again offer our sincerest condolences to Mr and Mrs Harrison in their grief following the death of baby Jessica. 'The family have met with our clinical teams and our head of midwifery and we will continue to support and advise them during this very difficult pre-inquest period.'","Parents want Southend Hospital to apologise and admit liability over the death of their newborn .

A four-year-old boy is taking his first steps after undergoing an expensive private operation to overcome tightness in his muscles. Corin Potts was diagosed with cerebral palsy after having a brain scan when he was 18-months-old and has only been able to walk using a frame. At the start of 2012 his parents started a fundraising campaign to pay for a special procedure to loosen his legs as it is not routinely available on the NHS. However, they had to redouble their efforts after callous thieves stole money from their fund. Scroll down for video . Corin when he was a few months old (left) and standing tall today (right). He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 18months. He is already sleeping better since he had the operation a few weeks ago . The lively youngster went in for the operation at the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol on December 11. He has now been at home for 10 days and his delighted parents say they have already seen an improvement in his condition. His father James Potts, 31, said: 'Straight away we saw the difference, immediately he was sleeping better. Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.Source: SCOPE . 'We won't see the real results yet but . all Corin's spasticity has gone and he's not tight anymore. He used to . be really tight in the groin, hamstrings and calves but that's gone now. 'He is not in any pain anymore and is . sleeping a lot better. He has got lots of dexterity in his hands and is . eating by himself with a knife and fork. 'He couldn't hold a pen properly before and would hold it like a baby would a crayon but now he can hold a pen. 'We didn't expect it to be so obvious. Just the fact he is having a good night's sleep is worth the effort for . us. 'The main thing for us was for Corin to have the freedom and dignity . to be able to take himself to the toilet and I am happy with that.' Parents James and Faye Weeks wanted their son to have a procedure called  selective dorsal rhizotomy. It . involves cutting faulty nerve endings in the spinal cord in order to . loosen the legs and make them more agile. However, they faced the mammoth task . of raising £35,000 for the operation after they were told their local . Trust would not pay for it. Disaster then struck last August . after £1,400 from the charity fund was stolen after callous thieves . broke into a community centre safe. Mr Potts, Corin's father, said at the time he was 'gutted that one or two people have let everyone down like this'. But the determined family redoubled their efforts and had raised the amount in time for Christmas. Corin with his proud parents James and Faye: He should be able to walk unassisted in the coming months following intense physiotherapy . This CCTV shows the moment two heartless thieves stole £1,400 from a charity saving for an operation to help Corin walk . The postman added that his son could now cross his legs which meant he would be able to sit with the other children at school rather than on a chair away from the rest of his class. James, a postman, said: 'It is the little things like that. People think of the operation as a miracle cure for walking but it is also about giving him the chance to be like every other child.' Corin Potts when he was just a couple of hours old. His spasticity has gone since his operation according to his father . Corin is building up the strength in his legs to help him walk and he is doing physiotherapy every day. His parents have also been taking the youngster swimming and cycling so that the work is more fun. James said the family is so appreciative to all the people who helped their son have the surgery and wanted to send his thanks to as many people as possible. But he also hopes that successful operations on youngsters like Corin will be taken into account when funding of SDR is reconsidered. He said: 'I can't see how they can't say it is justified after the success on a number of Americans, where they have been doing it for 25 years. 'I think it should be available on the NHS, or at least there should be some help. 'It's massive, who wouldn't pay £35,000 for being able to get a good night's sleep for 70 years or so, or being able to go to the toilet by yourself. Children don't choose to have cerebral palsy. 'And he has probably cost £35,000 already in terms of mobility cars and his wheelchair.'

Many strains of norovirus are circulating the population but most people taken ill have contracted the newest variant . Most of the 1.2million people taken ill with the winter vomiting bug caught a new strain of the virus that came from Australia, according to health experts. The variant, called Sydney 2012, has become the 'dominant strain' and may explain the huge rise in the number of cases. In October, when the number of cases started to increase, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) performed genetic testing of norovirus strains in England and Wales. They found a 'cocktail of different strains' that were circulating around the population. But according to recent analysis published in Eurosurveillance, Sydney 2012 - first identified in Australia last year - has overtaken all others to become the dominant strain. While other strains are still in circulation, Sydney 2012 is responsible for the majority of recent cases in England and Wales. Recent figures suggest that it affected 150,000 people over Christmas. But health officials said that Sydney 2012, which has also been identified by health experts in France, New Zealand and Japan, does not cause more serious illness than other strains. The HPA said yesterday there have been 4,140 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus so far this season - but for every reported case, an estimated 288 are not flagged up. This means as many as 1.19 million people could have contracted the illness this season - a 63 per cent rise on the previous year. Dr David Brown, director of Virology Reference Department at the HPA, said: 'It is always difficult to predict the norovirus season and this year is no different. 'Noroviruses mutate rapidly and new strains are constantly emerging. 'At the start of the season it is normal for outbreaks to be caused by a range of different strains. However, as the season progresses particular strains are more successful and become dominant. 'The emergence of a new strain does not mean that it causes more serious illness.' Prevention: Frequent hand washing is the best way to stop contracting norovirus . He said there is no treatment for norovirus other than to let the illness take its course with symptoms normally lasting about two days. Norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces and objects. It is known to spread rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes. Last month hospitals said they have been so overwhelmed by people suffering fromsickness bugs that paramedics were forced to care for 999 patients. Ambulances were left queuing outside several hospitals in Greater Manchester - including Wythenhsawe Hospital, Pennine Acute Trust'sNorth Manchester General, Royal Oldham, Rochdale Infirmary and Fairfield Hospital in Bury. Symptoms include sudden vomiting, diarrhoea, or both, a temperature, headache and stomach cramps. The bug usually goes away within a few days. Although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year, activity increases in the winter months, with most cases seen between January and March. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say norovirus causes 21 million illnesses a year, with 70,000 cases requiring hospitalisation and around 800 ending in death. Ian Goodfellow, a scientist who has studied norovirus for 10 years, describes it as ""the Ferrari of the virus world"" and ""one of the most infectious viruses of man"".","Most people taken ill with norovirus caught the strain Sydney 2012 .

A new treatment could help peanut allergy sufferers get over their potentially deadly intolerance to the popular pub snack. Trials of sublingual immunotherapy treatments, where patients are given doses of allergens in gradually increasing amounts, suggest the technique could one day be used as a cure for the allergy. However, experts carried out the tests under strict conditions and have warned people not to try a similar experiment themselves. Around one in a 100 people in the U.S. and UK is allergic to peanuts, and reactions range from mere watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. Potential cure: Around one in a 100 people in . the U.S. and UK is allergic to peanuts, and reactions range from mere . watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. Now U.S. researchers believe they have a cure . For sufferers even eating a tiny amount of peanut can lead to a deadly reaction. Many must carry around special medicines like epinephrine-containing pens for emergency treatment in case they eat contaminated food. The prevalence of peanut allergy is increasing, however there is as yet no clinical treatment available for sufferers other than strict dietary elimination. New research published in the the . Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology this month however shows that . giving patients gradually increasing doses of a liquid containing . peanut powder could help them to build up a tolerance. Life saver: Until now, the only way sufferers could the allergy was to avoid peanuts and carry an epipen (pictured) in case they came into contact . The patients first hold the liquid under the tongue for 2 minutes and then swallow it. Dr Wesley Burks, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said the results of the research were 'encouraging'. 'The immune response was stronger than we thought it might be, and the side effects of this treatment were relatively small,' he said, . 'However, the magnitude of the therapeutic effect was somewhat less than we had anticipated. That's an issue we plan to address in future studies.' Dr Burks and Dr David Fleischer, of National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado, recruited 40 peanut allergy sufferers aged between 12 and 37, and randomly gave them either daily peanut sublingual therapy or a placebo. All were given a baseline oral food challenge of up to 2g of peanut powder to test how much peanut powder they could consume without symptoms. After 44 weeks, all were given a second oral food challenge. Mild: . Severe: . Those who were able to consume either 5g, or at least 10-fold more peanut powder than their baseline amount, were considered to be responders (i.e., desensitised to peanut). At 44 weeks, 70 per cent of those who received peanut therapy were responders, compared to 15 per cent of those who were given the placebo. Among the responders, the median amount of peanut powder they could successfully consume without symptoms increased from 3.5 to 496 milligrams. After 68 weeks, that amount increased significantly, to 996 milligrams. Of 10,855 peanut doses given through week 44 of the study, 63.1 per cent were symptom-free. When oral and pharyngeal symptoms were excluded from the analysis, 95.2 per cent of doses were symptom-free. The study concluded that peanut sublingual therapy safely induced desensitisation in a majority of participants compared to a placebo, and that the longer that treatment continued the more peanut powder they could safely eat. However, Dr Burks cautions, this is not a treatment that people should try on their own. For now it's a treatment that should only be given by medical professionals in a carefully monitored clinical trial, he said.","Around one in a 100 people in the UK is allergic to peanuts .

A curfew has been imposed for the past three days in parts of the city which has a population of around 400,000. Last night officers described the situation as 'peaceful and under control'. Hindus make up around 80 per cent of the population of Dhule and there have been several violent clashes with the Muslim minority over the last few decades. In 2008 mass riots in the city led to the deaths of 10 people.","Police resorted to using live rounds after being attacked by rioters hurling bricks and acid .

Leaflets we can't understand, emollient twaddle about ‘relationships' with people we don't know (or want as new fake friends), charges we weren't expecting, and, if we're really doing well, a free fake leather cover for our cheque book. As far as I am concerned, bank managers still (erroneously) think they are doing us a favour, when it ought to be the other way round. Recently, I decided to change banks, after my manager's assistant (who I had never met) told me they were allowing me to keep a joint account 'as a favour'. Bank managers still think they are doing us a favour, when it ought to be the other way round... This account had only a few hundred quid in it, and was being used to pay household bills. My other accounts were always in credit. Model customer, you might think, except this snooty bank (Coutts) acted like I was a penniless nuisance. They charged me £150 a quarter on the joint account, ludicrous when there were so few transactions. I decided to move to HSBC, but then my stress levels really started to soar. It's taken five weeks, four different people writing me strings of emails, dozens of incomprehensible forms, and I've ended up with two managers at two different branches! According to Janet, snooty banks treated her like a penniless pest and charged her extortionate fees . They decided my company credit card could have only a £1,000 limit (even though I was bringing a large business savings account) as if I was an ignorant student, and not someone who has made a living as a broadcaster and writer for over 40 years. Then, they had the cheek to announce the limit would be increased ‘as a gesture of goodwill' in the light of problems moving my accounts. This makes me even crosser. I don't need a favour, just what I am entitled to  — respect! Stuff a relationship, what about service? I went to two meetings of an hour and a half each, and now another manager wants to meet ‘to cement our relationship'. No chance. Banks should be there to serve us, not provide staff with chances to have a coffee and see the inside of our house or office. Banks need to start treating their clients a lot better to prevent the souring relationship between banker and customer . I am not very welcome as a customer because I don't need a mortgage, a loan and advice on investments. I am one of those irritating crumblies who manages to remain afloat all by myself — something banks aren't keen on when they can charge big fees if we exceed our overdraft. Which? magazine reports that only one in ten of us read the small print when switching banks, because the information they provide is so confusing. HSBC — and I can vouch for this — hits the jackpot with a 29,000-word document that takes around an hour and a half to read! I am not interested in internet banking, all I want is statements and cash out of a machine. I haven't even got the details of the ‘free' travel insurance they promised four weeks ago. Then they sent a form asking me to rate my ‘experience'. I put a great big cross right through it — are they paying me to do their research? It's not surprising that only 40 per cent of ‘extremely dissatisfied' customers (less than 4 per cent of all of us) can face the trauma of switching banks. Next year, things should improve following a report by the Independent Commission on Banking. Under the new rules, by September 2013, changing banks should take fewer than seven days. If we suffer any inconvenience, we should be able to claim compensation. Good luck! You'll still get a free credit-card wallet easier than a new business loan. Meanwhile, Douglas Flint, the Chairman of HSBC, says he'd like bankers to sign up to an oath, like doctors, and be monitored by an independent body enforcing a code of conduct. One of the proposed rules would require bankers ‘to act honestly and fairly at all times when dealing with clients'. I'd go further, how about remembering that old adage ‘the customer is always right'? Mr Flint is said to be looking for new non-executive directors for his board — I'm available and waiting for his call. Larry taught me how to steal the show . Dallas baddie: Larry as JR Ewing . Cheerio, Larry Hagman, you'll be missed. Larry was one of the most entertaining actors I ever encountered, far more eccentric than his on-screen persona as the ultimate baddie in Dallas. When we met at a dinner party in London in the early Eighties, he was smoking a large joint, and announced he spent every Sunday at his home in Malibu in silence, in order to preserve his sanity. Larry was fabulously indiscreet about his Dallas co-stars and revealed that when contract re-negotiations were in full swing, everyone tried to get in front of the cameras (even when they were not needed) as much as possible to build up their ratings. It got so bad that he and Bobby Ewing (played by Patrick Duffy) were patting each other on the back, shaking hands and sidling up to each other so frequently, they were told off! He taught me loads of valuable tricks about how to upstage rivals on a show, many of which I still employ today. What a fabulous man. So far, I'm dead disappointed . Detective Sarah Lund takes aim . The new series of The Killing is proving to be a struggle. Detective Sarah Lund (right) remains as compelling as ever, but this drama seems to be using too many of the same stock shots of the city at night we already saw in Danish political thriller Borgen. Who cares about dreary party leaders rushing up and down dim corridors in government offices, vying to form a coalition government? The leading lady looks as if she hasn't slept for weeks, and seems to have aged ten years since Series 2. The action takes place  in the dark, and the budget cuts the police are coping with seem to mean every office is lit with a single bulb. So far, I'll award The Killing just six out of ten. What makes celebrities happy? Jamie Lee Curtis on the red carpet . To raise money for a new museum of British illustration in London, artists were tasked with turning the lists of what makes celebrities happy into pictures to be auctioned at Sotheby's next month. Quentin Blake drew David Walliams swimming while his wife Lara Stone stands on the riverbank with a stopwatch, surrounded by spaghetti, pyjamas and their dog chewing on a shoe. Jamie Lee Curtis (right) picked clogs, cereal with milk, and a black T-shirt (by trendy Jil Sander, not just any old garment). Jeremy Paxman chose Evelyn Waugh's Decline And Fall and Bollito Misto (an Italian dish of boiled meats), which sounds rather pretentious. Other celebs included Ruby Wax, Brian Eno and Florence Welch. I wasn't honoured, but I doubt whether an illustration of my list would have fetched much. Black pudding for breakfast, a walk in the rain, cotton M&S knickers, and pink turnips from my veg plot.

A couple have been told their six-year-old daughter has a premature ageing syndrome that means she won't reach her teens - and their unborn baby has it as well. Ella Barden, six, was diagnosed with Cockayne Syndrome in November after years of tests. The condition affects one in 500,000 people and sufferers have an average life expectancy of 12 years. Now her six-months pregnant mother, Jodie, has discovered her unborn daughter also has the condition, after testing positive. Parents Jodie and Luke have drawn up a bucket list for their daughter Ella . Jodie when she was one (left) and with her mother Jodie now (right). They realised something was wrong with Ella when she was nine-months-old but she was only diagnosed in November . Jodie and her husband Luke, both 27, also have a two-year-old son Alex who doesn't have the syndrome. The mother from Witham in Essex, said: 'We have to take it day by day and . can't look too far in the future as it is just too upsetting and we have . got to try and keep positive. 'Somehow Alex will have to deal with losing two sisters.' Cockayne Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. Features include a failure to gain weight, an underdeveloped nervous system, small head size and extreme sensitivity to sunlight. Sufferers typically don't reach their teens and usually die from pneumonia. Mrs Barden said: 'We are absolutely devastated. Everytime she gets ill you think, is this it?' The couple first knew something was wrong with Ella when was nine-months-old. She had stopped growing and putting on weight. She underwent numerous tests including two MRI scans but nothing was picked up for five years. Jodie gave up her job as a graphic designer last August to look after Ella. Ella with brother Alex, 2, who doesn't have the disease. Their parents are both carriers of Cockayne Syndrome meaning each child had a one in four chance of developing it . Ella at birth: Her parents had no idea they were carriers of a rare genetic disorder . In November, a geneticist at Great Ormond Street Hospital warned the family it could be Cockayne Syndrome. Jodie said: 'I went home and Googled it and unfortunately it was fitting and I thought 'Oh my God' that might be it.' Ella, who attends a local special school, can only say a few words and cannot walk.  There is no prognosis for how it will affect her in future but it is likely she will age prematurely. Jodie and Luke have set up a bucket list of activities such as ice skating and swimming with dolphins which Ella can enjoy before she becomes too ill. Meanwhile they must face the devastating fact that their unborn baby will also face an untimely death. Jodie, who is due to give birth in April, said she decided to continue her pregnancy as: 'I would still have to give birth to my child and I would rather know I had given my child happy memories and given her a chance to love life and live it happily and to enjoy life.' Ella's mother said: 'She is such a lovely girl and very loving' She added: 'It is not going to be easy in the end and I have thought about that lots, endlessly,but at the end of the day I have still got to bear her either way.' Jodie and Luke, a HGV driver, both carry the gene for the syndrome but are not aware of anyone in their families having suffered from it. Jodie said: 'It is one small chance us meeting and both having the gene. 'We have been through the blame thing, but only blaming ourselves. We can't do that, we can't let everything fall apart. 'My worst fear in life, when we didn't know what was wrong with her, was we were worried if it was something absolutely devastating. Now my worst fear has been realised. 'We have got to deal with it and get on with it and try and keep positive. We have to stick together as it will make us stronger.' Her family are raising money for the bucket list and to raise money for research into the syndrome. 'We have got to make memories with Ella,' said Jodie. 'She doesn't want us to be upset, she wants us to be happy. She is such a lovely girl and very loving. 'Everyday is special when you know it is coming to an end.'

Nicola Moss, 29, was shamed into shedding the stones after a woman offered her a seat on her morning commute - mistakenly thinking she was pregnant. Embarrassed Nicola hit the gym and began a strict diet - and the pounds were soon melting away. And when her younger sister, Victoria, 26, saw how much weight she'd shed, she decided to sign up to the same diet - terrified she'd be known as the 'fat sister'. After six months of spurring each other on through the tough times, the sisters, from Wansdworth, London, have lost almost 10 stone between them - and can now both slip into a size 10. Older sister Nicola pictured before and after remarkable weight loss . Nicola said: 'We have always been bigger than our other sisters - we are both quite tall so we've always just thought we are not meant to be skinny people. 'I'd noticed I was struggling to fit . in my size 18 clothes, but it wasn't until the day someone assumed I was . pregnant that I actually did anything about my weight. 'I'd . managed to find a dress that I thought was quite flattering, but as . soon as I stepped onto the train this lady looked at my stomach, smiled . and offered me her seat. 'I . could have died of embarrassment. I couldn't bring myself to tell her . that I wasn't pregnant, so I just said that I was getting off at the . next stop. 'I went straight home in tears - and the first thing I did was log onto my computer and start looking up diets. Younger sister Victoria pictured  before and after her impressive weight loss . Nicola said she noticed she was struggling to fit in size 18 clothes, 'but it wasn't until the day someone assumed I was pregnant that I actually did anything about my weight' 'I remembered seeing Frankie Essex had lost weight on the Cambridge Weight Plan, so I signed up the same day.' Within a few weeks, retail manager Nicola had lost more than a stone - and was the envy of her younger sister. And after realising that Nicola was melting away before her eyes, Victoria also pledged to sign up to Cambridge - and like her sister, started shedding the pounds. Since joining the plan in July, 5ft 8in Nicola has lost a staggering four and a half stone - shrinking from a whopping 15st 12lb and struggling to squeeze into a size 18 dress to a slender 11st 6lb - and a size 10 to 12. And sister Victoria, who is 6ft tall,  now weighs just 12st 2lb - after originally tipping the scales at just under 17st. The sisters say: 'Our mum is so proud of us - she can't believe how much weight we have lost' Victoria, a teaching assistant, said: 'We've both managed to keep on track thanks to a bit of sisterly competition. 'When we were bigger, we used to convince each other that we were never supposed to be skinny girls - that we didn't have the skinny gene. 'But now, we've started to convince each other that there's no reason we can't fit into a size 10 - and we've helped each other get there. 'We were inconstant competition to keep up with each other's weight loss, and that kept us going.' Nicola added: 'One night when our weight loss had had slowed a bit, I remember standing at the fridge, rummaging for chocolate. 'Then my phone beeped with a message, and it was Victoria saying she'd lost four pounds that week - I slammed the fridge shut straight away. 'We've both joined a gym and we try to go to work out together - it's so much easier when there's someone else egging you on. 'If you'd told us both we'd have been going to a gym a year ago we'd have both said you were mad - but it's true! 'Our mum is so proud of us - she can't believe how much weight we have lost. 'We keep getting compliments wherever we go and it's a great feeling. 'Over Christmas, we actually lost weight, rather than put it on - it was amazing. 'I'm sure we'll help each other motivated enough to keep it off too.'","Nicola Moss, 29, was shamed into shedding weight after woman offered her a seat on commute thinking she was pregnant .

The population of wild lions in Africa is estimated to be as low as 15,000 . The west African lion is on the verge of extinction, according to experts after a marked decline in recent years. It is estimated there are just 645 genetically distinct wild lions left in western and central Africa, with as few as 34 remaining in the whole of Nigeria. Now experts from conservation group LionAid say they are ‘in real danger of extinction’. According to the group, there are no lions left in 25 African countries and populations are barely surviving in ten. Clusters of lions remain in Burkina Faso, Niger, the Central African Republic, Cameroon and Chad but are already extinct in countries such as Ghana, The Ivory Coast and Togo. Thirty years ago there were 200,000 lions roaming wild across the continent – but now there are only between 15,000 and 32,000 left. West African lions have been largely forgotten due to political apathy to conservation. Dr Pieter Kat, trustee of LionAid, told The Guardian: ‘There has been a catastrophic decline in the populations of lions in Africa, and particularly west Africa. ‘These lions have been neglected for a very long time and do not have adequate protection programs.’ He said the west of the continent is often ignored in favour of eastern Africa, leading to a decline in species. The lion is threatened by a range of factors, including loss of habitat, loss of natural prey due to poaching, 'unsustainable levels of trophy hunting' and human conflict. A new threat is also on the rise as lion bones are being used to supply the demands of Asian traditional medicine as tiger bones become more scarce. Conservationists want lions to be put on the list of most endangered species to give them greater protection from hunters . In Nigeria a government wildlife . official told The Guardian that the number of lions in the country had . dropped from 44 in 2009 to a meagre 34. Yohanna . Saidu from Nigeria’s interior ministry told the newspaper they are . trying to protect the lions but admitted to being ‘very concerned’. Dr Kat said it would now be impossible to build up a population of lions in Nigeria and therefore the species should be classed as extinct there as well. The picture is similar in other countries. In Senegal, the LionAid said there are just 40 lions left. The charity said there are only five 'viable' populations - those of 1,000 or more - lions left on the continent. Three of those are found in Tanzania and Kenya, with the remaining populations surviving in South Africa and Botswana and Zimbabwe. Lions are now extinct in 25 African nations . Recent studies on African lion populations show that about three-quarters of Africa’s savannah has disappeared over the past 50 years. Conservationists say it is not possible to individually count every lion in the continent so estimates on remaining population numbers vary. However experts do agree the plight of the African lion is ‘very serious’ and want the animal to be included on the convention on international trade in endangered species list. Inclusion would mean tight protection on hunting and trade, especially important as more than 5,600 wild African lions were hunted and exported as trophies between 1999 and 2008. However, conservationists say they face strong opposition from the pro-hunting lobby. Dr Kat said: 'We are currently paying lip service to . the conservation needs of a species so greatly important to our . cultures, history, and indeed the health of wildlife biodiversity in . Africa. 'Lions are not only an iconic species important to very many people all over the world, but they are also a vital component of African ecosystems.'","LionAid say there are just 645 wild lions remaining in west and central Africa .

But Damon - who back then weighed 25st 3lb stone - is so 'embarrassed' to look at their old wedding photos that he and Clare are going to do it all again, in order to generate a brand new family album. Damon Clarke, 37, and his wife Clare, 31, have lost 11 stone between them since their 2004 wedding, and will now be renewing their vows so as to generate a brand new photo album of their second special day . Damon has lost over eight stone in . just 11 months after realising he needed to take drastic action to . tackle his weight when he became physically incapable of playing . football with his sons Callum and Tyler.

'He has completely changed and become much more confident. I am so proud of his achievements.' Damon used to live on a diet of ready . meals, fish and chips and takeaways. Over the years his waist six . ballooned to a staggering 61 inches. He said: 'I have always been a big person, even though I have played football all my life. 'When .

'There's . a chippy next door and a Chinese and kebab shop nearby, so it was easy . to grab something - and most of the food at home was from Iceland. 'I was playing football with my son . last year and had to go and get a drink because within minutes I was . sweating - he looked so embarrassed in front of his friends. 'I decided to do something about it and joined Slimming World. Since . then, I have lost a lot of weight and feel like a new person.'

His new diet consists of healthy home-cooked meals and he visits the gym three to four times a week.

She said: 'Although I eat healthy food at work I wasn't as committed as Damon but still managed to lose weight by eating the same dinners as him. 'When Damon proposed I was shocked.

The 'Kalyady Tsars' (Christmas Tsars) is a festive event celebrated in the village of Semezhevo in the . Minsk region of Belarus. It now takes place only in this village and is performed to celebrate the New Year, which is January 13 according to the archaic Julian calendar. Folklore: Villagers perform the Christmas Tsars rite in the village of Semezhevo in Belarus . Heritage: More than 500 performers, mostly young boys and men, take part in the annual event . But UNESCO, the cultural watchdog of the United Nations, has added it to its List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding as interest in the event dwindles. The rite of the Kolyady Tsars dates back . to the 18th century, when the tsar’s military units were stationed not . far from Semezhevo. According to the local legend, during . the New Year celebrations . soldiers and officers visited local houses to give comic performances . and receive rewards. Since then, locals continued the tradition and . turned it into a unique Christmas event. The rite originates from when the Tsar's forces would come to the village to celebrate the Julian calendar New Year . Onlookers watch a performance in their home. The men go door-to-door to entertain people . About 500 men participate annually in the event, seven of which are chosen to play the roles of the Christmas Tsars. They dress in white trousers and shirts, . with red embroidered belts crisscrossed across their chests, . and high caps adorned with colorful paper ribbons. Other characters such as the dzad (old man) and baba (old lady), are played by a young girl and boy respectively. During the drama, ‘tsars’ visit the local houses of unmarried girls to give comic performances and receive good wishes and awards. The procession continues into the night, lit by torchlight. It incorporates performing arts, costumes, art and even special dishes, but the younger generation are starting to lose interest in the event. Blaze: As the day turns to night, the participants light torches to continue the show . Lost history: Unesco fears the ritual is dying out as the younger generation is not joining in . Rebirth: The Christmas Tsars was resurrected in 1996 after history experts pieced the performance together from oral history and documents . A Unesco statement said: 'At present, the ceremony, although popular with older residents, is diminishing in popularity with the younger generation. 'This may result in a gap in transmission of knowledge regarding the production of costumes, instruments, interior decorations and particular dishes associated with the event – intangible heritage that may not outlast the present generation of residents.' People believe that being visited by the 'tsars' brings peace, harmony and wealth for a year. The rite was revived in 1996 after proceedings were reconstructed from documents and interviews with older members of the community.","The Christmas Tsars is an annual tradition in a village in Belarus .

Porsche drivers are most likely to be caught driving too fast, ahead of those with an Aston Martin, Jaguar or Bentley. They may be too well-off to be deterred from their thrill-seeking tendencies by the prospect of a fine. Or they may enjoy the risk of living life in the fast lane and do not believe they will get caught. The result is that other road users are more at risk from  middle-aged men with high- powered jobs and expensive cars than from boy racers. The figures were compiled by price comparison website MoneySupermarket.com from details supplied by drivers searching for insurance – more than 14million quotes over 12 months. Those in basic cars and low-paid jobs, students and drivers aged 20 to 24 were least likely to have a speeding conviction. Men in their 40s are far more likely . to speed than any others.

Oscar-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins stunned the new owner of the small Welsh house where he grew up when he dropped in for a cup of tea – and asked if he could buy the property. The star arrived at the semi-detached home in Port Talbot in a chauffeur-driven car with his wife and two bodyguards, and asked Chris Trainor and his partner Carly Culver if he could look around. The bemused couple invited the actor and his group inside and he stayed for 30 minutes, posing for pictures before asking if the home was for sale and even offering £180,00 for it. Sir Anthony Hopkins shocked a young family by offering to buy their house because he was born there . Sir Anthony also invited them to visit him at his stunning Malibu mansion. Mr Trainor, who has a two-year-old daughter called Poppy, said: ‘I looked out of the window and caught sight of a chauffeur and he told me he was taking Anthony and his wife to London. ‘Then Sir Anthony Hopkins popped his head out of the car window and said to me, “How are you?” ‘I knew from the previous owner that Sir Anthony had been born in this house and spent a number of years living there, so I asked him in. 'He had a really good look around the house and said he was born in my daughter’s bedroom. 'He said he has got a place in LA and would send us a postcard with his details on it. He said we could visit. At one point his wife revealed that Sir Anthony would be interested in buying this house from me. ‘I made a joke about it at the time, but if they do make an offer, I’ll definitely have to consider it.’ Celebration: Sir Anthony and his wife Stella at his 70th birthday party in Port Talbot, South Wales . Sir Anthony pictured when he was just nine months old... it is not known if this picture was taken in the garden of the house he offered to buy . It was reported that his wife Stella asked if the couple would consider a £180,000 offer - more than the average price of such a house in the area. The star, who turned 75 on New Year’s Eve, was travelling back to London from Pembrokeshire where he and his Colombian wife, Stella Arroyave, renewed their wedding vows. Mr Trainor, 32, who runs a home-maintenance firm, added: ‘I was a bit star-struck, but the visit clearly meant a lot to Sir Anthony. I was glad he got to revisit the place where he was born.’ It was at the YMCA in Port Talbot that Sir Anthony, whose father was a baker in the town, had his first experience of acting. He also once credited a Port Talbot dentist he remembered as a child as the inspiration for his Oscar-wining portrayal of serial killer Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 thriller The Silence Of The Lambs. He said: ‘Lecter was sophisticated and educated and could be charming, but he was capable of inflicting pain without turning a hair. ‘It made me think of going to the dentist as a child.’ Home: Sir Anthony, who grew up in the Welsh town of Port Talbot, is considering buying back the house where he grew up .

A mother has lost an incredible ten dress sizes in as many months after taking drastic action to save the health of her and her daughter. Kathryn Swan, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, saw her weight rocket following her wedding to husband Andrew 22 years ago. The 39-year-old ballooned to a size 32 in clothes as she and her husband and daughter lived on a diet of pie and mash, takeaways and other unhealthy food, and rarely ate fresh fruit and vegetables. But, when her daughter Bronwyn, 12, began to be picked on at school about her mother's weight, Katherine decided to take action and has got down to a svelte size 12. Kathryn's doctor offered her two months free at her local Slimming World club to help her shift the pounds . Kathryn 'had always been big', as she was 'brought up on proper meals, and had a weakness for biscuits' With sky-high blood pressure, Kathryn's doctor offered her two months free at her local Slimming World club to help her shift the pounds and reduce the risk of further health problems. Kathryn said: 'I have always been big, I was brought up on proper meals, and I've got a weakness for biscuits! 'I slimmed down when I got married, which I found easy, I think because I had a serious goal to work for. 'But when I tried to lose weight after that, it never worked. I tried loads of fad diets but I don't think I was motivated enough to lose significant amounts. Kathryn, pictured with daughter Bronwyn, didn't want her being picked on . 'I didn't want Bronwyn being picked on either. She had never been fat, but children can be cruel and she was getting to the age where girls in particular were very conscious about their weight.' Kathryn swapped stodgy meals and packets . of biscuits for healthy salads and carrot sticks and saw eight pounds . drop off her in the first week on the diet. Breakfast: Bacon Sandwich . Mid-morning snack: Shortbread biscuits . Lunch: Fish and Chips . Dinner: Toasted Sandwich . Supper: Hot Chocolate and biscuits . Snacks: Crisps . Breakfast: Magic Porridge - oats & yoghurt . Mid-morning snack: Chopped fruit and veg . Lunch: Chicken salad . Dinner: Chicken curry with rice . But the housewife, whose husband Andrew works as a train driver, admits that it wasn't easy to begin with. She said: 'Going through the doors to Slimming World was terrifying. I felt like everyone was looking at me. 'But everyone was so welcoming. At the . end of the day we were all there for the same reason and it was good to . have people around me spurring me on.' The Slimming World diet plan involves food optimising, allowing slimmers to eat what they want but in moderation, to try and avoid binging due to cravings. Kathryn said: 'We are allowed to have 15 'sins' a day which works out at 105 a week. A cream cake for example is 40 sins, so it made you think about how many you would have left that week and whether it was really worth it. 'If I was going out for a big meal, I . would tend to use all my sins on one night, knowing then that I'd had . my treat for the week and had to be good until the following week.' Kathryn . quickly left behind baggy tops and elasticated waistlines as she . regained a figure and was able to shop on the high street for more . fitted outfits. And last week, she proudly pulled on a pair of jeans ten sizes smaller than her old jogging bottoms. Kathryn thinks her choosing to lose weight brought her and daughter Bronwyn 'closer than we ever had been before' - and she quickly wanted to swap snacking on chocolate for carrot sticks . As . Kathryn has become healthier and gained bags of energy, her daughter . Bronwyn began to take an interest in leading a better lifestyle.

'When Andrew is away, Bronwyn and I snuggle up together in bed and watch a DVD. 'But she quickly wanted to swap snacking on chocolate for carrot sticks.' While . Kathryn has now reached her target weight, she is planning on . continuing with the Slimming World classes to keep up her motivation to . stay slim.

A tape has emerged on the eve of the presidential debate of Barack Obama making controversial 'race' remarks about the government’s response in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Speaking to an audience of predominantly black ministers at Hampton University in 2007, Obama said that the response to Katrina was lacklustre because ‘the people down in New Orleans, they don’t care about them as much'. Critics say the tape is an example of the President trying to whip up 'fear and hatred' but supporters of Obama said the speech has already been widely reported and dismissed the release as an attempt to deflect attention away from Romney ahead of tonight's crucial debate in Denver, Colorado. Scroll down for video . Fiery remarks: Obama was filmed giving the speech in 2007 at Hampton College, Virginia where he discussed the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina . The speech had previously been aired but . only an edited video was released and a transcript that did not include . the ad-lib remarks about New Orleans. Mr Obama said: 'Down in New Orleans, where they still have not rebuilt 20 months later. There's a law, federal law - when you get reconstruction money from the federal government - called the Stafford Act. 'And basically it says, when you get federal money, you have to give a 10 per cent match. The local government has to come up with ten per cent. Every $10 the federal government comes up with, local government has to give a dollar.' He continued: 'Now here’s the thing. When 9/11 happened in New York City, they waived the Stafford Act - said, ''This is too serious a problem. We can’t expect New York City to rebuild on its own. Forget that dollar you have to put in. Well, here’s $10.'' 'And that was the right thing to do. When Hurricane Andrew struck in Florida, people said, ''Look at this devastation. We don’t expect you to come up with your own money here. Here’s the money to rebuild. We’re not going to wait for you to scratch it together, because you’re part of the American family.'' 'What's happening down in New Orleans? - ''Where's your dollar? Where's your Stafford Act money?'' ‘It tells me that somehow the people down in New Orleans, they don’t care about as much.' Rousing: Obama spoke at the minsters' conference of Hurricane Katrina, saying: 'The people down in New Orleans, they don't care about as much' Audience: Obama's speech was made to predominantly African-American ministers at a conference in 2007 . The recording of Obama also reveals him giving a 'special shout out' to controversial pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright who was in the audience. In the footage, Obama introduces Reverend Wright as 'my . pastor, the guy who puts up with me, counsels me, listens to my wife . complain about me. 'He's a friend and a great leader. Not just in . Chicago, but all across the country.' The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act became law on November 23, 1988 and was amended in 2007. It coordinates the federal response to natural disasters including tsunami, tornado, terrorism, landslide, hurricane/tropical storm, wildfires and earthquakes. During the response to Katrina in 2005, the act was criticized for its bureaucratic red tape that delayed the relief effort and distribution of aid. Obama's speech in June 2007 came a year before Wright's infamous 'God damn America' remarks surfaced in 2008. Referring to treatment of African-Americans in the U.S, Rev Wright said in a sermon in 2003: 'No, no, no, not God Bless America. 'God damn America....God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human.' The retired pastor also came under fire . after he said the September 11 terrorist . attacks were 'America's chickens coming home to roost'. He was kept at a . distance by Obama during the 2008 campaign. Right and left-wing media were divided over the impact of the tape. The Daily Caller, which broke the story, erupted over Obama's remarks, describing them as 'racially-charged'. The conservative blog added that the 'at times angry speech undermines Obama’s carefully-crafted image as a leader eager to build bridges between ethnic groups'. It also compared the President with radical civil rights activist Al Sharpton. The site's editor Tucker Carlson told Fox that the clips were Obama 'whipping up race hatred and fear. Period.' Supporters of Obama have dismissed the tape's release as an attempt to deflect attention away from Mitt Romney ahead of tonight's crucial debate in Denver, Colorado. Romney here faces Newt Gingrich (left) during a Republican presidential debate earlier this year . Direct line: President Obama calls supporters during a visit to local campaign offices in Henderson, Nevada this week ahead of the first presidential debate .

People didn’t actually know he was this black, and if they . had known, they never would have elected him.' Sam . Feist, Washington Bureau Chief at CNN, tweeted: 'Re: Secret tape of the . Obama event: CNN covered it in 2007. It was open press.' Both Romney and Obama have stepped back from the campaign trail in recent days as they prepare ahead of their first head-to-head meeting on stage on Wednesday night. The Republican National Committee has stayed quiet over the release of the tape while Romney's camp has denied involvement. Security: Workers build fencing outside the Magness Arena at the University of Denver ahead of tonight's first presidential debate . All set: Adjustments to the stage are made with just hours to go before Obama and Romney arrive . The Obama campaign said the release of the clips were a 'transparent attempt' by Romney's allies to divert from a secretly-recorded tape where the Republican nominee told a fundraiser that 'there are 47 per cent who are with him [President Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims'. Campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said: 'The only thing shocking about this is that they apparently think it’s wrong to suggest that we should help returning veterans, children leaving foster care and other members of Mitt Romney’s 47 per cent get training that will allow them to find the best available jobs. 'If the Romney campaign believes that Americans will accept these desperate attacks tomorrow night in place of specific plans for the middle-class, it’s they who are in for a surprise.'

She defied her doubters and became an inspiration when she achieved numerous feats of endurance despite suffering from terminal cancer. Now Jane Tomlinson's husband has admitted even he was stunned when his wife announced she intended to run a marathon after she had been given just six months to live. Mike Tomlinson shared his wife's inspiring story on the podcast Marathon Talk after announcing a new marathon will be staged in York in her memory this year. The widower told presenters Martin Yelling and Tom Williams how his wife had never run before her cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2000 when she was only 36 years old. But after being told she had only six months to live, she decided to take on the endurance challenge. He said: 'It . was preposterous. She was told she was not going to see next spring and . there she was saying she was going to run the London Marathon in . April.' Mike added: 'She . did everything I thought wasn't possible for her. She was desperately . ill with a lot of cancer in her bones. I never for a minute thought she . could do it. 'But when she went out in the month before the marathon and . did an 18 mile training run, I thought this is serious, she's really . going to do it. She should have been dead and there she was on the start . line of the London Marathon.' Jane went on to live for another seven years after her  advanced metastatic breast cancer diagnosis which Mike said was largely thanks to advances in cancer treatments. But he added he was certain taking up sport also helped prolong her life. Not only did getting fit make her more 'robust' physically so she could better handle her grueling chemotherapy treatments, it also helped her mentally. The marathon gave Jane a chance to 'take control' at a time when she was 'losing everything', Mike explained. 'It meant cancer stopped defining her'. The mother-of-three built up to running the London Marathon by taking part in 5k to half marathon races and after finishing the event in a respectable time of 4 hours and 53 minutes, decided she wouldn't stop there. Remarkable: The mother-of-three went on to complete an Ironman and raise nearly £2m for charity . Pedal power: She also cycled across America to boost charity coffers . She went on to complete an Ironman (comprised of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run) and then a 4,200 . mile bike Ride Across America, from San Francisco to New York. Remarkably after completing the Ironman - an event that can break the fittest of athletes - Mike said Jane didn't need painkillers for a week as she was on such a high from her achievement. 'If someone has had a cancer diagnosis, . they don't have to run a marathon but hopefully her story will give . people some hope that diagnosis is not the end of your life' He said: 'I expected her to wake up the next day and be a complete shell but she had no painkillers for a week. 'The endorphins she got from doing the race kept the pain at bay. That was the only week in seven years when she didn't take painkillers - after the Ironman. 'I'm not a medical man, I don't understand how the body works but there has to be something in that.' Jane's achievements meant her whole family were thrust into the public eye and the Yorkshire man admitted they found this difficult to begin with. While many people were supportive of Jane, others criticised her for the challenges she was undertaking while ill and some even questioned whether she really had terminal cancer at all. Legacy continues: Her husband Mike Tomlinson is helping to stage the Yorkshire Marathon in her memory . But Mike revealed while they would never have sought attention, when Jane's story first started making headlines, they decided to embrace it in order to make as much money for charity as they could. By the time of her death in 2007 at the age of 43, she had raised almost £2million for charity. She also won numerous accolades including a CBE and inspired people around the world to change their lives through her example. Mike said he hopes Jane's story continues to make a difference to people's lives. 'If someone has had a cancer diagnosis, they don't have to run a marathon but hopefully her story will give people some hope that diagnosis is not the end of your life, you can still have a fulfilling life,' he said. Now Mike and his family are keeping Jane's legacy alive and continuing to raise money for good causes through staging various sporting events in the North. Marathon challenge: Celebs including Paralympian Hannah Cockcroft, pictured front left with Mike, are supporting the event which will take place in York in October . Through Jane Tomlinson’s For All Events, they already stage the Leeds, York, Hull and Pennine-Lancashire . 10Ks, Leeds Half Marathon and walking and swimming festivals. But now their jewel in the crown will be the Yorkshire Marathon which they hope will become a not-to-be-missed event in the UK sporting calendar. The race, on a flat and scenic course around York city centre and surrounding countryside, will be held on Sunday, 20 October. Entries are now open and participants are encouraged to donate money to the Jane Tomlinson Appeal or raise money for a charity of their choice. However, there is no pressure to raise a certain amount in order to take part. Do the impossible: Mike said on the day of the marathon, he hopes to see people 'achieve things they have never dreamed of like Jane did' As well as raising money for charity, Mike hopes the race will make a difference to people's lives by encouraging them to get fit and enjoy taking part in sport. Mike and his daughter will also be running and he said he is looking forward to seeing people achieve what they thought might not be possible by completing the 26.2 mile course. He added that the best part will be 'seeing people achieve things they have never dreamed of like Jane did - that's success.'

A former Miami University student has escaped criminal charges after he distributed a flier on how to get away with raping female students. The case drew national outrage in October after the shocking notice titled 'Top Ten Ways to Get Away With Rape' was found in a freshman co-ed dorm bathroom at the Ohio college. The flier told readers that 'practice makes perfect. The more you rape, the better you get at it.' It also said: 'If you're afraid that the girl will identify you, slit her throat.' The student pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, but a Butler County judge sealed records in the case, keeping the student's name secret, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Anger: A flier posted in a freshman dorm at Miami University, pictured, caused outrage, as it lists the top ten ways to get away with rape . After The Enquirer challenged the judge's move to seal records in the case, the student was allowed to withdraw his plea and Prosecutor Michael Gmoser asked to drop the charges. Judge Rob Lyons said sealing the case was something he routinely does for students. According to The Enquirer, Lyons of Butler County Area I Court in Oxford allowed the student to withdraw his plea in a hearing on December 13. Butler County prosecutors then decided against pursuing the case, and Lyons said he dismissed the charge. Trouble: A flier posted in the men's restroom at a Miami University freshman co-ed dorm offered pointers on the Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape' The judge then sealed the criminal case a second time at the request of the student's defense attorney, Dennis Deters, to correct a mistake he made in November. That mistake was among several violations The Enquirer alleged in its challenge to sealing the case. The Enquirer asked the Ohio Supreme Court to order Lyons to rescind his sealing order and open the file. The case is pending. The newspaper sued after the student initially pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. It also claimed that Lyons could not issue a blanket order sealing every document in the case, that he didn’t hold a required hearing the first time around, and that he failed to consider any less-restrictive means of limiting public access to the records, which is required by the Ohio Supreme Court. 'Safety for all and fair justice for suspects are among our most important expectations of government,' Enquirer Editor and Vice President Carolyn Washburn said. 'In this case – a situation in which someone encouraged the heinous crime of rape – all of the handling of the only suspect happened in secret, including a decision to no longer prosecute. 'That does not make the community feel safe. And it does not allow the community to watch our elected judges and prosecutors to ensure justice was appropriately handled.' Lyons wouldn't say whether he or prosecutors came up with the idea to hold the second hearing.An assistant for Gmoser is representing Lyons in the Enquirer suit. Lyons said the charge against the student was 'insignificant' though he described the behavior behind it as 'offensive.' Escaped: The former Miami University student has escaped criminal charges . Sealing the case the first time around was routine, he said. 'If you went to any college town, the number of sealings is very high because we have such a high degree of students that get convictions,' he told the newspaper. 'You've got kids with indiscretions that want their records sealed before they start applying for graduate school or go to the job market. Literally every week I have a stack of sealing entries.' According to The Enquirer, Lyons' private law firm advertises that it can help seal criminal records.Lyons has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to dismiss The Enquirer's suit. Deters and Gmoser declined to talk to The Enquirer about the case for the story. The Enquirer's lawyer Jack Greiner said that the student was prosecuted as an adult and should therefore be identified. 'It goes to the heart of the public's right to know. The public is denied the right to observe the proceeding,' Greiner said. 'The judge's after-the-fact effort to rewrite history by allowing this individual to withdraw his guilty plea for no reason other than to allow the judge to cover up his initial illegal sealing order is appalling. It is why people become cynical about the system,' he added.","Flier encouraging readers to rape unconscious women and prey on female students walking alone was found in freshman bathroom in October at public university .

A schoolboy who died after being hit by a car four days before Christmas may have thrown himself to his death, it emerged today. Sam Belcher, 15, was said to have jumped in front of a Ford Ka driven by a teenage girl travelling home in the early hours of the morning. The youngster died instantly in the 2.30am collision in the village of Pamber Heath, near Tadley, Hampshire, less than a mile from his family home. Fifteen-year-old Sam Belcher died after he was hit by a car in Silchester Road (above) in the village of Pamber Heath in Hampshire . Police initially arrested the 18-year-old girl on suspicion of causing the boy’s death. But she has been released on bail until March and it is now understood detectives are focusing their inquiries on why Sam suddenly appeared in front of the girl’s car. His death will also be investigated by a coroner at a later date. The teenager died instantly when he was thrown into the road by the impact. Neighbours said the family was asleep and unaware that the 15-year-old had left the house and was walking at the side of the road.

As if the flooding and transport chaos hasn’t been bad enough already, now drivers face a new weather-related menace  –  potholes. And it has come at a hefty price. Motorists are paying out more than £1billion a year on car repairs to rectify the damage caused by cracks and pits in the roads. Record-breaking wet weather from last year has resulted in an ‘enormous increase’ in the number of potholes. Last month, an AA survey found that drivers and cyclists had to tackle an average of just over six potholes per mile. Motorists are paying out more than £1bn a year on car repairs to rectify the damage caused by cracks and pits in the roads. Above, a long rift opened up along the Oxford Road in Hinksey Hill today, exposing layers of dirt and gravel as parts of the surface sank . A study by Halfords Autocentres found that 8m vehicles a year suffer steering and suspension damage as a result of poorly-maintained road surfaces . But following December’s downpours, many road surfaces have deteriorated further. A study by Halfords Autocentres found that 8million vehicles a year suffer steering and suspension damage as a result of poorly-maintained road surfaces – with one driver affected every four seconds. The average repair bill is estimated to cost £135. The figures show that last month complaints over potholes almost doubled since a year ago. Councils were being notified at a rate of 54 a day in December, a 60 per cent increase on the average for the year. Blame the weather: Rain and floods in many parts of the country have cause more potholes than ever to appear on Britain's roads . The recent wet weather has made a bad situation worse. In Oxfordshire, one stretch of road was torn apart after days of heavy rain. A long rift opened up along the Oxford Road in Hinksey Hill, exposing layers of dirt and gravel as parts of the surface sank. With two-feet wide cracks in places, the through-road has now been sealed off by engineers. Paul Watters, AA head of roads policy, said: ‘The wet weather has had a massive impact on our roads. Our patrols are reporting an enormous increase in the amount of potholes. The heavy rain will have aggravated those that are already there, and brought about new ones. No through route: The figures were revealed as it emerged a landslide left a bridge connecting the tiny village of Ovington, County Durham, to a major commuter route impassable - adding ten miles to residents' journeys . Cracked: The stone bridge has been left twisted and crumbling with huge cracks in the tarmac . Inconvenience: Rain towards the end of December caused the bridge to sink down an embankment and it has been shut ever since . ‘But it will also have affected the . substructure of the road - in some instances we have even seen the base . of the road washed away. ‘And . it is still early days. Once we have freezing weather, we will see . frost and ice causing further damage to the road surface. ‘The full scale of the problem will only emerge in the next few months.’ Last year, the Asphalt Industry Alliance, which carries out an annual road maintenance survey, found the number of potholes filled in across England and Wales had nearly doubled in five years, to almost 1.7million. A spokesman said: ‘What we are hearing is that the extreme rain fall that we have experienced this year has had quite a devastating effect on the roads. ‘We have seen huge areas of the country where the ground has been saturated, and this affects the foundations of the roads. 'It will certainly be expensive to repair and we would not be surprised to see increasing numbers of potholes and serious cracks as a result.’ Many local authorities have been warning motorists that potholes are on the rise as a result of the wet weather. Following the recent flooding in the south west, councils said up to £20million is needed to repair the damage to the region’s roads. Devon County Council estimates the repair bill will cost taxpayers £10million, while authorities in Cornwall have earmarked £7million for the damage caused by the downpours in November and December. Counting the cost: Rectifying the damage caused . by potholes, such as these in Hull, East Yorkshire, left, and Finchley, . north London, right, can be unexpectedly costly, with an average repair . bill of £135 . Disparity: Some regions had far higher . incidences of pothole damage than others. Pictured: potholes in Glasgow, . left, and Liverpool, right . Plymouth City Council also expects long-term costs of up to £3million. Austerity measures will see road maintenance grants fall by almost £100million this year, and as a result many councils are being forced to mend rather than replace damaged roads. Over the long term, the estimated cost to ‘patch and mend’ rather than to plan proper road maintenance is 20 times greater. Last month ministers announced an extra £215million for councils to carry out repairs, from money put aside for roads in Chancellor George Osborne’s Autumn Statement. The figures were revealed as it emerged a landslide left a bridge connecting the tiny village of Ovington, County Durham,  to a major commuter route impassable - adding ten miles to residents' journeys. The stone bridge has been left twisted and crumbling with huge cracks in the tarmac. The closure restricts access to the A67 which links County Durham to North Yorkshire. Rain towards the end of December caused the bridge to sink down an embankment and it has been shut ever since. Expensive: Drivers from the North East being hit hardest with a £181 million bill, closely followed by motorists in the Midlands who pay out around £175 million for repairs . The village is still accessible from the south via Hutton Magna but traffic from Winston is being diverted via Caldwell. Residents . said the bridge, which has a 7.5ft weight limit and is listed, has been . put under considerable strain as a result of heavy farm traffic driving . over it. Rory . Carlin from Halfords Autocentres said: 'Even hitting a small pothole . can easily damage wheels, tyres and affect steering alignment but . serious suspension damage is becoming a more common occurrence. 'From bent anti-roll bars to damaged . shock absorbers, the problems are exacerbated by three factors; the . inability of local authorities to keep pace with highway maintenance, an . ageing vehicle fleet more susceptible to damage as drivers keep cars . for longer and component complexity, which drives up the cost of each . individual repair.' Some . regions had far higher incidences of pothole damage than others, with . drivers from the North East being hit hardest with a £181 million bill, . closely followed by motorists in the Midlands who pay out around £175 . million for repairs. Those . areas where drivers are least likely to encounter costly problems are . Wales and the East of England where the repair bills for pothole-related . damage are £53 million and £58 million respectively - though lower . traffic density, rather than better quality of road surface, may be . masking the true underlying threat. Councils, local authorities and the . Highways Agency have a duty of care under The Highways Act to take . reasonable measures to ensure that problems such as potholes are found . and dealt with swiftly. However, . since the initial cost of pothole repairs is borne by the driver it is . they who must prove the relevant authority has failed to meet this . obligation in order to make a claim, which is time consuming and far . from straight-forward. Typically . any driver seeking to recoup repair costs must prove that the relevant . authority does not have a robust system for dealing with road surface . issues, or that it fails to meet the national recommended code of . practice for highway maintenance. Mr . Carlin added: 'The funding gap is hitting motorists hard. This is . clearly not sustainable in the long term and we are currently looking . for ways in which we can support drivers who encounter potholes whilst . the authorities remain unable or unwilling to act.'","8m vehicles a year - one every four seconds - suffer damage due to potholes .

A coffee shop owner has decided to try and bring a little bit of Italy to his business - by spending £12,000 on recreating the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel on the side of his cafe. Kevin Kavanagh had the 115 sq ft fresco of the famous Libyan Sibyl painted on the side of his cafe in the centre of Bedford in a bid to bring some Italian history to the town. He commissioned artist Iain Carstairs to recreate the image, which was hand-painted at The Vatican by Michelangelo in the 16th century. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fresco: The painting cost Mr Kavanagh a staggering £12,000, but he hopes it will become a landmark of the town . Place in history: Mr Kavanagh has said he hopes the painting will remain in place for more than 1,000 years . The artist used a technique dating back to ancient Greece for plastering and then painting the brick wall on the side of Mr Kvanagh's Frescoes Cafe. Cafe owner Kevin said he hoped to recoup some of the costs through donations from residents benefiting from the new installation in his hometown. The 58-year-old said: 'It is my way of adding to the culture of the town and both me and Iain wanted something that was historic. 'We have been able to bring a bit of Italian history to Bedford and I hope that it will be there for well over a thousand years.' Artist Mr Carstairs said he too was pleased with the results of his endeavours. Recreation: Artist Iain Carstairs spent three months recreating the intricate detail of the original, right, on the side of the cafe wall, left . Amazing: The Libyan Sibyl, circled, is one of the 12 prophetic figures from the roof of the Sistine Chapel . He said: 'It's so pleasing to see and it's prettier than I thought. The most exciting thing is looking out of the window and seeing people's reaction to it. They seem to connect and react to it.' It also appears that the public are equally enthusiastic about the replica which is almost the exact same size as the original that adorns the roof of the Sistine Chapel. Mr Kavanagh, whose son studied art at . Nottingham University, said: 'Wonderful is a word that has been coming . up. To date there has been no negative comments. 'I want it to be a landmark of Bedford and I want generations of people to be able to come and visit it.' Artist: Iain Carstairs stands on scaffolding in front of his handiwork . Impressive: Mr Carstairs worked with plasterer Jim Smith to smooth the rough brick so the intricate detail could be added . The Libyan Sibyl is one of the 12 prophetic figures from the roof of the Sistine Chapel and depicts the priestess Phemonone presiding over the Zeus Ammon Oracle. Mr Carstairs spent months completing the stunning wall, which he painted from scaffolding surrounding the cafe. He worked with plasterer Jim Smith to smooth the rough brick wall so he could achieve the quality finish needed to do justice to the fine detail of the masterpiece. The image was put on show to the public for the first time before Christmas when the scaffolding was finally taken down. Completed in 1510, Michelangelo's rendering of the Libyan Sibyl can be found on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican City. In Classical mythology, the Libyan Sibyl was the prophetic priestess presiding over the Zeus Ammon Oracle at the Siwa Oasis in the western desert of Egypt . The sibyl, one of 12 prophetic figures on the roof, is considered to be one of the finest paintings on the ceilings . She was believed by the Greeks to be the first woman to chant oracles and was the daughter of Zeus and Lamia, a beautiful Libyan queen. Michelangelo is believed to have taken great effort to study the figure of the sibyl, called Phemeonoe, more than many others on the ceiling, which is considered a cornerstone of High Renaissance art. His intention was for the sibyl to be looking directly at the fresco below, which features John baptising Jesus Christ in the Jordan River. The ceiling itself was painted between 1508 and 1512 at the commission of Pope Julius II. It was built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV, who it is named after. It contains various painted elements which form part part of the chapel's larger decoration scheme, including the large The Last Judgement fresco, which was also created by Michelangelo. Nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the iconic Creation of Adam, are central to the ceiling's features.

The Queen has used her Christmas broadcast to respond to the outpouring of affection and enthusiasm shown by the nation during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. She described how she was left humbled by the huge crowds that turned out to mark her historic milestone. As her momentous year draws to a close, she said she was struck by the 'strength of fellowship and friendship' shown by well-wishers, most memorably during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant when more than a million people lined the banks of the river.

Despite the cold conditions and persistent downpours, the crowds who witnessed the once-in-a-lifetime flotilla were 'undaunted by the rain', she said in her address. The Olympic and Paralympic Games were another highlight of 2012 for the Queen. She paid tribute to the athletes, Olympic torch bearers and volunteer Games Makers for either inspiring the nation with their efforts or devoting themselves to others. The message, produced by Sky News, was broadcast in 3D for the first time and elements of the footage appeared to leap out from the screen. It was also shown in HD and standard definition. 'Memorable day': The Queen, seen here waving to the crowds during the Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June, paid tribute to 'strength of fellowship and friendship' shown by well-wishers during the celebrations . 'Striking': Despite the cold conditions and persistent downpours, she said the crowds who witnessed the once-in-a-lifetime flotilla along the Thames were 'undaunted by the rain' In her annual address to the nation, the Queen said: 'This past year has been one of great celebration for many. The enthusiasm which greeted the Diamond Jubilee was, of course, especially memorable for me and my family. 'It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. 'But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions.' The broadcast featured panoramic shots of hundreds of boats, tugs, ships, cruisers and canoes sailing down river past the Houses of Parliament during the pageant staged as part of the national celebrations in June. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry were shown waving to the crowds, while well-wishers stood on the riverbanks drenched by the downpours, but still clearly enjoying themselves. 'Extraordinary': The same spirit of celebration was found when the Olympic flame reached the UK, said the Queen, pictured here with torchbearer Gina Macgregor (left) and London 2012 chairman Lord Sebastian Coe . Bravery: A number of Olympic torchbearers were shown including seriously injured paratrooper Ben Parkinson (pictured), who carried the flame through his home town of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in June . In a light-hearted moment, the Duke of Edinburgh was featured jigging along to a nautical tune as other royals, including the Prince of Wales and the Queen, also enjoyed the music. The Queen summed up the day: 'On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. 'That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing over the elements.' The same spirit of celebration was found when the Olympic flame reached the UK, said the Queen, who recorded her address in Buckingham Palace's White Drawing Room. She added: 'The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service.' 'Splendid summer of sport': The Olympic and Paralympic Games were another highlight of 2012 for the Queen . 'Public-spirited': The thousands of Olympics volunteers, some of whom are pictured here posing in front of the National Gallery, were singled out by the Queen . A number of Olympic torch bearers were shown including paratrooper Ben Parkinson, considered the most seriously wounded soldier to survive the war in Afghanistan, who carried the flame through his home town of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in June. Lance Bombardier Parkinson lost both legs and suffered brain and back injuries in a bomb attack in 2006 and was cheered by thousands as he slowly made his way along the route. Military Cross holder Corporal Ricky Furgusson was another injured serviceman who took part in the Olympic Torch Relay. Despite losing both legs, five fingers and his left eye in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2010, the soldier from 4th Battalion, The Rifles was seen carrying the torch through Broseley in Shropshire in May. When the nation's sportsmen and women began competing, their efforts impressed spectators, remarked the Queen. 'As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes,' she said. Inspirational: Footage featured Olympic and Paralympic heroes, from cyclist Bradley Wiggins on his way to clinching the time trial gold medal . Highlighted: Paralympian David Weir (pictured) was seen during the speech after his triumph in the men's T54 800m at the 2012 Paralympics . Footage featured Olympic and Paralympic heroes, from cyclist Bradley Wiggins on his way to clinching the time trial gold medal, to an ecstatic Mo Farah after winning the 10,000m title - soon to be followed by a 5,000m gold. Paralympian David Weir was seen after his triumph in the men's T54 800m and the world's fastest man Usain Bolt powering over the finish line to retain his 100m Olympic title. The thousands of volunteers who were the public face of the Games were singled out by the Queen. She said: 'Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted.' The Queen, with Philip, was shown reviewing troops in May during the Armed Forces Diamond Jubilee Parade and Muster. The Queen, who wore a fine silk tulle gown by Angela Kelly for the broadcast, said: 'For many, Christmas is also a time for coming together. But for others, service will come first. 'Sense of duty': The Queen also reflected on the services provided by the Armed Forces, emergency services and in those in hospitals . The broadcast was recorded on December 7, a few days after it was officially announced that the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant, but there was no mention of the impending royal birth in the message . Those serving in our Armed Forces, in our emergency services and in our hospitals, whose sense of duty takes them away from family and friends, will be missing those they love.' The broadcast was recorded on December 7, a few days after it was officially announced that Kate was pregnant, but there was no mention of the impending royal birth in the message. The Christmas address is one of the rare occasions when the Queen does not turn to the Government for advice, but is able to voice her own views. It also has a strong religious framework and this year the Queen spoke about the story at the heart of Christmas - the birth of Jesus. 'A young mother and a dutiful father with their baby were joined by poor shepherds and visitors from afar. They came with their gifts to worship the Christ child,' she said. 'From that day on, he has inspired people to commit themselves to the best interests of others.' At the start of the broadcast, the British Paraorchestra, which accompanied Coldplay during the Paralympics closing ceremony, was featured performing the National Anthem in Buckingham Palace's Ballroom. For the final segment of the message, the Military Wives Choir, with choirmaster Gareth Malone, sang the carol In The Bleak Midwinter in the same setting.","Her Majesty responds to outpouring of affection shown by the nation .

He said: 'I don't think what I've done is remarkable, when you live by the sea it is just in your blood. 'It's . been so much fun and a complete pleasure. I could still carry on if I . really wanted. My colleagues don't want me to leave. 'It has taken a large chunk of my life, but I think it's time to stop. It's like the end of an era.' David . first began volunteering with the RNLI in 1955 at the age of 17 when he . offered to help launch boats at the station which was just yards from . his home. After 15 years, he joined the crew full-time as a helmsman in 1970 and served 18 years before returning to life as a volunteer. Always on call: Mr James, pictured second left on the lifeboat Catherine Plumbley n the 1980s . Life-saver: Mr James, far right, with the RNLI crew in 1992. The cabinet maker has been involved with around 1,000 call-outs over the years . Emergency response: A crew out on the water in the mid 1990s. A spokesman for the RNLI said the Minehead station had launched an average of 22 rescues a year since electronic records began in 1970 . During his career at sea, he was . called out on Christmas Day in the 1980s to rescue a stricken Greek . crewman anchored off the coast of Watchet, Somerset. They recovered the seaman and put him on a stretcher before lowering him in rough seas onto a lifeboat waiting below. However, getting him back to land proved a challenge. David, . who officially retires tomorrow, said: 'We took a doctor, who was also a . crew member, out to the ship and it turned out the sick man had renal . failure. 'We had to get him . ashore fast, but when we got back to Watchet the tide was out and we had . to run the boat aground to haul him across some deep mud.' It was reported that the mud came up to the crew's thighs. 'It was getting dark as we came back in and we were singing carols', David added. 'The ambulance crew came down the harbour steps to help, and meanwhile the boat had drifted away. 'The seaman was taken off and then we had to retrieve the boat.' How times have changed: Volunteers launch a rescue rowing boat using logs in the 1930s . Up against it: Around 22 people are rescued per day by the RNLI, pictured here in the 1930s, costing a staggering £385,000 to run, but the charity does not receive any state funding . A number of years later the father-of-three was involved in a rescue where he climbed 50ft up the crumbling Culver Cliff, in the Isle of Wight, to reach a man who had got stuck. He received a prestigious award and a framed letter of thanks from the Lifeboat Operations Manager for the rescue, which saw him climb the cliff three times. David said: 'When I got to him he was petrified and wouldn't move so I climbed back down and got the anchor rope and tied it around him and around the rock and he said: 'will it be ok?' 'I said: ""You've got two chances. You will be ok."" I lowered him down and then his radio was up on a ledge and I went up and got that as well. 'Lifeboat Magazine called it ""music while you work'. I was surprised to get the award.' In 1988 David became a deputy launching authority - making him one of five people authorised to order the boat to sea - and has worked in that position ever since. Now David, who still lives in Minehead, plans to enjoy his retirement by taking a trip around the country in a caravan with his wife Pam. He added: 'Volunteering for the RNLI just becomes a way of life, I'm not sure how I'll spend the free time now, but I definitely want to get a caravan and tour bits of the country I've missed over the year.' A spokesman for the RNLI said that . Minehead Station had launched an average of 22 rescues a year since . electronic records began in 1970. Across the UK, around 22 people are rescued per day by the RNLI, costing a staggering £385,000 to run. The charity does not receive any state funding and is entirely dependant on donations. A spokesman for the RNLI was unable to confirm whether David is the longest-serving volunteer and said he was among 'a handful' of members who have served a number of decades.","David James joined RNLI as a schoolboy in Minehead, Somerset, in 1955 .

'Like being awake in a coma': Teenager Shannon Magee suffers from a rare disorder which makes her sleep for nearly a fortnight at a time . A teenager has been dubbed a real-life 'Sleeping Beauty' after being struck down by a medical condition which makes her nod off for almost 12 days at a time. Former army cadet Shannon Magee, 17, suffers from a rare neurological disorder which means she can sleep for 22 hours a day for almost a fortnight. She also has bizarre episodes - roughly once a . month - where she will belt out pop songs at the top of her voice, walk . around naked and have ghostly hallucinations while she sleeps. For the past five years, the youngster, who has two brothers and three sisters, has slept through birthdays, Christmases, family holidays including a skiing trip to the Alps and even her GCSE exams. Shannon was seen by various doctors before finally being diagnosed with Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) after her father, Christopher Dodd, researched her symptoms online. There are only 45 people in the UK who have the condition, which is a complex neurological disorder characterised by periods of excessive amounts of sleep and altered behaviour. The teenager wants to become a nurse so she can help others, but is worried her condition will get in the way of her dream. Shannon, a college student in Bolton, Greater Manchester said: 'It is like being awake in a coma. It takes part of your life away with it. 'It's like I'm in my own little world and I don't recognise people. When I'm awake it's like I'm sleepwalking. 'The year when Alexandra Burke went on . X Factor was particularly bad for my parents as I kept singing . Hallelujah for four days solid. What makes it worse is that I can't sing . at all and I only knew the chorus to the song. 'I was like a broken record on repeat and just kept singing hallelujah over and over again.' Shannon has episodes each month, which usually last about 12 days, during which time she can sleep for about 22 hours per day. When she is awake, her behaviour changes as she can become aggressive and demands sweets and chocolate, and needs around-the-clock care from her parents. 'It takes part of your likfe away with it': Shannon, 17, suffers from Kleine-Levin Syndrome, which is sometimes called Sleeping Beauty syndrome . Bizarre episodes: The condition also makes the former Army cadet belt out pop songs, walk around naked and have ghostly hallucinations while she sleeps . It also affects her memory, and she says huge chunks of her teenage years are blank. Shannon added: 'My memory of when it first happened was playing in the pool with my brother Jake. I just started singing JLS really loud but I can't really remember much else. 'Then all I wanted to do was sleep, I think everyone thought I must have been bored or tired. I'd just crash and in the morning I'd have to be dragged out of bed. 'My family thought I was trying to be awkward and lazy and they had to literally pull the quilt off me and out of bed. It must have been very maddening. 'I think they thought I was being an obnoxious teenager. Looking back, the first time I started singing they didn't think much of it because they thought I'd been bitten by something.' She said the second episode happened when she returned to school in the September. Mystery solved: Shannon was seen by various doctors before finally being diagnosed after her father, Christopher Dodd (pictured), researched her symptoms online . 'I had just gone into Year 9,' she added. 'I was in my English lesson and I kept falling asleep. I had an . overwhelming urge that I had to go to sleep. 'I . kept getting told off and I got moved to the front of the class. I . actually fell asleep in class and my teacher shouted at me and she moved . me to the front of the class. 'I . couldn't help it though as I just felt overwhelmingly tired. I couldn't . keep awake and ended up getting sent to the head of year's office. As . far as the school was concerned, I was just being rude.' She said she saw various doctors who were unable to help. She . said: 'I was like a machine, I ate like a pig and slept. I binged on . Galaxy chocolate and wine gum sweets or anything which I could get my . hands on and then I'd go back to bed for three or four days and then I'd . come out of it. Missed treasured moments: Shannon, pictured with her family, has slept through birthdays, Christmases, holidays including a skiing trip to the Alps and even her GCSE exams . 'In the meantime, my stepdad thought that he would have a look on the internet at sleeping disorders and saw one which ticked every box. 'When it happens I get a feeling like a rush up through my chest to my neck and then I get a headache all day. I'd describe the feeling as similar to a panic attack, it starts in my chest and the feeling moves up to my throat.' Shannon is now on medication normally used for epilepsy sufferers. KLS is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence and sometimes will begin after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 22 hours a day. This symptom lasts between days and weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients are fine between episodes. Shannon is just one of 1,000 people worldwide to suffer from the disorder which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. Around 70per cent of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the disorder. She went on: 'I miss parties, Christmases and every year when we go away I have an episode, I even missed some of my GCSEs because of it. I completely fell asleep in my English Literature exam. 'I wouldn't remember if I had gone out because I'd be so spaced out in a dreamlike state. When I am in the middle of an episode I am like a zombie. 'I've just come to accept it now, although it is frustrating. I don't know when the episodes will come to an end it's like a waiting game.' Her mother, Julie Ratcliffe, 56, said: 'They were taking blood tests because they thought she was drunk or on drugs, then they thought it was epilepsy. 'Even when we go to appointments and it is on her medical records, the doctors don't know what it is. 'When she is in an episode it can be very stressful and she can be very challenging. She has a vague expression on her face and I can get about 50 texts at work asking for things because she has forgotten she has already texted. She added: 'We feel better knowing it is not life-threatening, but there is not enough information, nobody knows the answers.'","Shannon Magee has rare neurological disorder called Kleine-Levin Syndrome .

Dozens of photographs of First World War soldiers convalescing in an English village after being wounded on the Western Front were posted on the internet today by members of a new local history society. Pictures show injured soldiers being cared for at a temporary military hospital in Shepreth, Cambridgeshire, nearly 100 years ago. They were posted on the website of the Shepreth Memory Preservation Society - www.oldshep.co.uk - as Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 2014. Far away from trench horrors: This image is among dozens of photogrpahs released for the first time showing First World War soldiers recuperating at a military hospital in Shepreth in Cambridgeshire . 'Fascinating': The photographs have been posted on the website of the Shepreth Memory Preservation Society as Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 1914 . Two years ago, a postcard written to a Great War soldier in 1915 was found behind a wooden panel in Shepreth Village Hall, which was used as a military hospital between 1914 and 1919. Villagers said several people, whose relatives had worked as nurses at the hospital, revealed that they had Great War photographs in family albums after reading about the discovery of the postcard. Website designer Jordan Smith - one of the founders of the Shepreth Memory Preservation Society - has collated the images and included them in a feature about Shepreth during the First World War. 'Several families very kindly said we could copy the photographs and we felt that as many people as possible should be able to see them,' said Mr Smith, 20, who grew up in Shepreth. Remembering the past: Villagers in Shepreth were prompted to come forward with the pictures after a postcard written by a Great War soldier was discovered behind a panel in the village hall two years ago . Recovering: Wounded soldiers pose for photographs while convalescing at the military hospital in Shepreth . 'We hope people find them as fascinating as we do.

He added: 'We very much hope that people will recognise some of the faces in the pictures and tell us something about them.' In December 2010, carpenter Alan Payne found a postcard, addressed to Private Edward Wolstencroft of the Royal Fusiliers, while fixing the Shepreth Village Hall floor.

An eerie image of what some say is Jesus on the Turin Shroud has intrigued historians and religious believers for decades. Now one Lancashire town has its own version, albeit in rather less mysterious circumstances. Born-again Christian Terry O'Neill decided to have an intricate design depicting Jesus tattooed on his back. But when he woke the next morning, he found the pattern had left a ghostly imprint on the T-shirt he had worn to bed. Tat's eerie: Terry O'Neill holds up his T-shirt bearing the ghostly image of Jesus created when his newly inked tattoo of Christ created an imprint overnight . Hand of God: Tattoo artist Jay Abbott copies the iconic image of Jesus onto Mr O'Neill's back . Friends have dubbed it the Adlington . Shroud after the Greater Manchester town where he lives because of its similarity to the image in Turin. Mr O'Neill, 43, said: 'It was amazing. It's a shroud. They are going to frame it and put it up in the (tattoo) shop.' The father-of-two had his tattoo inked at Psycho Monkey, in Adlington, near Bolton. Afterwards, staff at the shop gave him a spare T-shirt to wear until he got home so he that did not ruin his clothes. When he took the T shirt off, he discovered it had created an imprint of Jesus's face on it. Shop manager Alan Calderbank said: 'We . gave him a T shirt so he wouldn't spoil his bedsheets and he gave it . back with an imprint of Jesus or, as we call it, The Adlington Shroud.' The body art cost £900 and took tattoo . artist Jay Abbott more than 14 hours to create. Mr O'Neill, who got his . first tattoo at the age of 18, said: 'It's not finished yet - it will . be even better once it is.' Heaven sent: Mr O'Neill's friends call his tattoo the Adlington shroud, after the town near Bolton, Greater Manchester, where he lives . He had the idea for the tattoo when he . saw a similar image on someone's arm in a magazine - but Mr Abbott said . it would look better if it was big. Mr O'Neill said: 'I was looking for somewhere to put it - I was running out of space. I thought, what about my back?' He said his family and friends' jaws dropped when they saw it. 'His eyes are glazed and piercing. It just looks so real,' he added. Mr O'Neill said the second sitting was particularly sore, but he refused pain-relieving gel in honour of Jesus. He said: 'I thought that would be cheating a bit with me being a Christian. Jesus went through a lot more.' Mr O'Neill, a drummer in The Taser . Puppets, a band that has recently signed to an independent record label, . turned to religion about 15 years ago. He said: 'I'm a born-again Christian. I don't think I was a nice person before I became a Christian. I've had a lot of lucky escapes and have been in some bad situations.' The imprint left by Mr O'Neill's tattoo (left) bears a chilling resemblance to the image in the Turin Shroud (right), which some say shows the face of Jesus Christ, shown here on a black-and-white negative . The Turin Shroud is a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. The Vatican, which owns the relic, hails it as an exploration of the ‘darkest mystery of faith’. But the church has shied away from any definitive statement over whether the shroud - which is supposed to have formed Christ's burial robe - is real. It was kept in a French convent for years - by nuns who patched it, and where it was damaged by fire. The Shroud was given to the Turin Archbishop in 1578 by the Duke of Savoy and has been kept in the Cathedral ever since. Carbon dating tests in 1988 dated it from between 1260 and 1390 - implying it was a fake. In 1999, two Israeli scientists said plant pollen found on the Shroud supported the view that it comes from the Holy Land. There have been numerous calls for further testing but the Vatican has always refused.","Musician Terry O'Neill, 43, had large picture of son of God inked on his back .

Boxing Day set a new British record for the number of shoppers who went online, figures showed today as crowds descended on high streets once again for another day of frenzied sales. While thousands of shoppers queued outside stores up and down the country to get ahead of the game, millions more made the most of tumbling prices from the comfort of their own homes. Britons spent 14 million hours trawling websites yesterday, paying around 113 million visits to online retailers on what became the UK's biggest day for internet shopping, analysts said. The figures emerged as stores threw open . their doors this morning, offering further discounts and sparking scenes . of mayhem on shop floors. Bargain hunters: While shoppers packed London's Oxford Street today millions have chosen to shop online this year . Sign of the times: Store on London's Oxford Street today tempts shoppers with last minute discounts. Stores in the West End expect to take £1bn in the run up to Christmas . Web sales were up by 17 per cent on Boxing Day last year, according to market data firm Experian. Figures were slightly lower than the 126 million online visits predicted for Boxing Day, something experts attributed to a 'sales creep' which saw retailers begin to slash prices before Christmas. James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said: 'Boxing Day set a new British record for online shopping with 113 million visits going to retail websites in a single day. 'However, with a number of the major retailers bringing their sales forward to Christmas Eve, the impact of that was that Boxing Day was slightly muted and not as prolific as we forecast.' Figures show that Christmas Eve was 86 . per cent bigger than last year as a shopping day, and Christmas Day was . 71 per cent bigger. Bag it up: While the high streets of Britain thronged with shoppers, web sales were up by 17 per cent on Boxing Day last year . While Boxing Day fell short of expectations, online shopping is still set to be up on last year by about 30 per cent. John Lewis today revealed that their online sales are growing at 40 per cent a year. The department store, which started it’s . online sale on Christmas Eve, said that increasingly their customers . were visiting stores and shopping online. Enticing customers: Shoppers file into John Lewis in Leicester in the hope of grabbing some bargains as the store's post Christmas sale begins today . Desperate for a bargain: Shoppers queue up outside John Lewis in London's Oxford Street for the start of its clearance sale today . Hunting the best deals: While thousands queued outside stores to get ahead of the game, millions more set an online record for the number of visitors to retail websites . A spokesman said: 'Shops are . absolutely key to our business, and as well as growth in sales from our . shops, we are actively investing in our physical estate. 'While . our online business is growing at 40 per cent, shops are also seeing . growth, and as our customers become more omnichannel, our online and . physical offers are more closely dependent than ever before.' The company said it was offering discounts of up to £300 TV brands including Sharp and Panasonic. It was another busy day in London's . bustling West End where footfall hit record levels yesterday - up 31.3 . per cent on Boxing Day last year. Similar scenes played out across the . rest of the country as retailers offered hefty discounts in a bid to . lure shoppers and compete with online rivals. Discount-hungry shoppers were in force again today with the West End alone expecting to take tens of millions of pounds. Flagship . department stores in the West End such as Selfridges and the House of . Fraser are expected to net millions in sales from rich tourists from .

Jace Tyrrell, a spokesman for the New West End Company which represents shops in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street, said he expects this year’s sales to beat last year's. He said: 'I think it is going to be a very big 48 hours for the UK's shops. 'A lot of people are wanting to get out of the house having spent the last few days inside for Christmas will hit the shops. 'We hit our forecast of £50m takings yesterday and we expect tens of millions of pounds to be taken today.' The West End alone expects to net a massive £1billion in the six weeks from mid November until the end of the December sales. Most shops have seen profits rise by between two and ten per cent compared with this time last year. The . busy post Christmas trade is crucial to helping shops recover from the . slump in sales this summer, which many have blamed on the Olympics. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the dash for discounts was boosted by consumers who were feeling the pinch. BRC . spokesman Richard Dodd said: 'Customers are under lots of financial . pressure and are really keen on seeking out value and taking advantage . of bargains. 'Today will be another big day when some retailers will launch their sales and that will help to continue the momentum.' Kent's .

The mall, which predicts some 900,000 people will surge through its doors during the next six days, is open until 10pm tonight. Robert Goodman, Bluewater's general manager, said: 'Boxing Day's momentum has continued into today, with the opening of the John Lewis clearance sale being a major draw.' The UK's largest independent shoe retailer Cloggs also saw online visits surge over Christmas and Boxing Day - with a 1000 per cent increase in customers using a handheld device to surf the store. Cloggs said it experienced a record level of users, with more than ever using an smartphone or simliar device to try and bag a bargain on the move. Chris Thomas, Cloggs' founder and CEO, said: 'Christmas Day itself and Boxing Day broke all records, in terms of visitor numbers and sales as people took advantage of aggressive discounting available across all big brand names. 'Our busiest days of the year were Christmas and Boxing Day, when we experienced a record level of visitors and sales through handheld devices. 'We have seen an increase of 1000 per cent compared to last year. Consumers are checking offers and prices and making purchases on the go, wherever they are and whenever they feel like it.

Goodbye: Lord Strathclyde's resignation was announced as the Prime Minister and his deputy unveiled a 'mid-term review' packed with new policy pledges . David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s attempts to restore Coalition unity were dealt an embarrassing blow yesterday as the longest-serving member of the Tory frontbench quit with a parting blast at the Lib Dems. Lord Strathclyde, whose resignation was announced as the Prime Minister and his deputy unveiled a ‘mid-term review’ packed with new policy pledges, admitted that in ‘moments of irritation’ he ‘might well have said’ that the Coalition had ‘broken down in the Lords’. The Cabinet minister said the Lib Dems increasingly faced a choice over whether to disrupt individual pieces of legislation or pull together and accept they will be judged on the overall success of the Government. The Leader of the Lords is also understood to have grown frustrated at having to steer legislation through the Upper House in the face of serial rebellions by Left-wing Lib Dem peers, who Mr Clegg appears unable to control. Disappointing: David Cameron (pictured) and Nick Clegg's attempts to restore Coalition unity were dealt an embarrassing blow . The announcement of his resignation . could not have been more badly timed for Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, who . yesterday refused to rule out another coalition deal after the next . General Election as they promised help for working families, pensioners . and housebuyers. Both . insisted the Coalition would endure until the day of the next election . in May 2015 as they attempted to head off backbench critics who want the . two parties to go their separate ways. No . 10 officials said Lord Strathclyde, whose wealth is estimated at . £10million and was an insurance broker before he entered politics, was . keen to return to the private sector after 25 years of continuous . service on the Conservative frontbench, 15 of them as leader of the Tory . peers. Lord Strathclyde, whose full name is . Thomas Galloway Dunlop du Roy de Blicquy Galbraith, was one of the most . colourful Cabinet members. His . parties at Tory conferences were famous for bottles of champagne piled . high in baths full of ice in his hotel suite, before they were deemed . inappropriate in times of austerity. Tory . MPs expressed amazement that news of his departure was not released . last week, rather than only hours before Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg’s . mid-term review. Committing the Government to 180 . policy measures, the Prime Minister sought to characterise the Coalition . as a ‘Ronseal deal’ which ‘does what it says on the tin’. Both he and Mr Clegg declined to rule . out a fresh deal between the Tories and the Lib Dems after 2015 – while . Mr Cameron claimed that their sense of ‘shared purpose’ had, if . anything, grown since 2010. The Coalition document identified six . priority areas for reform – childcare, elderly care costs, pensions, . housing, personal freedoms and investment in the roads network – with . detailed policies due to be unveiled over the next few months. Plans include underwriting some . mortgages, helping first-time buyers who are unable to raise a large . deposit, while planning rules will be eased to promote housebuilding. Working parents are expected to get up . to £2,000 in help with childcare costs per child, while the potentially . huge costs of long-term care for the elderly will be capped – but at a . higher level than the £35,000 proposed by an independent review. Asked how his ‘marriage’ to Mr Clegg . was faring, the Prime Minister said: ‘We are married – not to each . other. We are both happily married. This is a government, not a . relationship.’ Mr Clegg added: ‘Of course we can . fight, as we will do, as two separate, independent parties [at the . election]. Of course we will set out different visions of the future. ‘But we will govern and provide this . country with good government until the election is held in May 2015.’ The Lib Dem leader was scathing about Labour’s opposition to deficit . reduction measures – suggesting he would not countenance a coalition . deal with Ed Miliband. The Prime Minister insisted he was . fighting for a Tory majority, but refused to rule out a new power- . sharing arrangement, even if he won a small lead in the Commons. But Lord Strathclyde told Channel 4 News: ‘I think all of us would much rather be in a single party government.’ The school day should be dramatically extended to ten hours to improve standards and make it easier for parents who work, a group of reforming Tory MPs said yesterday. The 2020 Conservatives group called for pupils to be in class from 8am to 6pm. A typical state secondary school day runs from 9am to 3.30pm – just six and a half hours. In a report designed to encourage more radical reforms in the public sector, the MPs also called for wider study of key languages such as Mandarin. The report also backs George Osborne’s plan for benefit rates to be set regionally so state handouts don’t deter people from working in low income areas. The report said: ‘As both parents are working more hours, schools should facilitate work, at the same time as improving educational standards. ‘The length of the school day may need to change. In Hollywood schools are open from 8am to 6pm, 360 days a year. And if exams are failed, students come back in the holidays to catch up.’","Lord Strathclyde resigns as Leader of the Lords after almost three years .

Since then their marital War of the Roses has continued with Lancashire-born Edwin and Yorkshire-born Mary, 89, bickering over who left the lights on and whose turn it was to tidy up. The golden oldies celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary with a family party at a hotel in their hometown of Glossop, Derbyshire last weekend. Mary, 89, said: 'We only bicker over silly things really - but I do think those little rows keep us happier because everything is in the open. The little things: The couple are celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary and attribute their long marriage to having an argument every single day, even over little things . 'There are no secrets between us and nobody is brooding or sulking. We have a little disagreement and then we move on. 'We usually have little arguments about whose turn it is to tidy up. Edwin also has a thing for leaving doors and drawers open, as well as constantly leaving lights on. 'I'm always pulling him about it and I think he only has a moan when I moan at him - but that's just because he knows I'm right.' Longevity: The couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall (where they had an argument over who would dance with Mary) Dance partners: 'We met in the town hall at a dance. I used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days' said Mary . The couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall in Hessle near Hull when Edwin was stationed from his role as an anti-tank rifle operator with the South Lancashire Regiment during World War Two, and Mary worked in an aircraft munitions factory. They married just eight months later on January 2, 1943 in Hessle Parish Church. Mary said: 'We met in the town hall at a dance. I used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days. Family: Couple have 10 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren . 'Edwin asked if he could have the last waltz and I said yes. It turned out that he was arguing with a friend over who would ask me and Edwin won - so you could say we even met because of a row.' She added: 'I remember getting married like it was yesterday. It was snowing and we couldn't have our pictures taken so we had to wait till later at the reception to have them taken - I'm sure there were a few words exchanged between us then.' After having their eldest daughter, Pam, now 68, the couple moved to Manchester and Edwin worked as a telephone engineer and Mary worked in an office at the Smithfield market in Manchester. They and went on to have three more children, 10 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. Mary said: 'We have always been close as a family - most of us live within about 20 minutes of each other, which is nice. 'Pam takes me out quite a bit and Edwin likes to go out on his mobility scooter when he can so we have a little time apart to do our own things.' 'Despite our little tiffs we are still as firmly in love now as we were back them. I don't think the majority of people these days who are getting together will last like we have. 'The problem is it's too easy for people to pack marriage in rather than stay together now and give it a go. 'When Edwin tells me off for not putting things away after I've used them I just tell him I'll put them away when I'm good and finished with them.' Mary said: 'We had such a nice party four 70th wedding anniversary. All our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all came to visit us which was lovely. Wedded bliss: The couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary with all their friends and family . Healthy marriage: They usually argue over little things like Edwin leaving the lights on . 'Our eldest Pam made us a special anniversary cake with fruit and sponge with roses on the top and we all enjoyed having a little party. 'It was also a rare day for us too because we didn't have a go at each other about anything. I'm sure that was was because we were celebrating and there was nothing to complain about.' Edwin said: 'Mary tells me off for leaving a door open before I've even gone through it and it was usually case of I'm in the wrong. 'In the past I would give back as good as I got but over the years I've just learnt to say three special words: ""you're right, dear."" - and she probably is.'","Edwin, 93, and Mary Daubney, 89, say a daily squabble clears the air .

A grandmother who agreed to donate her entire body to medical research has finally been cremated - two years after her death. After developing breast cancer in 1973 and having to undergo a mastectomy, Betty Lambert vowed to let scientists at Manchester University use her for academic studies so they could try to find a cure for cancer . She initially agreed to be used as a guinea pig for research into arthritis but after the retired newsagent discovered she had terminal lung cancer in 2010 she offered to donate her entire body following her death. When she died the following November . aged 87 her only daughter, Diane Hibbert, 54, contacted the . anatomy department at Manchester University and they came to take her . away. Scientists then used . her body and used her organs to help them research various illnesses . including cancer and helped with the eduction of up to 4,000 medical, . dental and science students. It . was two years before the family were finally able to lay Mrs Lambert to rest . after her body was released by the university, who arranged her funeral, . last July. Now Mrs Lambert's ashes are back at Mrs Hibbert's . home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where she is preparing to fulfil . her mum's lifelong dream of scattering her ashes off the back of Mrs Hibbert's . Harley Davidson motorbike. Mrs Hibbert said: 'Mum would have been chuffed to bits if she'd have been there to . see the funeral. The service was wonderful and that's really given me . closure. It was hard when she died and I couldn't bury her, but now . she's back with me in her urn my living room. 'I would love to fulfil my promise and . take her out on my Harley Davidson but when I got her back I couldn't . bring myself to take them out to scatter. Betty, pictured with husband Jim, vowed to let her body be used for science after discovering there was no cure for cancer . 'I will do it and I'll know when the time is right. Plus they are really heavy - in fact almost as heavy as when she was alive.' Talking . of her reaction to her mother's bizarre request, Mrs Hibbert, who lives with . husband Graham, 59, said: 'I totally supported her with what she wanted . to do. I was in the police at the time and I went to lots of . post-mortems, so I wasn't freaked out about it. 'She . was really into teaching and used to love watching operations on TV. She had even watched a video about a mastectomy so she knew what had . happened to her.' Mrs Lambert married her husband in . 1946. He served in the RAF and the couple went on to run a newsagent's . shop which they had for 20 years. They retired to Cleveleys in 1980 but Mr Lambert died in 1988 aged 70 and his wife returned to Bolton to live with her daughter. Mrs Hibbert said: 'Mum had her left breast removed because of cancer in 1973 when . she was 50 and within two days she had a mastectomy. It's not like now . when you have treatment like chemotherapy, they just took away the . breast. Mrs Lambert's wish was for her ashes to be scattered off the back of her daughter's Harley Davidson motorbike . Diane Hibbert waited two years for her mother's body to be released, after the selfless grandmother donated her organs for medical science . 'She was surprised that there was no cure for cancer, so after her mastectomy she applied to donate her body to medical research so that she could help other sufferers in the future.' Mrs Lambert agreed to have let scientists test her arms and fingers for arthritis but in July 2010 she taken ill with a bad back and tests showed the cancer had returned to her lungs. Mrs Hibbert said: 'She died in my arms on . November 6. It was horrible but in glad it was me that was there with . her. She didn't suffer which is what matters. I can't ask for any more . than that and the university took her body away. 'They wouldn't tell us what sort of . research was carried out but eventually we got a letter from the . university saying that they were releasing my mum's body. 'They said that they had arranged a cremation service and I rang them up to confirm that we would be attending. Pictured: Betty, left aged five and right, 21, fought breast and lung cancer, and was determined that doctors use her to help them research cancer .

'They said that I could have as many . people there as I liked but with it being two years after her death only . three of us went, but it was still a lovely service. Betty Lambert donated her body to medical science at Manchester University after she fought cancer twice . 'We didn't want to wear black so we wore mum's favourite colour purple. We arrived at the crematorium at 10:30am expecting to be handed her ashes but the university had paid for a proper funeral with a hearse - complete with a purple wreath. 'Even the chaplain had a purple tie on. I know it was a coincidence but my mum gets her own way every time.' 'Looking back it was difficult but it was what she wanted. I have since asked my husband what he would do if I wanted to donate my body like mum did. He said he'd be happy with whatever I wanted so I'm considering it. After all they did such a good job with mum's funeral I know I'd be in good hands.' At the time of Mrs Lambert's death, professor of anatomy at the university, Alan Crossman said: 'We send our condolences to Betty Lambert's family and are tremendously grateful to Mrs Lambert for her selfless and public spirited donation. 'Such donations, no doubt made after some difficult contemplation and with great courage, benefit the education of around 2,000 medical, dental and science students each year.

A man is accused of raping his 'sex buddy' after she told him she had started a new relationship and didn't want to cheat on her new boyfriend, a court heard. It's alleged Shahzaman Meah, 28, raped the woman in her flat. Meah went on trial today at Luton Crown Court, pleading not guilty to raping the 25-year-old woman at her home in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, on May 1, 2011. Luton Crown Court heard how Meah is accused of having sex with the woman against her will in her Bedfordshire home . Prosecutor Isabel Delamere said that Meah, of Bedford, and the woman had met four months earlier and had become good friends. They were both single and they would phone and text each other and see each other occasionally at her flat. Miss Delamere said that by February 2011 the victim, in a series of text messages to the defendant, told him she wanted a relationship but didn't feel she could get into anything too deep. She texted him saying that she 'would like to find is a friend with benefits.' The prosecutor said that Mr Meah replied with a text saying 'You want a s*** buddy.' A series of text messages between the pair led to them then arranging to have sex with each other. The court heard that the pair had sex on a number of occasions following that but, by April of 2011, she had started a relationship with a new boyfriend. The prosecutor said that on April 14 that year, the woman sent Mr Meah a text saying 'When you do see me next time, it will be strictly a friendship.' Miss Delamere said 'He texted back: ""We can s***, right?"" to which she replied ""No sorry babes"".' The prosecutor said that when the defendant then sent a text asking why she would no longer sleep with him, and she said she did not want to cheat on her partner. Miss Delamere told the jury 'She is telling him - no more sex. 'By April, she has made it perfectly plain she is in a relationship and is happy to chat.' The court heard on in May 2011 at around 9.30pm, the defendant is alleged to have arrived at the woman's flat, having been drinking. Miss Delamere said that when the defendant tried to touch her breasts, the woman told him 'No, stop it, it's not going to happen.' It's alleged that, moments later, he attacked her and had sex with her against her will. Arrested later that night, the defendant is alleged to have told police in an interview 'It's ridiculous, she invited me in' and said he had had sex with her on three previous occasions. Miss Delamere told the jury that the issue for them to consider was whether the woman had consented to sex that night. The case continues.

While many streets across the country are decorated with festive greetings, the roads of Birmingham look distinctly less cheerful. Rubbish has piled up around the city after collections were suspended for Christmas and Boxing Day leaving residents angry. But homeowners are asking why the city's council did not organise an extra collection, or rearrange the delivery date so it would not clash with Christmas or Boxing Day. Piles of rubbish litter the Moseley area of Birmingham, and residents fear the winds will blow the rubbish all over their community . Household waste in the area has built up over the festive period, and homeowners have demanded to know why a collection could not have been made . Those living in Bordersley Green in Birmingham say the winds threaten to scatter the rubbish everywhere. Furious resident Lisa Wenner, 69, who has lived in the area all her life, said: 'The rubbish is 10ft high in some places, the winds are getting pretty high and if the bags aren't collected soon the rubbish will be blown everywhere. 'If that happens we are going to have rubbish in our houses and gardens, what would be done about that? 'Surely an extra collection could have been arranged for the day after Boxing Day?' Local Ian Richards, 35, an account manager, added: 'I don't pay my council tax for my rubbish not to be collected just because it's Christmas. 'Surely if a service is going to be removed then we should get some money back? 'Did they not think that Christmas means far more rubbish? Far more for us to deal with? Rubbish dump: The council says they widely publicised the fact that collections would not be made over Christmas . Residents have been 'shocked' that the council did not provide a Christmas rubbish collection . 'I bet they blame government cuts or something, but they could have just rearranged it for the next day. 'As for seeing adverts about it . across the city, well I certainly didn't see any, it came as a complete . shock to me and my family.' Mother-of-two Emily Clapham, 29, is frightened that the build up of waste will spread germs: 'The whole area is going to stink soon, it's raining here and the bags are becoming saturated with the water. 'Soon this is going to start breeding diseases, we should not have to deal with that, especially not at this time of year.' Resident James Furnish, 45, said: 'We all have a bit more rubbish at Christmas, and when they don't come and pick it up what can we do? 'It's piled high down every street, you have to walked down the pavements everywhere, and sometimes it's started to blow into the road. 'They haven't even cleared the litter bins they provide on the streets, so those are overflowing as well. 'Pretty soon this whole area is going to start to smell awful. It's disgusting.' Eric Pickles has warned councils they face a cut in Government funding if they do not reinstate weekly collections . A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the collection dates had been 'widely publicised'. He said: 'The bins are collected weekly, they were suspended over Christmas Day and Boxing Day and that was widely publicised. 'Collections resumed on the 27th and will be continuing over New Year, if they would normally have a collection on Boxing Day they will have on on January 2.' Birmingham City Council could face the wrath of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who warned councils last month that they face a cut in Government funding if they refuse to reinstate weekly bin collections. Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles says a voluntary scheme has ‘stopped the rot’ and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes.But he threatened to go further - suggesting central Government grants to local authorities will be slashed in the long-term for those that refuse to bring back the weekly bin round.At least half the homes in Britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks. The politician said in his vow to bring back weekly collections: 'I believe it’s a fundamental right for . every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their . chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for . it to be collected.'Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks. The Audit Commission downgraded councils in their inspections if they kept weekly collections and told them to adopt 'progressive' solutions of 'only emptying the refuse bin on a fortnightly basis or issuing smaller bins'. The Coalition announced a £250million scheme to prevent more local authorities moving to fortnightly collections and persuade others to switch back. Mr Pickles has approved bids from 85 councils. But despite his strong words, just five local authorities have restored weekly collections in full.",Council says it 'widely publicised' fact that collections were suspended .

Afghanistan has suffered more than most as a country after decades of war and civil unrest. With the country now appearing on a more stable footing politically, the same cannot be said of its once flourishing silk trade which it was so proud of. Cheaper, foreign imports are threatening generations of silkmaking families, as well as there being a decreasing lack of support for silkworm farmers. Dying trade? An Afghan handles cocoons at a silk factory in Herat competition from cheaper synthetic silk from China and Pakistan has put the industry at great risk . Proud: An Afghan man shows raw silk ready to be woven into fabric - but the question is can it flourish in a day and age of cheaper imports? Tradition: Skills which have been passed down through the generations of families in Herat are at serious risk of being lost in time . 'In the past, our handicrafts were very valuable, and businesspeople and wealth customers used to go to those who were producing silk handkerchiefs, shawls and turbans,' said Mohammad Hussain, speaking to The Institute of War And Peace Reporting, 75, his body bent after more than half a century as a silk weaver. 'Owning silk products was then a sign of nobility, but now the good customers are gone, along with our high wages.' Cheaper, synthetic silk is being bought as an alternative, but as with any material which is cheaper to produce and buy, the quality is also lessened. Career path: This young boy may have to re-evaluate whether it is a safe option to work in the silk industry . Sad: In Herat, once an important stop on the famous Silk Route, a few famlies are struggling to keep a once-splendid silk industry alive . Show of support: An Afghan woman buys raw silk to be woven into fabric in a market place in Herat - supporting the local industry . A pure, silk scarf might cost around 400 Afghanis (£5), whereas a synthetic version which could be imported from nearby Pakistan or China would only cost 150 Afghanis (£2). The major products of Herat silk weaving industries include shawls, scarves, turbans and other silken fabrics. Speaking to the Pahjwok Afghan news, Ghulam Sakhi, 75, who learned the trade from his father when he was 10 said: 'Thirty years ago there were 1,000 silk weaving looms in Herat city, all of which were using pure silk, but now most of the weavers use synthetic silk. 'I learned weaving from my father when I was 10 and for the past 65 years I have never used synthetic silk.' He has been weaving ever since and only with natural fibres. The price of natural threads has . doubled, and a once thriving stop on the 'Silk Road' now faces its . biggest challenge yet, not only to keep family tradition going, but to . also make a profitable business out of it. One kilogram of pure silk costs more . than 3,000 Afghanis while synthetic Pakistani silk can be bought for 420 . Afghanis per kilogram. However, . if the Afghan government stepped in and offered a fairer deal to . support the silkworm farmers and weavers, the industry could compete . with its synthetic opposite. 'Silk . weaving is a halal craft and it reveals the native art of Herat . province', said Abas Azami, head of silkworm producers and silk weavers, . to the Pahjwok. 'The government should not let this art vanish,' Azami said. A long stretch: A map showing the traditional 'Silk Road' or 'Silk Route;' however with the growth of free trade, a country's individual industry is threatened . Worrying: The Herat region of northern Afghanistan has historically been the centre of silk production, textiles, and a burgeoning garment industry .","Herat, to the west of Kabul, was once an important stop on the Silk Road - but now their once-proud industry faces a serious threat .

The mother of Neon Roberts, the seven-year-old boy with cancer, said today she planned to launch an eleventh-hour appeal against him having radiotherapy. Sally Roberts, 37, said she felt there were 'other options' for her son, who is due to begin radiotherapy next week, and said she wanted to find a medic who would back her up. She also admitted fear of missing out on grandchildren was a factor in her fight. Determined: Sally Roberts told Daybreak's Matt Barbet and Kate Garraway that she wanted to explore other treatments for her son . Mrs Roberts, who has been fighting against conventional medical treatment for her son's brain tumour, said this morning she planned to appeal against a court's decision that Neon should have the treatment. She told Daybreak: 'I feel there are other options out there that we haven't explored and I would really like the opportunity to explore these other options. 'I wasn't given enough time last time to present them with what I wanted to and that was a professional expert - a medic to back what I'm saying. 'It should be my choice because I'm the one that is going to be caring for Neon or the rest... I have always been his main carer.' 'I just want to do the best thing for Neon and if the doctors have to go down their route and something happens to Neon, am I not going to hold that in my mind?' Seriously ill: Neon Roberts is due to start radiotherapy next week . She added: 'I would like the opportunity to do all these other treatments for him.' Neon was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour and had an operation to remove it on October 25th last year. Doctors said he needed radiotherapy as routine follow-up treatment but his mother missed three hospital appointments and went on the run with Neon for four days without telling his father Ben, her estranged husband. Neon is now due to begin radiotherapy next week, after a judge at the Family Division of London's High Court overruled Mrs Roberts' wishes to try alternative therapies. The child has spent the last week being prepared for his treatment by doctors. Today Mrs Roberts told Daybreak that she had many concerns about her son having radiotherapy, including 'damaging the DNA'. She said: 'Just altering it and him never recovering from that.  His growth.  Infertile. 'No grandchildren is a big factor.  And there's just so many other treatments that he could be having.' She said in countries including Germany and China, doctors used treatments including 'hyperthermia' in which heat is used to stimulate healing alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy to lessen the risk of side effects. Mrs Roberts said radiotherapy was 'not a sure thing' and denied that stopping it would kill her son. 'That's from the doctors here in the UK,' she said, 'We've gone abroad and found other doctors who are backing what I've been saying from the beginning.... In other countries in the world they are giving these other treatments a chance and doing very well with them. She also refuted concerns that her son might be running out of time, saying: 'That's what they keep saying but I disagree'. 'We all want what's best for Neon': Sally Roberts on Daybreak this morning . Mrs Roberts, who is from New Zealand but lives in Brighton, East Sussex, said her son was 'doing very well' following the most recent operation to remove cancerous cells. Neon and his twin sister, Electra, spent Christmas Day with their father, an IT consultant from Knightsbridge, west London, and his family after Mr Roberts told Mrs Roberts she was not welcome following the family rift over how best to treat Neon. Mr Roberts believes his son should receive conventional treatment based on advice from his son's medical team. Doctors advise that patients in cases like Neon's should receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 28 days of surgery for the best chance of survival.  The boy's doctors agree that there may be side-effects, but say that without the treatment the little boy could be dead within a few weeks. A doctor told the court last month: 'This boy has a very highly malignant disease and he will die very quickly unless somebody gets their hands on him to treat him.' Mrs Roberts said: 'We all want what's best for Neon.  He is the most amazing little boy.'
