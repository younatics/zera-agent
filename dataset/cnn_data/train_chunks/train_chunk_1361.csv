"Craig Revel Horwood plays the pantomime villain on Strictly Come Dancing, but there is someone to whom he would never award anything less than a ten. His dog Sophie. The BBC TV judge confesses to being 'unbelievably in love' with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, rescued by his partner, Damon Scott, five years ago. 'I have never been broody for children,' says Mr Horwood, 'so it comes as a complete surprise to find out how much I love her.' Craig Revel Horwood (pictured with dog Sophie) confesses to being 'unbelievably in love' his the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and is heartbroken after she was diagnosed with a diseased heart . Sadly, that happy state of affairs may end soon. Sophie shares a curse common to many Cavaliers: a diseased heart. Now, despite a regime involving eight tablets a day, Sophie is unlikely to survive for very much longer. 'I am so upset,' says Mr Horwood. 'You know it's imminent, but you have to take one day at a time and enjoy it.' Sophie's condition highlights a serious issue — one that sheds light on modern attitudes to animal welfare. For centuries, mankind has been refining descendants of the wolf into ever-more-specialised breeds of dog. Many of them are prey to some particular illness or other, but some varieties are so riddled with inherited defects that even breed enthusiasts are calling for action to combat the problem — either by mixing them with other breeds or by getting rid of them altogether. Sophie shares a curse common to many Cavaliers: Mitral Valve Disease which is fatal for the animals . And so it is with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The breed is a longer-nosed version of the King Charles Spaniel and the result of an attempt in the 1920s to create a prettier dog from a small pool of 'founder' animals. Mild of temperament, the Cavalier is the pet of choice for many families, and last year some 5,100 puppies were registered with the Kennel Club — the nearest thing to a regulator in the dog world. Famous owners have included Princess Margaret, Ronald Reagan and Frank Sinatra. But that cute little head masks a terrible problem. 'I cannot support the breeding of Cavaliers and will, sadly, not be getting another,' says Carol Fowler, a former owner. 'I don't believe human selfishness should mean that animals suffer.' Cavaliers disproportionately suffer from two major defects. The first is Mitral Valve Disease (MVD), in which one of the valves controlling blood flow through the heart shrivels over time, reducing the amount of blood pumped into the body. Affected dogs can end up struggling for breath, before finally dying of the disease. The second is a very distressing condition called Syringomyelia (SM). Put simply, this involves the brain being too big for the skull. As a result, the brain squeezes through the opening leading to the spinal cord, causing fluid in the spine to press on nerves, resulting in pain and disability. Critics of the Cavalier breeding fraternity ascribe this suffering, in part at least, to the quest for a dog with a puppy-like appearance. 'Years of breeding for a prettier head has resulted in too small a skull,' says Margaret Carter, a one-time Cavalier breeder. 'Seventy per cent of Cavaliers will have gone on to develop SM by the age of six.' But it is not just Cavalier King Charles Spaniels which are prone to hereditary problems, Labrador Retrievers (pictured) are especially likely to develop obesity which leads to a collection of other health probelms . She has witnessed the consequences at first hand. 'My Cavalier was a top stud dog, and he started showing signs of SM at the age of 11,' she says. 'It got so bad that he ended up screaming with pain. It couldn't be controlled and he had to be put down.' Ms Fowler endured a similar experience to Mrs Carter with her first Cavalier, called Bonnie. 'Bonnie had to be put to sleep aged five as a result of unbearable pain,' she says. 'It broke my heart to know how much she'd suffered during her short life, and how little I could do for her. 'I foolishly got another Cavalier, Rosie, only to find out through an MRI scan that she, too, had SM. She fared better as a result of early surgery and drug treatment, but developed MVD and died aged 11.' Mrs Carter was a leading light in the Cavalier Breeders Club until removed from her position as spokesman on health in 2008. Her crime was to say in a BBC TV documentary that she had seen a scan confirming that a champion Cavalier, which had sired many litters, suffered from SM. Dog breeding and showing are, she says, 'almost like a cult — a kind of brainwashing. People know that inbreeding is dangerous in humans, but somehow don't see that it's dangerous in animals. 'There is a kind of code of silence that you do not talk about health problems in your breed,' she adds. 'It's about status. It's about not wanting to have to remove your best dog from the show ring or your breeding programme; about puppy sales and stud fees; it's about prestige.' Cavaliers (left) are also prone to Syringomyelia, a painful condition where the skull is simply too small for the skull, while the Pug breed (right) are prone to eye damage while their short faces gives them breathing difficulties . Today, Mrs Carter and Ms Fowler are pressing for the Kennel Club to refuse to register Cavalier puppies whose parents have not had MRI scans on their skulls and tests on their heart. The Kennel Club began a voluntary testing scheme in 2012, but up to November 2014 only 200 owners had submitted their animals for inspection. Mrs Carter says breeders avoid it because results are published, but the club claims that there is doubt about the effectiveness of screening in reducing SM and MVD. Bill Lambert, the Kennel Club's health manager, says: 'We have no powers as such, except the power to encourage and educate. In terms of breeding to produce exaggerated features, we have tried to control this through the show ring, and we believe we are beginning to have some success. 'One of the ways we deal with this is to put the health of the dog to the forefront in competition.' People supporting the campaign for mandatory MRI scans and heart testing can add their names to an online petition on Change.org. Mr Revel Horwood and his partner have now come out in support of mandatory testing for Cavaliers before puppies can be registered. In his entry on the petition, the Strictly judge writes: 'My partner, Damon, and I have a 13-year-old King Charles Cavalier called Sophie. She is the most beautiful little girl. 'But she has a lot of health issues that mean she's on full-time medication. There needs to be a law put in place to make sure Cavaliers are MRI-scanned and heart-tested before breeding.' In response to the criticism, breeders say they are being unfairly persecuted. Sheena Maclaine, chairman of the Cavalier Breeders Club, says her members love their dogs, and she denies that incestuous breeding is widespread. The German Shepherd (pictured like many large breeds, are prone to hip dysplasia which causes pain, arthritis, and problems walking . Mrs Maclaine, who has 29 Cavaliers, two of them suffering from SM, says: 'People who have done the campaigning have almost witch-hunted certain kennels and breeders. That has effectively driven people underground, away from scanning centres that publish the results of those scans.' Even dogs whose MRI tests give them a 'clear' bill of health can still produce a problem puppy, she argues, and she does not believe that head shape is the issue. While acknowledging that SM can cause 'dreadful' pain, she questions whether the percentage of dogs that suffer such pain 'would even be recognisable'. 'The Cavalier is one of the wussiest breeds, so if you comb its ears and catch a hair tangle it will scream,' she says. Dan O'Neill, a vet who has undertaken a study for the RSPCA on genetic conditions in dogs, is promoting more understanding of canine-inherited disease through the new Vetcompass project, in which vets share the results of screening. He warns: 'If we want to keep the breed — and Cavaliers are beautiful and adorable dogs — we have to breed away from it very gradually or we could end up introducing a new set of problems.' Ultimately, he suggests the broader public's attitudes to pedigree dogs may need to undergo a shift. 'A lot of the decisions about how dogs look are not driven by the Kennel Club, they are driven by the public,' he says. 'Flavours of the month at the moment are Pugs and French Bulldogs. Both can suffer from breathing problems because of their noses.' Mrs Carter has now set up the Companion Cavalier Club, and offers advice on how to reduce the risk of genetic disease. 'I believe the only way to save the Cavalier is to out-cross it to another breed,' she says. 'But as far as breeders are concerned, the product would be a mongrel.'","Craig Revel Horwood is devoted to Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Sophie .

"Controversial ‘Frankenfood’ crops could be grown in British fields from next year after the European Parliament yesterday voted for a new approvals process. The system will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a GM crop – once it has been ruled safe by EFSA, which is the EU’s food safety body. Most of Europe, including Germany and France, wants to ban the crops amid concerns over their impact on the environment, food and human health. However, the governments of Britain and Spain support the technology and are keen to see the crops in the fields and on dinner plates as soon as possible. European Parliament voted that each country should decide for itself whether or not to grow a GM crop - once it has been ruled safe by EFSA, the EU's food safety body (file photo) The Conservatives, Labour and Lib-Dems in Westminster all support the growing of GM crops, despite widespread public opposition. By contrast, the administrations in Scotland, Wales and many local councils oppose the technology having seen the problems that have emerged in the United States. There, superweeds have developed that are difficult to control, leading to the need for ever more powerful chemical weedkillers, while important species like the Monarch butterfly are under threat. Critics fear that pollen from GM plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops, as well as honey, so polluting the entire food chain. The first GM crops to be grown here could be varieties of corn or maize created by the labs of Syngenta and Monsanto, which are modified to give them protection from the weedkiller glyphosate, also known as RoundUp Ready. The idea is that these crops can be blanket sprayed with the chemical which will kills off any weeds but allows the corn to grow. Once a GM crop is approved by the EU and UK government as safe, any farmer in England will be allowed to grow it, regardless of any objections from people in the area. The only restrictions will surround the need to minimise the spread of pollen from the crop to neighbouring farms. This will involve setting official ‘separation distances’ between the GM and other crops, which will differ depending on the plants involved. The government has not decided what these separation distances should be. Any farmer where pollen does spread to pollute crops belonging to another person is at risk of being sued for the resulting loss in value. An organic farmer whose crop became contaminated may find it loses its status and value if contaminated with GM genes. Advocates claim that – in the future – GM technology could ‘feed the world’ by allowing crops to be grown in areas of drought or create plants that are high in beneficial nutrients. A farmer shows two corncobs of genetically engineered corn (right) next to two non-genetically modified corncobs (left). Critics fear that pollen from GM plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops as well as honey, which could pollute the entire food chain (file photo) Professor Johnjoe McFadden, professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey, welcomed the decision by MEPS, saying it would speed the commercial cultivation of GM crops. He said: ‘Devolving decisions down to national level will allow each country to make up their own mind and thereby free up GM technology from the pressure of intense anti-GM lobbying at the centre of the EU. ‘Farmers and consumers across the EU will be more accepting of GM technology when they can see its benefits across their borders.’ Friends of the Earth campaigner Clare Oxborrow said the new rules ‘could open the door to GM crops being grown in England’. She said: ‘Successive UK Governments have consistently championed GM crops and food - despite the fact that this technology has been hugely over-hyped and delivered little.’ Keith Taylor, Green MEP for South East England who voted against the proposals, said that despite giving EU countries new powers to ban GM in their territories, the move would mean more GM crops for the UK. ‘This is because our pro-GM Government are now able to give the go-ahead to more authorisations,’ he said. ‘I remain convinced that GM organisms cause contamination of crops, are bad for our health and that small scale sustainable agriculture is the answer to solving future food shortages.’ The new arrangements are largely the work of the pro-GM campaigner and former Tory food and farming secretary, Owen Paterson, who was sacked last year. He, along with ministers from Spain, led the drive in Brussels to speed the commercial growing of GM crops. The policy sprang out of a series of secret briefings between ministers, their civil servants and the GM industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which began in the summer of 2012. Ministers subsequently promised incentives for investment, a strategy for biotech and, most significantly, efforts to reduce regulation and speed up GM crop approvals, which came to fruition yesterday. Peter Melchett, policy director at the Soil Association said: ‘The EU proposal fails to require countries to ensure that any GM crops grown will not contaminate GM free farms.’ He added: ‘The commercial GM crops currently in the pipeline for Europe are not those with traits associated with ""feeding the world"". They are crops engineered by GM companies to be resistant to weed killers that they too have manufactured. ‘The use of these in the US has led to huge problems with resistant weeds, and an increase in the use of pesticides. Yields from GM crops are lower than non-GM, and in the US GM crops are damaging wildlife. The Monarch butterfly, one of the wonders of the world, is at threat thanks to these crops.’","The EU's food safety body will have the power to rule GM crops safe .

"A couple who spotted a 'weather beaten man' at a remote creek in northern Queensland have contacted police saying they believe he may be missing Senior Sergeant Mick Isles, who disappeared in mysterious circumstances five years ago. Graziers, Bill and Elizabeth Tudehope were on a remote road at Landers Creek on the Burdekin River near Millaroo last Sunday when they saw the man who was of the same age and height as the missing police officer, the Townsville Bulletin reported. Sgt Isles has not been seen since September 23, 2009 after leaving his home in the far northern Queensland town of Ayr for a workshop 80km north in Townsville. He never arrived. Vanished: Senior Sergeant Mick Isles (pictured), 58, went missing in 2009 in strange circumstances and has never been found until now, when a north Queensland couple possibly sighted him at a remote creek . Graziers, Bill and Elizabeth Tudehope were on a remote road at Landers Creek on the Burdekin River (pictured) near Millaroo last Sunday when they saw the man . Six days later, his police issue Toyota Aurion was found at Eight Mile Creek, 170km south. The latest sighting of Sgt Isles is at a location between Ayr and Eight Mile Creek. Following his disappearance, police conducted extensive searches for the 58-year-old, using trackers, the stock squad and the State Emergency Service. Apart from one alleged sighting by a truck driver soon after his disappearance, Sgt Isles has never been seen again until now. At the time of his disappearance, Sgt Isles was on only his third day back at work after a lengthy period of sick leave following a Crime and Misconduct Commission investigation which had exonerated him of drug trafficking and money laundering allegations. His wife, Fiona, reported her husband's failure to return home after finding an an undated note on the last page of a used notebook. The note read, 'This is nobody's fault but mine. I feel old and have lost the will to do anything. I feel a failure and a loser, particularly to my family whom I love so much'. The note was signed 'Mick + Dad'. Northern Queensland police have sent a team of detectives to the Burdekin river area to interview the couple who made the report . A shot gun and ammunition were found to be missing from the Isle's family home. Officers found a police uniform shirt  stuffed under the front passenger seat of Sgt isles' abandoned car and in the boot, along with a hessian bag, was a blanket and a box of ammunition that was missing 16 cartridges, a pair of uniform pants and a belt. The car keys were on the front driver's side floor of the vehicle and a set of senior sergeant epaulettes had been placed in the centre drink console. At a 2012 inquest, Queensland State Coroner Michael Barnes found Senior Sergeant Michael Isles 'intentionally took his own life' on the day he was reported missing. Mr Barnes said: 'I sincerely regret the distress this will cause his family'. The Townsville Bulletin reported that on Monday northern Queensland police have sent a team of detectives to the Burdekin river area to interview the couple who made the report. Mr and Mrs Tudehope said they saw a man walking along a sugar cane train track mid-morning last Sunday and they asked him if he wanted a lift. 'He wasn’t interested in talking to me and didn’t want any help,' Mr Tudehope said. They contacted Sgt isles son Steven, who travelled to the couples' property and the contacted police.","Reports of a man resembling a missing North Queensland policeman .

"TV presenter Jonathan Ross has posted a series of hilarious pictures of unrecognisable celebrity waxworks on his Twitter page after a trip to a museum – but can you work out who they are supposed to represent without peeking at the name tags? Mr Ross, 54, and his family visited the Louis Tussaud's Waxworks Museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, in Canada over the weekend. In one tweet he wrote: ‘It's almost like Canada want to start a war. Here's the Queen...’ with a picture of a waxwork with only the faintest passing resemblance to her Majesty. Scroll down for video . This waxwork (left) is far more dishevelled than the woman it represents, while this Material Girl (right) looks nothing like the famous celebrity it is meant to be capturing - can you guess who they are? (Answers at  the bottom) The Louis Tussaud's Waxworks Museum website boasts: ‘Louis Tussaud's Waxworks is a collection of instantly recognizable, true-to-life wax figures crafted by recognized wax artists from around the world.’ The building houses more than 100 ‘true-to-life’ wax figures in 16 themed galleries. The collection features both the famous and the infamous, including film stars, politicians and religious figures along with well-known musicians. Guests have the opportunity to sit on Oprah's couch, jump into bed with Yoko and John Lennon, and even measure up to Arnold Schwarzenenegger. This waxwork's expression (left) suggests he recently saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus, while (right) is one of the more life-like figures . This waxwork (left) had meticulously parted hair in real life. Some say (right) was the most accurate Bond of all time - but which one is it?

The actress (left) represents would definitely Runaway, while these screen legends are looking worse for wear . Two famous American talk show hosts - but who's who? Clue: One is the longest-serving late night talk show host in TV history . Louis Tussaud was the great-grandson of Marie Tussaud, creator of the Madame Tussauds wax museums. He worked at Madame Tussauds museum as a wax figure sculptor but eventually left and set up on his own. He founded a waxwork museum in London’s Regent street in 1890, which was destroyed in a fire just a year later. Louis Tussaud's waxwork museum in Great Yarmouth, which closed in October 2012, was described as the world's worst waxworks museum because so many of its models looked nothing like the people they were supposed to represent. His museums are not connected to his great-grandmother's Madame Tussauds waxwork museums. The Niagara Falls attraction has mixed reviews on Trip Advisor, with many guests complaining they needed to read the name tags in order to identify who the waxworks were supposed to represent. MailOnline has contacted the museum for a comment. The museum's manager, Tim Parker, said: 'We had a great time' was one of his reply tweets. Wax figures and their likenesses are always subject to everyones own individual perception and interpretation of wax celebrities. 'We do look to provide our guests with a rare opportunity to experience and get up close, and take an interactive photo with over 150 wax figures of some of the world's top celebrities.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott today stood by a plan that doctors fear will end bulk billing and force them to slug patients with higher prices from next week. Doctors are on the warpath over the plan to cut the Medicare rebate for short doctor consultations (between 6 and 9 minutes) by $20.10 from Monday. Some clinics have already announced they will cut bulk billing plans for groups of people and other doctors are considering whether they will pass the cost on to patients. But the policy seems likely to be overturned in February as Labor has joined a majority of senators in pledging to vote down the plan when Parliament sits. Scroll down for video . Lead opponent: Dr Stephen Parnis (pictured right), Vice President of the Australian Medical Association, has been vocal in his opposition to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Medicare rebate cuts . Letter: Doctors are already providing patients with letters such as this in opposition to the Abbott Government's plan to cut the Medicare rebate for short consultations (between 6 and 9 minutes) Rebate cut: The government argues that the Medicare rebate cut will encourage longer consultations and an end to 'six minute medicine' Many GPs are writing letters to patients, penning Facebook posts and plastering their surgeries with protest posters over the plan. Labor, the Greens and three key crossbench senators - Nick Xenophon, Jacqui Lambie and Ricky Muir - have indicated they will vote to disallow. That means a majority of senators currently oppose the policy. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten described the policy as the 'D-Day for GPs in Australia' and pledged to stop the 'sneaky' measure. 'Our position is unequivocal, it's in black and white. We will oppose Tony Abbott, absolutely, changing the rebate system for GPs,' he said. On Radio 3AW this morning, Mr Abbott said: 'I say to all of the critics: If you don't like what we are doing, come up with your alternative because we simply cannot go on as a government, and as a country, living beyond our means.' Mr Abbott said it was essential for the government to get healthcare costs under control in order to save the Medicare system. Dr Stephen Parnis, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said the plan had caused a 'level of angst and indeed fury among general practitioners'. Northwest Health, a chain of surgeries in Tamworth, New South Wales, has announced it will no longer be able to 'routinely offer bulk billing to concession card holders and children under 16' There will also be a $5 cut to Medicare rebates for non-concessional patients from July . 'They have many patients for whom the reduction of over $20... will impose incredible hardship on them,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Doctors are being forced to choose between an unviable business and patients who will be unable to see them on the basis of costs. Rural Doctors Association of Australia CEO Jenny Johsnon said she had 'no doubt' doctors were already making changes. 'We get feedback from a lot of doctors who are looking at their cost structures,' she said. 'The issue is the general practices are also small businesses.' A NSW AMA branch spokesman Lachlan Jones said many doctors were still considering whether the introduce changes, as the plan was introduced just prior to the holiday period. Northwest Health, a chain of medical centres in Tamworth, New South Wales, announced cuts to their bulk billing practices this week. 'Due to the changes to Medicare rebates that commence on 19 January our practice will no longer be able to routinely offer bulk billing to concession card holders and children under 16,' they wrote on their Facebook page. Campaigners against Medicare cuts have also shared an image of a letter given to patients at a medical practice. The letter said: 'This practice is not able to absorb the cut made by the government and will have to pass it on to you, the patient'. A spokesman for Health Minister Sussan Ley said she would explain the benefits of the plan with senators. 'The majority of GP consultations in Australia already last over 10 minutes and will therefore be unaffected. Bulk billing will also remain free for patients.' He said the changes encourage longer consultations with patients and not 'six minute medicine'. The government tabled the change as a regulation before Christmas. Parliament can review the regulation on February 9.","Furious doctors pen letters to patients opposing Medicare rebate cut .

"Some fisherman will do anything to catch a big one but when it means wading into waist-deep, crocodile-infested waters you have to wonder if it's actually worth it. Onlookers were left dumbfounded by the behaviour of a man, who spent 'at least 15 minutes' in the water at Shady Camp on the Mary River in the Northern Territory. Jason Rogers was there fishing nearby and photographed the man in the water. He said that at the time there was a four-and-half-foot crocodile floating within 50 metres of where the man was fishing. Scroll down for video . To the shock of onlookers the man is seen fishing waist-deep in crocodile infested waters . Mr Rogers has been a fishing guide in the area for 24 years and said that the spot was known for its barramundi fishing. 'It was one of the most dangerous things I've seen happen for years. The man just pulled up in a car with his mates and trotted off to the other side,' Rogers, 45, said. 'Then he waded in up to his waist and started fishing even though there were four or five crocs in and around him. 'But it's not the first time I've seen it happen. It didn't worry him at all. People are willing to take a chance so that they can catch some good barramundi.' The man was fishing for barramundi and took no notice of the crocodiles around him . Mr Rogers had been fishing from the bank before the man arrived and caught 15 barramundi before the man started out into the water. 'He was in there for at least 15 minutes. When he was out in the water you couldn't even have shouted to him to warn him that a crocodile was coming because the river was rushing so strongly. I'll never know how he didn't get eaten,' he said. It's believed that the man was from Darwin Mr Rogers said, and that he had fished in the area before for barramundi. Initially the fisherman just stood off the shore in shallow water as he fished . 'I've seen a lot of silly stuff with people going out and doing exactly the same thing as this man. But the thing is 20 years ago there wasn't as many crocodiles around. There's a bigger population of crocodiles now,' Mr Rogers said. 'A lot of people get taken and it's all because of stupidity. It can happen as quick as a wink, so if you get into the water up to your chest like this you wouldn't even see one coming. 'There'd be absolutely nothing you could do about it. He may have done this before, but the way he's going he won't be doing it for much longer.'

"A jury in the trial of the former lover of paedophile rock singer Ian Watkins has been told it will be allowed to return a majority verdict. Joanne Mjadzelics is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of possessing indecent images of children. The prosecution say the former prostitute was obsessed with the Lostprophets singer and would do anything to fuel his depraved desires. Joanne Mjadzelics, pictured left, is on trial accused of posessing indecent images of children. The prosecution claim she was obsessed with Ian Watkins, pictured right, and would do anything to fuel his depraved desires . Mjadzelics, 39, of Doncaster, is charged with four counts of possessing indecent images of a child, one of inciting Watkins to send her illegal photographs and two of sending pictures to Watkins. Watkins is currently serving a 35 year term for a string of sex offences - including the attempted rape of a fan’s baby. Mjadzelics’ defence is she was trying to entrap Watkins by collecting evidence on his sex offending. She insists she had reported Watkins to police before, but was not taken seriously - and was regarded by officers as a “nut job” and a spurned ex-girlfriend who was a “nuisance” to a famous singer. The Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees previously urged the 11-member jury to return a unanimous verdict. But after more than eight hours of deliberations, Judge Rees said she would accept a majority verdict on which at least 10 of them agreed. During her summing up of the case yesterday, she said: “You must reach your decision based on what you have heard in this court room - not on anything that you have seen or heard outside it.” The Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees, sitting at Cardiff Crown Court, said he would accept a majority verdict on which at least 10 of the jury agreed .

"Ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients’ lives to meet response time targets. One trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call-outs to non-urgent. This freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes. Scroll down for video . Ambulance trusts have been accused of reclassifying call-outs to free them from response time targets . East of England Ambulance Service admits that 8,324 patients had their cases reclassified in this way in a two-month period last year. At least 57 were not taken to hospital and died. Some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a ‘do not resuscitate’ order. It emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – Yorkshire – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases. Managers made the calls ‘non-urgent’ when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight-minute window. Denise Burke, of the Norfolk-based campaign group Action on Ambulances, said: ‘They are playing Russian roulette with patients’ lives. ‘What is most shocking with East Anglia is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated. They were deciding on patients’ quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later. 'A lot of pressure': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the number of ambulances dispatched within eight minutes had increased by 22 per cent this year . ‘Any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones’ lives could have been extended by a few months.’ Paramedics say they are so overstretched they often rely on firemen and police officers to take patients to hospital. NHS figures last week showed that eight out of ten ambulance trusts in England miss the target for responding to life-threatening calls. Extra demand is driven by an ageing population and lack of out-of-hours GP care. Ambulance crews also regularly find themselves having to queue outside casualty because staff are too busy to accept them. One paramedic, based in the North East, said demand had grown by 6 per cent a year over the past decade. He added: ‘It’s awful. I think it’s on the verge of collapse. We’re getting stuck at hospitals and we can’t respond to patients.’ Yesterday an internal investigation by East of England Ambulance Service found that in January and February last year managers agreed to downgrade calls involving terminally ill patients. Rather than being sent an ambulance within eight minutes, these patients were made to wait between 20 and 50 minutes. And in some cases ambulances crews were not sent at all and relatives were just given advice on the phone. The guidance had not been approved by the trust’s most senior management and was flagged up by concerned staff. Anthony Marsh, the ambulance service’s chief executive, said he immediately launched an investigation and ordered the reversal of the changes. A leaked document last month revealed proposals to extend the window for emergency calls deemed slightly less serious from eight minutes to 19 minutes. The issue was raised in the Commons yesterday by Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham (centre) who blamed ambulance rationing on the growing pressure on accident and emergency wards . The issue was raised in the Commons yesterday by Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham who said: ‘Withholding ambulances from terminally ill people is the most cruel form of rationing imaginable.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the number of ambulances dispatched within eight minutes had increased by 22 per cent this year and the service was ‘doing very well under a lot of pressure’. Last week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents because they were unable to cope with the huge volume of patients in casualty. Ambulance crews in the north of England have been forced to make 170-mile round trips as 999 provisions reached breaking point. The North West Ambulance Service deployed two emergency vehicles from Cumbria to Blackpool overnight last Monday. They were dispatched to help with several life-threatening 999 calls made in the area. However, the move stretched other crews serving in South Cumbria, with a smaller pool of ambulances having to cover a greater area as a result. Mike Oliver, a NWAS paramedic and Unison representative for Cumbria and Lancashire, branded the move 'unacceptable'. The North West Ambulance Service deployed two ambulances from Millom and Ulverston to Blackpool to cope with a surge in demand . 'Surely there were other crews in Lancashire that would have been able to come from Preston, Leyland or Lancaster,' he said. 'To take two ambulances from South Cumbria to help out in Blackpool just doesn't make sense. 'It's not unusual for crews from South Cumbria to respond to 999 calls in Lancashire. This is usually when they have been called from a hospital after transporting a patient. 'However, when it is 86 miles away we have to ask why weren't other ambulances closer called, especially as South Cumbria is already one of the worst performing areas for response targets.' A spokesman for NWAS said the seven other 24/7 crews based further east in South Cumbria could not be sent to Blackpool as they were too busy. He said: 'Occasionally there is a need to move resources to cope with high demand in a particular area. 'The decision to deploy two vehicles from the Millom and Ulverston areas on the night of January 5 and early hours on January 6 was due to an increase in demand. 'On the night, the vehicles in the Fylde area, dealt with a high number of immediately life-threatening emergency calls. 'Resources are not restricted to areas. We constantly monitor activity against the demand and then decide whether extra resources are required. 'Every patient who needed an ambulance in Cumbria during those hours was responded to.' NWAS has experienced a huge increase in demand so far this year as A&E departments continue to struggle with high demand. Between January 1 and 11, NWAS received 12,813 emergency calls in Cumbria and Lancashire - up roughly a quarter compared to the same period last year.","Report revealed ambulances are being held back from terminally ill patients .

"A teaching assistant who was '8 out of 10 drunk' left a man scarred for life after she smashed a pint glass in his face during a six-hour pub crawl. Ashleigh Bayliff, 28, lost her temper and lashed out at Phillip Campbell during a row whilst out  celebrating her boyfriend's birthday. Mr Campbell was hit just above his right eye, causing heavy bleeding from a one-centimetre gash. He also suffered four other cuts on his forehead. In the run-up to the attack Bayliff, from Burnley, Lancashire, had been drinking in seven pubs and was being verbally loud and aggressive. She later told police that on a drunkenness scale of one to 10, she was 'eight.' At Burnley Crown Court, Bayliff admitted wounding and was given an eight-month sentence, suspended for a year, with a 12-week curfew. Ashleigh Bayliff was given a suspended sentence after she glassed a friend of her boyfriend while drunk . Philip Campbell (right) was left with a scar above his eye after a row with Bayliff about his girlfriend Lianna Akbar (left) Bayliff was also ordered to pay £750 compensation at £100 a month and a £100 victim surcharge. She is currently suspended from her job as a teaching assistant at the Hendon Brook School in Nelson, Lancashire, and may now lose her employment. The court had heard that the incident occurred on July 5 last year after Bayliff went out with friends to celebrate her partner Danny Simpkin's 33rd birthday. Engineer Mr Campbell, 31, a close friend of Mr Simpkin, was also amongst the party, some of whom had been out from at least 5pm. David Clarke, prosecuting said 'a lot of drink had been consumed by some, if not all of them' and they had been to six pubs before arriving at the Bridge Beer House in Burnley. Mr Campbell - who was with his girlfriend Lianna Akbar, 29 - had himself drunk eight pints of lager and the group were all about to leave when the incident, which was caught on CCTV, happened, the court heard. Mr Clarke said the victim recalled a conversation with Bayliff about why she did not get on with Miss Akbar. In a statement to police, Mr Campbell said Bayliff was 'drunk and being verbally loud and aggressive'. The court heard the group had visited six pubs and were in their seventh when Bayliff unleashed the attack . The prosecutor added: 'His next recollection is her swinging a tall glass in her hand to the right side of his face, striking him just above his right eye, smashing the glass in his face. He was bleeding heavily.' The victim went to hospital after suffering a one centimetre cut and four smaller cuts on his forehead. Bayliff was later arrested at home and claimed she had been attacked. The prosecutor said Bayliff maintained the conversation had become heated and both had been verbally aggressive to each other. She already had received a caution for battery from 2007. In his impact statement, Mr Campbell said following the attack he had stayed away from social gatherings with his friends in case Bayliff turned up. In mitigation defence counsel Hugh McKee said Bayliff was of 'exemplary good character' and added: 'She is still at a loss to understand how it is that it came to this. They were clearly talking at cross purposes.' CCTV in The Bridge Beer House in Burnley, Lancashire captured the attack, which happened in July last year . Mr McKee added: 'She accepts she lost control of her temper. It's very short-lived, it can perhaps even be described as momentary. 'Mr Campbell can be seen pointing his finger very close to her face and obviously that's when the defendant says he was being abusive to her. But, she has to accept responsibility for what she did and she does. 'Obviously, this matter had affected her life to a very, very great extent. She is suspended from her job and her social life has changed completely. 'One struggles to see how she will maintain that employment, although that decision has not yet been made. Obviously, if she doesn't keep it, she doesn't know what she will do. 'There will be no repetition.There will be no further offending. She understands if she escapes custody, it may be by the skin of her teeth.' Passing sentence, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'I am quite satisfied this was an isolated incident and unlikely to be repeated. But people who cause injury with glasses in public houses generally receive custodial sentences, because, of course, that is conduct that needs to be prevented and discouraged, if at all possible.'","28-year-old had been out drinking to celebrate her boyfriend's birthday .

"The boss of Morrisons supermarket was fired  today after its founder told him management 'can't make excuses all the time' for poor sales. Dalton Philips was forced out this morning after the business announced the worst Christmas results of any of the Big Four grocers - down 3.1 per cent in the past three months. Founder Sir Ken Morrison has been critical of Mr Philips' leadership and last year accused him of speaking 'bull****' during a board meeting. Mr Philips told the BBC: 'I'm very sad to be leaving but when a board wants to make a change you accept that and move on. Tonight I will be going for a very large beer. 'I don't have another job to go to. My wife has given me a long list of chores to do'. Casualty: Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has quit  after the supermarket revealed sales were down 3.1 per cent over the Christmas period. Founder Sir Ken Morrison said there should be no excuses for poor results . Andrew Higginson, who is due to become chairman later this month, said the company's board believed the push to return the business to growth was 'best done under new leadership. 'I think Dalton's had a good run,' he added. 'It's a judgement call. In essence, we just feel it's time for a fresh look to try and regain some of that trading momentum.' With the company's new chairman calling for a 'fresh pair of eyes' over the business, shares in Morrisons surged by four per cent, 7.65p, to 184.5p. It also announced that it will shut 10 unprofitable stores with the loss of 400 jobs. Today former  Morrisons director Roger Owen called for a board clear-out saying the Bradford-based grocer has proved 'they are not capable of running a school tuck shop'. Sainsbury's suffered its worst Christmas in a decade with like-for-like sales down 1.7 per cent and at Tesco comparable sales in the the three months to start of January were down 2.9 per cent. Sainsbury's has announced plans to cut 500 jobs as part of a streamlining of its central operations. Dalton Philips will leave  after a bitter row with founder Sir Ken Morrison, who yesterday launched a fresh attack on the management ahead of disappointing festive sales. Sir Ken Morrison told the Mail: 'I think management has been somewhat remiss in the way they are running the business. They can't make excuses all the time. 'The only thing I'm interested in is performance,' he said. Morrison, whose family still hold a minority stake in the firm, had criticised the strategy being used by Dalton Philips and accused him of speaking 'bull****'. Morrison appears to be just as vexed, although choosing less incendiary language. Poor year: Morrisons has suffered declining sales in each quarter although sales have improved . Back in June Morrison told Philips that despite owning cattle 'you have a lot more bull**** than I do.' He also said the group's losses were 'disastrous'. Morrisons along with all of its major rivals have been suffering fierce competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. More than half of all British households visited at least one of the two retailers over the 12 weeks to January 4, latest research from Kantar Worldpanel showed. It added that Aldi's market share rose to 4.8 per cent from 4 per cent a year earlier while Lidl surged to 3.5 per cent from 3.1 per cent a year ago. With upmarket supermarket Waitrose also making progress, the UK's four main grocers all lost market share in the three-month period. Overall, prices were 0.9 per cent lower on a like-for-like basis in the period due to lower commodity costs and the continuing price war. High Street expert Phil Dorrell, of Retail Remedy, said: ‘If other members of the big four supermarkets are the squeezed middle, Morrisons is being steamrollered flat. ‘The departure of its chief executive was grimly inevitable. With the most dated stores and weakest business strategy of the old-guard grocers, Morrisons has haemorrhaged both sales and share to the brash young discounters who took its cheap-prices unique selling point, improved it, and then unceremoniously yanked the rug from underneath it. ‘The biggest surprise in these grim results is the decision to close just ten stores.’ Sainsbury's is set to axe 500 jobs as part of the latest round of cost-cutting in the supermarket industry. The chain said its proposals for the streamlining of its central operations will require around 500 fewer roles, spread across all divisions and grades in its store support centres. The steps form part of the £500 million in cost savings outlined by the retailer in a strategic review published in November. Sainsbury's is to axe 500 jobs in a 'streamlining' of its support operations . It has already announced plans to mothball a number of schemes in its property pipeline and intends to reduce the amount of money spent on new space over the next three years. In a letter to staff, chief executive Mike Coupe said: 'We want to work through this period of uncertainty as quickly as possible, while making sure we consult with colleagues who are affected by these changes. 'We're committed to treating all impacted colleagues with respect, during what we know will be a difficult time. 'I recognise that these changes will be difficult for our colleagues and I can assure you the decision to make them was not taken lightly. However, I'm certain that we will be in a stronger position to deliver our new strategy and better equipped to win in these times of change as a result.'","Dalton Philips quit after supermarket revealed worst results of Big Four .

"Swimmers and surfers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at a coastal beach. Several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water at Merewether Beach on the coastline of NSW after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday. The coastal stretch between Nobbys and Stockton beaches in Newcastle remain closed for a third straight day after lifeguards spotted the large shark on Monday morning. It's believed to be the same shark that was first spotted across the weekend and it appears to have moved up north, with the entire coastline being shut down to beachgoers. Scroll down for video . Following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, the entire coastline remains shut down . Nearby resident, 14-year-old keen surfer Nicholas Tonks captured a photograph of the five-metre shark swimming behind a lifesaver on a jetski on Saturday. 'My house is pretty close to the beach so when I heard the shark alarm go off, I grabbed my camera and quickly dashed down,' the young photographer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was overlooking the beach and saw a lot of jetskis around so I looked through the lens of my camera and snapped a few shots. It wasn't until I got home, I realised I got a picture of the shark.' 'There were no attacks reported but the lifeguards did a great job to maintain and get everyone out of the water - they were very visual on their jetskis as well.' Swimmers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at a beach . Newcastle beaches have been closed for a third straight day following the sighting of a great white shark . Nobbys beach inspector Paul Bernard said: 'Our beaches are currently closed and the rest of the city's beaches will once again be closed today.' A Westpac helicopter patrol returned with no sighting on Monday morning but lifeguards are continuing their watch. 'People have been sighting it from the break walls and lifeguards have been seeing fins in the water,' Mr Bernard told AAP. 'It's quite irregular to have them hanging around constantly,' he said. He cited increased marine activity, overcast and warm weather as possible reasons for the shark's prolonged presence. It comes just less than a week after multiple sharks were spotted at the iconic Bondi Beach, forcing beachgoers out of the water and shutting down for a couple of hours until it was all clear again.

"Never has the saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' been more fitting than when a jilted wife in China chopped off her cheating husband's penis... twice. When Feng Lung, 30, discovered her husband was having an affair she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors, then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it. She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm. Fan Lung (right) turned on his wife (left) after she cut off his penis for a second time and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital . Two-timing dad-of-five Fan Lung, 32, had used his wife's mobile to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu in central China's Henan province. But after forgetting to log out of his account, stunned wife Feng came across the message and several others, and flew into a rage. Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis. Surgeons were able to reattach it, but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window. This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital. A hospital spokesman said: 'The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. 'Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. 'He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.' Lover: Zhang Hung (left) visited Fan (right) in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could . Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat. The hospital spokesman said: 'The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. 'He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.' Fan's lover, who visited him at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could. 'It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,' Zhang said.

"A friend who counseled NASCAR driver Kurt Busch's ex-girlfriend amid the couple's breakup last year testified Tuesday that Patricia Driscoll initially was brokenhearted but later set out for revenge. 'I will destroy him,' Richard Andrew Sniffen quoted Driscoll as telling him, adding that she repeatedly said she would take Busch down. The testimony by Sniffen, a Christian musician and self-described music minister who performs at NASCAR outreach events, came in a court hearing in which Driscoll is seeking a no-contact order against Busch. Out for revenge: Patricia Driscoll, the ex-girlfriend of NASCAR driver Kurt Busch (pictured together in May) said she would 'destroy' Busch hours after he allegedly assaulted her in September, a friend testified Tuesday . Court battle: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, left, described his ex girlfriend Patricia Driscoll, right, as a 'badass' who could easily best him in a fight. The pair are pictured at a Delaware court in December . Driscoll says Busch assaulted her in his motorhome at Dover International Speedway in September, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times. Busch and his attorneys have denied the allegations, which are the subject of a separate criminal investigation. They have tried to portray Driscoll as a scorned woman out to destroy his career. Busch finished testifying Tuesday morning under cross-examination from Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, who asked a series of questions, though few of them dealt directly with the alleged assault. As he has in previous testimony, Busch maintained that he believes Driscoll's repeated assertions to him that she is a trained assassin who often takes part in covert missions in Central and South American and Africa. He recalled one time when she left in camouflage gear and returned wearing a trenchcoat over a blood-spattered evening gown. 'Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,' Busch said when his attorney, Rusty Hardin, questioned why he still believed Driscoll is a hired killer. Hardin later asked what Busch might have been thinking on the night of the alleged assault about hurting Driscoll. 'Frankly, that I would have got my ass handed to me,' Busch said. Sniffen, meanwhile, said Driscoll contacted him on the night of the alleged assault and told him that Busch had pushed her and that she hit her head. 'She was upset. She was angry. She was brokenhearted,' Sniffen said, adding that Driscoll never mentioned having her head slammed into the wall three times. He also said Driscoll has never told him that she is afraid of Busch. Immediately after the incident, Driscoll seemed brokenhearted and intent on seeking 'reconciliation,' Sniffen said. But her attitude seemed to change over the days and weeks leading to the assault allegation being made public. Scorned? Attorneys for Busch say that Driscoll, pictured above with the driver, is out to trash his career . Sniffen said Driscoll went 'from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge.' 'She was almost embracing the fact that there was no going back,' he said, adding that Driscoll told him that Busch 'was not going to walk away from me.' Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship after last fall's New Hampshire race, one week before the Dover race, because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing. The first witness to testify this week was Nick Terry, a chaplain with Motor Racing Outreach, which ministers to NASCAR drivers. Terry said Driscoll showed up crying at his motorhome on the night of the alleged assault and told him Busch had grabbed her by the neck and pushed her against the wall. 'Exciting': Busch, pictured kissing Driscoll, said it was 'exciting' being with her, even though he thought she was a contract killer . But he said Driscoll never told him that Busch slammed her head into the wall, and that he and his wife did not notice any marks on Driscoll. Terry also denied Driscoll's allegations that he had been threatened and offered bribes by Busch's attorneys. Kristy Cloutier, an executive assistant to Busch, described the relationship between Busch and Driscoll as one of puppet and puppeteer. 'Patricia was the puppeteer in telling him what to do and when to do it,' she testified. Cloutier acknowledged that Busch has a temper and sometimes speaks and acts before thinking, but that she doesn't believe he is capable of physical abuse.","Busch is fighting a no-contact order ex Patricia Driscoll is trying to get .

"Lorn Cheng appeared in Sydney Central Local Court on Tuesday . A grandmother who allegedly swallowed 252 pellets of heroin while attempting to smuggle the drugs into Australia has been granted bail. Lorn Cheng, 50, was stopped by Australian Customs and Border Protective officers at Sydney Airport on January 8 after arriving on a flight from Cambodia. Her bags were scanned by officers, and ephedrine and cocaine residue were detected. A body scan was then carried out and images on it showed 'inconsistences', according to a statement from Australian Federal Police. Cheng was taken into custody by the AFP when the woman was suspected of concealing drugs inside her body. She was taken to hospital where she later passed a total of 252 pellets, which were tested and initial reports indicate the substance inside them was heroin. Further testing will be carried to find out the exact weight and purity of the substance. The pellets were about one centimetre wide and two centimetres in length. They were wrapped in what appears to be in multi-coloured latex that balloons are made out of. Cheng, from Cabramatta in Sydney's west, appeared before Sydney Central Local Court and was granted bail after being charged with importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, 7News reported. She was also ordered to surrender her passport to authorities. The woman's daughter, Brenda, was only aware of her mother's whereabouts when she appeared before court, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The 22-year-old was so worried about her mother she went as far as filing a missing person's report at Cabramatta Police Station. The 50-year-old grandmother is accused of smuggling heroin in 252 pellets she had ingested . The pellets were about one centimetre wide and two centimetres in length and were wrapped in what appears to be in multi-coloured latex that balloons are made out of . Brenda said the last time her mother had made contact was two weeks ago during her seven-week trip. 'Every time she lands, she'll call me and I'll arrange to go pick her up to save money but I got no phone call on Thursday so we got really worried,' Brenda told Fairfax Media. 'I didn't know anything, this is such a huge shock, she has never done anything like this whatsoever.' ACBPS Regional Commander Tim Fitzgerald said this method of importation was particularly concerning. She was detained by customs officers on January 8 after arriving on a flight from Cambodia, following a seven-week trip . 'If you attempt to smuggle drugs internally, you are taking a serious gamble on your health and safety,' he said in a statement. 'The potential danger this woman has put herself in is a reminder of the risks involved with this kind of concealment. 'It is also a reminder to the Australian public of the lengths that people and organised criminal groups will go to in order to import illicit drugs into our country.' AFP Acting Airport Police Commander Conrad Jensen said drug couriers and their associates face strong penalties. 'This arrest should send a warning to criminals that if you participate in these activities, you could be facing up to 25 years imprisonment', he said.

"Detroit is the arson capital of the world, but recent freezing temperatures are making ice a bigger problem for homeowners in the run-down city. A Tudor-style home in the city's historic Boston-Edison district has been turned into an ice castle after a water pipe burst four days ago in the six-degree temperatures. E.T. Williamson Sr, 56, and his family lived in the home and says they lost all of their possessions because of the disaster, and that he's thinking about suing the company that owns the building. Pretty but destructive: This Tudor-style home in Detroit, Michigan was frozen over on Friday after a third-floor water pipe burst as the region was experiencing 6F temperatures . 'We've lost everything,' he told the Detroit Free-Press on Monday. 'We lost about $100,000 worth of things. It's all gone.' Williamson, a Christian pastor, told the paper that the pipe burst on the third floor on Friday, causing water to fill the home and spill out of the windows. The water quickly froze creating amazing icicles that were as beautiful as they were destructive. The sheets of ice weighed down on the second floor to heavily that the ceiling caved into the first floor. Williamson bought the home on West Boston and 14th in June 2011 for $70,000 but the house went into foreclosure when he fell behind on his taxes and is now owned by Winfire Management. Everything is lost: Home owner E.T. Williamson Sr. stands in front of the frozen section of his house in Detroit on Monday . Homeless: Williamson says his family lost all of their possession when the pipe burst, which he estimates to equal about $100,000 . Jeff Feuereisen is the new owner of the home, according to City of Detriot records that show he purchased the house for $13,100 in November 2011. 'They came and asked me did we want to enter into a land contract to keep our house because they didn't want to put anyone out,' Williamson said. Since Friday, the house has also been damaged by a fire, further resulting in loss of the family's belongings locked inside. 'All my furniture, my couches, the stove, my son's 4-year-old Kawasaki motorcycle, everything is destroyed,' Williamson said. 'All of my suits, my shoes, and my wife's clothes. It's gone. My grandkids and my grown kids lost clothes and computers. We lost everything.'","A pipe burst on the third floor of the Tudor-style building on Friday, filling the house in several feet of water which froze when they spilled outside .

"The first notable solar flare of 2015 has been spotted on the sun, Nasa has said. An image of the event shows the powerful burst of radiation on the surface. This particular flare is not thought to be any threat to Earth - but does that not stop the burst still looking mightily impressive. This image released by Nasa shows the sun emitting a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 4:24am GMT today (11:24pm EST yesterday). Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, but when intense enough they can disturb the atmosphere . The mid-level flare was emitted by the sun and peaked this morning at 4:24am GMT (11:24pm EST yesterday). It was captured by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun constantly. This particular event was classified as an M5.6-class flare. M-class flares are a tenth the size of the most intense flares, the X-class flares. The number provides more information about its strength. An M2 is twice as intense as an M1, an M3 is three times as intense, and so on. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, but harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere and physically affect humans on the ground. However, when intense enough, they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. Seen here are giant magnetic loops 'dancing' on the sun's horizon in concert with the eruption of the solar flare - seen as a bright flash of light - in this imagery from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory taken this morning. Animation credit: Nasa/SDO . Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustration shown, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It’s goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth. It captured the images of this morning's mid-level flare . Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time. Solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The former are the flash of light from the sun, while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as 'loops' coming from the surface. While the two often accompany each other, the relationship between them is not entirely understood.","Nasa scientists in California detect sizeable flare on the sun .

"Drivers of America, you've been warned. This summer, one of the first daughters will be out on the road. Malia Obama turns 16 on July 4, making her eligible for a learner's permit in Washington, DC. She can apply for a provisional license to drive alone six months after that. When talking about her daughters' summer plans, first lady Michelle Obama told Access Hollywood: 'One child is going to be driving this summer. Look out everyone!' Scroll down for video . Sweet Sixteen: First daughter Malia Obama turns 16 on July 4, which means she'll soon be learning to drive with her learner's permit. Pictured above on April 20 going to church with her family . Chelsea Clinton was the last teen to learn how to drive in the White House, and it was dad Bill Clinton who sat in the passenger seat for lessons. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton called the lessons 'scary' since her husband had been using a chauffeur for the 12 years prior. 'I think the president has been learning a lot by driving with Chelsea,' a spokesman with her office said in February 1996. But don't expect President or Mrs Obama to take up the same teaching role with their daughter. No driving with dad: Malia (second right) was just 10 years old when her father was elected into office. Her parents say they will not be the ones teaching her how to drive. Pictured above on election night 2008 after her father's victory . While Mrs Obama wouldn't elaborate on how a president's daughter goes about learning to drive under the protection of secret service, she said 'we've got a plan'. 'I think our [Secret Service] agents don't want us driving with teenagers ... Especially the president's detail. I don't think they want him in the state when she's learning how to drive,'Mrs Obama said on Live with Kelly and Michael last month. 'We will fortunately be able to hand that responsibility over to someone else.' Malia was just 10 years old when her father was sworn in as president in January 2009. By the time he leaves office in January 2017, Malia will likely already be half-way through her first year of college. Little-sister Sasha was 7 when Mr Obama became president, and will learn how to drive once her dad is out of office.","Elder first daughter will turn 16 on July 4 - making her eligible for a learner's permit to start driving .

"A daytime nap is an essential part of every baby's routine. It allows newborns and toddlers the downtime they need to cope with crucial physical and mental development that happens in a child's early years. But scientists now believe daytime naps are also vital in helping to boost a baby's memory. The first study of its kind, carried out by a team at the University of Sheffield and Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, has identified a link between sleep and babies' development in their first year of life. Their findings reveal half an hour's nap can boost a baby's memory, helping them retain the new skills they have learned. The first study of its kind, carried out by scientists in Sheffield and Germany, has found babies who nap for at least 30 minutes can better recall new actions they have just learned, than infants who do not nap . The study focused on 216 healthy six to 12-month-old infants, and tested their ability to recall newly learned skills. The babies taking part were shown how to remove and manipulate a mitten from a hand puppet, and were given the opportunity to reproduce these actions after delays of four and 24 hours. Those infants who did not nap after learning were compared with age-matched babies who napped for at least 30 minutes within four hours of learning new skills. The experiment found only infants who had napped after the learning activity remembered the new skills while those who hadn't slept showed no evidence of remembering the new information. After a 24-hour delay, the babies given naps also showed significantly better recall compared with infants in the no-nap group. Researcher Dr Jane Herbert, from the University of Sheffield's department of psychology, said: 'These findings are particularly interesting to both parents and educationalists because they suggest that the optimal time for infants to learn new information is just before they have a sleep. The findings reveal babies learn best, retaining more information, just before they sleep . 'Until now people have presumed that the best time for infants to learn is when they are wide-awake, rather than when they are starting to feel tired, but our results show that activities occurring just before infants have a nap can be particularly valuable and well-remembered.' The scientists also discovered that flexible napping schedules which responded to different daily events could help ensure optimal learning conditions for babies. Naps shorter than 30 minutes were not found to provide sufficient time for the infants to consolidate their knowledge to a point where it could be retained in the long term. 'Parents receive lots of advice about what they should and shouldn't do with their baby's sleep schedule,' said Dr Herbert. 'This study however examined learning opportunities around naturally occurring naps and shows just how valuable activities like reading books with young children just before they go down to sleep can be.' Past studies have found sleep has an enormous benefit on adult memory. It has been found to help adults gain new insights in previously encountered problems, or the flexibility to apply existing knowledge to new tasks. Further research will examine whether sleep not only enhances the quantity of infants' memory, for example how much is remembered, but also the quality of memory, or how the recollections are used. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.","The first study of its kind has found sleep boosts babies' memories .

"The convertible red Bentley that took pride of place in Elton John's Cold War hit Nikita has emerged for sale with an estimate of £70,000. Bought by Sir Elton  from new, the plush Bentley Continental was used for the video of the 1985 hit single about a beautiful female Russian border guard called Nikita. It featured Sir Elton sat in the luxury motor taking photos of Nikita from afar before making several failed attempts to drive it through her checkpoint. The 1985 Continental Bentley Convertible (pictured) which appeared in one of Elton John's music videos is going to auction next month . The song, from the album Ice on Fire, was a number one around the world and charted at number three in the UK. The album was Sir Elton's first in almost 10 years and despite Nikita's success was not critically acclaimed. Sir Elton bought the Bentley  in February 1985, and it appeared in the music video with it's original B120 WYM registration plate. He went onto change the registration for personalised plates of B20 ELT, which remain on the vehicle to this day, before he sold the Bentley some time after.

"A Swedish monster-spotter has won a £2,000 prize for a picture he took of the legendary Scottish creature  - without leaving his home in Stockholm. Bjarne Sjöstrand, 52, spotted a long, thin object in the water on Google Earth, after he logged on to his computer 800 miles away. Mr Sjöstrand, who has never visited Scotland, won the best Loch Ness Monster sighting of 2014, in an annual competition run by bookmaker William Hill. Scroll down for video . Bjarne Sjöstrand from Stockholm, Sweden, took this picture on Google Maps - he believes it could be Nessie . This infamous picture purporting to show the Loch Ness monster was taken in 1934 by Dr Kenneth Wilson . The systems administrator was at home in Stockholm when he spotted a long thin object in the water on a Google Earth image taken above Horse Shoe Scree on the loch's southern side. Mr Sjöstrand said: 'I am very interested in anything regarding Nessie and the history of Loch Ness. 'The reason I found this image on Google Earth was that I was sitting one night at home reading about Nessie and Loch Ness on the internet and thought I would check to see if I could see something from above - and that proved to turn out well. 'I have never been to Scotland but my hopes are that one day I will visit Loch Ness.' Bjarne Sjöstrand (pictured) has now won £2,000 for his intriguing picture of the Loch's mysterious inhabitant . The picture is the latest in a series of possible Loch Ness Monster pictures. In November MailOnline reported that grainy footage had emerged showing a long and thin shape swaying in the water - one that bears a striking resemblance to Nessie’s fabled slender neck. The video shows the object waving in the choppy water, around 500ft from the loch’s shore. It was captured by Richard Collis – who counts himself amongst the most ardent Nessie cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting. But the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iPhone, and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal. 'As I was watching, I was thinking what the hell is that?’ said Mr Collis, 58, who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from Fort Augustus at the south-west end of Loch Ness. He added: ‘I don’t really believe in anything like that until I see it.' Now, Mr Sjöstrand's picture has been chosen from five contenders in the annual contest run by bookmaker William Hill in conjunction with The Inverness Courier. It topped an online poll on the Courier website, which attracted a total of 92,000 votes, and was confirmed by judges to be the year's most intriguing image. 'I'm very happy to have won the prize,' said Mr Sjöstrand. A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Gary Campbell, who keeps the official register of Loch Ness Monster sightings, said Mr Sjöstrand's image mirrored other reports of large eel-like objects in the water. 'Something like this cannot be explained,' he said. 'I would like to see further analysis of the photograph carried out.' He added the result showed the continued international interest in Loch Ness and the monster. 'Nessie is much bigger globally than people realise.' Rupert Adams, PR manager for William Hill, said the number of votes cast demonstrated the popularity of the monster mystery. All five finalists received a £50 bet on the winner of the William Hill Scottish Cup. In 2001 semi-retired photographer James Gray and friend Peter Levings took this while they were out fishing . Paranormal investigator Jonathon Bright took this photo, which he believes proves Nessie exists .","Bjarne Sjöstrand decided to search the internet after reading about Nessie .

"Watched: English teacher Kim Shaw, pictured, was followed by private detectives after taking sick leave as she was suffering stress-related conditions . Council chiefs spent £3,600 of taxpayers’ money hiring private detectives to snoop on an employee who was signed off sick. Teacher Kim Shaw, 56, was illegally tailed by the ‘Stasi-like’ snoopers for three days after bosses gave them her photograph and address. Their report included images of her visiting Asda, bending down to look at flowers, and the observation that she was wearing ‘unusual’ kitten heels. Colin Adkins, of the NASUWT union, compared Caerphilly County Borough Council in South Wales to the Stasi – the former East German secret police. Now the Information Commissioner’s Office has ruled the council had no business covertly tracking Mrs Shaw, a teacher with 30 years’ experience. Last night, the mother of two said: ‘My reaction when I saw the covert film was utter revulsion. 'Then I experienced a range of quite intense emotions, ranging from fear that someone had been almost stalking me to incredulity at the personal details in the report. The whole tone of it was absurd.’ In its report, Conquest Surveillance Services said: ‘On March 18 the subject was seen to be wearing unusual shoes. 'They may be considered inappropriate and flamboyant if there are issues of depression or even in the context of unusual for shopping and walking up steep inclines. 'The shoes were kitten heels with flowers on the front.’ The Information Commissioner’s Office – the body set up to uphold information rights – has ordered the Labour-controlled council to review its use of surveillance, saying it had no reason to have Mrs Shaw followed, and had breached the Data Protection Act. She said: ‘To think of these agents noting the way I walked, what I was saying, the expression on my face, where I was going – that was really threatening, almost violating.’ Surveillance: Footage taken by the two-man team shows Mrs Shaw, 56, shopping in Asda, pictured . Followed: The teacher is then seen walking away from the supermarket with shopping bags in her hands . Illegal: An investigation into the surveillance found the county's decision to follow Mrs Shaw was unlawful . Mrs Shaw, who taught English at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, was suspended in November 2010 for breaching confidentiality after she talked to colleagues about allegations from senior staff of ‘irregularities’ in her GCSE students’ work. Bosses who suspect staff of taking sick leave on the basis of a fake illness often mount surveillance operations to see if they are telling the truth. But yesterday’s ruling by the Information Commissioner’s Office has made such snooping more difficult. Local councils and other public bodies that want to check whether an employee is swinging the lead cannot easily use the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which allows councils to spy on local residents suspected of minor crimes. It is difficult to use against staff because going off sick is not a crime. The ruling means employers trying to check whether workers who have been signed off really are ill will now have to show all other options were explored first and any surveillance was undertaken as a ‘last resort’. She then went on sick leave for stress-related conditions and was placed under surveillance in March 2011. She did not go back and was fired in September 2012. She took the council to a tribunal, where she learned of the surveillance, discovering it paid the detectives £3,600 to identify whether she was ‘defrauding the sickness absence system’. Anne Jones, assistant information commissioner for Wales, said: ‘Spying on employees is incredibly intrusive and must only be the last resort. 'Organisations need to be absolutely clear why they need to carry out covert surveillance and consider all other alternatives first. 'If it cannot be completely justified, it should not be done. 'Covert surveillance should be used as a last resort when alternatives which respect the employee's privacy have been considered and determined as not appropriate.' Caerphilly Council said the snooping was not carried out using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which lets councils carry out surveillance. Observations: Notes made by the private investigators included comments on Mrs Shaw's (pictured) shoes . Details: The council provided the surveillance company with the teacher's (pictured) address and photograph . A council spokesman said they had stopped surveillance of employees until a full review had been carried out. He said: 'The authority accepts the findings of the ICO and has signed an undertaking to ensure full compliance in the future. 'The council has publicly stated previously that the surveillance of council employees is on hold pending a thorough review of its policies and procedures. This remains the position.' Mrs Shaw’s husband, Kevin, 55, said: ‘It was a vindictive act. We were followed at the cost of taxpayers’ money.’","Kim Shaw, 56, took sick leave after suffering from stress-related conditions .

"Thug: Kerry Ozouf has been jailed for attacking her elderly neighbour after years of terrorising the local area with her anti-social behaviour . A neighbour from hell has been jailed after she assaulted a 92-year-old while screaming at her victim, 'die, you old woman!' Kerry Ozouf attacked her next-door neighbour Irene Bell after the elderly woman threatened to call the police following a string of anti-social behaviour. But after serving her five-month sentence, Ozouf, 38, will be allowed to return to the area she has long been terrorising - because the council says it does not want to 'move the problem elsewhere'. The assault on June 22 last year began when Ozouf was having a screaming row with her boyfriend in her front garden in Boscombe, a suburb of Bournemouth in Dorset. Mrs Bell, now 93, said she would call the police - prompting her neighbour to hit her from behind and knock her to the floor. The thug called her victim a 'cow' and shouted, 'Die you old woman, you shouldn't be here, die!' as she continued to beat her. Ozouf later claimed that Mrs Bell had provoked her by calling her a 'dirty old prostitute' - but the prosecution rejected this allegation. The victim, a former school matron who has lived in the same flat for 34 years, suffered a fractured elbow, cuts, bruises and swelling to her head in the attack, and now finds it harder to walk. Speaking after Ozouf was jailed, Mrs Bell said: 'They had been rowing all day. I told them, ""If you don't pack this in I will have to ring the police."" I got a lot of back-chat from her. 'They still didn't stop and eventually I went out again and told them I was going to call the police. Another neighbour had come out to speak to them so I went to go back inside. 'For no reason she followed me along the path and jumped on me, pushing me to the floor. She jumped on me so suddenly, I didn't know what had happened. It was like someone had dropped a sack of stones on me. Fright: Irene Bell, pictured with neighbour Jacquie Carmichael, has been left traumatised by the assault . 'She was hitting me with her fists. She was on top of me and her hands were in my hair, pulling my head up and down. She went beyond herself, as if she didn't know what she was doing. 'My neighbours came to help and got her off me and I can't remember much after that because I was in complete shock. My legs were black and blue and my head was swollen for days. 'Before this I used to walk into Boscombe centre and back but now I can only get to the local shops here - I have got no balance at all. 'I have been here 34 years, it was a beautiful area to live until she moved in. I'm very worried about her coming back.' Ozouf, who suffers from drink and drug problems, pleaded guilty to assault by beating at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court last year. As well as being sentenced to five months in prison, she is banned from contacting Mrs Bell for at least three years. Neighbourhood: The attack took place on this suburban street on the outskirts of Bournemouth in Dorset . Neighbour Jacquie Carmichael, 68, said that Ozouf had made residents' lives miserable with her loud noise, swearing and anti-social behaviour. 'She seemed nice when she first came here, but she has been awful since,' Mrs Carmichael said. 'She has fallen out with everybody over something.' More than two dozen locals have signed a petition calling for Ozouf to be removed from her flat, but council bosses claim that would only 'move the problem elsewhere'. A spokesman said: said: 'Shortly after this incident the council took legal action against one of its tenants to prevent this or similar behaviour reoccurring. 'In future any tenant, or a family member or visitor, convicted of such offences near their home would be subject to a mandatory possession order.'","Kerry Ozouf was arguing with her boyfriend at home in Bournemouth when Irene Bell threatened to call the police .

"Climate change experts have released maps of the world revealing how prepared different countries are to cope with the effects of climate change. In the maps, 192 countries are ranked by their ‘vulnerability’ and ‘readiness’, to produce an overall judgement on their fate. The results reveal that Scandinavian countries and the UK are among the most likely to survive - but areas of sub-Saharan Africa will be hardest hit. Scroll down for video . London-based company The Eco Experts has revealed the countries best-equipped to cope with climate change on a map (shown). Scandinavian countries like Norway and Finland, and also the UK, score highly. Green is best, scaling down to red being worst . The maps were created by London-based company The Eco Experts, using data from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, known as the ND-Gain Index. They took into account location, terrain, pollution rates and national resources when calculating which countries would be most affected. Countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark score well on the scale. But places like Central America, Africa and India all appear at risk from natural disaster - and are poorly equipped to cope, said The Eco Experts. Jon Whiting, of The Eco Experts warned: ‘Hurricanes, earthquakes, blizzards, droughts and flooding are all real dangers for some of these areas, and this is compounded by a lack of national strategy to counteract the effects.’ Burundi, Chad, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo produced some of the lowest scores, meaning these countries will be the biggest victims of weather disasters. Most countries across Europe will be not be severely affected by climate change, according to the map. It takes into accounts many factors such as access to clean drinking water and the risk of heat waves . But places in sub-Saharan Africa (shown left) will be most affected by a warming climate, while some countries in Africa like Bolivia (right) will also also be severely affected by global warming . The map is based on data compiled by the ND-Gain index, which has been monitoring 45 internal and external indicators of climate change exposure of 192 countries since 1992. The index is built on two variables; ‘vulnerability’ and ‘readiness’ for which a country gets a separate mark for each. These scores tally up to produce an overall total indicating how a particular nation would fare. On the scale, the country best equipped to cope with the effects of climate change was Norway. In fact, Norway has topped the ranking every year since the Index began in 1995. North America will also apparently be able to cope with the effects of climate change, thanks to high readiness scores for the USA and Canada.  The results have been published every year since 1995 - with Norway coming top every single year . Asia has a wide range of scores for different countries, owing to the vastly different climates and levels of infrastructure in various countries. Surprisingly, Australia comes out fairly well in the map, despite being a notoriously hot country . Various islands such as Haiti will be severely affected by climate change, perhaps due to the effects of rising sea levels. Others like Barbados, though, will apparently avoid some of the worst effects . ‘Adaptation challenges still exist, but Norway is well positioned to adapt. Norway is the 4th least vulnerable country and the 5th most ready country,’ according to the ND-Gain Index website. Second was New Zealand, third was Sweden, fourth was Finland and fifth Denmark. The UK came in seventh, followed by the US in eighth. Lower down, Ireland came in 17th and Russia in 32nd. At the bottom of the table Chad was deemed the country that would suffer the most from climate change. ‘It has both a great need for investment and innovations to improve readiness and a great urgency for action,’ said the site. It was followed by Eritrea, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central Africa Republic. On the site, detailed factors for each country can be viewed. These include the projected change of cereal yields, access to reliable drinking water and vulnerability to heatwave hazards.","London-based company The Eco Experts has revealed the countries best-equipped to cope with climate change .

"A prosecutor in the rape trial of two former Vanderbilt football players said in his opening statements Tuesday that the defendants ruined the life of a promising young neuroscience student when they sexually assaulted her on campus in 2013. Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman told Tennessee jurors that former players Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey giggled, shot video and sent text messages while they sexually abused her in an assault that began in a dormitory hallway. He described in sometimes graphic detail how one former player violated the female student with a water bottle while a teammate egged him on. The prosecutor said one of the players passed out condoms and raped her. Scroll down for video . On trial: Former Vanderbilt football players Cory Batey (left) and Brandon Vandenburg (right) are being tried on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery in a suspected attacked on a female student in January 2013 . Graphic details: Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman told jurors that the former players giggled, shot video, and one of them violated the victim with a water bottle . Thurman said one of the former players urinated on her and made a racial remark. Three of the ex-players are black and one is white. The victim is white. 'And after hearing all the proof you will be convinced they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,' Thurman said. The alleged victim, an Oklahoma native, sat in the audience during opening statements wiping her eyes with a tissue. She is expected to take the stand as a witness for the prosecution later in the trial. The trial takes place amid a roiling national debate about the prevalence of rapes at US colleges and universities, with investigations under way at dozens of colleges around the country and the Obama administration launching its own star-studded campaign, 'It's On Us,' to end sexual assault on America's campuses. Vandenburg and Batey are being tried this week on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. The defense will blame alcohol and a culture of binge drinking and sexual promiscuity on campus. Alcohol intoxication cannot be used as a defense for aggravated rape. However, defense attorneys hope that jurors will consider that their clients weren't even of legal drinking age and were heavily intoxicated when the events took place. 'I think the proof will be very clear at the end of the trial that alcohol played a role in what happened in that dorm room,' Worrick Robinson, an attorney who represents Batey, told jurors. Blame it on the alcohol: Defense attorneys will try to convince jurors that their then-underage clients were heavily intoxicated when the alleged assault took place . Blacked out: Worrick Robinson, an attorney who represents Batey (pictured in court Monday) said his client was so drunk he passed out that night . He said Batey was so drunk that he blacked out that night. Robinson also told jurors that there is no evidence of Batey's DNA in the dorm room and no evidence of his fingerprints on a condom box. One of Vandenburg's attorneys called the prosecutor's statements elegant but 'inflammatory' and said evidence would show that his client was not responsible for what someone else did to the woman, who allegedly was his date that night. According to published accounts, on June 23, 2013, Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, took the 21-year-old student to a bar called Tin Roof, and on the ride back the player's date reportedly passed out in the car. Several Vanderbilt students stated that the woman was then carried to Vandenburg's room on the second floor of Gillette House, where she was allegedly raped by a group of young men. Both defense attorneys warned jurors about the two other former players who are charged in the case. Brandon Banks and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey. Fletcher Long, one of Vandenburg's defense attorneys, told jurors that they have changed their stories repeatedly. Both defense attorneys suggested that Banks and McKenzie would be willing to point the finger at Vandenburg and Batey in order to get a good deal with prosecutors.

'Unreliable': Defense attorneys for Vandenburg (left) and Batey (right) warned jurors that Banks and McKenzie have changed their stories repeatedly . Crime scene: Police say Vandenburg brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her . Some widely publicized investigations involving student-athletes have heightened the focus on sexual assaults at college. Florida State Quarterback Jameis Winston was cleared last month of violating the school's code of conduct in relation to allegations that he sexually assaulted a student in 2012. Winston had adamantly denied the allegations. In Knoxville, two University of Tennessee football players were suspended from the team last year after a fellow student accused them of sexual assault. No charges have been filed against them. A woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by three University of Oregon basketball players filed a federal lawsuit last week against the school and the men's basketball coach. The three students had been kicked off the team in April. The trial is set to resume Wednesday at 9am Central Time.","Former Vanderbilt football players Cory Batey and Brandon Vandenburg are being tried on counts of aggravated rape and sexual battery .

"Fire investigators have determined sunlight reflecting off a makeup mirror was the most likely cause of a devastating blaze in a £3.5 million house last month. Six fire crews attended the fire at the house in Caversham, Berkshire on Sunday, December 28. The property is owned by Darren Browne, chief executive of the Pertemps employment agency. The £3.5 million property, pictured, suffered extensive damage when it caught fire on December 28, 2014 . Six fire crews attended the scene of the fire which destroyed the first and second floors of the house . Fire investigators believe that the blaze started when strong sunlight reflected off a make-up mirror . At the time, Mr Browne told Get Reading that the family had been out of the house at the time, but declined to make any further comment. An investigation by officers at the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service has found that sunlight reflecting off a mirror onto curtains in a south-facing upstairs bedroom resulted in the fire, which caused serious damage to the first and second floor of the property, as well as its roof. Station Manager Sean Keeley, who conducted the fire investigation, said: 'Cases of reflected light triggering fires in homes are rare, however we would urge the public to be aware of the potential danger of reflective surfaces intensifying the sun's rays. 'To minimise the risk of fire, please make sure reflective items such as mirrors are not placed in direct view of sunlight in the home - particularly during the winter months when the low-lying sun can shine on fixed surfaces for a prolonged period.' Station manager Sean Keeley said that cases of reflected light from a mirror triggering a fire are rare (file pic) Fire officers warned that the low sun during winter can reflect off a mirror causing a fire . Shortly after the blaze neighbour Jenny Steven, from Warrenside flats, said: 'The first I saw was a plume of smoke and I thought it was a bit strange somebody having a bonfire going. 'It was only when I went to walk into town that I realised it was a bit more than that.' She continued: 'It was burning for hours and hours. I went to bed at midnight last night and there were still flames. Stuart Van Dort, who lives nearby said he initially feared it may have been his home which was destroyed: 'I felt very sorry for the poor people. 'A friend from a property behind sent a text message saying smoke was coming from this area which was a bit scary but we were OK. 'We know it was close but the fire brigade did a remarkable job because it was pretty fierce through the roof.'","Six fire crews battled to save the £3.5 million luxury home in Berkshire .

"A Christmas attraction designed by TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen went bust - owing creditors nearly £1million. The Magical Journey, based at the Belfry Hotel, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, was marred with controversy before closing just nine days before Christmas - leaving furious parents out of pocket. Liquidators hired to handle the firm said creditors are owed in the region of £875,000 following the early closure of the attraction, which cost upwards of £50 for a family of three. Scroll down for video . Flamboyant TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen (centre) had been hired to design the attraction, which opened its doors in November. It was forced to close on 16 December - just nine days before Christmas . They said company directors blamed poor weather, the site's temporary closure, negative publicity and higher-than-anticipated costs for the closure. They added that when 'anticipated investment' failed to materialise, organisers had no choice but to shut down early. The festive experience opened its doors in November and was forced to close just one day later following a furious backlash from angry parents. The furore broke out after a barrage of complaints on the first day over elves smoking, rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around. Parents also complained that the train to Santa's grotto broke down on the opening day. Event director Paul Dolan had claimed that bad weather hampered first-day preparations and it had not been ready to open. It reopened several days later after work to improve it, winning positive customer reviews - but last month the organisers said they had been 'left in the lurch' and could not find a replacement backer. Scenes like this greeted visitors when the site first opened. Despite a raft of measures to make improvements, the attraction  closed early - leaving furious parents out of pocket . Presents were dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red Santa's outfit left on top at the Magical Journey, which closed after a financial backer pulled out. Creditors are owed roughly £875,000 . Organisers said they had been 'left in the lurch' and could not find a replacement financial backer. They also blamed poor weather and higher-than-anticipated costs. Above, this train broke down on the park's first day . When it closed its doors, there were claims that the crisis-hit attraction crumbled under pressure to pay its staff wages of more than £100,000 per month - just nine days before Christmas. Angry parents were told to contact their card providers for refunds with many buying tickets for their entire families. At the time, Mr Llewelyn-Bowen said he had not given any financial support to the project and was unaware of the backer's identity. Mr Povey, one of the liquidators, said: 'The directors of Magical Journeys Limited faced a number of significant challenges and attribute the failure to a combination of poor weather hampering site preparation, the temporary closure of the attraction, leading to negative publicity which had an impact on ticket sales, and higher-than-anticipated costs. Mr Llewelyn-Bowen (pictured) said he had not given any financial support to the project and was unaware who the backer was. When it closed, there were claims the attraction crumbled under pressure to pay staff . The attraction had to be shut down after a catastrophic flop on its opening day in November following negative feedback from visitors on social media . 'When anticipated investment failed to materialise, they had no option but to close the attraction early. 'We are in the process of reviewing creditors' claims and investigating if there are any assets which can be realised for the benefit of creditors. 'We'll be reporting back to creditors with the results of our investigations into the company's affairs in due course.' A statement on the attraction's website notes it has ceased trading and has not been in operation since December 16. Creditors of the Magical Journey, based at the Belfry Hotel, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, (pictured) are owed in the region of £875,000, liquidators have said. The hotel had 'no affiliation' with the attraction . Amid repeated apologies it states: 'We have explored all our options, and the situation leaves us with no alternative other than close the Magical Journey.' It added: 'We are truly sorry. After all we've been through, having to shut down in the final week is devastating. 'Although we had quite the time of it in the press and on social media, feedback was great with over 600 four-and five-star reviews. 'However, today a key financial backer has dropped out, leaving us in the lurch. We have tried desperately over the last few hours to find a replacement but to no avail.'","The Magical Journey opened in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham in November .

"Police are offering $100,000 in a fresh appeal for information on the 'teardrop rapist' who they believe has attacked 35 women in LA since 1996 . Los Angeles police have launched a fresh appeal to help catch the 'teardrop rapist' who they believe has assaulted 35 women as young as 14 since 1996. Cops are offering $100,000 for any information about the man - dubbed the teardrop rapist because several of his victims have described a tear-like tattoo or scar near one of his eyes. Police say the attacker usually approaches women between 5.15am and 8am along a central corridor that runs through LA, and begins speaking to them before pulling a knife or a gun. He then threatens to kill the victims before dragging them into a nearby alley or side street where the assault takes place. The last attack was in 2012, but investigators have launched a new appeal because they have exhausted all leads without finding a culprit. Officials have warned that the man will likely continue his assaults until he is arrested, as is common with serial offenders. Police say the man would now be aged between 40 and 55 years old, is Hispanic with brown eyes and brown hair, standing between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall. He weighs between 130lbs and 170lbs, has a light complexion and often sports a mustache. He likely has a teardrop tattoo near one eye, though this could be a small collection of tattoos, a birthmark, a scar, or even a temporary tattoo used only during the attacks. Hunted: Officers say the man is Hispanic, light skinned, with brown eyes and hair. He may also have one or several teardrops near one of his eyes, or a birthmark or scar resembling a teardrop . Almost all of his victims have been Latino women, and the attacks usually occurr along a corridor either side of Normandie Avenue that runs from I105 to US 101. Some assaults have also occurred in Hollywood, Koreatown and Los Angeles County. Police have collected several DNA samples from the victims which point to the same attacker, even though the victims' descriptions often vary greatly. The last confirmed attack was in June 2012 when a man fitting the teardrop rapist's description accosted a woman on Naomi Avenue near 25th Street in South L.A. He approached her wearing a hoodie, tried to talk to her, then pistol-whipped her and forced her into an alley. When a car pulled into the street he became spooked and ran away. Suspect: Some victims have not mentioned the teardrop tattoo, even where DNA has proved the attacker to be the same man. Police say the tattoo could be a temporary one, or may have been removed . He speaks Spanish and English and sometimes wears a beanie cap or baseball hat. Many of his victims have been minors, while the eldest was 41. Teardrop tattoos are common among Californian Chicano gangs and are widely accepted to mean that the bearer has killed someone. However, alternate meanings include that the wearer has served a long prison sentence, or is in mourning for a dead relative. Anyone with information was asked to call LAPD’s tip line at 877-527-3247, or to text the word TIPLA, a space, then the tip to 274637, or to emailrhd-sas@lapd.lacity.org. Police issued this map of the crime scenes, which occur in a corridor around Normandie Avenue. Cops say the attacks happen between 5am and 9am, and the victims are almost always Latino .","Man is responsible for 35 attacks on mostly Latino victims as young as 14 .

"A Vietnam veteran on death row has lost his appeal for clemency after he claimed he was suffering from PTSD when he shot dead a young sheriff's deputy. Andrew Howard Brannan, 66, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at 7pm on Tuesday at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia. Brannan was convicted in the 1998 slaying of 22-year-old Laurens County sheriff's deputy Kyle Dinkheller, a married father of a young daughter. Scroll down for video: Warning graphic content . Andrew Brannan, pictured in an undated photo taken during the Vietnam War. He is due to be executed on Tuesday despite pleas for clemency from his lawyers who said he has suffered from long-term PTSD . Dinkheller stopped Brannan after he was caught on January 12, 1998 driving at 98mph. The officer demanded he take his hands from his pockets after he pulled him over on a rural road. Brannan, who was 49 years old at the time, then began cursing, dancing in the street and saying 'shoot me' before he grabbed a gun, rushed at the deputy and shot him nine times while he attempted to call for backup. Lawyers for the Vietnam veteran said the shooting was tied to mental illness that can be traced directly to his military service and argued he should be spared execution - but lost their 11th hour appeal on Monday. In a statement, CBS reported, Brannan's family said they were 'profoundly disappointed' that the appeal to save his life had failed. Through his lawyers, they said that '[t]he death of Deputy Sheriff Kyle Dinkheller was a terrible tragedy. 'Executing a 66-year old decorated Vietnam veteran with no prior criminal record who was seriously ill at the time of the crime only compounds the tragedy.' According to the convict's lawyers, Brannan was diagnosed in 1991 as being '100-per cent disabled' by PTSD. Five years later, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder disorder, according to CBS. At the time of the shooting, the veteran was not on any medication, his current lawyers said, blaming his previous legal team for not making more of his mental history at his trial where a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury. Andrew Brannan, 66, was found guilty in 2000 of murdering 22-year-old sheriff's deputy Kyle Dinkheller (right) The horrifying moment that Brannan shot dead the officer was caught on his patrol car's dashcam. On the tape, Dinkheller pulled Brannan's truck over for speeding in Laurens County, Georgia around 5.30pm. Officer Dinkheller repeatedly asked the suspect to remove his hand from his pockets - in response, Brannan danced around and sang, appearing to mock the deputy. The 66-year-old then cursed and yelled at the deputy and proclaimed that he was a 'goddamn Vietnam combat veteran'. The suspect then ducked inside his pickup truck, pulled out a M-1 carbine rifle and began firing at the deputy. The two men exchanged shots, leaving Brannan with a wound to the abdomen while Dinkheller was shot nine times. Dinkheller can be heard screaming on the dashcam tape as Brannan closed in on him and delivered one last shot at point-blank range before yelling: 'die f*****'. In a sickening image from the patrol car dashcam, the suspect can be seen sneaking around the car with his rifle to where the officer lay injured and firing again . Deputy Dinkheller was gunned down by Brannan in 1998 after he pulled the man over for speeding . The two exchanged shots and Brannan suffered a wound to the abdomen while Dinkheller was shot nine times, during the incident caught on the officer's dashcam . The suspect was found during a search the next morning and taken into custody. Officer Dinkheller left behind an expectant wife and 22-month-old daughter when he died on January 12, 1998. Deputy Dinkheller's son was born in early September 1998. Earlier this month, the fallen officer's father, Kirk Dinkheller, wrote on Facebook: 'January 12, 2015 it will be 17 years since my son Kyle was murdered in the line of duty and on January 13, 2015 his killer will finally be held accountable. 'Nothing will ever bring my son back, but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family.' At his 2000 trial, Brannan, who had no prior criminal record, pleaded guilty by reason of insanity. However a court-appointed psychiatrist said Brannan was in his right mind when he killed Dinkheller. The psychiatrist also said Brannan may have killed the 22-year-old officer because he felt he was being disrespectful. The veteran's own psychiatrist was not called as a witness at the trial. Brannan pleaded guilty by reason of insanity which was rejected by the jury. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. His attorneys have tried numerous times - three appeals, four petitions, and five motions - to avoid execution, saying that the veteran's damaged mental health led him to killing Dinkheller. Brannan served as a first lieutenant with the U.S. Army in Vietnam after volunteering in 1968. He received commendations and a Bronze Star for his service as an officer. According to CBS, he acted as a Forward Observer - directing fire at the enemy, near the Laos border. A fellow veteran, Ray Chastain, wrote a letter for his friend to the parole board. It read: 'During the period when Lieutenant Brannan served, the Forward Observer had the shortest life expectancy of any category of soldier in Vietnam.' In their last effort, the defense team asked the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute his sentence to life without parole because Brannan has a mental disorder. The attempt failed. The 66-year-old's execution will be the first in the U.S. of 2105 if it takes on Tuesday evening after he has spent 14 years on death row. Brannan's lawyers filed an appeal with the Georgia state Supreme Court on Tuesday morning and expect a decision shortly. If that appeal is denied, they will take their case for a last try to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"Scientists have found that oxygen in the air we breathe may play a role in triggering lung cancer . Oxygen in the air we breathe may play a role in triggering lung cancer, new research suggests. Scientists found that rates of the disease decrease at higher altitudes, where there is less oxygen in the air. Although oxygen is essential for life, the US researchers suggest the way our bodies process it is potentially carcinogenic. Oxygen is known to be highly reactive. When cells in the body use oxygen atoms to harness the energy stored in food, they produce a natural by-product called oxygen free radicals. These free radicals can cause damage to cell structures and DNA, which in turn can trigger cancer. Kamen Simeonov, from the University of Pennsylvania, and Daniel Himmelstein, from the University of California at San Francisco, compared cancer rates across 250 western counties in the US with varying altitude levels. They found that incidence of lung cancer fell by 7.23 cases per 100,000 individuals for every 1,000 metre (3,281 feet) rise in altitude. Although there was a strong association between elevation and lung cancer, they did not see the same link with breast, prostate or bowel cancer, suggesting a role played by the inhalation process. They said if the entire population of the US lived in San Juan County, which is at 3,470 metres (11,400 feet), there would be 65,496 fewer lung cancer cases every year. Lung cancer kills an estimated 160,000 people in the US and 35,000 in the UK every year. Writing in the journal PeerJ, the scientists said there was ‘substantial evidence’ for an inhaled cancer-trigger ‘tied directly to elevation’. Researchers from universities in California and Pennsylvania found that incidence of lung cancer fell by 7.23 cases per 100,000 individuals for every 1,000-metre (3,281 feet) rise in altitude. Lung cancer kills an estimated 160,000 people in the US and 35,000 in the UK every year . They said exposure to sunlight and pollution, both of which are affected by elevation, was taken into account in their calculations. They added: ‘Viewing our findings through the lens of the literature, atmospheric oxygen emerges as the most probable culprit. ‘Overall, our findings suggest the presence of an inhaled carcinogen inherently and inversely tied to elevation.’","US researchers suggest way our bodies process oxygen is potentially carcinogenic .

"Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has told his own children that learning to cook is a 'life skill' and more important than exam results. The outspoken restaurant owner has revealed that he recently told his son Jack, 15, to stop stressing over a Latin exam and concentrate on improving his skills in the kitchen. He believes the childhood obesity epidemic is down to parents who don't know how to make nutritious food and insisted cooking will help youngsters more than academic achievements. Scroll down for video . TV chef Gordon Ramsay, pictured with his daughters Megan, Matilda and Holly, his wife Tana and son Jack . Despite leaving school with little qualifications and a failed football career, the 48-year-old now has a multi-million pound culinary empire. 'I'm fed up with kids getting blamed for this obesity epidemic and bad eating habits. It's not the kids, it's the parents,' he said in an interview on the David Letterman show. 'Cooking is now a proper life skill for the young kids. I look at my son Jack and he's stressing out over Latin. 'I'm saying to him ""Mate, if you're not going to use Latin for the rest of your life, don't worry about that exam, follow dad, let me show you how to make scrambled eggs"". Ramsay has revealed that he told 15-year-old Jack not to worry about his Latin exam but concentrate on learning how to cook . 'The good news is that now, every Saturday or Sunday, our four kids cook for us. I've got them up to speed and they're bloody good cooks.' He explained that the importance of cooking was instilled in him from an early age as his mother Helen Cosgrove worked as a chef in Stratford-upon-Avon while he was growing up. 'Mum worked in a little tea house called the Cobweb Tea Room - it was packed with American's and she was cooking classic English food. 'She used to bring home what she didn't sell back home. It amazes me today how she just got on with it and never cursed. 'Back in those days it was rude to leave anything so you ate and washed up straight afterwards. Today you have issues with kids even loading the dishwasher.' The father-of-four, who is currently teaching children in the United States to cook for the new series of Masterchef Junior, said the young contestants were better learners than adults. Speaking on the Late Show this week, he said: 'Some of the kids are eight years of age and can barely reach the stove but they are extraordinary. 'Working with them and getting a chance to teach them is great. The outspoken chef left school with little qualifications but has built a multi-million pound culinary empire . 'They absorb far better than adults, they are less sensitive, we get straight to the point when we have an issue or a stumbling block. 'Those kind of life skills are important to give a bit of confidence,' he added. 'I don't scream at the kids but I scream at the parents.' Ramsay's daughter Matilda, 13, is set to front her own cookery show called 'Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch', which will be aired on CBBC later this year. The series will see the teenager travel to Los Angeles to creates dishes to accompany Bollywood themed parties, stunt lessons at a film studio, daredevil zip-wiring and surf days on the beach. He also has two other daughters, Megan and Holly, with his wife of almost 20 years, Cayetana - also known as Tana. Youngster: A four-year-old Gordon posing for a school photo (left) and in his first ever chef whites (right) Teenager: On a fishing trip (left) and finally becoming a player for Glasgow Rangers FC in 1984 (right) The 48-year-old celebrity chef is well-known for his award-winning restaurants, string of TV programmes and his outspoken nature. He was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland in 1966 and moved to Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire when he was five, where his mother had a job as a chef. In his autobiography, he describes his childhood as being marked by abuse and neglect by his alcoholic father, and when he was 16 he moved out of home to Banbury, Oxfordshire. He had a promising football career and in 1984 had a trial with Glasgow Rangers, the team he supported as a boy. He claims to have played two first team games for the club and was signed at the age of 15. But after suffering a serious injury that left him unable to regain full fitness he was released from the club. His first experiences of a professional kitchen came from a couple of weekend jobs - first as a washer up in an Indian restaurant and then washing up in a Banbury hotel. This was when his interest in becoming a chef started. Having only obtained a few O levels at school he was left with limited options and decided to enroll on a catering course at North Oxford Technical College. In 1993 Gordon became chef of Aubergine in London, which within three years, was awarded two Michelin stars. In 1998, at the age of 31, Ramsay set up his first wholly owned and namesake restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, which quickly received three Michelin stars. He first appeared on television in documentaries Boiling Point (1998) and Beyond Boiling Point (2000), but had appeared previously as a judge on a masterchef-like series for young catering students in 1997. He has gone on to appear in his own programme - Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, The F Word and Hell's Kitchen - aired both in the UK and U.S.","Gordon Ramsay recently said to his son 'stop stressing over exam results'

Ortiz, who goes by the nickname 'Spyder' due to his arachnophobia, was back in jail on Monday in Volusia County, Florida, being held without bail on a domestic battery charge, according to the News-Journal. According to a report from the sheriff's office, Ortiz got into a fight with his brother Jose over changing the bed sheets at their shared apartment in Daytona Beach. Eric Ortiz told a deputy that he and his brother, Jose, got into a verbal altercation. The suspect claimed he was hanging out with a few girls during the prior night and his brother got jealous. Jose Ortiz told the officer that his brother woke him up on Monday night and wanted to know who changed the sheets, then became aggressive and threatened him, punching him in the chest. The alleged victim stated he was not injured and did not wish to pursue charges but Eric Ortiz was placed under arrest. Ortiz has a history of battery and fleeing convictions, records revealed. Last March, he was wanted by police in Florida for allegedly beating up his ex-girlfriend. He was also wanted on other charges including kidnapping, battery, false imprisonment, attempted sexual battery and tampering with a witness. Police said in March 2014, that Ortiz lured his 22-year-old ex out of her home, battered her and then tried to sexually assault her in an effort to pressure her to to drop earlier charges against him. A Bug's Life: Ortiz pictured in his mugshot from last year (left) when he just had a spider tattoo on his face (pictured right). He is being held without bail in Florida after being arrested on Monday for domestic battery . At a previous court appearance in December 2013, on a felony charge of driving with a license revoked, Ortiz told the News-Journal the reason behind the eye-catching tattoo. ‘Everybody fears spiders,’ Ortiz said. ‘That's why I got it. Just to, like, make me know, that that's what I fear, but not to fear it. You know what I'm saying?’ The 24-year-old's girlfriend apparently did not appreciate the tattoo and broke up with him soon afterwards. He then allegedly put a box-cutter to the woman’s throat and threatened to dump her in a ditch. He punched her repeatedly, police said, smashed her phone and dragged her to the couch where he attempted to rape her. She managed to escape when he left to use the bathroom. Ortiz's criminal history includes a laundry list of charges, among them burglary of a conveyance; domestic battery; retail theft; violation of injunction for protection and loitering and prowling.","Eric Ortiz, 25, whose spider  tattoo led to one memorable mugshot last year, has upped his game by adding a fly in a web to the opposite cheek .

"She has seen her popularity soar after posting dozens of racy selfies online - and now Labour councillor Karen Danczuk shows she has even more reason to smile. The 31-year-old has had her teeth whitened - giving her a megawatt smile that any Hollywood star would be proud to show off. And the mother-of-two, who is married to 48-year-old Labour MP Simon Danczuk, was quick to share the good news - posting before and after snaps on Twitter while still in the dentist's office. Brighter and whiter: Labour councillor Karen Danczuk pictured these before and after teeth whitening photographs online earlier today with the caption, 'so happy with my white teeth! 20 mins and pain free' Making her smile: In another photo, Mrs Danczuk posed with Dr Favero who carried out the dental work . The photographs come just days after Mrs Danczuk posted videos of her doing the splits on the floor of a bar after enjoying three bottles of Prosecco on a girls' night out. The Rochdale councillor became an internet sensation after she posted dozens of pictures online last year, mostly of her cleavage. Mrs Danczuk 'selfies' have attracted national attention and she has gained more than 34,000 followers since uploading the steady stream of images. Some have praised her for making politics 'sexy' while others have criticised her for cheapening it. In the photos posted online today, Mrs Danczuk shares photos taken before and after her teeth whitening that show her smile is now brighter and whiter. The caption for the photo reads: 'So happy with my white teeth! 20mins and pain free! Thanks Dr Favero. KD #white' In a second image, Mrs Danczuk poses with Dr Favero, from the Favero Dental Clinic in London, and shares a link to his website. Girls' night out: A short clip of Mrs Danczuk doing the splits on the floor of a bar, above, was posted online. In it, her friend, Nicollette North, is heard saying that the Labour councillor 'thinks she can do the splits drunk' It comes days after the Labour councillor was filmed pulling the splits in an impromptu gymnastics sessions. In one of the clips, uploaded to video sharing website Vine last week, Mrs Danczuk is seen holding the splits as her friend, Nicollette North, records the action on her mobile phone. Mother-of-two Ms North tells the camera that 'KD' - Mrs Danczuk's initials - 'reckons she can do the splits drunk'. The camera then shows Mrs Danczuk on the floor of the bar, believed to be in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, before she topples over as she starts to laugh. Strike a pose: In other images posted online, Mrs Danczuk and her friend pout for the camera (left) and show off the bottles of Prosecco they had shared (right) in the bar, believed to be in Rochdale, Greater Manchester . Tumble: After holding the splits, Mrs Danczuk soon collapses as she and her friend start to laugh. The mother-of-two saw her popularity soar after she posted dozens of photographs in recent months . In another clip, the two women pout at the camera and explain they are deciding 'who does the best pose'. The videos also appeared on Mrs Danczuk's Twitter, where they were shared with more than 37,000 followers. She uploaded a photograph of Ms North in front of three bottles of Prosecco, with the caption: '@NicolletteNorth is 3 bottles in!!!'. The next day, Cllr Danczuk added: 'Me & @NicolletteNorth have sore heads but it's worth it. @antanddec look out, been told we're a more fun duo lol. KD'. The photos and videos have since been removed from Mrs Danczuk social media profiles. Internet sensation: The 31-year-old has posted dozens of revealing images, like the ones above, online. She revealed last month that she would sell a number of signed photographs on eBay . The mother-of-two, who is married to 48-year-old Labour MP Simon Danczuk (pictured together), shared the short video clips of her impromptu gymnastics on social media website Vine . Last month, Mrs Danczuk was seen working out with a personal trainer at a park in Greater Manchester after being labelled fat by Twitter trolls. She was seen completing a challenging total-body circuit  - which included push-ups, boxing and lunges. Mrs Danczuk also revealed that she has decided to sell a number of signed and scented pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay. She said she had decided to bow to public demand and sell the pictures of herself for £10, insisting that it was good business sense and a way of interacting with people. Mrs Danczuk said that she is already having to order more copies after she sold 400 in less than 24 hours and attracted more than 4,000 views to the listing.","Karen Danczuk posted before and after photos showing Hollywood smile .

"An attack on a passenger bus in eastern Ukraine has killed at least 11 civilians, in a tragedy likely to deal the final blow to hopes that the country's short-lived and shaky cease-fire could take hold. The holiday period across Ukraine was spent in relative tranquillity after a new truce was called in December between government troops and Russian-backed militia. But it appears likely to collapse after at least 11 civilians travelling on a commuter bus from Donetsk were killed - and many more wounded - after what Ukrainians said were rockets fired from a Grad launcher in rebel territory. Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Curtains are left torn and damaged after the shell hit the bus near Donetsk, killing at least 11 civilians . The bus door is left bent and stained with blood after 11 people were killed in the shelling . Authorities inspect the scene of the killing, which was blamed on rockets fire from rebel-controlled territory . Regional authorities loyal to Kiev said the bus was passing a Ukrainian army checkpoint at the time, putting it in the line of fire, although leading rebel representative Denis Pushilin denied responsibility for the attack. The warring sides are now trading accusations over who is responsible for the breakdown in the truce that led to today's deaths - and what was the single largest loss of life in the conflict so far this year. Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that separatist attacks in recent days suggest an attempted onslaught to push back the frontline is under way. Separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said Ukraine's armed forces unilaterally resumed hostilities and that his fighters would respond in kind. A convoy of around 30 military-style trucks without license plates were seen at the weekend heading for Donetsk, suggesting that new supplies were coming in for the rebels. NATO's top commander, General Philip Breedlove, said that there had been a continued resupply and training of rebel forces over the holiday period. 'Those continue to provide a concern and something that we have to be thinking about,' Breedlove said. The bus (pictured) was on its way from Donetsk when it was struck in an attack that has thrown Ukraine's delicate ceasefire into jeopardy . Ukraine and the West have routinely accused Russia of being behind such consignments. Moscow flatly rejects the charges, although rebel forces are so well-equipped with powerful arms that the denials have become increasingly hollow. 'These are separatists that are clearly backed by Russia,' U.S. State Department  spokeswoman Marie Harf said, adding that Russia must do more to stop the violence and restore Ukrainian sovereignty. In the rebel-held Donetsk suburb of Makiivka, the thrash of outgoing mortars shakes still-inhabited neighborhoods on a daily basis. Separatists have consistently denied using residential areas for cover, but there are ample eyewitness accounts undermining those claims. The bus (pictured) was travelling near a Ukrainian army checkpoint at the moment it was hit, placing it directly in the line of fire . Ukrainian responses to artillery lobbed out of Donetsk are woefully inaccurate and regularly hit houses and apartment blocks, often killing people inside. The separatist military headquarters in Donetsk said Tuesday that 12 people had been killed and another 30 injured in the preceding three-day period. It did not specify who had been killed. There is little sign of life in Makiivka these days. People rush home from work or aid distribution points and occasionally come out of shelters to exchange information about where shells are landing. Maria Ivanovna, a local retiree, said she was inured to the blasts and drew an arc with her arm to show how shells fly over her home toward the government-held airport on the northern edge of the city. 'We will survive the same way we did after World War Two. Ration cards for bread. 300 grams (11 ounces) for children, 800 grams for factory workers and 1,200 grams for miners,' she said. A senior U.N. human rights official said this week that developments look poised to go in one of three directions — a frozen conflict, an escalation in violence or an evolution to sustainable peace. A hoped-for round of peace negotiations this week between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France has been put on ice — possibly indefinitely and Ukrainian military authorities talk like they are bracing for the long-haul - including laying out plans for a new round of mobilization. Members of the media surround British officials as they today presented ten armored vehicles from the British government to the OCSE special monitoring mission in Ukraine's east . Volodymyr Talalai, deputy head of the army's mobilization planning, said recruits will be drawn from all regions of the country. He gave no figure for how many people will be mobilized, but said that the primary aim of the upcoming drive is to enable the rotation of forces. Unremitting violence is radicalizing the mood. One resident of Donetsk's Petrovsky neighborhood — one of the most intensely bombed — said she took up arms and joined the separatist army after a rocket hit a home in her neighborhood.","A shell struck a bus today, killing 11 civilians and wounding many more .

"A former bartender at an Ohio country club patronized by House Speaker John Boehner has been charged with threatening to murder the 12-term congressman by poisoning his wine. According to federal prosecutors, the failed assassination plot was hatched by 44-year-old Michael Hoyt last fall after he was fired from the Wetherington Country Club. Investigators say Hoyt, known at the country club as ‘Bartender Mike,’ blamed Congressman Boehner for his termination in mid-October. Scroll down for video . Bizarre plot: Former bartender Michael Hoyt (left), 44, has been charged with threatening to murder House Speaker John Boehner (right) by spiking his wine with poison . An ax to grind: Hoyt was fired from the Wetherington Country Club in Ohio in October and apparently blamed his termination on Boehner . When questioned by the authorities, Hoyt reportedly said evil voices coming from his car speakers and his radio at home told him the House speaker was the devil. In his rantings to police, the 44-year-old failed mixologist also allegedly blamed the Ohio Republican for spreading Ebola and said he had been planning to shoot Boehner with his Beretta .380 automatic. A description of Hoyt's alleged plan was laid out in an arrest affidavit filed in federal court Novwmber 6 and unsealed just over a month later. The alleged plot on the politician’s life came to light October 29 when Mr Hoyt called 911 to complain that John Boehner allegedly got him fired a week earlier. When officers responded to Hoyt's home on Matson Avenue in Deer Park, the bartender told them he regretted he 'did not have time to put something in John Boehner's drink' during the five years he had spent serving him wine at the country club. According to a criminal complaint from October first obtained by WCPO, Hoyt told an officer 'he was Jesus Christ and that he was going to kill Boehner because Boehner was mean to him at the country club and because Boehner is responsible for Ebola.' Hoyt volunteered to be taken to a psychiatric hospital, and his loaded weapon was confiscated. Diabolical: Hoyt reportedly said evil voices coming from his car speakers and his radio at home told him the House Speaker was the devil, while he, Hoyt, was Jesus Christ . Michael Hoyt sent a rambling email to Boehner's wife of nearly 42 years, Debbie (pictured second left), to complain about her husband . In the course of the investigation, police uncovered that Michael Hoyt sent a rambling email to Boehner's wife of nearly 42 years, Debbie, to complain about her husband a day before he called the authorities. In his appeal to Mrs Boehner, Hoyt said he wanted her husband and another person, an Ohio doctor, to hand-deliver his termination report to him, or have him transported to a 'secure location' so the three of them could have 'an honest conversation.' 'If I had any intention of hurting Mr. Boehner, I could have poisoned his wine at Wetherington many, many times,' Hoyt reportedly wrote to Debbie Boehner. He added a cryptic note saying they can 'work together and succeed or..... fail miserably.' Hoyt concluded his message by providing his address and asking not to bust into the house so as not to startle his dog and cat. Debbie Boehner emailed in response asking Hoyt what this was about, to which the man replied that he had been fired from her husband's club. During his encounter with police the following day, the 44-year-old bartender said he started hearing voices from his radio after his termination telling him that John Boehner was the devil. Hoys also said he was convinced that evil people were coming to 'chop him up' – a fear that prompted him to call the police. Targeted: Hoyt's arrest comes less than a year after two other men were charged with threatening John Boehner’s life . Police said he shared his thoughts about the House speaker in an 11-page blog entry, which he emailed to his father, ex-girlfriend and a neighbor. Officers executed a search warrant at Hoyt's apartment two days later, seizing an SKS assault rifle magazine and ammunition. They also found a notebook containing references to Boehner and Ebola. When police went to search the home of Hoyt's mother in Hebron, Kentucky, they recovered his SKS assault rifle, which the woman said she had secretly snuck out of her son’s home on a recent visit. While undergoing mental health evaluation, Michael Hoyt told FBI agents he was let go from his job because several members of the country club complained about his bad attitude. It has been revealed that the 44-year-old Deer Park man has a history of mental health issues. Two years ago, he was treated for a psychotic episode and was prescribed psychotropic medication, which he stopped taking after six months, according to the FBI. Hoyt's arrest comes less than a year after two other men were charged with threatening John Boehner’s life. Brandon Thompson, 32, of Indiana, was arrested May 9 for making threats against Speaker Boehner, just days before Ronald Frazier, of Arizona, tweeted about wanting to kill the Republican politician. A spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel, said Tuesday the speaker is aware of the situation and sincerely thanks the FBI, the Capitol Police and the local authorities in Ohio for their efforts. When FBI agents interviewed Boehner about Hoyt, the congressman said he knew him as a bartender at the country club in West Chester but had not had any 'negative interactions with him.' Hoyt will remain in treatment at the Devens Federal Medical Center in Massachusetts until January 26.","Federal prosecutors indicted Michael Hoyt, 44, last week on charges of threatening to murder House Speaker Boehner .

"Britain will not be kept safer by keeping records on grandmothers visiting gardening websites, Nick Clegg warned today as he stepped up his attack on the new snooping powers. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted the security services should have the right to 'break the privacy' of people who 'seek to do us harm'. But he mocked proposals from David Cameron and the Tories to force tech firms to keep records of every internet visit and web chat made by every man, woman and child, insisting it would not reduce the terror threat. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the security services should have the right to 'break the privacy' of people who 'seek to do us harm', but warned keeping vast records of web visits would not help . The coalition is bitterly divided on the extent of surveillance powers needed to respond to terrorists using emerging technologies to avoid detection. The issue has re-emerged in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris which left 17 people dead. Security services around the world face the challenge of how to keep track of extremists who use the internet to communicate. David Cameron has promised to revive legislation – blocked by the Lib Dems – to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online . The so-called Snoopers' Charter would force internet and phone firms to store masses of information about emails, phone calls and internet clicks.Mr Cameron said yesterday: 'If I am prime minister, I will make sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other.' It raises the prospect of messaging apps like WhatsApp and Snapchat being blocked. But Mr Clegg insisted that it was wrong to store every web site visit and social media interaction of every person. The Lib Dem leader said the state should always 'retain the right to steam open envelopes, to listen to telephone conversations' of those suspected of criminal or terrorist activity. But he said the Snoopers' Charter 'does cross a line' and is 'not a proportionate response'. He told BBC Radio's Today programme: 'What it would do is say that you, every single person listening to this programme now, every website they visit over the last year, every social media interaction they have, will be stored by somebody.' David Cameron has promised to revive legislation – blocked by the Lib Dems – to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online . He stressed that his opposition was not about letting terrorists communicate in the 'dark' web'. 'It's about do I think that scooping up vast amounts of information on millions of people, children, grandmothers, grandparents, elderly people who are doing nothing more than visiting garden centre websites. 'Do I think that is a sensible use of our resources and our time? 'Does it address the issue which the agency quite rightly identifies, which is as technology mutates, as this globalised industry becomes more and more global how do we make sure that we continue to have the reach into those dark spaces so that terrorists cannot hide from it.' The legislation, which was tabled in draft form by Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012, would have extended the requirement for companies to retain phone and email data to include records - but not the content - of every individual's internet browsing activity, including use of social media sites like Facebook, internet gaming, and mobile phone messaging services. Mr Cameron yesterday said that as well as well as the Snoopers' Charter, new legislation will be required to enable the agencies to continue to intercept phone calls and access the content of electronic communications - on the basis of a warrant signed by the home secretary - when existing powers expire in 2016. In a speech tonight Mr Clegg will argue 'we do not make ourselves safer by making ourselves less free'. The Lib Dem leader will also underline his party's proposals for a Bill of Rights that would enshrine the right to free expression. 'If we really believe freedom of speech is a founding principle of our democracy, then we must act to protect it,' he will say. 'I look enviously at America, where every schoolchild is taught from day one that they have inalienable rights - including free expression - which are a fundamental part of what it means to be American. 'I want us to have the same. The time has come for a written constitution with a Bill of Rights. The Liberal Democrats are committed to a constitutional convention after the general election, and deciding how we enshrine free speech in a British Bill of Rights should be at the heart of it. 'We must always defend the British values of freedom, openness and tolerance. We must always defend the rights of individuals to express themselves freely. And we must always defend the right of a free press to do its work without fear or favour,' he will add. 'It is at times like these, when our freedoms are under threat, that we must stand up for them most of all.'","Deputy Prime Minister warns against reviving Snoopers' Charter plan .

"A shopper found more than he expected while unpacking his groceries when a snake popped out. Dean Gibbon had been shopping in Slatyford, Tyne and Wear, before returning home to nearby Throckley when he put his carrier bag full of shopping on the kitchen bench. But the 60-year-old yelled in horror and ran out of the room when the bag started to move and a nine-inch Corn Snake with a diamond pattern on its back appeared. Scroll down for video . Snake: Dean Gibbon found more than he expected upon his return from a shopping trip in Tyne and Wear . Scary moment: Mr Gibbon yelled in horror and ran out of his kitchen when the shopping bag started to move and a nine-inch Corn Snake with a diamond pattern on its back appeared . Mr Gibbon said: ‘I’d put the carrier bag down on the bench and it suddenly started moving. Then out comes this snake. I just yelled and ran out the room - I couldn’t believe it. ‘I was taking the stuff out of the carrier bag and noticed there was something moving inside. Before I had a chance to look, this snake appeared. It must have been about nine inches long. ‘After running out the room, I went back in and took hold of it, putting it into a kind of bottle until I knew what to do. A couple of times it looked like it was going to have a go at me, to strike out.’ Mr Gibbon believes the snake may have been curled up in a pair of thick socks which he had bought during the shopping trip on Saturday. Hiding place: Mr Gibbon believes the snake may have been curled up in a pair of thick socks which he had also bought during the shopping trip on Saturday . Trip: Mr Gibbon had been shopping in Slatyford, Tyne and Wear. A file photograph of the area is pictured . He added: ‘I think it’s maybe been keeping warm in them before coming out once I arrived back.’ Wayne Mailer, who runs Dragons Den Exotic Pets in Newcastle, said: ‘Looking at the picture, this appears to be an Anery Corn Snake. ‘I think it’s probably only a hatchling - maybe only a few weeks old. At the minute it doesn’t appear to be in the best of health, probably due to the cold weather. More than likely, it is an escaped pet.’ Corn Snakes are native to Central America and the south-east of North America. They have been popular in the UK as pets for many years and are viewed as a good beginner’s snake for those new to reptile keeping. The average size for an adult Corn Snake is around four to five foot. Mr Gibbon's snake is now keeping warm in a cardboard box in an effort to build up its strength. The snakes, which are said to be easy to tame and rarely bite,  can be bought for about £30 each.","Dean Gibbon had returned home from shopping trip in Tyne and Wear .

"Australia’s largest Arabic newspaper has revealed it came under hacker attack by purported jihadists and received several text message threats from Islamic State extremists. The El-Telegraph newspaper’s homepage was hacked last September, just days prior to the largest counter-terrorism raids the country has ever seen. Its landing page was replaced by a black Islamic State flag, prayer music played in the background and the message 'hacked by IS' was printed at the top of the screen. Staff received threats as late as December, just prior to the Sydney siege. In the wake of the Paris massacre, police last week urged newspaper staff to report any out of the ordinary threats and phone calls. Scroll down for video . Newspaper staff were 'alarmed' to find its website had been 'hacked by IS' with an Islamic State flag replacing all the text on the page and prayer music echoing from the speakers . Terror on the streets: The newspaper received a message from police urging them to report anything suspicious in the wake of the Paris siege . This is the El Telegraph newspaper as it appears normally. Staff received threats after publishing reports (pictured) about the Islamic State . Editor-in-chief Antoine Kazzi told Daily Mail Australia he received the threats after publishing reports about the Islamic State terror group. ‘The police told me they want me to tell them everything no matter how small - they want it on their radar,’ Mr Kazzi said. ‘We have received threats in the past, just for reporting news about Islamic State, so I am happy the police are taking everything seriously. During the early hours of September 16 the site’s manager, who did not want to be named, detected what appeared to be a cyber-hacking by Islamic State sympathisers. Mr Kazzi said he was placed under police protection following an apparent text message threat the same week. ‘I received a text message right after we covered a story on Islamic State and for about three months police officers were watching my home and workplace and they continue to check in every now and then,’ he said. Later, in December, he received a message which said: 'I know where you live, I know where you are, don’t put anything about Islam (in the paper)'. 'Cyber Caliphate': Islamic State hackers claimed to have hacked Pentagon social media accounts overnight . The newspaper's website manager, who did not wish to be named for security reasons, told Daily Mail Australia he was alarmed to wake up to the hacking. ‘I woke up at around 2am to an email alert from our webhost informing me of the hacking,’ said the website manager . ‘I turned on my computer to find two alarming images as Islamic prayer music played. 'I saw the black Islamic State flag with Arabic calligraphy emerging on the screen and the flag of Iraq on top of it. ‘We were left scrambling for ways to regain access to our own site. Even our webhost could not assist. It was a sophisticated hack but thankfully short-lived,’ he said.

We have to report on all issues because we owe that to our readers. 'We are against terrorism and we will continue to report the facts and promote peace in our coverage of both local and international issues.’ The police have been notified about these incidents and the publication has since tightened its security measures.

"He's best known for looking good in his underpants, but Britain's most successful male fashion model is now hoping to attract some attention to his very stylish feet. The Billericay-born 34-year-old, who shot to fame wearing just his underpants in a Dolce & Gabbana campaign in 2006, is now the proud owner of footwear brand, David Preston. David Gandy, who is dating The Saturdays' Mollie King, loved his pair of David Preston-designed Chelsea boots so much, he decided to buy the company. Scroll down for video . David Gandy (right) has bought the David Preston (left) shoe brand and the pair are launching their first collection as business partners  at his weekend at London Collections: Men . The label will have a soft launch at London Collections: Men, which Mr Gandy is also an ambassador for, later in the week. In an interview regarding his latest acquisition, the male supermodel, who has 230,000 followers on Instagram, told fashion website WWD: 'It was always my aim — which sounds really strange as a model — not to always be in front of the camera but to turn the other way and have an input. 'I don't just do one campaign and move on. I go in there, I look at the team and I want to help the brand move in a different direction. He added: 'For me, that's the exciting part - I want to be involved. 'Everyone thinks I turn up on set and go home afterward, but I'm probably the biggest pain in the a***. ""Can we do this? Can we do that?"" It's fun.' David Gandy in David Preston shoes: The model loved his pair so much he decided to buy the company . Mr Gandy's plans for his new brand are to 'create a lifestyle' around the label and to think how men want to be seen in them. 'It's having a cigarette and a whiskey after going out to a black-tie do or being in your classic car with your Chelsea boots on,' he suggests. The Chelsea boot is where this creative venture all began. The model owned a Paul Smith pair that he loved to death but when they finally wore out, he found it hard to replace them out of season. Gandy in the Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Pour Homme television commercial, which shot him to fame . When he heard about a Bethnal Green-based designer who specialised in similar styles, he decided to track him down. 'We met, had lunch, and he was a very interesting guy,' Gandy said in a recent interview with The Financial Times. 'David is very creative — he'd worked as a nurse for 20 years, then taught himself how to make these boots when he couldn't find anything like them — and found a cult following.' Fans of David Preston's trendy footwear include members of Blur, Kasabian, Iggy and the Stooges and Gandy. The first collection since Gandy's acquisition in October launches this weekend at London Collections: Men, and then at the Tranoï trade show in Paris.

According to Gandy, at that price they are aiming to: 'Rival the best at an attainable price.' As well as the iconic Chelsea boot, the collection will also include Oxfords, brogues and monk straps that are more businesslike and other designs that include a touch of velvet or suede for a party vibe. Gandy's latest foray into the business world is another feather in the model's cap as he is already a columnist for GQ and has two apps — one fashion-related and another for fitness.

"A man obsessed with Katie Price is undergoing cosmetic surgery in his quest to look just like his glamour queen idol. Nathan Thursfield, 20, has a 'major fascination' with the Brighton-born star and was so desperate to emulate her that he decided to start copying her features - starting with her nose. The cash supervisor from Stoke-on-Trent, told MailOnline that he first bonded with Katie, 36, when he met her at her book signing and the pair compared fake tans. Nathan, pictured with the star before his nose job, even tweeted Katie, with whom he's become friends with, to show her the results. 'She thinks I'm mad,' he laughed . Nathan hated the way he looked and felt like his nose was too big, left, so he had a loan-funded surgery to make it look like Katie Price's 'dead petite and gorgeous nose' - after the operation pictured right . Earlier this year he underwent his first operation - taking out a loan to fund the surgery, which cost £6,500 - to have his nose reconstructed to look like her and even took a photo of her into the consultation with him. However, Nathan admits he wants another nose job - and is planning on getting a bottom lift, which costs around £4,300, in September to emulate Katie's 'peachy' derriere and in May, he wants veneers so his teeth look like hers. He also got his eyebrows tattooed on to replicate her 'proper amazing' ones. He said: 'I love Katie Price, I am fascinated by her and she's so gorgeous and down-to-earth. I love her ballsy attitude and her looks and where they've got her. 'Ever since I saw her in real life at her book signing a few years ago, I wanted to do what she does.' Nathan, whose boyfriend of five years supports his decisions, hated his appearance and felt like his nose was too big so he decided to do something about it - and looked to his idol for inspiration. He said: 'I was so uncomfortable with my nose, I felt it wasn't suited to my face and that everyone was staring at it. Katie's is dead petite and gorgeous, it's just perfect.' Nathan, pictured before his procedure with Katie at a book signing, thinks she is 'so gorgeous and down-to-earth' - the pair even compared fake tans . Nathan is now planning on getting a bottom lift in September to look like Katie's 'peachy' derriere. He also got his eyebrows tattooed on to replicate her 'proper amazing' ones . 'The surgeon thought I was joking when I told him what I wanted and he said the nose would be girly but I didn't care. I just told him not to make me look like Michael Jackson,' Nathan said. Nathan was desperate to rip-off the cast and check out his new nose as soon as he woke up, quickly rushing to compare pictures of his new nose with Katie's. 'It's not exactly the same,'  Nathan said. 'That's why I am having another £5,500 procedure in three weeks to make it exactly the same, it has to be right.' Nathan does, however, say that the procedure has changed his life for the better. The youngster never used to go out before he had it done because he was so self-conscious, now he goes out partying and on holidays with friends. Nathan Thursfield, 20, is so obsessed with Katie Price that he decided to start copying some of her features - starting with her nose. He now plans to have a second nose job to make his feature even more similar to hers . 'It has completely changed everything,' he said. 'I have never felt so confident, I used to hate meeting people and now I love it.' Nathan even tweeted Katie, with whom he's become friends, to show her the results. 'She thinks I'm mad,' he laughed. But Nathan, who even gets invited backstage to meet Katie at her public appearances, said he will continue with the procedures to look like his idol. 'I will just keep getting whatever she has,' says Nathan, who got a loan to fund his procedure at MYA Cosmetic Surgery. While some of his friends and family think he's crazy and question why he wants to look like her, his boyfriend supports him. 'He just goes with the flow now, if I am happy then he is,' he added.","Nathan Thursfield, 20, has a 'major fascination' with the Brighton-born star .

"Up to 5,000 Islamist fanatics are at large after returning to Europe from the front line in Syria, the Continent's police chief has revealed. Rob Wainwright, the British head of Europol, said the threat from home-grown terrorists was at its highest level since the September 11 attacks in 2001. The warning comes after French gunmen killed 17 people over three days of terror in Paris last week. Rob Wainwright, the British head of Europol, said the threat from home-grown terrorists was at its highest level since the September 11 attacks in 2001 . Mr Wainwright, appearing in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Europe now faces it's ‘most severe terrorist threat since 9/11’. He added: ‘We are talking about 3,000 to 5,000 EU nationals who are potentially a threat. 'Clearly, we're dealing with a large body of mainly young men who have the potential to come back and have the potential or the intent and capability to carry out attacks we have seen in Paris in the last week.' The warning comes after revelations that a major security alert was triggered on New Year's Eve by a message posted on Twitter claiming ISIS had ‘killed a British soldier’. The tweet allegedly came from a fighter in Syria and read: ‘Allahu akbar! Islamic State has killed a British soldier in Britain in his own home.’ The threat was taken extremely seriously amid growing concern that British jihadists are planning to copy the beheadings carried out in Iraq and Syria and broadcast over the internet. Counter-terror officers have allegedly picked up ‘chatter’ about abducting a serving soldier or police officer and filming their murder on the internet, the Times reported. It comes after David Cameron promised to revive legislation – blocked by the Lib Dems – to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online . The so-called Snoopers' Charter would force internet and phone firms to store masses of information about emails, phone calls and internet clicks. Mr Cameron said yesterday: 'If I am prime minister, I will make sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other.' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (left) - in Downing Street following a meeting with David Cameron yesterday - is facing an increased terror threat against the UK . Islamist fanatics murdered British charity worker Alan Henning (left) and Lee Rigby (right). Security chiefs fear further copycat killings . Lee Rigby's killers Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) were on the security services watchlist . It raises the prospect of messaging apps like WhatsApp and Snapchat being blocked. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted that it was wrong to store every web site visit and social media interaction of every person. The Lib Dem leader said the state should always 'retain the right to steam open envelopes, to listen to telephone conversations' of those suspected of criminal or terrorist activity. But he said the Snoopers' Charter 'does cross a line' and is 'not a proportionate response'. He told BBC Radio's Today programme: 'What it would do is say that you, every single person listening to this programme now, every website they visit over the last year, every social media interaction they have, will be stored by somebody.' He stressed that his opposition was not about letting terrorists communicate in the 'dark' web'. 'It's about do I think that scooping up vast amounts of information on millions of people, children, grandmothers, grandparents, elderly people who are doing nothing more than visiting garden centre websites. 'Do I think that is a sensible use of our resources and our time? 'Does it address the issue which the agency quite rightly identifies, which is as technology mutates, as this globalised industry becomes more and more global how do we make sure that we continue to have the reach into those dark spaces so that terrorists cannot hide from it.' Amedy Coulibaly murdered a policewoman before killing four hostages in a Kosher supermarket in Paris . Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi murdered 12 people at a satirical newspaper that caricatured the Prophet Muhammed . The legislation, which was tabled in draft form by Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012, would have extended the requirement for companies to retain phone and email data to include records - but not the content - of every individual's internet browsing activity, including use of social media sites like Facebook, internet gaming, and mobile phone messaging services. Mr Cameron yesterday said that as well as well as the Snoopers' Charter, new legislation will be required to enable the agencies to continue to intercept phone calls and access the content of electronic communications - on the basis of a warrant signed by the home secretary - when existing powers expire in 2016. In a speech tonight Mr Clegg will argue 'we do not make ourselves safer by making ourselves less free'. The Lib Dem leader will also underline his party's proposals for a Bill of Rights that would enshrine the right to free expression. 'If we really believe freedom of speech is a founding principle of our democracy, then we must act to protect it,' he will say. 'I look enviously at America, where every schoolchild is taught from day one that they have inalienable rights - including free expression - which are a fundamental part of what it means to be American. 'I want us to have the same. The time has come for a written constitution with a Bill of Rights. The Liberal Democrats are committed to a constitutional convention after the general election, and deciding how we enshrine free speech in a British Bill of Rights should be at the heart of it. 'We must always defend the British values of freedom, openness and tolerance. We must always defend the rights of individuals to express themselves freely. And we must always defend the right of a free press to do its work without fear or favour,' he will add. 'It is at times like these, when our freedoms are under threat, that we must stand up for them most of all.'","Tweet allegedly came from a fighter in Syria sparking major operation .

"I don’t know about you, but I find this time of year a bit of a struggle. The fun and frolics of Christmas are over, and it’s back to work – getting up and going home in pitch darkness, and battling through the cold, wind and rain just to grab a pint of milk from the shop. If I had my way, I’d burrow down under the duvet and hibernate til the spring sunshine makes an appearance. Scroll down for video . This week Binky shows you how to get a polished makeup look, perfect for the winter weather, in just five minutes . But since that’s not an option, I’ve gone for the next best option. I’ve created a quick and easy make-up regime that will have you have you looking fresh-faced and gorgeous in a flash – just the thing to brighten up those dark winter days. Step 1: The Base . Chilly weather and central heating are a dehydrating double-whammy for your complexion, so this is a good moment to invest in a decent foundation. DiorSkin Star Foundation gives excellent full coverage, evening out dry, dull winter skin without feeling greasy or cakey – I applied it with a foundation brush to achieve a professional finish. Binky begins with a correcting concealer as a quick fix for any blemishes . Christmas indulgences often lead to blemishes, so I also used a touch of bareMinerals Correcting Concealer to disguise any spots and under-eye shadows. This product has a lovely creamy consistency, making it easy to blend, but if your concealer is a little hard, you’ll find that applying it with your fingertips helps as the heat from your hands will warm and soften the formula. A dusting of translucent powder will fix everything in place – I used bareMinerals Illuminating Veil Powder, swept onto my forehead, cheeks and T-zone with a big fluffy brush. Step 2: Cheeks and Eyes . I’ve become a real fan of contouring powders. Clever shading and highlighting can subtly alter your face shape, sharpening up those cheekbones and adding a glamorous dewy sheen that looks super-flattering. Binky uses contouring powders to sharpen her cheek bones . For this quick look, I used the Red Carpet Cosmetics Contour Made Easy palette, blending the contour shades under my cheekbones and dusting the highlight shades across my cheeks, forehead, nose and chin. Sticking with the same palette for speed, I worked the same light shimmery shades all over my eyelids with a medium-size, flat brush, followed by applying the warmer shades along the crease of my eye to add definition. Using a single palette for face and eyes really pulls your look together, as well as saving both time and money! A few coats of Too Faced Lashgasm Mascara will add a polished finish to your eyes. Work the brush from roots to tips, wiggling from side to side as you go to ensure each lash is fully coated with mascara. Lips need extra care this time of years so Binky recommends opting for a tinted balm . Finally, use your fingertips to work a touch of Daniel Sandler Watercolour Cream Blusher in Soft Pink into your cheeks. Winter complexions tend to look pale and washed-out, so blusher is a must at this time of year, and this lovely creamy formula is a welcome treat for your skin, too. Step 3: The Lips . The delicate skin on your lips is especially vulnerable at this time of year when the wind and cold can play havoc, so a hydrating and protective product is a great beauty investment. I slicked on a coat of Clarins Instant Light Natural Lip Perfector in Rose Shimmer. Again, it’s super-quick to apply, it gives a fresh shimmery finish, and (best of all) its rich, moisturizing formula will take care of your precious pout! To get Binky;s glamorous day-to-day look it only takes three simple steps and five minutes . Time’s up! Three steps and five minutes from start to finish, and that pale creature that greeted you in the mirror when you woke up will be transformed into a glowing, fresh-faced beauty – a gorgeous ray of sunshine on a dreary winter day. If you’re tempted to try any of the products I’ve recommended here, then head to Escentual.com, the fab e-boutique for all your beauty favourites. Or if you’re guilty of over-splurging in the January sales, here are a few cheaper alternatives I’m loving: . Keep warm and stay gorgeous!

"A 19-year-old medical student has died while undergoing liposuction - a prize for winning her local beauty competition. Catherine Cando, a part-time glamour model, was crowned winner of the Queen of Duran beauty contest, in Ecuador. Miss Cando, who won the competition in October last year, was showered with prizes, including a new Aveo car 2015, a smart tablet - and a free course of cosmetic surgery treatment. Scroll down for video . Catherine Canto died earlier this month after undergoing liposuction treatment in her native Ecuador . The treatment was a prize for being named Queen of Duran, a beauty contest in her home town . After winning her title, Miss Canto had hoped to work in tourism projects, as well as 'social assistance programmes' for children and seniors, as well as in animal protection . Miss Canto put off the treatment as she felt she didn't need it - despite judges in the competition recommending she lose a bit of weight. She told local media she had decided to exercise to lose the supposed excess weight instead. But it seems others were keen for her to undergo the surgery. Her brother Daniel Zavala, 24, told local media: 'Before having the surgery, she received a lot of calls from the surgeon trying to persuade her to do it, but she kept saying no. 'She was thinking about letting someone else have it as a freebie but eventually she agreed to have it just get him off her back.' According to Ecuadorian newspaper El Telegrafo, she eventually underwent the procedure at a private clinic on January 10 - with tragic consequences. But instead the teenage beauty queen died on the operating table, after allegedly being pressured into undergoing liposuction . Exactly how and why Miss Canto (left) died remains unclear, with further examinations ordered to ascertain cause of death . Mourners at Miss Canto's funeral, which was held just months after she was named winner of the beauty contest . The surgeon who carried out the operation has now been arrested to prevent him leaving the country . Lawyer Carlos Reyes Izquierdo said: 'I was told she had died of a brain oedema. 'But the clinic staff told her relatives that she had died of a cardiac arrest. 'I have ordered cytological and pathological examinations to find out what exactly happened. 'However, it can be presumed as negligence because there has been no support from doctors who have failed to explain anything about the case. 'The doctors in question have been arrested to prevent them from leaving the county.' The tragic death follows that of Brazilian model Pamela Nascimento, 27, who also died during liposuction surgery in 2011. The cause of her death was registered as hypovolemic shock, where severe blood loss makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. The perils of cosmetic surgery have also been in the headlines more recently, with Andressa Urach, 27, runner-up in the 2012 Miss Bumbum competition, ending up in intensive care after her surgery wounds became infected.

"Luxury cruise firm Cunard have released an animated timeline of its illustrious history to mark the 175th anniversary of the company. The video details various key moments, from Cunard's first scheduled transatlantic crossing in 1840 to its role in World War I. The shipping company was also the first steel ship to use electric light bulbs on board. Its ships pioneered wireless transmission at sea took at the turn of the 20th century, while they also operated the first round-the-world cruise in 1922. The company, founded by Sir Samuel Cunard, made its maiden transatlantic voyage in 1840 when the Britannia sailed from Liverpool to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The video also documents Cunard’s participation in WWI, including the loss of 20 ships from the fleet when they were deployed between 1914-1918. Winston Churchill estimated that its famous vessels the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth helped to shorten the Second World War by at least a year; fundamentally due to the large troop-carrying capacities of the ships. Samuel Cunard founded the iconic British cruise company in 1840 . The cruise liners had many firsts over the years, including being the first to use a wireless transmission at sea . Upon the end of the war, Cunard regained its position as the largest Atlantic passenger line after falling behind to US competitors, and by the mid-1950s operated twelve ships to the United States and Canada. As well as being called upon at time of crisis, the animation also details how Cunard played its part in the world of fashion and glamour as many of the world's most iconic movie stars graced the Promenade Deck of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth in the 1950s. Fred Perry, Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor becoming regular guests as they made their way across the Atlantic.

"Lee Webb has been jailed for four years after shocked staff at his son's nursery found drugs and knives in the boy's lunch box . A father accidentally sent his son to nursery with a 'drug dealer's kit' consisting of Class A drugs and knives instead of a packed lunch, a court heard. Drug dealer's stooge Lee Webb, 23, confused the two bags before dropping off his three-year-old child at the Smarty Pants Nursery in Folkestone, Kent. Shocked staff opened up the toddler's rucksack at snack time expecting to find food and drink, but instead, discovered cocaine and banned stimulant mephedrone inside. Childcare workers also found two knives, a set of scales and other drug paraphernalia, Canterbury Crown Court heard. Webb, a tree surgeon from Folkestone, has now been jailed for four years after being convicted of possessing Class A and Class B drugs. Judge James O'Mahony told him: 'You sent your three-year-old son to nursery with a rucksack containing a significant quantity of Class A and B drugs. In effect, you sent your son there with a drug dealer's kit. 'Your stupidity put children at risk and I consider the potential exposure to children of these drugs is so serious only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.' Mary Jacobson, prosecuting, said staff at the nursery alerted police but, shortly afterwards, Webb turned up and demanded the bag back. She said that they refused to hand over the Tupperware box and Webb then left. Ms Jacobson said the incident happened in March last year when the father of two dropped his son off at the nursery with the rucksack at 8.45am. She said: 'The staff noted the bag contained what they thought could be drugs and they called the police. 'A PCSO arrived and took possession of the Tupperware tub with white powder, a blue wrap, a spoon, weighing scales and two knives.' Staff at Smarty Pants Nursery in Folkestone were shocked to discover the drugs  when they opened the box . Officers later raided Webb's home and arrested him, noticing that he had written on his hand details of a local solicitor. Webb, who also had a stash of £680 at his house, claimed he had been given the bag by another person to look after overnight. The judge told him: 'You maintain you were holding the drugs on behalf of another and that you were expecting to be paid cash for holding the drugs. 'You must have been well-trusted by those further up the chain, although you indicated you felt intimidated by the individual you assisted. 'Yet you have rejected an opportunity to give evidence in relation to this man and, in reality, profits from selling drugs mean that those involved are invariably intimidating.' The judge added that he accepted that giving the drugs for his son to take to nursery had been a mistake - and Webb was now genuinely remorseful. A judge at Canterbury Crown Court told Webb his 'stupidity' had put children at risk and he had to be jailed .","Tree surgeon packed off toddler to nursery with lunch box last March .

"Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party should prepare for the apparently unthinkable prospect of Labour and the Tories in power . Labour and the Conservatives may take the extraordinary step of entering a ‘grand coalition’ with each other after the next election, a senior Cabinet minister has claimed. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party should prepare for the apparently unthinkable prospect of David Cameron and Ed Miliband reaching some sort of power-sharing deal. ‘We may have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that we won't be in the coalition at all, that there will be a grand coalition between Labour and the Tories instead,’ he said. Asked if he expected that to happen, he said: ‘It's one of the possibilities we should be preparing for.’ Mr Cable went on: ‘It's not something I'm advocating, as it would put me out of a job. But we need to consider all of the possibilities.’ The Business Secretary’s startling prediction came as he spoke to other guests after recording last week’s BBC Question Time programme. In recent weeks, some political commentators have raised the possibility of a Labour-Tory alliance as polls suggest the two main parties are on the slide and both will struggle to command a Commons majority. Conservative hopes of an outright win are threatened by the rise of Ukip in England, while a dramatic advance by the SNP surge in Scotland since last year’s independence referendum is hampering Labour’s chances. Ian Birrell, a former speechwriter for David Cameron, has speculated about a ‘national government’ bringing together the largest parties – a familiar arrangement in Germany, where it is called a ‘grand coalition’. ‘A government of national unity between Labour and the Conservatives may sound far-fetched, especially amid the froth and fury of a nascent election campaign,’ he said. ‘It would certainly be tricky, exacerbating internal divisions and leading to more defections. 'Yet, while there are serious disagreements, the two parties have more in common with each other than with the insurgents on many key issues – especially if David Cameron survived and Miliband was replaced by someone such as [shadow business secretary] Chuka Umunna.’ In the 1929 general election, Labour won 37 per cent of the vote and cobbled together a minority government led by Ramsay MacDonald with Liberal support. But when public spending had to be slashed to rein in a spiralling budget deficit following the Wall Street crash, the government fell apart. MacDonald, encouraged by Palace officials, formed a national government in 1931, with the Conservatives joining a coalition. Conservative and Labour strategists dismiss the prospect of a similar arrangement after May’s election, despite the similar difficulties facing Britain as it tries to cut the vast debts run up in the 2009 financial crisis. Tory David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband could be forced to enter a power-sharing deal if the election result is inconclusive, Mr Cable suggested . One senior Tory said Mr Cable’s predictions were ‘absolutely absurd’ and there was ‘not a snowball’s chance in Hell’ of an arrangement with Labour. Labour leader Mr Milband prompted speculation of a deal with the SNP over the weekend when he four times refused to rule out a coalition or looser arrangement with them. A deal with the Nationalists would most likely would be a ‘supply and demand’ arrangement, ensuring budgets and other key pieces of legislation were passed rather than a formal coalition. Senior Scottish MPs are known to bitterly oppose the idea, but Mr Miliband repeatedly declined to rule it out in an appearance on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. SNP Westminster leader and General Election campaign director Angus Robertson said: ‘Ed Miliband refused to rule out working with the SNP following the General Election, leaving the door open to the benefits of the SNP holding the balance of power in a hung Westminster parliament with a minority Labour government. ‘Left to their own devices, Labour would continue with austerity. With a strong group of SNP MPs holding the balance of power at Westminster, we can ensure that Scotland’s voice is heard and use our influence positively to end austerity economics, free Scotland of Trident nuclear weapons, and secure the powers we need to build a fairer, more prosperous country.’ Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “With every week that passes, we hear more evidence Labour and the SNP are preparing to jump into bed with each other after May. ‘Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon are already halfway down the aisle. ‘A weak Prime Minister Miliband with Alex Salmond pulling the strings in Westminster should scare anyone committed to keeping the UK together, as we can only imagine the concessions the SNP would wring from a Labour party desperate for the keys to Number Ten.’","Business Secretary says country must prepare for the unthinkable .

"The husband of a young mother who was last seen on December 30 has been charged with her murder, police confirmed on Tuesday. Kyle J. Crosby, 28, of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, was being held on one count of murder over the death of his wife, 26-year-old Erica Crippen. The young mother's body has not been found and investigators continue to search for her whereabouts after the suspect reported her missing on January 7. Crosby was captured by police on Monday during a traffic stop, while he was driving his wife's car, from which he attempted to flee on foot. Kyle J. Crosby, 28, of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, is being held on one count of murder over the alleged death of his wife, 26-year-old Erica Crippen. Her body has not been found . According to 6abc, Crosby had been missing since last Wednesday doing drugs with a prostitute. According to a release from the Mount Laurel Police Department, in the trunk of the vehicle, investigators found several items they believe 'have evidential value in connection to her disappearance'. Police gave no further details to the items in the trunk of the car. According to nj.com, Crosby was driving his wife's car which had also been reported missing by her family members. Crosby was being held in the Burlington County Jail on $1.2million bail. He appeared in court on Tuesday afternoon and was charged with murder and two counts of child endangerment. The couple lived together in New Jersey with their two children - Crosby's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship and their three-month-old baby girl. Police officers were sent to the family's home on January 7 for a wellness check after the eldest girl did not attend school that week. The father signed a missing person's report for his wife that day and claimed that he had not seen his wife since New Year's Day. The couple were last seen together at PJ Whelihan's restaurant in Cherry Hill on December 30, according to NJ.com. The 26-year-old gave birth to her daughter (pictured) three months ago. The new mom has been missing for almost two weeks . Crosby, pictured left leaving court in handcuffs, accompanied by police officers after being charged with his wife's murder in New Jersey . Further investigation led to a charge against Crosby filed on January 10 for Endangering the Welfare of a Child. The charge allowed officers to stop and detain the 28-year-old suspect on Monday. According to reports, the alleged murderer has previous convictions for drug and robbery offenses. Ms Crippen's cousin, Barbara Kellam, told CBS that she had not heard from her cousin since December 30 and that when family members went to check on her at home, they found broken glass and no shower curtain or rod in the bathroom. On a Facebook page titled, Team Bring Erica Back Home, loved ones have shared messages about the 26-year-old's disappearance and noted that her car also had been missing. A message from January 9 read: 'I seriously can't fathom all that is going on right now and even the strong possibility that Erica may not return to us with breath in her body!!! My heart hurts and my mind is boggled.. I personally want to thank all of you who have reached out in love and support to help us through this...'

"A 1,000-year-old sculpture which was used in recent years as a tombstone for a cat has been bought by a museum for £150,000. The Anglo-Saxon limestone relief depicting St Peter was originally discovered at a quarry in Somerset by Johnny Beeston, a stonemason. He took it home and used it to mark the grave of his tabby Winkle, whom he had adopted as a stray, at the bottom of his garden. Discovery: This Anglo-Saxon carving was used as a gravestone for a cat before its significance was realised . Inspiration: Historian Chris Brewchorne spotted the carving and told its owner what it was worth . But when Mr Beeston died, a historian examined the monument and realised that it was in fact a rare artwork dating back to the 10th or 11th century. It was bought by a private collector 10 years ago - but now it will go on public display after it was acquired by the Museum of Somerset for £150,000, with half of the money coming from a lottery grant. No one knows exactly where Mr Beeston found the stone, but it is thought to have come from a local church such as Muchelney Abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. Experts have suggested that it could have been part of the church's architecture, perhaps mounted next to the altar. The work would originally have been painted, and the deep holes in the figure's eyes imply that they would once have been filled with blue glass or a similar material. Purchase: The monument, which shows St Peter, has now been bought for £150,000 by a local museum . Home: For years it was located in the garden of this house, where it marked the grave of a pet cat . Local historian Chris Brewchorne was the first person to appreciate the carving's value when he passed the home where Mr Beeston's widow was living. 'I was walking past the house one day and saw it in the front garden and knew immediately I was looking at something special,' he said. 'I knocked on the front door, spoke to the owners and told them, ""I think you've just won the lottery.""' The artwork was originally sold at Sotheby's 10 years ago for £175,000 to Stanley J. Seeger, an American collector. After Mr Seeger died in 2011, the carving came up for sale again - and this time the museum was able to raise the funds to buy it. Snapped up: The sculpture will now live in the Museum of Somerset, based in Taunton Castle, pictured . Steve Minnitt, head of museums for the South West Heritage Trust, said: 'We were keen at the time to acquire it for the museum, but the price was beyond us. 'So when it recently came up for sale again we were determined to raise the money if we could.' Digging around in the back garden is not just a relaxing hobby - for some lucky collectors, it can be extremely lucrative. Two years ago, a couple from Northumberland realised that the stone trough they used to plant flowers in was in fact a Roman coffin (above) valued by experts at £100,000. More Roman remains were discovered in the garden of an archaeological school in Kent in 2012, and turned out to be a theatre which would once have been able to hold 12,000 people. Last year, Nicola and Paul Walling were shocked to find human skeletons (right) in their Hampshire garden while they were building an extension - and even more surprised to learn that they were the bodies of French POWs captured during the Napoleonic Wars. There have also been a number of 20th-century finds - in 2012 a homeowner in Somerset found a 6ft-deep air raid shelter buried underneath his garden, and the next year a family realised that the oldest surviving garden swing in the world, dating back 90 years, was located in their back yard. Perhaps the most bizarre discovery of all came in October 2013, when John Lambert was told that a large bone he'd found in Ipswich belonged to a 250million-year-old pliosaur, a sea creature related to dinosaurs. It will go on public display in the museum, based in Taunton Castle, from this Saturday. Historians say that despite the fragmentary nature of the sculpture, its high price tag is explained by the fact that few comparable carvings are in as good a condition. Dr Victoria Whitworth, from the University of the Highlands and Islands, told MailOnline that the depiction of the saint was characteristically English. 'The carving is very fine, depicting a typically Anglo-Saxon image of St Peter, in that he is beardless and tonsured - a convention paralled in many Anglo-Saxon manuscripts but unknown on the Continent, where he is bearded,' she said. 'St Peter would usually have a key, but here he has a book - perhaps this is why his name was added to the image.' She suggested that the sculpture could once have been 'flanking the altar with the Virgin Mary on the other side', adding: 'His upward gaze perhaps is intended to guide the viewer's eyes towards Christ in Majesty.' Dr Helen Gittos of the University of Kent added: 'It's important because it's such high quality, and because comparatively little Anglo-Saxon sculpture survives from Somerset and the South-West generally - despite there having been many important Anglo-Saxon churches there.' At the time of the original sale, a Sotheby's spokesman said: 'The relief is made from Oolithic limestone and is incredibly rare, as few reliefs of this period have survived, time normally having worn the surface detail away. 'The carving is believed to have originally been a section of a cross shaft, or part of a larger panel - the figure of St Peter is clearly visible. 'It is a rare survivor of English stone carving at its best and draws strong parallels to the ninth and 10th centuries.' The sculpture dates from around the time of the Viking invasion of England, when Alfred the Great was forced to hide in the Somerset marshes before rallying his troops and taking back his kingdom.","A stonemason found the carving in a quarry and used it as a tombstone .

"As wildlife crime is on the rise, a newly-discovered method of recovering fingerprints from feathers and eggs could help catch those guilty, according to scientists. Researchers at Abertay University based in Dundee have established which fingerprint powders are most effective at developing fingermarks on the feathers and eggs of birds of prey. The discovery means that police can establish whether a bird or egg has been handled by a human. Researchers at Abertay University, Dundee have found a method of recovering fingerprints from feathers (fingerprint on a golden eagle egg above) and eggs that could help catch those guilty of wildlife crime . The discovery of which powders are most effective at developing fingermarks (a fingerprint on a red kite feather above) means that police can establish whether a bird or egg has been handled by a human . Since 2006, 2,578 incidents of bird crime involving or targeting wild birds of prey have been reported to the RSPB. Dennis Gentles, a lecturer in forensic science at Abertay University, said until now, feathers were a surface where recovering fingerprints remained elusive along with human and animal skin. He said: 'We had heard anecdotally that it had been achieved and were keen to see if we could develop a method that produced consistent results and could be used by the police in an investigation.' He added: 'Now, if the police examine a discarded bird of prey for fingerprints following our guidelines, any fingermarks that have been left there will become visible. 'If a fingermark shows up, it is proof that the bird has been handled and suggests that it was discarded on someone else's land as the perpetrator tried to get rid of the carcass. 'Even if they don't manage to recover an identifiable fingermark, the presence of the mark means that they know exactly where to focus their attention to swab for DNA and that this particular bird of prey had been handled by a human. Six species of bird of prey feathers including the kestrel (pictured left) and seven species of bird prey eggs including the tawny owl (pictured right) were examined in the research . 'So, we hope that this research will help the police in their endeavours to bring those guilty of wildlife crime to justice. 'They will now be able to recover more evidence - and it will be evidence that could potentially link a suspect to the crime.' Six species of bird of prey feathers (kestrel, sparrowhawk, buzzard, red kite, golden eagle and white-tailed eagle) and seven species of bird of prey eggs (kestrel, sparrowhawk, golden eagle, goshawk, tawny owl, barn owl and long-eared owl) were examined in the research. Previously it had not been established which of the many different fingerprint powders available would work and there was always a risk of damaging the evidence. The results of the latest research showed that red and green magnetic fluorescent powders were the most successful at recovering fingerprints from feathers. Black magnetic powder was the most successful at recovering fingermarks from eggs. The results of the latest research showed that red and green magnetic fluorescent powders were the most successful at recovering fingerprints from feathers. Species of bird prey including the sparrowhawk (above) was also tested in the research . Ian Thomson, head of investigations at RSPB Scotland, welcomed the research. He said: 'Since 1994, almost 750 protected birds of prey have been confirmed as being the victims of illegal poisoning, shooting or trapping in Scotland. 'This has included some of our rarest breeding species like golden eagles, hen harriers and red kites whose populations continue to be threatened by illegal killing. 'While government laboratory testing has made it relatively straightforward to identify the cause of death of the victims in many cases, identifying the perpetrator of offences that often take place in some of the remotest areas of our countryside continues to be very difficult. 'Although there has been a reduction in the number of cases of illegal egg collection, the practice still exists and there is evidence that illegal egg collectors are now increasingly operating abroad. 'This work carried out by Abertay University is a great step forward in the development of forensic techniques and can only assist in the fight against those who threaten some of our most iconic raptors.' Full details of the methods used have been recorded in a research paper, which has been published in the journal Science & Justice and is available online.","Black magnetic powder proved to be most successful at recovering fingermarks from eggs .

"A central Florida mother is facing a child cruelty charge after police say she drove down a busy road with her teenage son clinging to the hood of her car. According to Winter Springs police, an officer pulled over 43-year-old Tojuana Lowe last Thursday morning as she was traveling on State Road 434. Lowe reportedly told that officer that her son had jumped on her vehicle to prevent her from leaving and that she drove away in an attempt to scare him, assuming he would jump off. Scroll down for video . Bad move: Tojuana Lowe, 43, was charged with child cruelty after driving for a third of a mile along State Road 434 with her 16-year-old son on top of her Mazda . Police say Lowe was traveling about 20 to 25 miles per hour and had made it nearly a third of a mile from their home before being stopped. No injuries were reported. According to an arrest report obtained by Orlando Sentinel, Tojuana Lowe was stopped by a police officer at around 7.30am on January 8 after she was spotted driving with her 16-year-old son on her windshield. The mother told the officer that her son jumped on top of her Mazda to prevent her from leaving their home at Moss Park Apartment sin Winter Springs. 'I tried to scare him by driving off with him on the car,' she reportedly told the officer. There is no word at this time why the boy wanted to stop his mother from leaving. Police said the 16-year-old at one point jumped off the car, but then immediately hopped back on, settling on the hood. Evidence: This photo from a surveillance video at a Winter Springs gas station reportedly captured Lowe's son (highlighted) on her car . Dangerous route: State Road 434 is considered one the busiest thoroughfares in Seminole County . The mother stated that she was in the process of calling 911 when she saw a Winter Springs police officer and pulled over of her own accord to ask for help. ‘State Road 434 has a high volume of traffic flow and if Tojuna’s vehicle was involved in a traffic accident, [her son] could have sustained serious bodily injury,’ the arrest report stated. Miss Lowe told the arresting officer she knew it was wrong to drive with her son clinging to the outside of the car. Lowe was booked into the Seminole County jail and later released on $2,000 bail.","Tojuana Lowe, 43, was traveling 20-25 mph and had made it nearly a third of a mile from their home in Winter Springs .

"A family fear they could be torn apart after the Panamanian wife of a British man was denied a permanent visa. John Dennis moved back to the UK last year after marrying his wife Ana Maria in Panama and the couple's four-year-old daughter, Victoria, has now started school near their new home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. But their hopes of settling down in Britain have been left hanging in the balance after the self-employed business consultant says he was told he did not earn enough for his wife to get a permanent visa. John Dennis fears his wife Ana Maria, the mother of his daughter Victoria, could be sent back to Panama . Mr Dennis, 50, insists he earns £36,000-a-year from his company, Lean Six Sigma Training, which advises small firms. But the Home Office say the couple did not provide enough 'evidence' to support their application. Mr Dennis met his wife while he was working in Panama as a consultant in 2009. Their daughter Victoria was born in Panama in 2010 and they married in 2012. The family decided England would provide a better life for them and also meant John could be closer to his widowed 80-year-old mother, Audrey. After moving in April last year, Victoria, who also has a British passport, settled at school, and Ana began the process of applying for a permanent visa. But they have been left shocked after their application was refused, meaning Ms Ramos de Dennis faces having to return to her home country. The couple met in the Central American country (pictured) while Mr Dennis was working there and they married in 2012 before moving back to Mr Dennis's native North East England . Mr Dennis said: 'Our family is going to be broken up for an indefinite period of time because of faceless bureaucrats. 'Victoria is the one who is going to suffer the most. She will either have to leave the school she loves and leave her dad to go back to Panama or stay here with me and be without her mother.' Since July 2012, the Immigration Rules have contained a financial requirement to be met by a person applying for entry clearance to remain in the UK. The minimum income threshold for a couple is £18,600 - which rises to £22,400 where the application includes sponsorship of a non-EU child. However, the financial requirement does not apply to a child who is a British citizen. Acceptable 'evidence' includes bank statements  on official bank stationery, electronic bank statements,  building society statements or a letter from a financial institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for money in overseas accounts. Source: Home Office . 'I can't sleep. I lie awake every night thinking about it and worrying.' He added: 'The relationship requirements and everything like that were met, but they refused the visa, saying that I don't meet the financial requirements. 'You have to earn £18,600 a year as a minimum. I'm self-employed and earn about £3,000 a month and I gave them bank statements and everything I could think of to prove it. 'But they refused the visa, saying that I don't meet the financial requirements. They said I didnt give the necessary evidence, but didn't say what that was supposed to be. 'She had 28 days to appeal but you have to be in your home country to do that, so she would have had to go back to Panama so we could appeal it. 'If we cant get this decision turned around, we will all have to go back to Panama and start the process of applying again. 'When we went to Panama to hand in the forms and evidence, I was there to answer any questions they wanted to ask, but they didn't ask me anything. 'It's not the refusal that I think is unfair, but it does indicate incompetence and a broken system.' The Home Office has claimed they have not supplied enough evidence to support their visa application . The family are now pinning their hopes of staying in Britain on an appeal they plan to make against the decision. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution. 'Our family rules are designed to make sure that those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner will not become a burden on the taxpayer and will be well enough supported to integrate effectively.

The rapper's rental fee includes a night in a penthouse hotel suite, a ride in a Lamborghini and, in Riff Raff's words, the knowledge 'U are a legend at your school.' Scroll down for video . Could this be you? Cult rapper Riff Raff famously took Katy Perry to the 2014 Video Music Awards and now he's offered to take a rich and over-18 high schooler to prom this spring for the low, low price of $28,000 . Riff Raff, 32, who was born Horst Simco in Copperfield, Texas, posted his offer and all its myriad perks on Instagram over the weekend for all his 900,000 followers to see. Those perks include a full week of promotion of the event on Twitter and Instagram 'saying who you are and that he is taking you to prom.' The lucky, and well-heeled, young Riff Raff fan will also receive, 'freestyle videos and iconic prom pictures all night,' Riff Raff writes. Aside from his $28,000 fee, Riff Raff requires only that his date be 18-years-old or over. Riff Raff's lucky date can also revel in knowing that she will be on the arm of the same man who took Katy Perry to the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. He's also the man who inspired James Franco's Alien character from 'Spring Breakers.' Riff Raff first gained notoriety after appearing on MTV's From G's to Gents. He's now a beloved hip hop personality, albeit not for his musical talents . What a steal: Riff Raff posted his scintillating offer on Instagram over the weekend . Expensive car fan?

He opted out of wearing a denim hat like JT did back in the day in order to show off his colorful braided hair, though he did arrive on the red carpet carrying one in his hand. Riff Raff is known more for his off-the-wall style than his musical talents, but that doesn't keep fans from lining up to see him perform songs from his album Neon Icon live. He first gained notoriety on the MTV show From G's to Gents before breaking out to collaborate with such hip hop notables Lil B, Lil Debbie and Soulja Boy.

"Criticised: Tony Blair, the former prime minister, at the Northern Ireland Select Committee, where he was accused of 'betraying' terrorism victims . Tony Blair was heavily criticised yesterday for ‘betraying’ terrorism victims after defending his secret deal to send letters granting amnesty to IRA fugitives. The former Prime Minister insisted the Northern Ireland peace process would probably have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects – the so-called ‘on the runs’. The scheme, set up by the Labour government in 1999, assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters that they were no longer being hunted by the police. Some 95 recipients of the so-called ‘comfort letters’ were linked to almost 300 murders. Under hostile questioning from the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee, Mr Blair refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients ‘get out of jail free’ cards. But he did say sorry to the victims of the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed four soldiers, because chief suspect John Downey was mistakenly given a ‘comfort letter’ in 2007 which led to the collapse of his Old Bailey murder trial in February last year. Last night, those who lost loved ones in IRA atrocities said they were ‘disgusted’ with Mr Blair. Shelley Gilfillan, from Castlederg, County Tyrone, whose uncle Lexie Cummings, 39, was gunned down in cold blood outside his shop by masked republican terrorists, said: ‘Blair won’t talk to the victims but he’ll happily sit down with Sinn Fein and the IRA and do deals. It’s more backstabbing. ‘We are the ones still grieving and they get a pat on the back.’ Mr Blair, who is the UN’s Middle East peace envoy, gave evidence to MPs about the ‘on the runs’ programme after evading an appearance for more than nine months. During a heated two-hour session, Mr Blair was told the ‘unsavoury’ scheme, drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, had left victims feeling ‘hurt and betrayed’. But the former PM said the letters were ‘absolutely critical’ to the peace process and an ‘essential component’ in getting Sinn Fein to accept an overhauled police service in Northern Ireland. He said talks were on a ‘knife-edge’ before the establishment of a power-sharing government in Stormont between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein. ‘If I had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all… I think it is likely that the peace process would have collapsed,’ he said. ‘I wanted to put the death, destruction, terrorism and misery to an end. I couldn’t bring back those people who had died during the Troubles but I was trying to make sure there would not be further victims.’ 'I wanted to put the death, destruction, terrorism and misery to an end': Mr Blair refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients ‘get out of jail free’ cards . Peace process: Mr Blair, left, with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, right, and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness in 10 Downing Street in 2005. He said the pair pressured him for the amnesty for paramilitaries . As part of the peace deal, IRA terrorists serving prison terms were granted early release that could not apply to those on the run. But a controversial agreement was reached between Mr Blair and Sinn Fein whereby checks would be carried out and those who were no longer wanted by police would be sent a letter informing them of that fact. Mr Blair insisted the scheme was ‘not secret’, even though leading Northern Ireland politicians, including Lord Trimble, who was First Minister of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2002, and senior police chiefs in the province were unaware of it. The comfort letters came to light only when Downey’s trial was halted. Mr Blair said yesterday: ‘For that, I take responsibility and I apologise to those who have suffered.’ But he added: ‘I’m not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received them because without them we would not have had peace.’","Blair insists peace process would have collapsed without the scheme .

"A Chinese woman was crushed to death after trying to stop a digger driver from driving off following a dispute about damage the driver had caused to her property. The incident happened after the owner of the digger was sent to dig a trench as part of work being done to put in an oil pipeline in the Kongwan township, in the city of Yicheng, in central China's Hubei province. According to neighbours of the couple, Yu Chung, 49, and his wife Zhen, 48, the trench had been dug too close tot their home which caused a wall to crack and sag outwards. Zhen Chung was crushed to death after trying to stop a digger driver from driving off following a dispute about damage the driver had caused to her and her husband's property in China . Annoyed by the damage the couple are said to have used pitchforks to threaten the digger driver and force him to agree to pay compensation. When he refused the couple reportedly chased him off and seized the digger. A week later, with the dispute still unresolved, the owner of the digger, Yu Bin, 29, came back to the property during the early hours of the morning. Using a spare key, Bin then tried to drive off in the digger, but the engine woke up the Chungs. Another villager Ye Meng, 40, said: 'As soon as he started the engine he woke up the couple, and they ran outside shouting which woke some of us up as well. Zhen had lay down behind the digger to stop the driver from leaving, but he had failed to see her . 'When I got there I saw Chung standing in front of the digger and refusing to move to stop it getting away, and when the digger driver decided to try going backwards his wife ran behind it and lay down on the ground.

"Energy and vitamin-enhanced drinks do not boost mental or physical health, a damning study has claimed. In fact, many of the benefits being claimed have no foundation in nutritional science either, said the report by university academics. The drinks boast of being packed with various nutrients and vitamins making claims to improve everything from concentration to improving mood. Many of the health claims associated with these drinks have no foundation in nutritional science either, said the damning report by Canadian academics . But many young people get their daily intake of many of these vitamins in other ways, researchers told the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism. Nutritional scientists from Canada's University of Toronto and Ryerson University, looked at the ingredients and claimed benefits of brands from local supermarkets. These included energy drinks, vitamin waters and juices with added nutrients, most commonly the vitamins B6, B12, C and niacin. But with the possible exception of vitamin C, most young adults are already getting their daily recommended levels of these nutrients anyway, said researcher Naomi Dachner. Energy and vitamin-enriched drinks boast of being packed with various nutrients that may improve everything from concentration to mood . She said: 'While our findings suggest that consumers stand to reap little or no benefit from the nutrient additions in novel beverages, most products were being marketed as if they provided a unique benefit to the consumer through the nutrient additions.' The brands are, typically, aimed at young adults claiming to give them renewed vigour and energy, help them to focus or revive them after a late night, for example. Ms Dachner said the ingredients of such drinks do not 'address existing nutrient inadequacies in the population'. The report said: 'Labels 'highlighted nutritional attributes such as immune support and antioxidant properties, and some made claims related to specific nutrients. It added: 'In addition, nutrients were often juxtaposed with messages related to performance and emotional well-being, benefits that go beyond conventional nutritional science.' And 'young adults - the likely target group for these products - are already consuming enough of these nutrients to meet their needs.' The researchers said measures were needed to 'ensure that consumers of [such] beverages are not misled or exposed to unnecessarily high nutrient loads with no potential benefit.'","Many of the benefits being claimed have no science behind them either .

"For thousands of years, phallic objects have been used symbolically as a means to boost fertility and ward off evil spirits - but their use as sexual aids has a long history, too. A 28,000-year-old phallus found in Germany recently, for example, is quoted as being the oldest known 'sex toy' ever found. While phalluses made from stone, wood, leather and even camel dung have all be found during excavations, or referenced throughout historical text and images. To celebrate this expansive history of sexual experience, the Wellcome Collection currently has a number of ceremonial sculptures shaped - among other sexual artefacts - as part of its Institute of Sexology exhibition. A 7.8-inch (20cm) long, 1.1-inch (3cm) wide stone object (pictured) was found in the Hohle Fels Cave near Ulm in the Swabian Jura. The prehistoric ‘tool’ is made from 14 fragments of siltstone and dates back 28,000 years. Due to its size, experts believe it may be the earliest example of a sex aid ever found . The term dildo was first coined in around 1400 AD and originated from the Latin for ‘dilatare’, which means ‘open wide’, and the Italian for delight, which translates as ‘diletto.’ In the Middle East, historical reports reference Egyptians and the Greek using unripe bananas, or camel dung coated in resin as sexual aids. But the aids were used much earlier, as far back as 500BC, when phalluses were carved out of stone, leather or wood. Some were even made from tar. Phallic sculptures weren’t just used for sexual pleasure. In some pagan cultures, a female orgasm was seen as an offering to the gods of fertility, while the phallic symbol was popular during ancient Roman times. In particular, statues of fertility god Priapus with a large phallus would be used to protect gardens and help crops grow. In Greek mythology, Priapus was depicted with oversized, permanent erection, which is where the name for the medical term priapism originated. Priapism is a persistent and often painful erection that lasts for several hours - in rare case, for weeks. A solid bronze amulet, in the form of Priapus, is among the artefacts displayed at the Wellcome Collection. Phallic charms of the time were known as fascinum, and were even found in the ruins of Pompeii, and it was believed that the symbols could ward off evil spirits. Meanwhile, the phallic deity Mutunus Tutunus was a symbol of marital sex. In Turkey, during the 6th century BC, ancient Anatolians used sculptures of sex organs to ward off evil and ill luck as they believed they contained special powers. In ancient Greece, in particular, reports claim traders in the city of Miletus made and sold objects called ‘olisbos’, intended to help wives achieve sexual penetration while their husbands were away. The aids were also used in Renaissance Italy, and were typically made of leather and used with olive oil for lubrication. High class members of society would even display their sex toys, often made from silver, gold and ivory. However, they were said to be painful to use and their popularity waned. The first dildos didn’t arrive in the UK until the 1500s. Honor Beddard, co-curator at the Wellcome Collection said: ‘The Institute of Sexology presents the study of sex in all its complexity and contradiction. ‘It brings together the diverse collections of data, art, testimony and objects of those who challenged preconceived ideas about sex and tells the human stories behind the charting of sexual experience. ‘Highlighting the profound effect that gathering and analysing information can have in changing attitudes about the human condition, the exhibition reveals our understanding of sexual identity as an ever-evolving story.’ The exhibition features rare archival material, erotica, film, photography, medical artefacts and ethnography, all related to sex. In 2005, a 7.8-inch (20cm) long, 1.1-inch (3cm) wide stone object was found in the Hohle Fels Cave near Ulm in the Swabian Jura. The prehistoric ‘tool’ is made from 14 fragments of siltstone and dates back 28,000 years. Due to its size, experts believe it may be the earliest example of a sex aid ever found, but could have also been used for knapping flints to help light fires, said Professor Nicholas Conard, from the department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, at Tübingen University. During excavations at Neolithic site Membury Rings in Dorset in the early 20th century, archaeologists found various deposits of artefacts and other material, including antler, animal and human bone, flints and carved chalk.

But this has been disputed as myth . In Turkey, during the 6th century BC, ancient Anatolians used sculptures of sex organs to ward off evil and ill luck as they believed they contained special powers. Much later, in 18th century France, the first vibrator called Tremoussoir was built. It was a handheld, wind-up contraption designed by physicians. In 1869, an American physician George Taylor is credited as creating a steam-powered version called the Manipulator, before an electromechanical vibrator was developed in 1880 by Dr Joseph Granville. Far from being sexual aids, these devices were said to have been used to treat female hysteria. Reports claim that doctors as far back as the 13th century doubted that women had libidos and advised using sex toys to alleviate sexual frustration. Physicians during the 20th century would then use vibrators for clitoral stimulation to treat this so-called hysteria, which comes from the Greek word for uterus. Symptoms for hysteria included anxiety, sleeplessness, irritability and erotic fantasies. One such vibrator, called Veedee, is on display at the Wellcome Collection, but a spokesman told MailOnline that its use as a Victorian tool by doctors to induce orgasms has been disputed as myth. The first rubber dildos have been traced back to around 1850 and they started appearing in movies during the 1930s and 1940s. At this point, many were called marital aids, rather than sexual aids. ‘At the turn of the century, the vibrator kind of split into two product lines,’ explained technology historian Rachel Maines. ‘One was for doctors and one was for consumers and doctors really hated the idea that there were consumer vibrators out there. ‘There were these relatively inexpensive, some that looked like an egg beater for people who didn't have electricity. And there were battery powered ones. ‘There were even water-powered ones that you could attach to your sink!’ A solid bronze amulet, in the form of Priapus, is among the artefacts displayed at the Wellcome Collection .

"A black Labrador named Eclipse is so eager to get to the dog park she often catches the bus - on her own. If the two-year-old's owner Jeff Young takes too long finishing his cigarette, and their bus arrives, Eclipse climbs aboard solo and rides to her stop. The trick delights her fellow Seattle bus passengers. Radio host Miles Montgomery was amazed to see the pooch get off the bus at the dog park alone last week, and began looking into it. Scroll down for video . Morning commute: Eclipse, middle, rides the bus from her Seattle home to a dog park nearby if her owner Jeff Young takes too long to finish his cigarette and board with her . Mr Montgomery told Komo News : 'It doesn't really appear to have an owner. 'The dog gets off at the dog park. I just look out the window and I'm like, 'did that just happen?'' 'She was most concerned about seeing out the window, and I couldn't figure out what that was. It was really just about seeing where her stop was.' Mr Young said if Eclipse gets on the bus without him, he catches up with her at the dog park which is three or four strops away. He said: 'It's not hard to get on. She gets on in front of her house and she gets off at the dog park, three or four stops later.' Mr Young said the tradition has been going on for a while. 'She's been here the last two years, so she's been urbanized, totally. She's a bus-riding, sidewalk-walking dog,' he said.

"A former head of MI5 last night warned the revelations by CIA fugitive Edward Snowden had left Britain at risk of ‘vigilantism’ because it was less able to protect itself from Islamist fanaticism. Breaking his silence on the devastating impact of the security breach, Jonathan Evans said: ‘The result of this can only be that the overall risk of a successful terrorist attack in this country has risen.’ In a chilling intervention, he also warned that events in Syria and Iraq had given jihadis a ‘jolt of energy’ and the Government must complete the ‘unfinished business’ of giving the security services extra surveillance powers – or risk ‘vigilantism’ on the streets as citizens look to protect themselves. Former MI5 spy chief Jonathan Evans, pictured, warned that a lack of security will lead to vigilantism . Lord Evans said: ‘Inadequate security will breed vulnerability and fear and that in turn will tend to limit people’s ability to contribute to civil society, will tend to provoke vigilantism and will tend to diminish people’s ability to exercise the very civil liberties and human rights that we wish to sustain.’ The ex-spy chief’s comments came amid a warning from the EU’s security chief that Europe faces its ‘most serious’ threat since 9/11. Rob Wainwright, the head of Europol, revealed there were between 3,000 and 5,000 EU nationals who posed a terrorist threat after travelling overseas to countries such as Syria. He told MPs: ‘Clearly, we’re dealing with a large body of mainly young men who have the potential to come back and have the potential or the intent and capability to carry out attacks we have seen in Paris.’ Lord Evans, who stood down as head of MI5 in April 2013, used his maiden speech in the House of Lords last night to deliver a devastating analysis of the harm caused by Snowden, who stole and leaked thousands of documents detailing intelligence-gathering techniques used by Western intelligence agencies. The revelations, printed in The Guardian, have led to terrorists changing the way they communicate. They have also made internet companies less willing to co-operate with MI5 and GCHQ for fear of upsetting privacy campaigners. Lord Evans, who sits as an independent crossbench peer, said: ‘When I left MI5 in 2013, I felt cautiously optimistic that we were over the worst as far as Al Qaeda and Islamist terrorist attacks were concerned. ‘It seemed to me that we were making significant progress. Regrettably, subsequent events have proved that judgment to be wrong. ‘The atrocious killing of Fusilier Rigby in May 2013 demonstrated the reality of the threat we face in this country and the brutal murders in Paris last week demonstrate that this is a European and international problem, not one we face alone. Lord Evans said Edward Snowden's revelations allowed terrorists to avoid detection by the security services . ‘The revelations made by Edward Snowden . . . have clearly led a reduction in the ability of the security agencies both here and overseas to access and read the communications of terrorists internationally, with the result that as the threat from terrorism has gone up in the last two years, the ability of the security agencies to counter those threats has gone down.’ Lord Evans also warned the current situation of extremists returning to the UK from Syria – 600 have travelled out, according to MI5 – put him in mind of the Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan before 9/11. He said: ‘On their return, many of them were even more radical than they had been when they departed. ‘They had experience of combat and had been trained in violence and they had an international network of support on which they could draw. Those circumstances led to a series of attacks internationally and over a long period, and I fear we may be facing the same situation.’ Mr Wainwright said the terror threat was the ‘most serious’ the continent had faced since the fall of the Twin Towers more than 13 years ago. He told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that Europol had been building a database of EU citizens who had travelled overseas to fight. So far it has collected 2,500 names of suspects from security agencies across member states – but he believes as many as 5,000 may have gone abroad. It came amid a continued row at the top of Government over surveillance powers. On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron said a future Conservative government would pass laws which aim to deny terrorists a ‘safe space’ to communicate online. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg reiterated his party’s opposition to a ‘snoopers’ charter’, saying Britain will not be kept safer by keeping records on grandmothers visiting ‘garden centre websites’.","Former MI5 head Jonathan Evans said Edward Snowden damaged security .

"A 28-stone binge-eater who spent more than £20,000 on takeaways when she couldn't afford to pay her mortgage has lost more than 15 stone after her home was repossessed. Amanda Ford, from Coalville, Leicestershire, who ballooned to a size 32, would chomp her way through packets of biscuits, stodgy cheese sandwiches and multi-size bags of crisps until she fell asleep. Unable to stop herself from eating, she consumed as much as she physically could until she dropped off, only to start again a few hours later when she woke in the middle of the night. Before, left: At her heaviest, Amanada ballooned to a size 32 and weighed a staggering 28st; After, right: Amanda lost 15st and now weighs 12st 7lbs and is a trim size 14 . Former binge eater Amanda Ford with husband Jim Lord, 65, who supported her through her weight loss . Amanda, 50, who is now a slim 12st 7lbs and a size 14, admits she was 'eating myself to death', forking out £100 on takeaways 'which could go towards my mortgage payments'. But it wasn't until Amanda met her third husband - and her home was repossessed after she failed to pay the mortgage that she realised the extent of her eating problem. She said:‘I had no switch-off button. I would eat and eat like a woman possessed. I’d be halfway through a sandwich or a box of chocolates when I fell asleep. ‘And if that wasn’t bad enough, I’d wake up a couple of hours later and carry on until I was physically sick.' She continued: ‘I look back now and I’m absolutely disgusted. I was worse than an animal.’ But Amanda wasn’t always overweight . As a young girl she was very slim and through her teenage years hovered around a size 12 to 14. It was only after Amanda had her son, Jody, now 31, that she began to struggle with her weight. Amanada (pictured left at her wedding in 2010 and, right, looking trim today) would chomp her way through packets of biscuits, stodgy cheese sandwiches and multi-size bags of crisps until she fell asleep . She recalls: ‘After he was born, I went up to 16 stone and was a size 20. I absolutely hated it.’ Determined to shed the extra baby pounds she contacted a local slimming company, Weightcare, and lost 7lbs, through healthy eating. ‘I felt wonderful,’ says Amanda. ‘And for years stayed at the same weight.’ But after she married her first husband in the late 1990s, her old bad habits resurfaced. She said: ‘It wasn’t a happy marriage. I soon realised I wasn’t in love and turned to food for comfort. I’d treat myself to chocolates, packets of biscuits and crisps, to cheer myself up. ‘We’d have a takeaway most nights for tea. It could be anything from pizza, a curry or a Chinese. Before I knew it, I was a size 20 again. ‘And once we split up my unhealthy eating carried on. I just felt so low and the only thing that made me feel better was food.’ Amanda (pictured on her wedding day) to her now-husband Jim Lord . Amanda remarried in 2001 and initially dropped down to just over 11st. She said: ‘I was keen to impress and my husband was very thin. He could eat what he wanted and never put on any weight.’ But it wasn’t long before the weight started to pile on again. Amanda said: ‘The marriage only lasted two years. 'I suspected he was playing away and I turned to my old friend - food - for comfort again. ‘Before we split up, I would stash food in the bedroom. It was mainly chocolate and biscuits, and I would go up there and gorge on it while my husband was downstairs. 'I’d just eat and eat until I was physically sick. ‘By the time I actually left him, I was a size 22 and 18 stone. My self-esteem and confidence was at an all-time low. ‘I couldn’t bear the thought of going out, so would just stay in and eat all evening.’ It was only after Amanda (above) had her son, Jody, now 31, that she began to struggle with her weight . Amanda’s life spiralled downwards even further when she couldn’t keep up with the high-interest mortgage payments on her new home. She said: ‘My outgoings became more than my incomings and I couldn’t see a way forward. I reached rock bottom. 'I’d never felt as low in my life. I’d gone through two divorces and my house was about to be repossessed. I’d never felt as depressed in my whole life. ‘And just like I always had when I was low I looked to food for comfort.’ But Amanda’s eating habits became more extreme as she was unable to mentally stop herself from binge-eating through the night. She recalls: ‘I’d get home from work and the first thing I’d do was order a takeaway. Within half an hour of finishing it, I would start on stodgy cheese sandwiches, super-size bags of crisps and giant-sized chocolate bars. ‘I would then literally eat non-stop until I fell asleep. My stomach would be throbbing I was so full and I’d often be sick, but even that didn’t stop me.' Amanda (pictured above left and right) says: ‘I’m now 12st 7lbs and feel wonderful. I can go into any high street store and buy whatever clothes I want and don’t feel embarrassed by the rolls of fat I was once hiding' She continued: ‘I would fall sleep surrounded by food. Then I’d wake up at 3am most nights. I called it my ""witching hour"" – it’s when I would start eating again. I would literally much through anything I could get my hands on, but it was generally more goodies. ‘I’d drop back off about 5am. By the time I got up for work, my stomach felt like lead. I felt so ill I wouldn’t be able to eat all day – but the cycle would carry on when I got home of an evening.’ Amanda’s compulsive overeating carried on for two years. She said: ‘Logically I knew I was doing myself so much harm, but I just couldn’t break the cycle. My mood was very low and I couldn’t see a way out. ‘I was also aware that I was spending up to £100 a week on takeaways which could go towards my mortgage payments, that works out at £20,000 over four years, but not even that was enough to stop me almost eating myself to death. ‘I ballooned to a size 32 and weighed a staggering 28 stone. I could only wear skirts and trousers with elasticated waists and baggy tops. It was utterly soul destroying.’ In January 2010, Amanda finally lost her home after the bank repossessed it and with even more mounting debts, she declared herself bankrupt. Amanda won Weightcare's 'slimmer of the year' ‘You can’t get much lower,’ she says. ‘I’d all but given up on life.’ But a few months later, Amanda met her husband, Jim Lord, 65. She recalls: ‘He is such a caring man and accepted me for who I was. He didn’t care how big I was or what I ate – he simply loved me. ‘So after we moved in together, I carried on eating ridiculously and squirrelling food up to the bedroom to eat in secret. 'I know Jim wouldn’t have been bothered by what I ate, but I was embarrassed and didn’t want him to see how addicted to food I really was. ‘But after two years, I was at breaking point again. One night Jim came home and I burst into tears, I was so unhappy by my eating. I just cried and cried for hours. ‘Jim did his best to comfort me, but I knew I had to do something before I ended up with huge medical problems. ‘It was like a light switch had suddenly been turned on in my mind. ‘The following day, I contacted Weightcare again, who I’d lost weight with in the past. The owner Elaine came out to see me straight away. When she weighed me I was 27 stone 12lbs – three times what I’d once been.’ Immediately Amanda gave up takeaways, chocolates, crisps, biscuits and her ultimate guilty pleasure – stodgy butter-laden cheese sandwiches. She says: ‘For the first time in years, I actually had three square healthy meals. I’d have eggs for breakfast, salad for lunch and chicken and vegetables for dinner. ‘At the end of the first week, I’d lost 8lbs and after a month I had shed 18lbs. ‘It felt wonderful. I stopped suffering from stomach cramps and my energy levels increased, as did my self-esteem. I stopped feeling so depressed and sorry for myself and actually looked forward to the day ahead. ‘Jim was wonderfully supportive, encouraging me every step of the way. He’d eat what I ate just to help me.’ In just two years Amanda lost an incredible 15st 7lbs, dropping from a size 32 to a trim size 14. She says: ‘I’m now 12st 7lbs and feel wonderful. I can go into any high street store and buy whatever clothes I want and don’t feel embarrassed by the rolls of fat I was once hiding under baggy clothes. ‘I feel repulsed now when I think about what I used to eat – it was absolutely disgusting. I literally ate like a pig! ‘But now as I pull on my skinny jeans and tight fitting top it’s just the inspiration I need never to binge eat ever again.’","Amanda Ford, from Coalville, Leicestershire, 50,  is now a slim 12st 7lbs .

"A new YouTube video that takes a light-hearted look at Australia is fast becoming an online sensation and could turn out to be the unofficial national anthem over the summer. From backyard cricket with wheelie bins to a gyrating Peter Garrett of Midnight Oil, the video has a bit of everything. Even former Prime Minister John Howard and The Wiggles make an appearance. Terry Mann aka Coach Bombay put together the song and video package called ‘Straya!’ which is a cover of Outkast’s number one 2003 hit ‘Hey Ya!’ with appropriate images and lyrics. Scroll down for video . Summer madness: A scene from the video ‘Straya!’ leaves nothing to the imagination . Chop gun: Barbecues in the backyard are just part of the clips in the video . It's hoped that the song will be used to celebrate Australia Day on January 26 . The original idea came from a friend of Mr Mann’s, Calvin Teoh, who posted on Facebook last Australia Day: ‘Sing ‘Hey Ya’’ but replace the lyrics with ‘STRAY. YA.’ Then another friend commented: ‘Get @Terry Mann onto it’. ‘From there I went away and wrote the new lyrics, recorded it and made the video – ready for the next Australia Day. So it was definitely a team effort,’ Mr Mann explained. ‘I don’t think any other song could possibly work as well though. It hinges on that basic play on words. ‘When I started writing the lyrics, I knew that it could easily get carried away with too much negatively and political commentary. ‘And although that opens it up for more satire and ultimately humour, I wanted the overarching feeling and message to be positive.’ Terry Mann aka Coach Bombay from Melbourne put together the song and video package . Backyard cricket with wheelie bins was another must for the new YouTube video . A video about the joys of Australia wouldn't be the same without a shot of a surfer out on the ocean . The 27-year old is from Melbourne and Coach Bombay is the artist name he uses for performing his electropop music. He said that he didn’t usually make parody videos and that his stage name is a character from the 90s film franchise The Mighty Ducks. ‘I’ve been making music all my life, and releasing my own songs since 2009. Video editing and musical mashups have always been a hobbies of mine on the side. Every now and then, all these interests combine into something like this - as long as the idea is right,’ he explained. Mr Mann admitted there were a lot of topics to cover in the video, but one clip that he felt had to go in was of former Prime Minister Howard’s infamous hand shake with Mark Latham on the eve of the 2004 Federal Election. Beers and barbecues are what it's all about and the new video champions both . ‘I really wanted to put John Howard’s cricket-bowling fail in as well, but that would have been a bit too much Johnny,’ he said. He was also tempted to have a whole section dedicated to Garrett ‘shaking it’, but it would have meant ‘missing out on The Chooky Dancers, The Wiggles, Kylie and AC/DC’. Mr Mann also thought it would be nice to replace the hashtag ‘#straya’ for a while and use it for something that’s ‘ultimately positive and celebratory’. His hope is that the ‘Strayla!’ video will be the perfect anthem for Australia day on January 26. No video celebrating Australia would be complete without the Sydney Harbour Bridge . ‘I'm hoping that people use it as a form of celebration, especially around the 'Australia Day' period,’ he said. ‘Whether that's to play the song at parties and BBQs, sing a long, do their own versions etc. The term ‘straya’ has been kicking around for a few years now, and it would be great to use it in a more positive sense this Australia Day. ‘Music is my passion, and I'm always trying new things and starting new projects. I don't know where any of them will take me, but it's always fun just to be making music.’","The YouTube video takes a light-hearted look at iconic Australian people and places .

"Facebook has confirmed it is placing clickable warnings over extreme 'graphic' content on its site. The warnings, which are placed over flagged images and videos, state that the content might 'shock offend and upset'. The move comes after the Californian social media site came under fire for failing to impose greater controls on disturbing images. Facebook has confirmed it is placing warnings over extreme 'graphic' content on its site.The warnings, which are placed over flagged images and videos, state that the content might 'shock offend and upset' The warning asks the user 'are you sure you want to see this?'. Content with the warning will not be seen by users under 18 and videos will also not autoplay like other newsfeed items. Videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of French policeman, Ahmed Merabet, who was shot in Paris during the Charlie Hebdo attacks. 'A photo or video containing graphic content may appear with a warning to let people know about the content before they view it, and may only be visible to people older than 18,' Facebook said. Facebook has confirmed the scheme has been rolled out on its site since December. 'When people share things on Facebook, we expect that they will share it responsibly, including choosing who will see that content,' a spokeswoman told the BBC. Videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of French policeman Ahmed Merabet, who was shot in Paris during the Charlie Hebdo attacks . 'We also ask that people warn their audience about what they are about to see if it includes graphic violence.' As well as changes to graphic content warnings, Facebook said today said it will begin firing off police-sanctioned 'Amber Alerts' to members of the leading social network to help locate children who have been abducted or gone missing. Alerts including pictures and details about missing children and their possible abductors will appear in news feeds of Facebook members in areas where those being sought might be found, according to the social network's trust and safety manager Emily Vacher. Facebook members sharing the news will be able to link to relevant information at the website of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which issues Amber Alerts at the behest of police . The Amber Alert warning system was started after the 1996 kidnapping and murder of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman in Arlington, Texas. Since then, more than 700 children have been found as a direct result of the alerts. The alerts are issued over TV and radio, on highway signs, as text messages and over the Internet. But one psychologist said the current measure did not go far enough to protect young people. Dr Arthur Cassidy, who runs a branch of the Yellow Ribbon Program suicide-prevention charity, is calling for an outright ban on graphic clips. He told the BBC that many children used the service and they could work around the new restrictions. Currently, Facebook only allows children 13 years or older to be members. However, many can get around this rule by giving false details. It is unclear whether changes will be made to the warnings, and Facebook did not immediately respond to the Dailymail.com. The site has long faced criticism for what has been described as an 'overly complex' response to disturbing content. Its policy states it would ban any content 'shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence'. In 2013, it placed warnings over clips of beheadings, but the scheme was not rolled out across the entire site. The measure was later reversed. Later that year, the group bowed to pressure from child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in Mexico. They had accused Facebook of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents. Critics accused the firm of 'taking leave of its senses'. Facebook said at the time that while the images must not be posted for 'sadistic pleasure' they should be available for those who wish to condemn them. Currently, Facebook only allows children 13 years or older to be members, but many can get around this rule .","New warnings are placed over flagged Facebook images and videos .

"Yale Howarth, 15, was found dead hours after he was questioned by teachers about a sexual encounter with a teenage girl . A 15-year-old schoolboy hanged himself after teachers questioned him over a sexual encounter with a girl and he feared he may be sent to prison, an inquest has heard. Yale Howarth was found in the garage at his home in Chirk, Wrexham, in January last year. He was taken to hospital but died the following day. An inquest into the teenager's death heard how Yale was quizzed by teachers at Ysgol Dinas Bran in Llangollen, Denbighshire, after a girl asked a member of school staff for the morning after pill. During the interview Yale, who was regarded as an intelligent, gifted and polite pupil, said that he and the girl had drunk alcohol at a party and that some sexual foreplay had occurred with the girl’s consent, but they had not had sex. After the interview, assistant head Dafydd Morris, who was also head of child protection, allegedly told school nurse Sian Hughes they should 'let him sweat on it', the inquest heard, although the teacher  denied making this comment. The hearing at Ruthin Coroner's Court was told Yale had expressed fears that he could be sent to prison over the incident. John Gittins, senior coroner for North Wales East and Central recorded a narrative conclusion on Yale's death, and said he may not have intended to kill himself. The inquest heard that the girl in question had been drinking, and did not know if she had had sex. The matter was referred to Wrexham social services, and social worker Paula Moran said she advised Ms Hughes that Yale be interviewed - unaware the girl had accepted his version of events and they had not had sex. Miss Moran, who broke down in tears as she gave evidence at the inquest, said the girl had made no complaint and it was clear that Yale was not a perpetrator. The inquest was told   it was unlikely that any further action would have been taken, a view confirmed the following day by Miss Moran's team manager. 'What happened was clearly two teenagers drunk and doing what teenagers do in a consensual way,' she said. Yale had been quizzed by teachers at Ysgol Dinas Bran in Llangollen, Denbighshire, (pictured) after a girl had asked a member of school staff for the morning after pill, the inquest into his death heard . Miss Moran denied advising Mr Morris that Yale’s parents should not be contacted. Members of staff who spoke to fellow-pupils in the days following Yale’s death said he had expressed concern that he could be sent to prison. Teaching assistant Phillipa Mathews told the hearing that one girl claimed Yale had received the prison warning from 'teachers', so she reported it to the school's then head, Alison Duffy. Andrew Wallis, Yale’s head of year, said the teenager would probably have been aware of an earlier unrelated but recent sex case involving a girl, which had resulted in the offenders being sent to prison. Assitant learning manager Sally Martin, said that immediately after Yale had been questioned Sian Hughes told her: 'Daf [Mr Morris] said let him sweat on it.' Mr Morris denied having made the comment, adding: 'I would never have said anything like that.' After Yale's death, his father Mark Howarth lodged a formal complaint, saying that he and Yale's mother Della were not told of the incident, and if they had been they would have been able to support their son. The coroner read statements from officials of Wrexham and Denbighshire councils detailing the changes in procedures introduced following an investigation into the tragedy. In his conclusion, Mr Gittins outlined the events leading up to Yale’s death on January 23, and said the boy was probably embarrassed by the matter and shocked and scared by the possible consequences. Yale's family have called for schools across the UK to review their procedures as sensitive pupil issues are dealt with . Although Yale did not appear to be distressed when he got home he went to the garage and hanged himself. 'Although there is insufficient evidence to be certain of his intention to end his life at that time the effect of his actions resulted in his death,' he said. Mr Gittins paid a glowing tribute to the teenager who, he said, would be missed by his family, friends, fellow pupils and staff. The coroner invited the legal representatives of the family, Denbighshire and Wrexham local authorities and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to submit their views on a possible Regulation 28 letter aimed at preventing future deaths. In particular, he said, he would like to know what steps had been taken at the school to provide more support for pupils placed in the same situation as Yale. Yale's family today called for schools across the UK to review their procedures as sensitive pupil issues are dealt with. They have asked specialist law firm Irwin Mitchell to investigate the events leading up to his death and together lawyers and Yale's parents have urged schools across the country to take note of the tragic incident. Mr Howarth said: 'We are absolutely devastated by Yale's death and think about him every day. 'It breaks our heart to think that one simple phone call from the school could have potentially saved his life by making us aware of what he was going through. 'I hope that all schools take note of what happened in this situation and ensure that they give their pupils better protection and support than we believe was afforded to Yale. 'The way our son was treated seems so heavy handed. We should have been made aware of the situation so that we had some warning of Yale's state of mind on that day - at the very least we would have been able to check up on him.' Katie Carroll, an expert lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the family said: 'The family are grateful to the coroner for examining the evidence and we are investigating the events further to help determine if more could have been done to prevent this tragedy. It is crucial that lessons are learned from this to ensure that school children, who are clearly vulnerable and impressionable, are properly supported so as to eliminate the risk of similar incidents in the future.'","Yale Howarth, 15, found dead in the garage of his home in north Wales .

"For the four Utah men profiled on controversial new TLC reality series 'My Husband's Not Gay', it's possible - if not common - to remain married to a woman despite having sexual feelings for other men. But a new study has found that relationships involving gay Mormons are two to three times more likely to end in divorce than others. Researchers surveyed 1,612 LGBT/same-sex attracted members and former members of the Latter Day Saints Church and found that between 51 percent and 69 percent of mixed-orientation marriages end in divorce. By comparison, only 25 percent of LDS couples that both identify as heterosexual end in divorce, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Scroll down for video... Controversial: A new study has found that Mormon marriages involving a man who is attracted to other men are two to three times more likely to end in divorce than others. Here, Preston and Megan Dahlgren, one of the couple's profiled in My Husband's Not gay, hold their daughter Naomi . Co-stars: Jeff Bennion and his wife Tanya kiss in front of their home near Salt Lake City during filming of My Husband's Not Gay. The concept of the show has come under fire since it was announced by the TLC network . The study was spearheaded by John Dehlin, a doctoral student at Utah State University, and Bill Bradshaw, a retired Brigham Young University professor, with help from Renee Galliher, also of USU. It also found that 70 percent of people who experience SSA - same sex attraction - which the church prefers to gay as a label, would go on to leave the LDS, while 80 percent admitted to undergoing some kind of therapy to change their sexual orientation. The people who participated in the survey were spread across 48 states, but 45 percent were from Utah, as well as 22 countries. Some 75 percent were male and 22 percent were female. Around 7 percent were excommunication from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 25 percent had resigned, 36 percent were inactive, 29 percent were active, and 3 percent had been disfellowshipped. Kendall Wilcox, the creator of Far Between, a documentary about LGBT Mormons, said the data stacked up. He also noted the willingness of such Mormons to come forward, because 'they want their story to be known and not repeated; they want vindication for their mistreatment'. The release of the study coincides with the debut of 'My Husband's Not Gay', which has the support of Mormon leaders but was slammed as irresponsible and dangerous by gay rights advocacy groups. 'While the church does not promote marriage as a treatment method for same-sex attraction, couples who are trying to be lovingly supportive of each other while being true to their religious convictions deserve our support and respect,' said church spokesman Eric Hawkins. The gay rights group GLAAD, however, says the show sends the wrong message and is a sad reminder of so-called gay conversion therapy, often faith-based efforts designed to change sexual orientation that can be emotionally scarring. New Jersey and California in 2013 banned therapists from practicing gay conversion therapy on children and teenagers. The American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association do not support the therapy. As pro-gay groups like GLAAD vent outrage over the show's premise, the LDS Church has spoken out in support of the unlikely TV stars . 'No one can change who they love, and, more importantly, no one should have to,' GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. 'By investing in this dangerous programming, TLC is putting countless young LGBT people in harm's way.' The organization pointed to a change.org petition asking TLC to cancel the show that so far has gathered more than 80,000 signatures. Responding to GLAAD, the network says it will tell compelling stories about different ways of life, and the four men on the hourlong show speak only for themselves. Jeff Bennion, 44, met his wife, Tanya, more than 13 years ago after he had dated men. He told her he was attracted to men after they'd been dating for about a year and a half. 'I was devastated because I didn't know what that meant for me,' said Tanya Bennion, 42. She worried that he'd cheat on her with a friend but said the couple's strong connection helped her work through her questions. Megan Dahlgren says her marriage remains strong, including the physical aspects of their relationship.  'We do have a happy, healthy sex life,' she said. Dahlgren and Bennion both said their upbringing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband-and-wife relationship. 'I would say it was part of my decision early on, especially, and a big influencer of that,' Dahlgren said. 'It certainly helped guide me toward where I'm at today, no doubt about it.' Preston Dahlgren and Jeff Bennion both said their upbringing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband-and-wife relationship . 'My Husband's Not Gay' is not the only show about people from Utah in unusual marriages. TLC also airs the shows 'Sister Wives' and 'My Five Wives' about polygamous unions . Jeff Bennion said he would be horrified if a parent told a gay child that they should be more like one of the men on the show. 'That's not anything that I would support or agree with,' he said. But Bennion said that he's happy with his wife and their 6-year-old son. 'I can't believe how lucky I am,' he said.","Researchers surveyed 1,612 LGBT/same-sex attracted members and former members of the Latter Day Saints Church .

"Judges in India's Supreme Court have demanded answers after children died during a controversial cervical cancer vaccine trial. Young tribal girls received shots of pharmaceutical company Merck's Gardasil vaccine and Cervarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccines are given to girls as young as nine in many countries - including the UK and the US - to protect against the human papilloma virus, one of the major causes of cervical cancer. But the Indian court yesterday heard a challenge by campaigners who claim the study - funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - failed to obtain the informed consent of the children or their parents. They say that a 'study' carried out for the foundation by a US organisation was in fact an illegal drugs trial. Unaware: Aman Dhawan (pictured), 16, is one of many youngsters  who took part in the trial without being aware they had been signed up to test  Merck's new Gardasil 9 drug, aimed at preventing cervical cancer . 'Guinea pig': Sana Ansari, 19, her brother Mazhar and sister  Asiya were all enrolled in the trial of  Gardasil 9 drug - but she and her family say  she had no idea she was testing the drug . The petitioners have also asked judges to look into the way trials were conducted into Merck's new cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil 9. A MailOnline investigation published earlier this month uncovered claims that children as young as nine suffered side-effects after being used as unwitting human guinea pigs for the new drug. Gardasil 9, which is expected to be worth £1.2 billion a year in sales, has already been approved for use in the US and could be available in the UK later in the year. At a hearing of India's Supreme Court in Delhi yesterday judges expressed frustration that the country's government had failed to provide answers to what had happened during the earlier trials of the original Gardasil and Cervarix. They gave the government a month to explain what action had been taken to investigate and what efforts had been made to obtain the consent of those taking part in the trials. They wanted to know whether there had been any follow-up or monitoring of the girls to see whether they had suffered adverse health consequences. And the judges also ordered the government to produce an opinion on the issue of liability and compensation. Side effects: Aman Dhawan, 16, from Indore, lost weight and strength after being enrolled in the Gardasil 9 trial, which he didn't know he had signed up for either . Lawyers for the campaigners who brought the case said they were pleased with the fact that, for the first time, liability and compensation for the victims had come up in court. 'It is a very encouraging development that the judges are now discussing accountability and not just accountability but also compensation, so the tone of the hearing today was very positive for us because it's clear from all the parties, including from government reports, that there were, at best, serious irregularities and, at worst, gross violations of fundamental human rights,' said Kerry McBroom, one of the lawyers. An investigation by an Indian parliamentary committee had previously concluded that the trials amounted to a serious breach of trust and medical ethics amounting to child abuse and 'a clear cut violation of the human rights of these girl children and adolescents'. The committee's report said it had been established that clinical trials of the vaccines had been carried out 'under the pretext of an observation/demonstration project' in violation of all laws and regulations laid down by the government for such trials. The group accused of carrying out the trial under the 'pretext' of carrying out an academic study - PATH - said it 'strongly disagreed with the findings, conclusions, and tone of the released report and its disregard of the evidence and facts.' Injected: Mazhar Ansari (pictured), 18, who was enrolled in a trial of Merck's new Gardasil 9 drug . Revealed: Whistleblower Dr Anand Rai (pictured), 37, lifted the lid on the scandal of illegal drugs trials in the city and now has been given an armed guard to protect him . In court yesterday a bench of judges headed by Justice Dipak Misra criticised the Indian government for failing to act on the committee's report. 'It should be the concern of [the government] that health of people is preserved,' they said. 'Don't leave the matter to court. It is for the government to find out a way. 'If parliamentary committee has done something then it is obligatory for the executive government to take action on this report. 'File affidavit stating protocol to be followed by getting consent of people to undergo trial and the process to find out what is the effect of vaccination and whose liability is it to pay compensation.' Merck and GSK have both been ordered to respond to the allegations made by campaigners. Yesterday's hearing was told that Merck had provided a six volume document amounting to around 2,000 pages of evidence - but that GSK had so far failed to respond. Gardasil is now given to girls aged 12 and 13 as a vaccination against HPV, a sexually transmitted virus which causes most cases of cervical cancer . Both companies have denied any wrongdoing. In court yesterday the judges also heard from lawyers for PATH - the US-based group that organised the 'study' - which emphasised the vaccines were safe and the vaccinations had been carried out in the interests of public health. McBroom said she and her team would be referring to the latest trials of Gardasil 9 in their closing submissions. MailOnline's investigation into Gardasil 9 revealed how several children used in those trials claimed to have suffered problems including weight loss, fatigue, dizziness and menstrual problems. They and their parents maintained that they did not give their informed consent and that that they were not aware that they were taking part in the trial of an untested drug. Among those who took part was 16-year-old Aman Dhawan, who lives in the Pancham Ki Phel slum in the city of Indore. His family say they were told the drug was a new medicine that would prevent a range of diseases, including malaria. But Aman said that after he was given the vaccine he began to see changes in his body and he lost weight and strength. Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women and kills more than 265,000 people every year, most of them in developing countries, according to Cancer Research UK. It is caused by changes to the cells in the cervix - which sits at the neck of the womb. Diagnosed early, it is usually possible to treat - but can mean a woman needs a hysterectomy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. But cervical cancer isn't easy to spot: it often has no symptoms in its early stages, although some women may have bleeding in-between periods, after sex or after the menopause. However, these  symptoms don't definitely point to cervical cancer so women are encouraged to be screened regularly to check for signs of the disease. In England, this takes place from the age of 25 and is commonly known as a 'smear test'. The test shows up any abnormalities in the cells of the cervix. Abnormal tests do not necessarily mean a woman has cervical cancer, as most are caused by infection or treatable pre-cancerous cells, NHS guidance says. Most are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) - a common virus spread through sex. There are many strains of the virus - many of which do not cause cancer. Just two are known to be responsible for 70 per cent of all cervical cancer. To cut the rates of cervial cancer, vaccinations against HPV were introduced in 2008. The vaccinations are now routinely given to 12 and 13-year-old girls. It is hoped it will reduce the incidences of cervical cancer, which caused 920 deaths in 2012, according to the latest figures available.","Tribal girls were given shots of cervical cancer vaccines during trial .

The videos show the foul-mouthed pensioner giving life advice to her granddaughter, sharing drunken tales and stories of her outrageous past. The spunky grandmother, known as Gram, is the star of a series of Youtube videos: Sh** Gram Says . 'Gram has always had a potty mouth, as well as a spunky attitude to accompany it,' Alyssa told MailOnline in an email. 'As the years progressed and we became older, her potty mouth has definitely gotten more vulgar.' In this particular video, posted on her YouTube channel, Gram takes on the topic of drinking and going for a night and is quickly offered a beer after rejecting a drink of Fireball whisky. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-native is 87-years-old and a former cashier, who is now retired . After declaring that she hates beer, Gram takes a shot of whisky with her granddaughter on camera . 'I don't even like beer. I can't stand the smell of it,' she replies, while flipping through a magazine. 'It's worse than horse p***, I think.' However, she quickly adds: 'I like anything that's hot, baby.' Gram, Alyssa's maternal grandmother, lives with her family. She then begins recounting tales of her own days going out on the town in South Philadelphia .

"Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso has stepped down as CEO of the global e-commerce company having already chosen her own replacement. The 30-year-old, whose debut book #GirlBoss is a New York Times best-seller, announced the news to her staff on Monday, naming the online retailer's current president, Sheree Waterson, as her successor. Miss Amoruso told Re/code that she made the decision on her own, noting that she will continue to serve as Nasty Gal's executive chairman and oversee the company's creative and brand marketing teams. Moving on: Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso (L) has stepped down as the company's CEO and has hired the brand's current president Sheree Waterson (R) as her successor . The community college dropout, who turned an eBay shop into a $100 million fashion empire, explained that she wanted the growing company to have a CEO with operational expertise, who would take the company to 'the next level of maturity'. 'I'm not even a parent,' Miss Amoruso joked. 'I hope to someday be the leader that Sheree is.' Perhaps Miss Amoruso will use her new found free time to plan her wedding; she announced her engagement to her longtime partner, whose name is not known, on Instagram in June of last year. The change in leadership comes on the heels of Nasty Gal's most challenging year. Although the online retailer opened its first brick-and-mortar location on Melrose Avenue in 2014, the company's rapid growth has slowed and 10 per cent of the staff were fired last summer. Ms. Waterson, who is now joining the company's board, was hired as president of the brand in late 2013. The former Lululemon chief product officer joined Nasty Gal after the athletic wear company's see-through-pants controversy. Original #GirlBoss: The 30-year-old community college dropout said she will still serve as Nasty Gal's executive chairman and oversee the company's creative and brand marking teams . 'It's been a long time coming, but I'm stoked to announce that I've promoted Sheree Waterson, Nasty Gal's President now for a year, to CEO,' Miss Amoruso wrote Monday on her Instagram account. 'I can't wait to unleash my talents and hang with our customers in new ways and to unleash Sheree's insanely bonkers leadership talent on our team.' She noted: 'This is the kind of partnership dreams are made of. And for the record, I ain't going nowhere.' Nasty Gal board member Danny Rimer said stepping down was really something Miss Amoruso wanted to do. 'She said to me, ""I see that there are two customers of Nasty Gal. The customer that is girl and customer that is employee. I want to focus on the girl.""' He added: 'It shows a level of maturity that she knows what she can do well and what others can do better than her.'","The 30-year-old #GirlBoss author announced the news to her staff on Monday .

"George Osborne today hailed a sharp fall in inflation to its lowest level since May 2000 for helping family incomes go further. The Chancellor said the economic recovery was now being 'widely felt, after a supermarket price war and falling petrol prices meant the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation fell to its lowest point for almost 15 years. With wages now rising faster than bills, ministers hailed the news as a 'giant tax cut for the economy' with family incomes now going further each month. The CPI rate of inflation fell to 0.5 per cent in December, the lowest level since May 2000, according to the Office for National Statistics . The Consumer Prices Index is the measure of the increase in living costs over a year. It takes into account every aspect of daily life, including housing bills, food, transport and recreation. Lower inflation means bills are not rising as quickly, and some areas prices are falling. In addition to food and petrol bills falling, gas and electricity bills barely rose last month unlike last year when the Big Six came under fire for large price hikes. The fall in inflation will ease pressure on household budgets as it boosts real-terms pay as well as pushing further into the future any need to raise interest rates. Mr Osborne said: 'Today we have welcome news that inflation is at its lowest level in modern times, we have family budgets going further, an economic recovery now being widely felt.' But he cautioned: 'We've got to remain vigilant that we have low inflation for the right reasons, this is further proof that our long term economic plan is working.' Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the 'good news' which he said was proof that the government's economic plan was working . The figures will be welcome news for David Cameron and George Osborne, who were seen leaving Downing Street today . Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent was 'good news in the short term for British households'. But acknowledged the dangers that could be posed by it turning negative. He told the BBC that interest rates were still on course to rise over the next couple of years despite the drop in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure to a record low. But he said that any rate hikes would be more gradual and more limited than had been expected a year ago. Mr Carney said: 'By and large these figures are good news in the short term for British households. 'It's largely caused by lower petrol prices and lower food prices. That means your pound is going to stretch farther - lower prices at the pump and in the shops. 'The issue is to make sure that this doesn't become more generalised and that we don't see low and falling prices more generally, because a little bit of inflation is good for the economy, it greases the wheels of the economy.' The fall below 1 per cent means Bank of England governor Mark Carney has to write to Mr Osborne because it is more than a percentage point off the the Bank's 2 per cent target. Bank of England policy-makers have said they expected CPI to fall below 1 per cent and remain there for months to come. It means any rise in interest rates is likely to be delayed, providing a welcome boost to home owners paying off their mortgages. But the sharpness of the decline brings the UK uncomfortably close to the scenario in the eurozone, where there are fears of a damaging deflationary spiral after inflation fell to minus 0.2 per cent. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: 'These figures show that the falling price of oil is working its way into lower prices. 'This acts like a giant tax cut for the economy, putting more money in the pockets of hard pressed consumers.' The Office for National Statistics said that in 2014 food prices fell by 1.9 per cent and prices of motor fuels fell by 10.5 per cent. 'Historically, these prices have been among the main causes of inflation, though this has changed in the last year,' the ONS said. Transport was one of the biggest causes of the fall in inflation, down 0.2 per cent overall between November and December 2014, compared with a rise of 1 per cent between the same two months in 2013. Almost all of the downward contribution came from the falling price of petrol and diesel, the ONS said. Sharp falls in food and transport costs were the biggest drivers in the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent, the ONS said . Latest figures show that wages were up 1.6 per cent in October, well ahead of falling inflation . The average price per litre fell to 116.8p for petrol and 122.9p for diesel, some 24.8p per litre below the peak average prices of in April 2012. Since December, fuel prices have fallen even further, with petrol now selling for under £1 per litre in sum areas. James Sproule, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, said: 'This is good news for the vast majority of businesses and households in the UK. 'Neither the Treasury nor the Bank will be worried by today's figures. In the UK, lower prices driven by a fall in the cost of oil will provide a boost to the economy, and underpin domestic confidence and spending.'","Consumer Prices Index drops to 0.5%, the lowest level since May 2000 .

"A popular YouTube prankster who boasts more than 1.2 million subscribers to his comedy channel has turned his talents for low-budget video making into a booming family business after landing his own reality series. Jack Vale, 41, uprooted his wife, and their five children, from their home Hungtington Beach, California, in order to move them to Las Vegas, after the now-infamous prankster's celebrity status in their local area left him unable to film his normal hidden-camera comedy series without being spotted. 'We knew we had to go somewhere because we were being recognized,' the YouTube star told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Too famous? Jack Vale, 41, revealed to Daily Mail Online that he and his family were forced to think about moving after he began being recognized in his local area . 'You want that fresh feeling when you're uploading content and people were staring to recognize me from seeing my videos, or from being told about previous pranks and it made it difficult to keep coming up with new and exciting ideas.' And in addition to keeping his YouTube content fresh and interesting, Jack admits his family's move to Sin City was also motivated by another factor: his new HLN reality series Jack Vale: Offline. The show documents the family's move from California to Nevada, and follows the Vale clan as they set out to unleash their finest pranks and practical jokes on the people of Las Vegas. 'It's been so exciting to be in a new place, with so many more people there to interact with and work with,' Jack said. 'We've had such a great time working here, the atmosphere is great and it's just an incredible city to be in, especially when you're doing the kind of work that we are.' Family affair: Jack and his family are all involved in the new HLN reality series . Doting wife: Sherry Vale admits that she never expected her husband would make his living as a famous prankster . And despite some initial reservations from his family members, Jack insists both his wife and their children have taken to their new home - and their new role as his reality TV co-stars - with serious energy and enthusiasm. 'We are really spontaneous as a family,' he explained. 'And everyone was so excited at the prospect of starting this new chapter. 'Everyone is involved in the show; my son Jake helps with the camera work, while Chris is a wizard with social media. They all pitch in and have great ideas. 'Our house is filled with laughter and fun.' The comedian added that, while he often dreamed of one day turned his YouTube success into a reality series, he never imagined that it would actually happen. Got you! Just minutes after arriving in Las Vegas, Jack can be seen pranking a newly-married couple . 'We're moving': Jack announces the move to his family in front of the cameras . 'I let myself think about it, I've thought about it my whole life,' he said. 'But I only realized it was an actual possibility a couple of years ago, when people started getting in touch saying that they'd like to pay to feature clips from my videos on their shows and so on. 'That was when I started to think that maybe this dream could become a reality.' While is show is built around practical jokes and pranking, Jack is adamant that the content, which includes everything from dressing as Santa and passing wind in an elevator to prank-calling people on Craigslist, is all completely family-friendly. 'Some people wake up and think about what videos will make other people angry,' he said. 'They create content that they know will offend or upset others. 'That's not what I do. I create stuff that the whole family can watch and enjoy. That's why it has been so great to get my whole family involved - first in YouTube and now in the show.'

"A top children's doctor has been killed while kayaking on a turbulent stretch of river on his day off. Consultant paediatrician Dr Damian Pryor, 52, was paddling down a stretch of rapids yesterday when he began to struggle in fast waters. Emergency services went to River Tawe at Ynyswen, Swansea Valley, after witnesses saw him going underwater. Dr Damian Pryor, a keen canoeist, died after getting into difficulty in the River Tawe in South Wales yesterday . Emergency services saved him from the water after he was seen going under but he later died in hospital . Keen canoeist Dr Pryor was plucked from the river and taken to hospital where doctors tried to save his life, but he later died. Dr Pryor, who worked as a consultant in paediatric intensive care at the University Hospital of Wales, was an active member of the Cardiff Canoe Club. A spokesman for the club said: 'Our well respected Dr Damian Pryor died pursuing what he loved on the River Tawe, despite every effort by his colleagues and the emergency services. 'A full inquiry is underway and our heartfelt thoughts are with his family and friends. He will be dearly missed.' Friends said the 'well-respected' doctor was 'doing what he loved' when the accident occured . The River Tawe was swollen yesterday following heavy rainfall across the UK in recent days and weeks . Rescuers pulled Dr Pryor from the river and he was taken to hospital. Another kayaker survived uninjured . A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said: 'A report was received that a male kayaker had got into difficulty on the river. Fire service and Mountain Rescue were called to the scene as part of the rescue operation. 'The man was rescued from the water and was conveyed to Morriston hospital (near Swansea) by ambulance. He was taken to hospital and subsequently died.' Dr Pryor was with a friend who also got into difficulty in the rough waters around midday on Monday, but the other man escaped from the river uninjured. The coroner has been informed of the death.","Paediatrician got into trouble while paddling in river in the Swansea Valley .

"The bad news for our supermarkets just keeps coming. They have been lining up in recent days to report sales figures ranging from disappointing to near disastrous. Yesterday, it was Morrisons' turn to feel the pain, when it announced that its sales in the six weeks to January 4 fell by 3.1 per cent. As an indication of just how serious this is for the chain, Morrisons announced 400 job losses and that it will shut ten loss-making stores this year. It represents a crippling psychological setback for Morrisons, and underlines how only drastic action can halt, or at least slow, the haemorrhage of shoppers from its stores. Scroll down for video . Morrisons CEO  Dalton Philips is to step down after five years at the helm of the struggling supermarket business after it announced that its sales in the six weeks to January 4 fell by 3.1 per cent . Morrisons' chief executive, Dalton Philips, the man who set out optimistically only five years ago to refresh the already ailing business with novel strategies such as 'misting' vegetables (spraying them with water so they seem more appealing), has stepped down. Other big chains dare not gloat, for they aren't much better off. Last week Sainsbury's reported its worst Christmas for more than a decade with like-for-like sales down 1.7 per cent. Now, they're cutting 500 jobs, too. This came hot on the heels of an unprecedented poor performance from beleaguered Tesco. Already reeling from a succession of profit warnings and the discovery of a huge and mysterious black hole in its accounts, it recently reported a sales drop of 2.9 per cent. This decline is so significant Tesco has decided to close 43 loss-making stores this year and shelve plans to open 49 huge Tesco Extra superstores. How are the mighty fallen! And how rapidly. Until September 2013, when Tesco backtracked on its plans to open a store in Sherborne, Dorset, after residents' effective 'No Thanks Tesco' campaign, the brand was synonymous with aggressive expansion and never-ending, seemingly unstoppable store openings. The Big Four supermarkets have all been struggling with Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's posting dramatic falls in Christmas sales . Tesco, already reeling from  the discovery of a huge and mysterious black hole in its accounts, recently reported a sales drop of 2.9 per cent which has led to a decision by the supermarket to close 43 loss-making stores this year and shelve plans to open 49 huge Tesco Extra superstores . We await results from Asda, but given that Marks & Spencer is reporting its spindly 0.1 per cent food sales increase as 'strongly outperforming the market', it seems unlikely that Asda will have much to raise the prevailing gloom that hangs over the supermarket sector. So why do things look so bad? Quite simply, we don't automatically want to shop in big supermarkets any longer. Sick of being ripped off by their outrageous prices, we're abandoning the knee-jerk, one-stop weekly shopping expedition supposed to get us through the week, but which often left us with half a fridge of uneaten food. We have become promiscuous customers, shopping around more frequently, buying less at a time, and cherry-picking from various outlets. In these straitened economic times we are intently focused, more suspicious than ever, about what we are being asked to pay for food. The nation's supermarket shopping habit has been irretrievably broken by the arrival of the German-owned discount chains, Aldi and Lidl. It took them more than 20 years (Aldi arrived in this country in 1990 and Lidl in 1994) to get their cheaper price message through to us, but we've definitely got it now. Loud and clear. Budget chains Aldi (pictured) and Lidl have been blamed for irretrievably changing the nation's supermarket shopping habits . We realise the 'Big Four' have been charging us way too much — behaving particularly rapaciously when it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables — earning excessive margins and profiteering at our expense. Last week, for example, I could have paid £2.99 per kilogram for cherry tomatoes in Sainsbury's, but at Lidl I'd have paid only £1.78. The celery Morrisons wanted 79p for cost 39p at Aldi. And this isn't the discounters playing silly, short-term games with prices — unlike their higher-profile rivals. It's these discount chains simply showing what can be done with a different business model and less greedy pricing. Such spectacular price differences couldn't be ignored for ever. Britain's shoppers have finally woken up and voted with their feet, and their wallets. Given the hundreds of millions the big supermarket chains have spent on building our trust — through advertising, loyalty cards, phony price wars and deliberately bamboozling promotions — the discovery that, surprise, surprise, they're not actually on our side has been shattering, and has changed consumers' habits dramatically. These chains all kept telling us how cheap they were, and we believed them. What they forgot to tell us was what obscene profits they were making. 'Every little helps,' said Tesco, and we never paused to ask: 'Helps whom?' Well, no more. Any trust we had in them has been lost and may never be restored. Sainsbury's (pictured) reported its worst Christmas for more than a decade with like-for-like sales down 1.7 per cent . It's not many years since the supermarket each of us so loyally used almost defined who we were — an aspirational Sainsbury's family, perhaps, or maybe down-to-earth Morrisons customers. It still does, to some extent — in the case of Waitrose. But by and large, the ties that bound us so tightly to one particular chain have been broken. There is more genuine choice and better value to be had elsewhere. These days, we shop where we want — at Aldi one day, at a local butcher or grocer the next and, on those days when we're simply too tired to care, at whichever chain-owned convenience store we pass on the way home, when we'll decide what's for dinner that night. Mainstream chains still get some of what we spend on food — but not as much. Many people will be overjoyed by supermarkets finally getting their comeuppance — their aggressive expansion policies, in the High Street and out of town, made them bitterly resented. On Twitter, news that Tesco would shut 43 of its smaller stores was celebrated by those delighted that the destroyer of so many local, independent shops was beginning to suffer itself. Add the cancelled plans for 49 superstores — the white elephants of today's food retail world, according to analysts — and what many saw as the 'Tesco-isation' of Britain finally seems to have gone into reverse. They have also announced they are cutting 500 jobs to tackle the poor sales as shoppers turn to cheaper alternatives such as budget chains Aldi and Lidl . I'm sure other chains will quietly follow suit, mothballing plans for future store openings. And, as with Tesco and Morrisons, I wouldn't be surprised to see existing stores shut, too. Britain's supermarkets may have peaked in their hold over us, but they certainly won't vanish altogether, though it would be encouraging to see signs of them learning from past mistakes. Instead, Sainsbury's has done what big chains always do when faced with adversity — announced yet another 'price war' to try to persuade customers they are getting brilliant deals (when often they could still buy cheaper elsewhere), and place even more economic pressure on its suppliers. So what will the future of food shopping in Britain look like? Now, the supermarket enchantment spell has been broken, consumers are back in charge. If we want to shop at a discounter we will, a trend that may result in a modest expansion of the Aldi or Lidl chains: their circumspect German owners are too canny and conservative for grandiose plans. They'll have seen what over-ambition has done to Tesco, and learned a lesson. Other winners will be the assortment of retailers that have emerged in the past few years to meet the demand from consumers for a better shopping experience. I'm talking about traditional street markets, small independent shops, Asian and Middle Eastern grocers, farmers' markets, vegetable box schemes, farm shops, food co-operatives and a range of online enterprises that have successfully carved out their own niches. It's not nostalgia for times long past. But some traditional street markets offer better value than even the discount chains. No, I look at today's food shopping experience and see what works and what doesn't. And what certainly doesn't work as well as it used to is shopping at supermarkets. Our 40-year love affair with them is over. Now, they must pay the price.","Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's all posted big falls in Christmas sales .

"Police are struggling to stop a Sydney-based website from selling shoplifting tools as the administrator has managed to find a legal loophole. The Sydney-based website, which will not be named by Daily Mail Australia, distributes a range of equipment for thieves which have been designed to remove security tags, allowing the shoplifter to remain undetected. There are calls for the online store to be shut down but despite investigations from the National Retail Association, the website is currently not breaking any laws - even though it is distributing products that encourage and facilitate crime. The website founder, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia that they are doing nothing wrong. The website even has 'how-to' videos, where a young woman in a pink bra demonstrates how to use the products to foil a range of different security measures to steal clothes, sunglasses and liquor . 'We are not doing anything new, there are many companies selling these (products) both direct to the public and to stores,' he said. He also believes that shop owners should know that security tags are not an adequate measure to prevent theft. 'There are currently no regulations on the sale of these products.' The website is also used to distribute their own line of clothing and point out that they would never trust security tags with their own products. 'As we tell the stores who stock our clothing range, security tags should not be relied on as the only form of loss prevention.' The website has different tools which are used to unlock different security tags to facilitate illegal shoplifting . The brand is hugely popular with almost 30,000 people following their Facebook page. However it's not known how many people are buying the shoplifting tools, which they call 'rack masters'. The website even has 'how-to' videos, where a young woman in a pink bra demonstrates how to use the products to foil a range of different security measures to steal clothes, sunglasses andliquor. Thieving is a hugely costly problem for the retail sector. Many organisations are working together to prevent the criminal activity. The website demonstrates how the 'Rack Master 1000' can quickly remove the security tag from sunglasses . ‘Shop lifting is a massive problem in Australia, we’re looking at about $2.3 billion per annum,' Philip Burton from the National Retail Association told Seven News. ‘We’ve asked the police to investigate and to try and close this website down as quickly as possible,’ NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox told Seven News. However, one of the biggest problems which has allowed the website to remain open for five years in the Australian law. The legislation is being examined to potentially find a way to ban the distribution of these products. ‘We’ll talk with the Attorney General’s department in order to see if there’s any legislative changes that might be appropriate to make sure that these things are not able to be sold within any Australian jurisdiction,’ Mr Burton told Seven News. In the meantime, the website continues to sell and promote their products and law enforcements cannot intervene. However, one of the biggest problems which has allowed the website to remain open is Australian law.The legislation is being examined to potentially find a way to ban the distribution of these products .","Police cannot shut down a website that sells tools to help shoplifters .

"A mum who was persuaded to try for 'one last child' by her husband was stunned when she beat odds of two million to one - to have naturally conceived identical triplets. Melanie Thornton, 33, thought her family was complete with daughter Tia, 13, when her partner Martin, 27, talked her into trying for another child. A scan at five weeks confirmed one little 'sack' but she was astonished when medics later revealed she was expecting three identical triplet girls. Scroll down for video . New arrivals: Melanie pictured in hospital with Boe, Mika and Hope after giving birth in August last year . Melanie says Boe, Mika and Hope are happiest when they are closer together and don't like being apart . Boe, Mika and Hope were born healthy and mum Melanie has had to make some serious changes to cope with her new super-sized family. Melanie, a sales manager from Paignton, Devon, said her living room 'resembles Mothercare' with the couple bulk buying in almost 100 litres of baby formula a month for the growing babies. She has even arranged special rubbish collections to deal with more than 250 dirty nappies a week, as well as ordering a special £2,000 bumper pram for three. The Thorntons have also had to sell their Peugeot car - trading it in for a £5,000 second-hand VW Transporter. Melanie also estimates her electricity bills have doubled since the twins have been born. But the proud mum insists the mountains of dirty babygrows and endless feeds are all worth it for the adorable trio, who are happiest snuggled up together holding hands. Melanie fell pregnant with the triplets, pictured above, after being persuaded by her husband Martin to try for a second child. She said she 'thought it was a joke' when told she was expecting three babies . Melanie's 12-week scan revealed she was expecting triplets - after the previous scan had showed one 'sack' The proud mum-of-four said: 'Before the scan I had been saying something felt really different this time round. 'I said a few times ""I'm sure there's more than one"" but I never said anything about triplets. 'I just burst out laughing and asked ""where are the cameras?"" I thought it must have been a joke, a set up. 'When they were finally born it was so nice to finally see them - I didn't know who to go to first, who to touch or who to talk to first. 'Now we've got them home everyone keeps offering to come round to help me because I have three, but they are great - they all slept through the night last night. 'If I split them up though they do start to cry - the closer together they are the better.' The couple started trying for a baby early last year and found out on Valentine's Day that Melanie was expecting. Melanie said: 'I really disliked being pregnant the first time so I thought that was that, but a couple of years ago my husband said he wanted to have another baby. 'He managed to talk me into it and I had my implant removed and we were pregnant after about four months.' Mother-of-four Melanie has had to buy extra equipment for the triplets - including a three-way pram . Bulk-buys 100 litres of baby formula a month . Had to arrange a special rubbish collection for the 250 dirty nappies . Does up to 20 washing machine loads a week . Electricity bills have doubled . The special £2,000 three-baby pram had to be imported from Poland . They all currently sleep in one cot-bed together, but they have bought two more £50 second-hand beds for when they grow too big to share, along with three £80 mattresses . The family used to have a Peugeot car, but traded it in for a £5,000 second hand VW Transporter van - with extra seats added . Mother's instinct told Melanie she might be carrying more than one baby, but a private scan at five weeks reassured her, after it appeared to show a single embryo. But when they went for the 12-week scan at Torbay Hospital, medics - who thought the couple must have had IVF - told the shocked pair they were expecting three. Melanie said: 'I kept having a recurring dream where the sonographer said to me ""Have you had IVF? Have you got a history of twins in your family?"" 'So when we went for the 12-week scan and he said we were having triplets I thought it was a joke.' Doctors warned the family of the dangers of multiple births and for the whole pregnancy they said the smallest baby - named Hope - was unlikely to survive. 'It was stressful,' recalled Melanie. 'We'd have to go for scans every two weeks, and they would constantly warn us of the death and mortality rates for triplets. Happy Christmas! The triplets pictured dressed as Santa's Elves were all home in time for the festive season . 'They said Hope wasn't going to make it to birth. Every day onwards from then I was almost waiting for her to die. 'I was depressed for about a week and then I realised that while I was doing that she was just kicking harder and harder. I could tell where each one was. 'I thought, you know what, if she's not going to give up, then I wasn't either. The adorable trio were born at 32 weeks and four days on August 25, via caesarean section at Torbay Hospital. Boe arrived first at 2.37am weighing 3lbs and 3oz, Mika was a minute later weighing 3lbs and 1oz and Hope arrived last at 2.39am weighing just 2lbs and 13oz. After five weeks, everyone except Hope was allowed to go home, and she joined them on October 16 - her due date - after an operation to remove fluid around her brain. 'I'd looked up pictures of premature babies before so I expected them to look a bit weird, but they weren't they were perfectly formed tiny little babies,' Melanie said. 'It was amazing. My babies took up the whole room. 'It was so reassuring to see how perfect they were and they didn't need any help or anything with breathing - just a little tube for food.' Now aged 20 weeks, the siblings have already formed a close bond. 'They are such content and happy little babies,' Melanie said. 'They love to cuddle. They put their arms around each other and love to hold hands. Their favourite way to be is with Mika in the middle, and she holds both hands. 'My living room does look like Mothercare and the washing machine is constantly on. 'When I'm feeding and burping them it is a lot of balancing, and juggling and holding bottles, but of course it is worth it. 'I can't really remember life when my family was half the size.'","Melanie Thornton talked into trying for another child by husband Martin .

"A gay couple claim they were thrown out of a pub after they shared a kiss and were branded 'revolting' by the landlord. Dylan Morris was celebrating his birthday with family and his boyfriend Darren Barnett at the St Levan Inn in Plymouth in Devon when they kissed. The couple, both law students, were then told they would have to leave the premises if they continued because the landlord said he did not like 'that sort of behaviour.' Darren Barnett (left) and boyfriend Dylan Morris claim they were told to leave a pub because they kissed . But the landlord of the pub said he would take the same action against a female and male couple for kissing like that on his premises. Mr Barnett, 22, said: 'The landlord said what we did was revolting. 'All of Dylan's family were there and they were really angry. It was a very stressful situation. 'We are not happy at all with it. This is the first time something like this has happened to me - what we were doing should have been fine. All we did was share a kiss.' He said they had contacted Plymouth City Council to complain about the incident and would not be returning to the pub. Mr Barnett added: 'We were really taken aback by the kind of language he was using. I said it . The landlord of the St Levan Inn said asking the couple to leave had nothing to do with their sexuality . was discriminatory and against the law, but he shouted to the barman to not serve us.' 'Even the barman looked quite shocked. When we went elsewhere it was fine.' His partner Mr Morris, 20, posted a message on Twitter after the incident, which saw several people condemning the heavy handed reaction of the pub. 'Cannot believe that I was kicked out of my family pub for kissing my boyfriend. Absolutely disgraceful,' he wrote. Mr Morris (left) branded the incident 'disgraceful' However landlord of the Levan Inn, Paul Bodenham, denied that the incident had anything to do with the couple's sexual orientation and said he would do exactly the same if it happened again. He said: 'I have been a landlord for 30 years and have never seen behaviour like it. 'There was a complaint from one of my customers. So I said to them, 'if you want to do that again, do it outside.' 'But I did not throw them out. I just told them to go outside if they wanted to act in that manner. Then they started causing all kinds of problems. 'It would be the same if it was a man and a woman kissing like that. I have nothing against gay people - half of my darts team here are lesbians. 'I don't do social media so I haven't seen what people are saying. But I would definitely do the same again. 'Behaviour like that in a pub is unacceptable. It was out of order. I am trying to run a public house and I can't have things like that going on.'","Dylan Morris, 20, and his boyfriend Darren Barnett were at Plymouth pub .

"'Nincompoop': Ramesh Tawadkar  announced that Goa intends to set up centres to 'cure' homosexuals . An Indian state minister has announced plans to open treatment centres for the LGBT community to 'make them normal', comparing homosexuals to alcoholics. Ramesh Tawadkar, Goa's minister for sport and youth, said the government in the popular tourist resort would 'cure' homosexuals with 'training and medicines'. Tawadkar, a representative of right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, sparked outrage with the comments, made during a press conference yesterday. 'We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholics Anonymous centres,' Tawadkar said, adding that the Goa government would 'train them and give them medicines too'. Tawadkar made the comments after releasing the Goa state's policy on youth issues which listed the LGBT community as a stigmatised group that needed attention. Bharatiya Janata Party, is the current majority party in India, and is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tawadkar's comments drew widespread criticism and ridicule from gay rights groups who branded them offensive, while hostile remarks were posted on Twitter and other social media. Anjali Gopalan, founder of sexual health organisation Naz Foundation,  called minister Tawadkar an 'incompetent nincompoop'. 'We should not respond to this kind of stupidity. If anyone needs treatment, it's people like him... he should realise he sounds like a complete fool,' Gopalan said. Nitin Karani, trustee of the gay rights advocacy group Samapathik Trust, said the minister's comments reflected his ignorance, but at the same time he conceded that the LGBT community needed to 'reach out more to the mainstream for awareness'. Tawadkar's comments came one day after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accused India of fostering intolerance with its laws against gay and lesbian relationships. United in support: Members and supporters of the Indian LGBT community march during a Gay Pride Parade in New Delhi in November last year . Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi on Monday night, Ban said he 'staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality'. 'I am proud to stand for the equality of all people -- including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,' Ban said in an address to a gathering that included India's Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi. Critique: UN's Ban Ki-moon accused India of fostering intolerance with its laws against gay sex . 'I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. 'Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.' India's Supreme Court reimposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges. Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' was a violation of fundamental rights. Members of the gay community have filed petitions to the top court since the 2013 ruling asking for a review on criminalising gay sex. Campaigners say the law is rarely used to prosecute homosexual acts, but add that police do use it to harass and blackmail members of their already marginalised community. Surveys show broad disapproval of homosexuality in India, forcing many gay men and women to live double lives. Hindu hardliners have often called same-sex relationships a disease and a Western cultural import. Popular Indian guru Baba Ramdev, who is close to the Bharatiya Janata Party, stirred controversy in 2011 when he said that homosexuality could be 'cured' through yoga.","Goa state minister announce plans for LGBT 'treatment centres'

"A dog owner nearly lost his leg after he caught  a flesh-eating infection and blood poisoning from a tiny scratch caused by his puppy. Chris Longley, 29, was playing with his six-month-old German Shepherd Wolfie in a park near his home in Reading, Berkshire, when the dog accidentally scraped his claw along his shin. Mr Longley didn't even notice the scratch until he got home, but after 24 hours it had started to ache and his leg muscle started to spasm. Dog owner Chris Longley (left) nearly lost his leg after he caught a flesh-eating infection and blood poisoning from a tiny scratch caused by his German Shepherd puppy Wolfie (right) The next he was admitted to hospital with a severe skin infection and septicaemia after bacteria in the scratch caused necrosis of the tissue in his leg. Doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital warned that any further delay in seeking medical attention could have resulted in Mr Longley losing his leg - or even dying from severe blood poisoning. 'I ended up being in hospital for a week and off work for a month - and all for a little scratch from a lovely puppy,' he said. 'At first I felt a bit silly, but the doctors took it very seriously. 'They said if I hadn't come into hospital when I did it could have been very, very serious. 'Worst case scenario could have been death due to the blood poisoning and necrosis, but ultimately losing a leg was quite a likely outcome if I had left it for a week. 'It could very easily got gangrenous and I could have lost the bottom of my leg.' Mr Longley, 29, was playing with his six-month-old German Shepherd  in a park near his home in Reading, Berkshire, when the dog accidentally scraped his claw along his shin . Mr Longley said he had not realised he was hurt until he returned home and spotted a four-inch red line on his leg, which he thought nothing more of . Software development manager Mr Longley and his wife Jen, 32, got Wolfie in June and the dog scratched him on his left shin while taking a Sunday walk in October. Mr Longley said he had not realised he was hurt until he returned home and spotted a four-inch red line on his leg, of which he thought nothing more. But a day later it started to ache and he was sent home from work when his leg started to spasm and he felt weak. NHS walk-in centre staff directed him towards the accident and emergency department at Royal Berkshire Hospital. Mr Longley - who by this time was finding it difficult to stay awake due to the poison travelling through his blood - was given super-strength antibiotics to treat the infection. After two days the infection had started to spread and tissue at the scratch site on his left leg turned black as the cells started to die . However, after two days the infection had started to spread and tissue at the scratch site on his left leg turned black as the cells started to die. Surgeons - who were worried it would reach the bone - rushed him in for emergency surgery to cut the flesh from his leg. During surgery Mr Longley had a bad reaction to the anaesthetic and his blood pressure dropped dangerously low. But he pulled through, and was kept in hospital for a week, before three more weeks of rest at home. Relieved Mr Longley said: 'I was wearing shorts because it was nice out and we were just playing around and he just caught me with his front claw. 'It was a bit red when I got back, but I didn't think anything of it. 'A day later it started to get redder but I thought it would just got better on its own.

"A senior U.S. House Democrat unveiled this week an aggressive agenda to boost workers' paychecks by shifting significant tax breaks from the wealthiest Americans to the middle class. The plan from Representative Chris Van Hollen has almost no chance of passage by the Republican-controlled Congress but is aimed at shaping Democrats' policy vision for the 2016 presidential election. The Maryland Democrat's plan calls for an annual 'paycheck bonus' tax credit of $1,000 for individuals making less than $100,000 a year and $2,000 for married couples making less than $200,000 and would be funded through a new fee on financial transactions. Scroll down for video . Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen wants to boost workers' paychecks by shifting significant capital from the wealthiest Americans to the middle class . It also includes a bonus of $250 for people who save at least $500 of this credit every year. The tax breaks would be offset with a 0.1 percent tax on stock trades, mostly from high-volume transactions. According to the Washington Post, the legislation would redirect $1.2 billion over a decade from the nation's top earners to the middle class. Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House's budget committee, said the tax - what he called a 'high-roller fee' - would curb 'the kind of financial speculation that creates no value for the economy.' He portrayed his plan as an alternative to Republicans' ambitions to cut top tax rates as part of an overall rewrite of the U.S. tax code this year. The Democratic lawmaker said the new tax would limit corporate tax deductions of bonuses paid to executives in excess of $1 million unless the companies can show their workers are getting pay raises that reflect productivity and cost-of-living changes. It would also give tax benefits to companies that invest in employee training programs and increase deductions for child daycare expenses from $3,000 per person to $8,000. 'We can pay for these new tax benefits for working Americans by changing the ways our current tax code is rigged in favor of those who make money off of money and against those who make money from work,' Van Hollen said. The plan goes beyond Democrats' past efforts to address rising income inequality, which centered on raising the minimum wage. That message found little resonance among middle-class voters in November's elections, leaving the party searching for a more effective message. President Barack Obama, right, meets with Speaker of the House John Boehner, center, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, left, during a meeting with congressional leadership in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Tuesday. The White House wouldn't endorse Van Hollen's plan today, saying it needed to review the details, but Pelosi has offered her support. Boehner's office slammed it as a 'trillion-dollar tax hike' Republicans say the plan is nothing more than a 'massive' tax increase, though, that would add to the dysfunction of the tax system rather than alleviate it. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, told Reuters, 'Here in the House our focus is going to be on cleaning up the tax code so that we can lower rates for all taxpayers and help create good-paying jobs, not scaring them off with punitive tax hikes.' 'Our economy is still struggling to create jobs - and the last thing we need is a new trillion-dollar tax hike added to the current broken tax code,'  Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told Fox News. In response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accused Republicans of not caring about the average Americans the bill seeks to aid. 'Apparently House Republicans only like tax relief if it's for their millionaire friends and special interest backers, not for hardworking middle class families,' the DCCC said in a statement, . Van Hollen's plan has drawn the praise of his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill searching for new ways to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. 'The challenge is a big one. You have to think big, you have to think forward, and you have to think new. You have to think new and fresh,' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post. Van Hollen told the Post that he had spoke to senior Obama administration officials and they seemed supportive of his plan. The president's spokesman would not offer an endorsement of the legislation today, however, saying the White House had not yet had an opportunity to review it in its entirety.","Chris Van Hollen's plan calls for an annual 'paycheck bonus' tax credit of $1,000 for individuals making less than $100,000 a year .

"From a mythical 40's spacecraft, to a cigarette packet sketch, then to the drawing board, and finally to reality in someone's front garden in Towcester, Northants. This is the story of the UK's only Roswell caravan. Daniel Gregory's persistence, skill and enthusiasm has produced the only Roswell caravan in the country. And as far as anyone knows the only other one ever made is in the United States, but that one is used as a utility trailer with a welding machine in the back. Daniel Gregory is believed to have the only 'Roswell Caravan' in the UK, and maybe one of two in the world . The vehicle that 43-year-old Mr Gregory built serves the original purpose it was designed for - as a small family caravan with a double bed in it. For more than 70 years this unique style of caravan existed only as a rough sketch based on a mythical space craft in the States when space exploration was in its infancy, and Dan Dare was the hero of the day. Then a few years ago Andrew Gibbons a CAD (Computer aided design) engineer from Newcastle decided to put pencil to paper or in this case 'mouse to computer,' and proceeded to draw a fully dimensional layout of the Roswell from the 70-year-old sketch of what people thought a spacecraft would look like back then. Not only does Mr Gregory's design look like something from a space mission, but it is useful as a place for the family to stay on trips . Daniel Gregory used designs by an engineer from Newcastle to design the UK's only Roswell Caravan . Mr Gibbons's aim was to see if anyone might take up the challenge and actually make one. A few year ago Gregory found out about the existence of the fully finished plans of this as yet, none existent caravan and decided to produce the first one. So he asked Gibbons if he could use his drawings, and produce one for himself and his family, to which the latter was only too pleased. Taking around 250 hours of bending shaping and welding, from within his friend's barn, came the birth of the first glistening Roswell caravan. It is made out of sheet aluminium instead of plywood, which was originally planned and 30mmx50mm tubular steel under frame. Gregory had put his skills to good use. He left school in 1986 to train and work as a 'Stick welder' in an engineering company that produced components for North Sea gas rigs, but after two year doing that he decided that he wanted to join the RA, spending four years working on transportation. The caravan certainly stands out in Mr Gregory's hometown of Towcester in Northamptonshire, with people eager to catch a glimpse . This could be an alien head in the bubble, or maybe just a button on the special caravan . Then a change came along again and he went back to engineering. This time he learnt the skill of 'Tig' welding and he became a fully trained Fabbie, hence his knowledge of welding aluminium and bending sheet metal stood him in good stead for this project. In 2000 he went to work with Virgin trains but for the past nine years he drives trains from Banbury for Chiltern railways. Gregory just loves having things to do, so when this project came up he put his heart and soul into it. Nearing the completion date he had in mind, he put even more time in to finishing the caravan, working on if for five days in a row putting in 15 hours days. Before Gregory made the full-scale van, 11 feet long by five feet wide and 4.7 feet high, he made one out of cardboard at 12th scale to see if there was going to be any potential problems . Interestingly the indicator lights on top of the wheel arches are from a 1950's jet that he bought of Ebay. Mr Greogry worked on the project for five days in a row putting in 15 hours days as he neared completion of his masterpiece . The Roswell Caravan is towed around the country by Mr Gregory who takes it to various rallys . His four-year-old daughter Victoria loves the caravan her dad made and helps him clean it. Last summer her nursery school was doing a week's project on 'Space' and Dad was asked if he would bring the Roswell down to the school. 'It was great,' said Daniel. They (the children) were all over it and inside and out. They were so excited, as to them, I suppose it looks quite large and they would never have seen anything like it before.' Asked how much interest the space caravan garners, he added: 'I don't even have to take it out of the front garden, as I, or my wife have people knocking on the front door asking if it's for sale or where can they get hold of one. 'I have even been asked by someone in America if I would go over there and make one, but I'm not into that I've got too much going on here. Also if I'm taking it to a rally I see people taking photos from their car windows as they over-take me. Mr Gregory took advantage of a rare day of January sun to polish up his special mobile home . 'It tows like a dream you wouldn't know you have anything on the back. I suppose it's so aerodynamic that adds to its stability'. So far it's only Daniel that has been away in the caravan but he is now starting to get it ready to take wife Jo and his daughter with him down to Weymouth in a few months time. So out came the metal polish and his electric polisher/buffer on one of the first sunny days this year, and with a lot of elbow grease and a little help from his daughter, he took over six hours to bring back that mirror finish that gets dull and oxidised when it stands out in the garden over the winter months. 'It doesn't take long to get dull again, added Gregory. 'It's a bit like painting the Forth Bridge, it's an ongoing process.' Also he needs to revamp the inside, as he is happy to crash out on a bit of sponge and a sleeping bag when he's on his own in it, but he wants to make the inside as impressive as the outside for his wife and daughter when they all go away in it. Space is limited and it can only take a double bed, a few under bed lockers and bringing the 1940s style up to date, he also wants to install a flat screen TV as well. 'Jo and Victoria will sleep in the caravan and I'll sleep in the awning when we go away he says, so there's no problem there.'","Daniel Gregory has built the only Roswell Caravan in the UK, and it's thought one of two in the world .

"Thousands of fervent football fans have fancied their chances at Spot the Ball, while countless other punters have had a crack at it too. After all, just how hard could it really be to place the position of the ball missing from a football live action photograph? Well, as it turns out, extremely hard. So hard, in fact, that no one has won the game’s £250,000 jackpot for more than a decade, it was revealed yesterday. Scroll down for video . Peter Cook, 66, discovered the jackpot drought as he confronted organisers in frustration at winning just a £10 and a couple of £2 vouchers despite spending about £1,300 over 11 years . No one has won the game’s £250,000 jackpot for more than a decade. Mr Cook, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said: ‘If no one won the National Lottery jackpot for that long there’d be an outcry' Some 14,000 people a week regularly play the Football Pools-run game, but the last time anyone actually managed to pinpoint the ball exactly was in 2004. The jaw-dropping discovery was made by Peter Cook, 66, when he confronted organisers in frustration at winning just £10 and a couple of £2 vouchers despite spending £1,300 over 11 years. Mr Cook, a retired local newspaper editor of Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said: ‘If no one won the National Lottery jackpot for that long there’d be an outcry. ‘It’s ridiculous. By the laws of probability you’d have thought someone must have won it by now.’ In its Seventies heyday Spot the Ball was played by three million people a week. But interest fell after the National Lottery was launched in 1994. The weekly game has some 14,000 devotees paying a minimum 50p for 50 guesses but no one has scooped the top prize since 2004 . Die-hard Spot the Ball fan Mr Cook puts £2.50 a week on 1,000 crosses. Players are provided with specially printed sheets of small stick-on crosses allowing them to cover areas of the competition photo with blocks of guesses if they wish. But frustration at winning so little over the years drove Mr Cook to contact the organisers about when anyone last scooped the jackpot – which, unlike the Lottery’s, does not roll over each week if not won. Yesterday a Football Pools spokesman said: ‘Players of the Spot the Ball game have won £16million in prizes over the last ten years. ‘The top prize is won by guessing the exact centre of the ball but this has not happened since 2004, reflecting the fact that fewer people play the game. ‘However, the £16million has been paid out to weekly winners for other prizes on offer, including for being closest to the centre of the ball.’ The last winner of the jackpot was a grandmother who won the £250,000 prize after a tip from beyond the grave from her dead mother. Irene Robertson, then 69, of Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, said after winning that her mother Alice had told her at a seance: ‘Don’t forget the coupon,’ just before she had planned to stop her £3 weekly flutter on the game after 40 years of playing.","The last Spot the Ball jackpot was won in 2004 .

"Daniel LaPoint Jr and Eric Witzke could feel it in their bones that they found something extraordinary when their digging tools unearthed a grey skeleton in a Michigan backyard. LaPoint, a contractor, and his neighbor at first thought they had uncovered dinosaur fossils on Witzke's property in Bellevue. But what the pair of amateur archaeologists actually found were 42 massive mastodon bones. Lucky find: In this January 7 photo, Dan LaPoint, right, and Eric Witzke, pose with just a few of the many ancient mastodon bones they unearthed while excavating a pond on Witzke's property outside Olivet, Michigan . Ancient creature: Experts were able to determine that the 42 bones are from a 37-year-old male mastodon and are between 10,000 and 14,000 years old . The prehistoric mammals, distantly related to modern elephants, roamed North and Central America for over a million years before they suddenly went extinct at the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago. After four days of digging with LaPoint's excavator, he and Witzke contacted an expert at the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, who was able to examine and confirm their chance discovery, reported Lansing State Journal. Museum Director Daniel Fisher said the bones are from a 37-year-old male mastodon and are between 10,000 and 14,000 years old. The museum will be able to narrow the exact age within 200 or 300 years once it has received the bones. LaPoint and Witzke plan to keep a few of the bones and give the rest to the museum later this month. About 330 confirmed mastodon bones have been discovered in Michigan. Bag of bones: The Bellevue fossils include leg, shoulder and hip bones, multiple ribs, the base of a tusk and bits of the mastodon's vertebrae (pictured) Got a bone to pick: Most of the bones will be donated to University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology later this month .

Before donating their remarkable find to science, the neighbors took the mastodon bones to Olivet Community College where a group of excited middle-schoolers got a chance to handle the remains of the long-extinct extinct ice-age creature. ‘To change one kid's life because they got to touch it, I think, is an incredible opportunity.’ LaPoint said, calling the discovery a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

"Tour operators and bus companies have been warned they must pass on falling fuel costs to families booking their summer getaway. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander has written to package holiday firms demanding they cut prices after oil fell to a six-year low. Petrol prices have dropped to below £1 a litre at forecourts in some areas, but other industries which blame high fuel costs for rising prices have not acted to cut charges. Tour operators have been ordered by the Treasury to pass on falling fuel costs to reduce the price of family holidays . The New Year heralds the start of the holiday booking season for many, with families planning their summer breaks during the winter gloom. Mr Alexander wants package holiday firms to pass on savings accrued through lower air, coach and other holiday costs. He has also written to five major bus operators calling on them to pass on the dramatic falls in the diesel price to customers through lower fares. Mr Alexander said: ‘With fuel prices dropping across the country it’s right that the full benefits are passed on. Falling oil prices are like a giant tax cut to the economy. But the positive effect will only be felt if the oil price falls are passed on. ‘While drivers are already seeing the cost of filling up the car come down, the millions of Britons who use the bus are still paying what they did a few months ago. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander has written to package holiday firms demanding they cut prices after oil fell to a six-year low . ‘On top of that many people will be planning their summer holidays now and looking for an early bargain. I want package tour operators to reflect the lower costs of fuel in their prices now. “Consumers have suffered the pain of high oil prices, it’s only right that companies and organisations do all they can to pass on as quickly as possible every last penny of oil price falls.” New figures released today show the average price for petrol last week was £1.08 and £1.16 for diesel, a dramatic fall from £1.30 and £1.38 a year ago. But travel operators said it was difficult to pass on the savings, because many airlines and coach firms will have bought their fuel in advance when prices were higher. A spokjesman for ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, said: ‘The fall in fuel prices is good news for consumers although they may have to wait to see the full effects of the price drop. ‘Many airlines buy their fuel in advance to enable a deal of certainty about prices and so may not immediately be in a position to pass on the benefits of lower fuel costs to consumers.’ Virgin Atlantic cut fuel surcharges by £10 on its long-haul flights last month, but other firms, including British Airways, have not followed suit. Airline association IATA has predicted that over the course of 2015 consumers can expect to see worldwide airfares decrease by an average of 5 per cent thanks to lower fuel prices and faster global growth, ABTA added. ‘Airlines and tour operators incorporate fuel costs, as well as a number of other cost factors, into the headline price that they charge consumers at the time of booking.’","Lib Dem Danny Alexander writes to travel companies to demand price cuts .

"PC Warren Luke, pictured leaving Wood Green Crown Court, where he is facing charges of actual bodily harm . A police officer savagely beat a mother who rowed with staff at a children's hospital, a jury heard. PC Warren Luke grabbed the woman as she clutched the arm of her seriously ill seven-year-old daughter. Nurses watched in horror as he punched the mother in the face and kicked her, it was alleged. The ferocity of the clash left the girl, who suffers from cerebral palsy, covered in her mother's blood. The 41-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept yesterday as she told jurors she had feared she would die. She said Luke attacked her in full view of a ward of very sick children, leaving her bleeding heavily from a wound to her face. 'I couldn't do anything. I was being beaten. I was helpless. He kicked me six or seven times,' she said. In a police video interview played to the jury, she described how Luke suddenly turned on her as two women PCs spoke to her 'nicely'. 'He told me, 'You've got to leave, you've got to leave',' she said. 'I kept playing with my daughter and then I saw him moving towards me. He was kicking me and kicking me. 'He had one hand on my head. When I fell on the bed he grabbed my hair and banged my head. I was screaming. 'I couldn't defend myself. My ex-husband ran in and shouted, 'Why are you kicking my wife?' 'It seemed as if this officer wanted to kill me.' The former husband said: 'I saw him punch her in the face. He was elbowing her too.' Luke, 38, was one of four officers called to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in December 2013 after the woman argued with doctors and refused to leave her daughter's bedside. Nurses feared the woman would try to remove the girl from the hospital, where she had spent two months receiving life-saving care. Prosecutor Samantha Cohen told Wood Green Crown Court in North London that Luke made the woman release her daughter's arm, but returned moments later and grabbed her hair. Luke was accused of savagely beating a mother who rowed with staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (pictured) Luke, a Met officer for six years, denied the attack during the trial at Wood Green Crown Court (pictured) She said: 'He then punched her in the back of her head and on her back. He then kicked her arm a number of times. She was bleeding heavily from her face. She offered no resistance.' The woman was handcuffed by two other officers and escorted from the hospital. Security staff told police they were appalled by Luke's behaviour, Miss Cohen said. Two of his colleagues reported Luke to a supervising officer and he was arrested later that evening. Susannah Stevens, for Luke, said he behaved 'calmly and politely' and accused the woman of 'completely exaggerating' the force used. The woman had behaved aggressively towards staff twice before and had grabbed Luke's groin during the melee, she said. Luke, a Met officer for six years, denies causing bodily harm. The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

"Some 4.5million E.On customers will get £24 off their bills this year after the energy giant decided to pass on the money it has saved from the falling price of gas on the wholesale markets . Energy consumers are finally set to get some relief from ever-higher bills after one of the Big Six fuel companies announced it was cutting its gas tariff by 3.5 per cent. Some 4.5million E.On customers will get £24 off their bills this year after the energy giant decided to pass on the money it has saved from the falling price of gas on the wholesale markets. The move could spark a price war among the leading power suppliers - but experts have warned that the cuts are 'trivial' and encouraged customers to shop around for the best deal. The latest figures suggest that even though wholesale gas prices have reached a four-year low - and are a fifth lower than they were last winter - most households have seen no respite in their heating and electricity costs. Ed Miliband's planned freeze in energy prices has been cited by company bosses as one cause of the persistently high prices, because firms fear being locked in to low tariffs if Labour comes to power after May's election. But now E.On has cut prices, the pressure is on the other Big Six suppliers – British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, EDF and Npower – to follow suit. The energy industry has come under fire over the past year due to its high profits, and faces a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority to determine whether it is in fact operating a competitive market. The fall in the price of wholesale gas is partly due to the fracking revolution in the US, and the discovery of shale gas in the UK and continental Europe. Energy firms' refusal to cut bills stands in contrast to the situation for motorists, who have seen the cost of petrol fall at the pumps in tandem with the tumbling price of oil in global markets. Soaring: Fuel prices have been rising sharply in recent years, as this House of Commons graph suggests . Falling: Wholesale gas prices have tumbled since the end of 2013 - but the costs have not been passed on . Labour wants to give Ofgem the ability to force companies to pass on wholesale price cuts to consumers - which industry estimates claim could knock £136 off the average bill. E.On UK chief executive Tony Cocker said Mr Miliband's proposed price freeze meant the company was 'undoubtedly taking a risk' by cutting tariffs. However he added the price cut and new, lower tariff demonstrate that E.On 'fundamentally believe in doing the right thing for our customers'. Threat: Energy firms have blamed Ed Miliband's promise to freeze gas bills for their reluctance to lower prices . Mr Cocker added that although oil prices have slumped, the gas price remains volatile, while other non-energy costs on customer bills have increased and are set to rise even further. A spokesman for energy regulator Ofgem said: 'This is a small step in the right direction. We have consistently called for suppliers to explain the growing gap between falling wholesale prices and retail prices. 'Cutting prices is an explanation that consumers will understand and in a competitive market we would expect others to follow suit.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey added: 'This will be very welcome news for many bill payers. Those who aren't seeing price cuts should check whether someone else can give them a better deal - many people have saved hundreds of pounds by switching supplier, which is now quicker and easier than ever before.' However, Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com insisted that the only way for customers to get a fair deal was by shopping around and changing supplier. 'All price cuts are welcome, even if they’re just a trivial 3.5 per cent on gas only,' he said. 'Yet the true revelation of this announcement is that it shines a light on the fact that most households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy. 'The real concern is that people will see this as a message that ""everything’s fine, my provider has cut prices, things are going to get better"" - no, this is wrong, only switchers get the cheapest prices. So do a comparison and see how much you are overpaying. 'While it is possible other companies will follow suit and shave down their standard prices slightly, I doubt we’ll see any real change until after the general election. 'Most providers are petrified of the potential Labour government's price freeze, which means if they cut now they’re likely locked in, even if wholesale prices rise again - so they’re gaming the system. If only Ed Miliband hadn’t pre-announced it, it would’ve been a strong policy.' Price cut: E.On customers will have the equivalent of £24 cut off their annual gas bill . Households have seen their energy bills rise by a third since 2010 yet figures show wholesale costs to be at a four-year low, consumer groups claim. The latest figures from Ofgem show that wholesale gas prices are down 19 per cent on last winter. But the drop is likely to surprise householders who have only seen harsh increases in their energy bills - while consumer groups and the government urge them to try and find a cheaper deal by switching between suppliers. The consumer website energyhelpline.com estimates that £136 could be knocked off the average bill if falls in the price of wholesale oil and gas were passed on to consumers. Industry regulator Ofgem wrote to the Big Six firms in the summer, asking them to explain how they were going to pass on falling wholesale costs to their customers. At the time, Rachel Fletcher, senior partner for the regulator's markets division, said its figures 'might be suggesting that there is room for price cuts or that you wouldn't be expecting prices to go up. 'As the regulator, it is not for us to tell companies how to set their prices. We are relying on the market to do that. 'But the thing that has concerned us is that in a situation where we have got wholesale costs coming down, you would be expecting some of the companies at the very least to be saying ""Here is an opportunity to gain market share by reducing our prices."" We haven't seen that.' Wholesale gas prices tend to move alongside oil prices, and Chancellor George Osborne has launched a Treasury investigation into whether energy companies are passing on the savings from falls in the wholesale price of oil. Energy expert at MoneySupermarket Stephen Murray said that while the cut is welcome, it is 'underwhelming'. He added: 'It's been three long years since customers last benefitted from price decreases to standard energy bills. 'To say it has been a long time coming would be the understatement of the year, but finally one of the nation's Big Six suppliers has responded to the falling price of wholesale gas and given bills the chop.' Other members of the Big Six refused to reveal whether or not they were planning to follow E.on's lead and cut prices for their customers. British Gas, Npower, EDF and Scottish Power all said they were constantly reviewing their tariffs, while a spokesman for SSE said: 'When we announced our unprecedented price freeze to 2016 we said we'd cut prices if we can.' Figures from Energy UK reveal that 1.3million customers moved from a large supplier to a small one during the past 12 months. This has forced the hands of the Big Six, which have all recently launched new tariffs in response to cut-price deals from smaller rivals - but these new independent suppliers still tend to offer the cheapest deals. Potential savings for households are now huge - some can shave off more than £400 a year from their bills - particularly for those that have never switched before. Last January E.On became the last of the Big Six firms to raise gas prices, by 3.7 per cent or £20 a year. However, year-forward wholesale gas prices have fallen 28 per cent over the last 12 months, according to consumer body energyhelpline.com. Its marketing director, Mark Todd, said E.On's move was a 'small step in the right direction'. He added: 'British Gas in particular should be able to follow quickly and with bigger cuts. They have the highest standard gas prices and benefit the most from wholesale gas price drops. 'Now is the time for suppliers to take action. Winter is here and this is when customers most need a price cut but suppliers with an eye to profit least want to give one. The reaction of the other suppliers will show their priorities - customers or profit.'

"A husband and wife who claim to be the world's oldest married couple have celebrated their joint birthdays - with a combined age of 211. Karam Chand celebrated reaching 109 on the same day his wife of nearly 90 years, Kartari, turned 102. The couple celebrated their birthdays with four generations of their family at their home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on Sunday. Karam Chand (pictured left) celebrated 109 on the same day his wife of 89 years, Kartari, (right) turned 102 . They claim to be the world's oldest married couple, tying the knot 89 years ago in December 1925 after meeting in India as teenagers. Their son Paul Chand said he was proud to see his parents celebrate almost a century of married life. He said: 'It has been a special day for my family and for us all to be able to come together like this. 'Relatives have flown in from India to be with us. 'People are so impressed by my parents. They always ask me: ""What do they eat? What are you feeding them and how do they stay so healthy?"" The couple are pictured here with their children at Mr Chand's 100th birthday party  - nine years ago . Mrs Chand says the secret to their happy marriage is getting along with each other and being family focussed . 'I tell them, ""If I knew that I would be eating the same thing myself!"" 'Everybody asks how they keep healthy and my answer is that for the last 20 years we have given them a stress-free life.' Mr Chand, who moved to the UK in 1965, has said in the past: 'Eat and drink what you want but in moderation. I have never held back from enjoying my life.' The retired mill worker smokes one cigarette a day before his evening meal and also drinks a tot of whiskey or brandy three to four times a week. Mrs Chand said: 'We have always eaten good wholesome food, there's nothing artificial in our diet but things like butter, milk and fresh yoghurt are what we like. 'We know that being married for 86 years is a blessing, but equally we will be ready to go when it's time. 'It's all up to the will of God, but we really have lived a good life.

"An information reward in exchange for tips in the murder of a 19-year-old who was burned alive has been boosted to $43,000 - as no prime suspect has been named. The FBI contributed $25,000 to the previous $18,000 figure, Panola County District Attorney John Champion told The Clarion Ledger. Mississippi teenager Jessica Chambers was burned alive on December 6, with 98 percent of the teenager's body covered in burns and her car also set on fire, the newspaper reported. Chambers died the next day. Scroll down for video . Victim: 19-year-old Jessica Chambers (seen left and right) was able to get out of her burning car on December 6, though 98 percent of her body was covered in burns . Fire: Flammable liquid had been poured on Jessica Chambers head of her murder . Authorities have spoken to over 100 people but there is no prime suspect in the teenager's murder, according to The Clarion Ledger. Chambers is believed to have told first responders the assailant's name, 'but even leads connected to that statement have not yet panned out,' the newspaper reported. 'We're still interviewing people,' Champion told the newspaper. 'Mostly we're in the process of re-interviewing people and going through everything with a fine-tooth comb.' He also said 'A lot of things in this world are money-driven, and we're hoping that there's someone out there that know something that sees the reward and is willing to come forward.' Both state and federal law enforcement agencies are working together on the case, according to the newspaper, which reported that gangs have been suggested as being tied to the murder. The teenager's father Ben Chambers told The Clarion Ledger, however, that a purported gang member reached out to him to offer sympathies. 'They're very upset about it,' Chambers said. 'They said you wouldn't even treat a dog like that.' Chambers also said 'We're just waiting and hoping that something will hurry up and happen, and praying and getting through it. If something doesn't happen we might go crazy.' Investigation: Authorities have spoken to over 100 people but there is no suspect in the teenager's murder .

Champion relayed difficulties with the investigation to The Associated Press last month. 'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done'  but 'we feel like somebody out there has heard something,' he said. Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby previously told Fox News that flammable liquid had been poured on Jessica Chambers ahead of her murder. Before she died, Chambers went to a gas station and in surveillance video a person off-camera called her away, the website reported. Gas station owner Ali Alsanai told Fox News that he was at the store on December 6 - and that he and Chambers had 'Just small talk. I wasn’t really paying attention because I was busy that day.' Alsanai has been ruled out, Champion told the news outlet.","An information reward in exchange for tips in the murder of a 19-year-old who was burned alive has been boosted to $43,000 .

"Moving on: Ann Curry announced today her departure from NBC. The 58-year-old served as a co-anchor on the Today show for just a year before she was replaced in June 2012 with the younger Savannah Guthrie . Ann Curry's toxic career at NBC is finally over. The former Today co-anchor is leaving the network more than two years after her tearful last day on the morning show to start her own production company. 'This is about reaching for the edge of the future in journalism, which we know is undergoing an irrevocable transition,' Curry said in the statement. 'In today’s world of fragmented media, this is the time to seize the opportunity to improve the way we distribute and even tell stories. 'I want to expand my drive to give voice to the voiceless to emerging platforms and produce both scripted and non-scripted content, in addition to continuing to report on-air about stories that matter.' NBC says they are helping finance Curry's new company, which will produce documentaries and special reports for news outlets. 'We’re proud to support Ann in her new venture, and we look forward to more of her exceptional storytelling,' NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Pat Fili-Krushel. said. 'She is committed to uncovering critical issues, humanizing them, and ultimately helping viewers understand and connect.' Curry, 58, has allegedly been in protracted negotiations with the network to end her contract, which is reportedly worth a lofty $12million. Though her stint as Today show anchor lasted just one year, she had been a reporter on the show for 15 years prior and was well liked by long-time viewers who reacted negatively to her abrupt dismissal in June 2012. Long time coming: The news comes two and half years after Curry's last day on Today in June 2012, when she was pushed to tears having to announce she was being kicked off the show . Uncomfortable: Curry's terse reaction when Lauer tried to comfort her with a kiss on the head fueled reports that he had a hand in her departure . Her last day, where she tearfully announced her premature Today show retirement, marked the beginning of a dip in ratings for the ensuing months - worsening the cutthroat rivalry with  Good Morning America. Curry's strained face as Lauer leaned over for a comforting kiss on the cheek on her last day did not go unnoticed, and fueled reports that he sabotaged her career by demanding she be moved during his own contract negotiations. Savannah Guthrie, 43, replaced Curry in the position. In an apparent attempt to save Lauer's withering reputation, and Today's ratings, then-executive producer Jim Bell eventually took the blame for Curry's departure. Curry has spent most of her career at NBC, joining the network as a correspondent for NBC News Chicago in 1990. She rose quickly at the network and was promoted to a position in New York, serving as a substitute news anchor for Lauer from 1994-1997. When Lauer left that position, Curry took over and became one of the longest-serving Today news anchors in history, behind Frank Blair. In May 2005, Curry transitioned to co-anchoring Dateline NBC with Stone Phillips, and later became the primary anchor when Phillips left in June 2007. She continued anchoring Dateline NBC and filling in occasionally on NBC Nightly News until she was made anchor at Today in 2011. Curry is responsible for getting some of the most high-profile interviews the Today show has seen during her period as news anchor and anchor. Perhaps her most memorable was an interview with then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, just a few days before he traveled to the U.S. to speak at the United Nations in 2009. Hypothetically, her most recent position as Today show 'anchor-at-large' and NBC Nightly News contributor would have presented her the opportunity to land more exclusive interviews like this, but she has been rarely seen on the network these past two years. 'Ann has been unhappy for a long time because she’s basically doing nothing, while NBC is unhappy that she has been paid a lot of money to do nothing,' a source at NBC told the New York Post. Curry is married to software executive Brian Ross and the couple have two children.","The 58-year-old NBC veteran co-anchored the Today show for just one year before she was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 43, in June 2012 .

"A girl who lost an arm and was severely disfigured after being attacked by two pitbulls when she was eight, has been awarded $72 million by a jury. Erin Ingram was mauled by the two dogs in 2010 in Lithonia, DeKalb County, Georgia, after she went outside to play basketball. The attack was so brutal that surgeons were forced to remove part of her arm, while the other arm is disfigured and her ankles are severely scarred. Erin Ingram, (pictured)  who lost an arm and was severely disfigured after being attacked by two pitbulls when she was eight, has been awarded $72 million by a jury . Local children said the same dogs (pictured) had bit them before, but on March 9, 2010, they were loose and attacked Erin . Local children said the same dogs had bit them before, but on March 9, 2010, they were loose and attacked Erin. 'They knocked me down,' she said, reports CBS46. 'They started biting me around the arms and ankles. I was screaming for help.' The attack was so brutal that surgeons were forced to remove part of her arm, while the other arm is disfigured and her ankles are severely scarred. Pictured: Erin before the attack and right, now . With new prosthetics needed as Erin grows and more operations expected,  her medical bills are expected to easily exceed $1 million . Erin can be heard screaming out in pain in a 911 call. When DeKalb Police Sgt. R. Peeler arrived, he said he used his baton to try to stop the dogs. But while the dogs backed away, they were still aggressive, he said in testimony reported by WGCL TV, and he shot the more aggressive dog in the head, killing it. The second dog ran away, but was later caught and euthanized. Neighbors tried in vain to get the dogs off the girl until police came and shot one of the dogs. Owner Twyann Vaughn, said the dogs broke out of the kennel when she wasn’t home. She was jailed for 16 months after being found guilty on six misdemeanor counts, including reckless conduct and owning a vicious dog. She apologized to the family in 2010. I'm just very, very sorry that it all happened,' Vaughn said. 'I'm just very, very sorry that it all happened and I just want to express that to the family. I hope Erin's doing well. I really do.' Her attorneys said the jury's award is one of the largest in a dog attack case, reports WSBTV. With new prosthetics needed as Erin grows and more operations, her medical bills are expected to easily exceed $1 million. About 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs each year and more than half of the victims are children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. About 800,000 people seek medical attention for the bites. Less than half of those people require treatment and about 16 die, the agency said. After children ages 5 to 9 years old, the agency said that seniors represent the largest group at risk, followed by letter carriers.","Erin Ingram was attacked by two dogs in 2010 in DeKalb County, Georgia .

"Free woman: Nawal Msaad, 27, pictured  after she was cleared of funding ISIS jihadists at the Old Bailey, has revealed that she has been stopped from leaving the UK by anti-terror police . A student cleared of trying to smuggle ISIS cash from Britain to Syria in her knickers has said an anti-terror squad has now stopped her boarding a plane to see her unwell grandmother. Nawal Msaad, 27, 'could not stop crying' as she was questioned by ten police officers at Gatwick and missed her flight to Tangier in Morocco on Sunday. The singer, who was dubbed 'The Jihottie' online during her terror trial, believes she is on a British watch list despite not having extremist views and being cleared of any terror charges during a four-week trial last summer. Last year she was caught with £16,000 in euros stuffed in her underwear at Heathrow as she attempted to board a flight to Istanbul, but a jury agreed  that she was tricked into being a mule by an old school friend. But the new incident at Gatwick on Sunday means she is unable to get on with her life. She told the Evening Standard: 'I noticed around 10 officers came to the gate and I jokingly said, 'Are you all here for me?' 'I explained that I was visiting my sick grandmother, and that either way I don't need an excuse to go to Morocco — my family are from there. I couldn't stop crying I was so upset'. After 35 minutes of being searched and questioned her flight departed without her. She said: 'I'm really annoyed personally. They were apologetic as usual, but they'll just do it again. They said they would get me on another flight, (but) there are no direct flights for a few days so I have to wait.' Police was stopped under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, used by police to establish if an individual is  linked or involved in terrorism. Sussex Police said today: 'On Sunday afternoon a woman due to depart Gatwick Airport on an outbound flight for Tangier was briefly stopped and interviewed by Sussex officers at the Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. 'She was spoken to for 35 minutes and in the meantime the flight departed without her. 'We apologised for the fact that she had missed her flight and made efforts to find her an alternative flight but to no avail. We therefore supplied her with a rail warrant to enable her to return to her UK address that evening. We also offered to fund her eventual flight. 'The reasons for stopping passengers under Schedule 7 are not disclosed but specific suspicion of involvement in terrorism offences is not required. The woman was not detained under the Act, a procedure which only takes place after one hour has elapsed.'

"The owners of a village pub called the Prince of Wales in Essex were shocked to be sent a gas bill for £1,800 addressed to 'HRH Prince Charles' - even though they don't have gas. Terry Gaskin, 57, who has run the pub in Broxted near Stansted Airport with his partner for three years, initially thought the letter from British Gas was  a prank and put it to one side. He explained that it was only after reading it a second time that he grew concerned as the notice indicated that someone at his address had accumulated a debt of £1,773.30. Terry Gaskin and his partner Karen Rand (left) have run the pub in Essex for three years and were shocked when a letter arrived for a debt of £1,800 for the Prince of Wales (right) 'It came on Saturday and I thought it was a joke at first,' he told MailOnline. 'But then I looked at it again. It's all official and I thought that's not a joke. 'The letter is very polite, but what was worrying was this amount of debt was being sent to my postal address and they said they had tried to contact a number of times. 'But the most surprising part of all is that there is no gas in the village at all. We don't run off gas and never have done.' The letter from Tracey Swenne, head of business debt operations with British Gas, said : 'Your Royal Highness. Important information about your account.

'We contacted you a number of times to tell you about the debt owing on your account and to agree payment. 'Unfortunately the debt has still not been paid.' It adds that the debt on the account is still outstanding and had now been transferred to a debt recovery company, called the PRA Group. Mr Gaskin said he has not heard from British Gas or the debt recovery firm since receiving the letter. 'We were busy hosting a group of Morris dancers yesterday so I didn't get the chance to call, but I am expecting them to get in touch today,' he said. A British Gas spokesman said: 'His Royal Highness can rest assured that he was not the intended recipient of this letter. 'We're looking into how the error occurred so that it can be resolved.' The Prince of Wales, who lives at Clarence House in London, generates his primary source of income from the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 133,658 acres of land.

"‘His Serene Highness Prince Oliver von Mecklenburg-Schwerin’: Really Oliver Trusgnach, who was arrested in Spain after 11 years on the run . A fantasist who pretended to be a German aristocrat was jailed yesterday after being convicted of stealing more than £115,000 to fund his lavish lifestyle. Belgian national Oliver Trusgnach, who is gay and called himself ‘His Serene Highness Prince Oliver von Mecklenburg-Schwerin’, was arrested in Spain after 11 years on the run. He previously hit the headlines after falsely accusing former Belgian prime minister of sexually abusing him as a child. A judge heard that Trusgnach, 39, spent three years forging his boss’s signature on cheques while working for a prestigious antiques dealer to fund a champagne and cocaine lifestyle and nights out in London. He had been appointed gallery manager at the HW Harvey antiques shop in Witney, Oxfordshire, in May 2000. Alexandra Bull, prosecuting, told Oxford Crown Court that Trusgnach had stolen a total of £115,775 from the English furniture specialist until he fled the country in 2003. She said: ‘A minimum of 77 cheques were stolen from the company, written out as payable to himself and Mr Harvey’s signature was forged. ‘Beyond the actual financial loss of course, there was also the loss of goodwill from Mr Harvey’s trade suppliers who were left unpaid.’ Trusgnach fled Britain and spent time at his parents’ home in Belgium before moving to Germany and then to Calle can Marti Feliu, in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. He was eventually tracked down after a Europe-wide manhunt and arrested last July. He admitted the fraud and theft charges at Oxford Crown Court in October. Mark Dixon, defending, told the court that Trusgnach had stolen the cash because he had started living a lifestyle he could not afford on his £18,500 salary. ‘He got into a party lifestyle in London and was spending money on alcohol and cocaine,’ he said. Mr Dixon said Trusgnach was relieved to have been caught and appealed for leniency because his client pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. ‘When the walls started to crumble and he was being spotted, he left and went home,’ he said. However, jailing Trusgnach for two years and three months, Judge Ian Pringle said: ‘I can understand his relief but it probably pales in comparison to the relief of Mr and Mrs Harvey.’ 'He got into a party lifestyle in London': Mark Dixon, defending, told the court that Trusgnach had stolen the cash because he had started living a lifestyle he could not afford on his £18,500 salary . The Ditchley Park house where Trugsnach rented a property: Trusgnach, 39, spent three years forging his boss’s signature on cheques while working for a prestigious antiques dealer to fund a cocaine lifestyle . Mr Harvey branded Trusgnach a ‘fantasist’ who lied to elevate his social position. He said Trusgnach had been living in the Ditchley Park estate, Oxfordshire, with his boyfriend Brandon, who styled himself as Lord Dashwood of the Thomson publishing empire. However, Mr Harvey had no idea about his party lifestyle and was told the pair had been at dinners at the German consul or out with dignitaries in London – not partying in Soho. Andrew Hennell, who employed Brandon Thomson at his antique store in Woodstock, added: ‘They both lived a great lifestyle in Ditchley Park. They were living it up.’ Mr Harvey branded the 27-month sentence ‘light’ compared with the damage Trusgnach’s crimes had done to the business his father founded in 1950.","Belgian national Oliver Trusgnach forged his boss’s signature on cheques .

"Finding water on Mars might be a bit of a challenge, but if you want to find ice you need look no further than the Martian poles. Here there is an abundant source of carbon dioxide ice that exists for most of the year. And in stunning images from Nasa the ice can be seen forming some bizarre and familiar shapes - in this case a 'happy face' on the surface. Scroll down for video . Sharp-eyed NAsa researchers have spotted a 'face' on Mars. They noticed the eyes, nose and upturned mouth shapes at one of many monitoring sites at the South pole residual cap (SPRC). Images are taken throughout the Martian year to document changes in carbon dioxide ice coverage . The image was captured by Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which has been in orbit around the red planet since 10 March 2006. Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia,  when people see patterns  in random, unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places. On the red planet, one of the most famous is the 'face on Mars' spotted by one of the Viking orbiters in 1976. This was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes. Researchers noticed the face-like feature at one of many monitoring sites at the South Pole residual cap (SPRC) on Mars. This is a region where carbon dioxide ice can be seen shifting throughout the year as the Martian climate changes. The face appears to have a mount, nose and even an upturned mouth to denote a smile. In the image the face is approximately 1,640ft (500m) across. The features highlight different levels of elevation, and also different ice densities, on the surface. Towards the edge of the face the dark areas show steep cliffs that descent from the top of this raised area to the ground below. The image shows a popular spot where one of the features resembles a smiley face that is approximately 1,640ft (500m) across. The planetary feature was captured by HiRISE, one of six instruments on Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In this zoomed-out image a 'rabbit' can also be seen to the right of the face . Carbon dioxide ice is common at the Martian poles, where temperatures are cold enough for it to exist. Away from the poles, however, ice is harder to find on the surface as it quickly evaporates onto the atmosphere. ‘Images are taken throughout the Martian year to document changes in carbon dioxide ice coverage,’ Nasa’s Tre Gibbs said in a video. ‘This image shows a popular spot where one of the features represents a smiley face that is approximately 500 metres across. ‘If you smile at Mars, sometimes it smiles back.’ The image was captured by Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (illustration shown), which has been in orbit around the red planet since 10 March 2006 .

"Lorraine White has been given permission to run her 'photography and mild fetish play business' A dominatrix who calls herself Princess Lucina has won planning permission to turn a warehouse into a sex fetish dungeon - because it'll help the local economy. Stockport Council has given Lorraine White the go-ahead to run her 'photography and mild fetish play' business in a converted warehouse at the Vauxhall Industrial Estate in Reddish. She was already using the premises without planning permission but was forced to submit a retrospective application in September after a complaint was made to the local authority. Planning officers have now approved the application, which asked for opening hours of 11am to 7pm, Tuesday to Saturday. A council spokesman said: 'The proposal would improve the economic, social and environmental conditions of the area. 'It therefore comprises sustainable development and the local planning authority [Stockport Council] worked proactively and positively to issue the decision without delay.' The fetish club was discovered in 2012 when firemen were unable to get into the building after it caught fire because of all the locked doors. Miss White, who refers to herself as a 'Manchester mistress' and 'sensual sadist, was fined £8,000 for breaching health and safety laws at the time. Firemen finally gained access and found a trove of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices in the basement. They also discovered several canisters of nitrous oxide and laughing gas - also know as 'hippie crack' - which White’s clients used. At the hearing at Stockport Magistrates Court Miss White said men were generally restrained or gagged in the dungeon, but nothing was too severe. At the time she said: 'It involved a lot of humiliation, doing domestic work and dressing up in women’s clothes.' Despite that the reaction to the club has been largely positive and the council received five responses to its consultation - all in favour. She was using the converted warehouse at the Vauxhall Industrial Estate in Reddish without permission . White has previously been fined for breaching health and safety laws after firefighters were unable to get in .

"You might think Amazon is the cheapest place to go for online purchases, but a new study has revealed this isn't always the case. Researchers have found that the Seattle-based company fools users into thinking they are getting a good deal by tweaking their prices a number of times each hour. Overall, the study found that the online marketplace harnesses the 'psychology of price perception' in buyers by making millions of individual price changes a day. Scroll down for video . Researchers have found that the Seattle-based company fools users into thinking they are getting a good deal by tweaking their prices, such as on the pictured router, a number of times each hour . For instance, when it's offering its biggest discounts on popular products, such as a TV, it will increase the prices of its less popular items to make a profit. According to a white paper by Boomerang Commerce, the technique means Amazon often appears to be beating its competition on low prices. 'Amazon may not actually be the lowest-priced seller of a particular product in any given season,' the report reads. 'But its consistently low prices on the highest viewed and best-selling items drive a perception among consumers that Amazon has the best prices overall – even better than Walmart.' One example is when a best-selling router (pictured) was priced 20 per cent below Walmart's price, a different model was priced at 29 per cent more expensive than it cost on Walmart . Last month, a glitch allowed online shoppers to buy their products on Amazon for 1p. Some firms lost tens of thousands of pounds in a single hour during Friday night’s disastrous software malfunction. Customers cashed in by placing 1p orders in bulk, in a ‘supermarket sweep’ on products ranging from clothes and toys to home furnishings and health products. Some took to Twitter to boast of ordering goods worth thousands of pounds for a few pence. The problem affected firms on Amazon’s Marketplace – which allows independent sellers to offer their goods alongside Amazon’s own – using third-party business software called RepricerExpress. It is designed to keep them competitive by automatically repricing items on Amazon so they are cheaper than others in the digital market. News of the pricing glitch spread fast on social media, with dozens of people taking to Twitter to report the bargains they had snapped up thanks to the technical glitch. Amazon said many orders had been cancelled . Boomerang uses the example of a $350 (£230) Samsung TV that was discounted $250 (£165) on Black Friday. But at the same time, Amazon increased the price of the HDMI cable needed for the TV, as the product would not change the price perception of the larger purchase. Another example, according to Business Insider, is when a best-selling router was priced 20 per cent below Walmart's price, a different model was priced at 29 per cent more expensive than it cost on Walmart. 'Competitive pricing has moved beyond weekly adjustments and price matching,' said Guru Hariharan, founder Boomerang Commerce. 'The Producer Price Index sheds light on the complexity and the speed at which retailers adjust their pricing to drive buyers and revenue.'

"Cuttlefish may be known for their enormous eyes and incredible  ability to 'disappear' into their surroundings, but it's the creature’s undulating swimming technique that has inspired roboticists to create a mechanical replica. A team of Swiss students have created a four-finned machine called Sepios that glides through water with incredible ease. The almost silent robot is designed for underwater exploration in areas where noise distresses wildlife and, unlike propellers, its method of propulsion does not stir up sediment, turning water cloudy. Scroll down for video . A team of Swiss students have created a four-finned machine called Sepios (pictured) that ripples through the water efficiently. They were inspired by the undulation motion of the cuttlefish, but the robot has more fins. IT is almost silent and could one day be used for underwater photography projects . The machine was constructed by engineering students at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich who were inspired by nature. It is 27 inches (70cm) long  with a ‘wingspan’ of 37 inches (95cm) nad weighs 51 lbs (23 kg). Its symmetrical fins were inspired by the cuttlefish and allow it to move in any direction, because they can be steered individually. While the students do not explain the exact construction of the fins, they are soft with rods inside for rigidity. They are controlled by a rippling motion using nine servo motors attached to each fin where they join the main body of the robot. The robot's symmetrical fins were inspired by the cuttlefish (pictured) and allow it to move in any direction, because they can be steered individually. Cuttlefish have lateral fins which they use as stabilisers, and for steering and propulsion. They move forward by forcibly expelling water through a siphon . Length: 27 inches (70cm) Wingspan: 37 Inches (95cm) Weight: 51 lbs (22.7kg) Parts: More than 4,700 including 36 servos – 9 on each fin . Max depth: 32 ft (10 m) Top speed: 1.1 mph (1.8kph) Max time underwater: 1 hour, 30 minutes . The students claim their robot is more environmentally friendly than devices with propellers, which can be noisy and get their blades tangled in sea grass, for example. They tested their invention in a French river where they navigated through weeds and grass as well as man-made obstacles to show the agility of the robot. In contrast to propeller noise, which can stress and confuse marine creatures such as whales and make it hard for dolphins to find food, Sephios is virtually silent. The students wrote on their website: ‘its fishlike appearance and low disturbance are ideal for closing in on fish, making it the ideal device for marine life filming.’ They are working on adding an extra on-board, lasers and a measurement unit to help the robot avoid obstacles that could cause it to crash. They also want to simplify the current controls to make the robot operable using a single mouse. The cuttlefish can change the colour and pattern of its skin to stay hidden from predators. And scientists are looking to the fish’s camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers, which could help them to blend in with their surroundings in realtime. Last January, experts discovered new details about neural organs called chromatophores, which enable the ‘chameleon of the sea’ to virtually disappear. Scientists at Harvard University and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) believe their findings could also lead to new types of paint, cosmetics and consumer electronics – as well as smart uniforms for soldiers that can react to surroundings in realtime. Scientists are looking to the cuttlefish's (pictured) camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers, which could help them to blend in with their surroundings as well as the cephalopod . The cuttlefish has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues, but scientists have had an incomplete understanding of the biological, chemical and optical functions that make this adaptive coloration possible. To regulate its colour, the cuttlefish relies on a vertically arranged assembly of three optical components: the leucophore, which is a near-perfect light scatterer that reflects it uniformly over the entire visible spectrum, the iridophore, which is a reflector containing a stack of thin films and the chromatophore. This layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours. The team of researchers showed that within the chromatophore, tethered pigment granules regulate light through absorbance, reflection, and fluorescence - in effect functioning as tiny light-sensitive elements, even as the chromatophore changes in size. ‘The cuttlefish uses an ingenious approach to materials composition and structure - one that we have never employed in our engineered displays,’ said co-author Evelyn Hu, Tarr-Coyne Professor of Applied Physics.","Students at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich, made the bot .

"Dozens of squatters were evicted by bailiffs from former TV offices in central London today. The group of around 40 people had been squatting at a building off Tottenham Court Road and had been calling themselves Love Activists - a group known to campaign about the rising number of homeless people. Around 20 former residents of the Rathbone Place building, which used to be home to the offices of the Nickelodeon TV channel, were seen arguing with bailiffs as they were told to leave the building. Scroll down for video . Squatters argued with bailiffs as they were evicted from the former Nickelodeon offices in London today . Love Activists had previously occupied the former Royal Bank of Scotland building in London in December before they were kicked out on Christmas Eve. They had pledged to make Christmas dinner for homeless people at the site and despite being evicted returned to the site on Christmas Day. They moved to Arthur Stanley House, a former hospital building in Tottenham Street, in late December but were evicted without warning on January 5. As the latest eviction took place around 20 people carrying sleeping bags and dressed in heavy coats stood outside the building arguing with bailiffs. Some hooded activists wearing scarves across their faces banged on the windows and shouted abuse at three bailiffs standing inside. An ex-soldier among the evicted squatters said: 'We've been here a couple of weeks, I'm not sure how long. 'The bailiffs were really brutal. They've just been really heavy-handed. One girl got hit on the head and another guy got hit on the knee. Around 40 squatters had been staying at the former Nickelodeon TV offices in Tottenham Court Road . Squatters were seen arguing with bailiffs and police as they were evicted from the site . 'This morning I went to go and get some breakfast around Tottenham Court Road and when I got back the building was sealed off. 'There was a bailiff standing outside saying ""you're not getting in."" I was heartbroken - it's a case of moving every couple of weeks. 'I'm an ex soldier. I was in the Army for seven years. I went to Iraq and then these bailiffs treat us like animals. It's disgusting. 'There are two ex soldiers in this building. There were disabled people here. 'I've been squatting for over a month - there's just nowhere to stay and renting isn't an option. It's soul destroying. It's all we've got.' The squatters called themselves Love Activists - who also took over an old RBS building before Christmas . The former soldier said he had got evicted two weeks ago and was now looking at sleeping on the street again, as forecasters predict snow could reach London by the end of the week. Police were on hand to help bailiffs, who had an order from the owner of the building to remove the squatters. No arrests were made. A female squatter, who did not want to be named, said: 'A bailiff hit my head and then a policeman dragged me out as if I was a towel or something. 'It's appalling. I still feel dazed and in shock. He was shouting and I kept telling him to leave me alone.' The building has been empty since 2012 when Nickelodeon moved out to new offices in Camden Town. Planning permission has been granted to demolish the Rathbone Place building and develop new commercial premises at the site, which is understood to be owned by Royal London Property. MailOnline has contacted the company for comment.","Dozens of squatters evicted from a building in central London earlier today .

Kim Kardashian, 34, went bra-less on a night out with husband Kanye West  in New York last week, refusing to let the Arctic temperatures stop her from making a daring fashion statement . Speaking about the look - and whether she thought she could pull it off - Deni said: 'I feel very exposed - I don't mind showing cleavage created by a good push-up bra, but this plunging top is quite extreme.' While Kim's garment is no doubt designer - and comes with a high-end price tag - Deni got dressed up in her daring black ensemble from New Look and H&M. 'I feel quite sexy and confident, but also self-conscious,' Deni added. Deni said that she felt quite sexy and confident in her plunging top in High Street Kensington, but also self-conscious in her revealing outfit . Eyes right! Deni got lots of attention from passers-by on the street in her cleavage-baring outfit . Deni attempted to emulate confident Kate as best she could with a photographer in tow, striding nonchalantly along in High Street Kensington on a very cold Friday afternoon - much to the amusement of passers-by. Lucien Joyce, a 27-year-old from London, paid particular interest when he saw Deni walking past. He said: 'She's showing too much flesh for the temperature but she looks really nice and I like her outfit.' So did he think Deni pulls it off better than Kate or Kim? Lucien said: 'A celebrity is a real woman at the end of the day, someone like Kim just celebrates her body more than the next person. 'If a lady wants to show off her assets like Deni is, then she should go for it.' Getting an eyeful: Lucian Joyce, a 27-year-old from London, paid particular interest to Deni as he strolled past . Deni copied Kate Hudson and Kim Kardashian's style by striding confidently down Kensington High Street . Deni received more than a few glances - especially from passing men. 'You look amazing, love', 'are you a model?' and 'smoking' were just a few of the comments from gawping guys walking past. An older lady who didn't want to be named added: 'She's young, she can get away with it, she's having fun', while a few school boys stopped to take some snaps on their mobile phones. One passer by, Martin, a 26-year-old who works in the music industry in London, stopped for a lingering glance. He said: 'She looks great, I have absolutely no complaints about her look. 'I don't think anyone can judge her and if you do, that says more about your character than her look.' 'You look amazing, love', 'are you a model?' and 'smoking' were just a few of the comments that Deni got . Deni bought her daring black ensemble from New Look and H&M and took it to High Street Kensington to find out what the reaction would be . Sharing his opinion, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Granted, Sienna, Kim and Kate gets chauffeured from one place to the next, and probably have an on-hand stylist with an iron, so their dresses will always look perfect. 'But for us mere mortals, a plunging top or dress like this is possible with the same amount of glamour. 'As long as you are always on boob-watch, and have emergency tit-tape in your bag, you'll be fine and Deni looks amazing.' This isn't the first time that Kim or Kate have dared to bare and their fashionable friends Cara Delevingne, Gwyneth Paltrow and Miranda Kerr have all trialed the trend, too. Speaking about the new extreme cleavage fashion, celebrity stylist Claire Wacey, said: 'The trend to show off more cleavage is great provided you have a pert, toned bust. 'If, however, your breasts do not defy gravity and require bras of steel to keep them in place do not attempt this trend.' Passer by Martin, a 26-year-old who works in the music industry in London, stopped for a lingering glance at Deni . She continued: 'If attempting then ensure that you only show the curve of the bust, either in the centre or at the top rather than creating a pushed together ""Bum Boob"". 'Look for dresses that will separate and lift the bust so that the look remains classy. 'Invest in strong tit-tape, like Boots stock Eylure tit tape, which is great to keep everything in place.' Simon added: 'Anyone can add a chic blazer over a gown, I've been suggesting this particular styling in my work for years. 'It's super elegant, sophisticated and screams of power-woman, plus, it's a great option of jacket on a cold night out. 'I'd like to think that only those women with the ""right"" boobs for this dress would attempt it. 'That's not to say there isn't something for everyone, but when they are on show like this, you need to think carefully if you can go without support.'

"A rare letter penned by firebrand civil rights protester Malcolm X shortly after he converted to Islam and changed his name is expected to fetch $20,000 when it goes under the hammer. The six-page note, written in 1950, is one of the earliest known examples of the black power campaigner using the Malcolm X moniker for which he would later become famous. In the letter, written from inside jail, he discusses his love for the Boston music scene, and jazz in particular, while grappling with the demons of his 'sinful past'. Historic: This letter, written in 1950 by Malcolm X as he was  in jail, discusses his love for jazz music, his 'fear' about returning to that sinful life, and is one of the first times he signed using 'X' instead of his last name . The activist, who was born Malcolm Little, was sent to prison in 1946 for larceny and breaking and entering after a life of petty crime and trouble with the law. But once in prison he discovered Islam and joined the Lost-Found Nation of Islam, dropping his 'slave' last name and adopting the letter 'X', symbolic of a stolen identity, in its place. Malcolm X worked in jazz clubs as a youth, but after being jailed he converted to Islam, renounced his former life, and became a civil rights campaigner . The letter, which will be auctioned later this month by RR Auction in Boston, is addressed from prison to an unknown member of the Islamic Nation movement. In it, Malcolm discusses his love of jazz music, calling the musicians 'wielders of souls', and praising its 'comforting effects'. However, he also admits that he fears 'the temptations of that life and its memories', adding: 'I steer as far clear from the subject as possible unless I know the fellows are brothers [Muslims].' In the note he asks his fellow believer to send him a list of all the jazz musicians he knows that follow Islam so he can also write to them from his cell. At the end of the note, he signs 'As Salaam Alaikum, your Brother, Malcolm X', one of the first known instances where he used his new name. As Salaam Alaikum is a standard greeting or farewell in Islam, and literally translates as 'peace be upon you', but is usually interpreted as 'hello' or 'goodbye' when used in this context. After he was paroled from prison in 1952 Malcolm X went on to challenge the mainstream non-violent civil rights movement of Martin Luther King Jr. Instead he called on his followers to defend themselves from white aggression 'by any means necessary', and advocated black rifle clubs. His fundamental belief, taken from the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, was that the white man was the devil, and that blacks could never live in harmony with whites. His autobiography, and numerous public speeches, formed the basis for the black power movement which gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.","Malcolm Little jailed in 1946 for larceny and burglary after troubled youth .

The new cases include three reported Monday in Southern California, including two in San Bernardino County and one in Long Beach. Long Beach City Health Officer Mitchell Kushner said in a release that January 3 potential exposure sites in town included a Total Wellness Club, supermarket Stater Brothers, a Bank of America, and a Wells Fargo branch. The exposure would have been from 9am to 11:30am. Kushner said 'The Long Beach resident spent time at the Disneyland Resort in the City of Anaheim, during the period of December 16-20, 2014.' Other locations have been listed by officials as potential exposure sites, The Los Angeles Times reported. They include Cabazon's Morongo Casino on January 4 between 6 and 11:30pm, Chino's Magic Wok on January 6 between 3 and 5pm, Whittier's Jimmy Warehouse Sportscard between 3 and 10pm, as well as Urgent Care at Pomona Valley Health Center on January 8 between 3:56 and 5:05 pm, also located in Chino. Last week the CDPH said it had confirmed cases in Alameda, Orange, Pasadena, Riverside, as well as San Diego. There is also a case in Ventura County, according to The Los Angeles Times. CDPH said last week that 'Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and within a few days a red rash appears, usually first on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body. Measles is a highly infectious, airborne disease.' The agency also explained 'Measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000. However, large measles outbreaks have occurred in Western Europe, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines in recent years. 'Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles. Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic.' Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance.

"A South Carolina judge declared a mistrial this morning in the case of a white ex-police chief charged with murder for shooting dead an unarmed black man in 2011. The jury in Orangeburg deliberated for 12 hours before telling Circuit Judge Edgar Dickson early on Tuesday that they were deadlocked. Nine of the jurors voted to convict the former cop, Richard Combs, while three were not convinced of his guilt, Prosecutor David Pascoe said. Combs, a former Eutawville police chief, was charged after shooting 54-year-old Bernard Bailey three times in May 2011 as he tried to arrest him on an obstruction of justice warrant in the town hall parking lot. Pascoe, who argued that the warrant had been trumped up, said on Tuesday that he will evaluate his case but plans to try Combs again. It is not yet clear when that will happen. Scroll down for video . Mistrial: Former Eutawville Police Chief Richard Combs sits with lawyers during his murder trial last week. Early on Tuesday, the judge declared a mistrial after the jury could not agree on his guilt . 'I'm going to take a little time, but we're going forward,' Pascoe said. Defense attorney Wally Fayssoux, who maintains Combs is innocent, said it had been a long week. 'We're disappointed we didn't get a result, but I think both sides feel that way,' Fayssoux said. The defense said that the shooting had nothing to do with race and argued Combs fired in self-defense when he was caught in the door of Bailey's moving truck as he tried to arrest him. During closing arguments, Pascoe said Combs frequently changed his story to match the evidence and was confident he would never be held responsible for killing Bailey because he was a cop. Bernard Bailey, 54, was shot in the town hall parking lot in 2011 after trying to get away from Combs . 'He thought he got away with it because he wears a badge. Prove him wrong,' Pascoe said in a passionate, hour-long argument during which he slammed the gun used in the killing on a table and had an assistant sit in the witness chair so he could carefully recreate the shooting. Pascoe also told jurors that Combs had delayed serving the arrest warrant for seven weeks in an effort to show off for his law enforcement friends. Fayssoux said the case hinges on the three seconds in which Combs was trapped in the door of Bailey's pickup as it rolled in reverse, not the seven weeks it took Combs to serve the warrant. 'Does he want to go home to his family?' Fayssoux said of Combs. 'Or does he hope the truck doesn't roll over the top of him?' Jurors had the choice between murder and voluntary manslaughter. Murder carries 30 years to life in prison without parole. Voluntary manslaughter carries two to 30 years in prison, and would have meant Bailey's killing was illegal but happened in the heat of the moment. Judge Dickson authorized the voluntary manslaughter option Monday. The seeds of the fatal confrontation were sown seven weeks earlier when Combs stopped Bailey's daughter for a broken taillight. The daughter called her father and Bailey came to the side of the road. Sometime later, the chief secured a warrant for obstruction of justice, but waited several weeks to serve it until Bailey came to Town Hall the day before his daughter's trial. Combs had pulled over Briana Bailey (seen in court) during a traffic stop on March 15, 2011 (pictured right) and she called her father. Seven weeks later, Combs tried to arrest him for obstructing justice in the incident . Gunned down: Combs claims he shot Bailey after he became caught in his truck door as he drove away from the town hall. Here, Captain Lacra Jenkins shows the jury a photograph of Bailey's truck after the incident . Pascoe asserted that Combs wanted to make a display of arresting Bailey, when he could have instead asked for help from sheriff's deputies. After Combs told Bailey he was being arrested for obstruction of justice, witnesses said Bailey left Combs' office and went for his truck. Combs followed. Pascoe said Combs could have stepped away from the truck door, but instead stood there and fired three shots into Bailey. The prosecutor said several things made it clear the truck was stopped and Bailey was trying to give up: The victim's foot was on the brake, and three shell casings were found close together along with Combs' dropped handcuffs. But Combs' lawyer said all that mattered was that the chief feared for his life during the three seconds it took to shoot. He said Combs had no pepper spray or Taser and had no option but his gun. On the stand: Prosecutor David Pascoe, left, shows Combs the weapon he used to shoot Bailey during Combs' testimony on Friday. Pascoe has said he intends to bring Combs to trial again . Eutawville suspended Combs after the shooting and dismissed him several months later. The town reached a $400,000 wrongful death settlement with Bailey's family. Although Combs was white and Bailey was black, race hasn't been front and center of the case. Pascoe contends Combs was angry at Bailey for just trying to show him up. 'If I'm wrong, find him not guilty,' Pascoe said. 'Give him back his badge, give him back his gun and let him pull somebody else's daughter over.'","Richard Combs was accused of murder after shooting dead Bernard Bailey while attempting to arrest him outside the Eutawville town hall in 2011 .

"A grieving widower has blasted phone company EE after they charged him £62 to cancel his wife's £5-a-month phone, just weeks after she died of cancer. Terry Conway, 73, from Clifton in Nottingham, was left heartbroken when wife Pauline died aged 74 on November 27, after a short battle with lung cancer. The great-grandfather-of-four decided to wait until the new year to sort out the financial affairs of his wife of 52 years, and contacted the phone company last week. Terry Conway has blasted the mobile network EE for telling him he needed to pay £62 to end his dead wife's £5-a-month phone, just weeks after she died of cancer . But he was left shocked when two different call handlers both demanded he pay £62 to end the contract - despite it only costing £5.49-a-month. Mr Conway and his family are now boycotting the firm and have refused to pay any further charges. Problems arose because although the phone was Mrs Conway's, the account was in her husband's name. Mrs Conway's phone was a 16-year-old Nokia 3210 and Mr Conway paid EE £5.49-a-month for a SIM-only deal. It included 500 minutes, 500 text and 250mb of data every month. Mr Conway, a former HGV driver said: 'When Pauline passed it was very sudden. She had been diagnosed with cancer months before but when her time came it was all over very quickly. EE have agreed to close the account without the cancellation fee being paid as a 'gesture of goodwill' 'I was in bits, so I decided to leave sorting out her affairs until after the new year and the funeral. 'So I set about sorting everything out last week, I had heard of people having some problems with the government groups like the DWP before, but they were as good as gold and sorted it out. 'So I called EE and explained my wife had died and I would not be using the phone. 'I said it would be switched off the moment I finished the call and never turned on again. 'So I couldn't believe it when the very nice man on the line said 'fine, that will be £62'. 'I explained again that my wife had died and couldn't use the phone, so he transferred me to another person, a lovely girl, who again told me I needed to pay the money. 'It was only a sim contract, just a little one. My wife never wanted a fancy phone or anything, so just took out a year-long contract. 'She used to be on pay-as-you-go but when she was diagnosed she knew she would be in and out of hospital and wanted the phone to make the odd call and mainly send texts. 'It was barely ever used, and won't be now so I just wanted to end it. 'Now I will be ending my own contract with them when it finishes, as will my family and a lot of my friends. We're all disgusted. 'I'm having to get on with life without Pauline, which is hard enough without added needless stresses. 'I had to use her phone to make these calls, how do they think that made me feel. 'She was such a lovely woman, the church was amazed by how many people turned up at her funeral to pay their respects. 'She used to volunteer, especially after she retired from Sainsbury's and I was still driving the HGV. Mr Conway has blasted EE for their 'lack of compassion' billing him just weeks after his wife's death . 'The account was in my name, but I didn't use it. You would think people would have some compassion.' Mr Conway's daughter Lynne Conway, 50, added: 'Since mum passed away, dad has been heartbroken. They were together for 55 years and married for 52. 'Cancelling the phone contract was hard enough for him because he gets upset talking about mum, so he was very upset when they told him it would cost him £62. 'I don't think it's right they should be charging him that - it's not his fault that he had to cancel the contract. 'If he had been cancelling it to change networks then fair enough, but he was doing it because somebody died.' EE have agreed to close the account without the cancellation fee being paid. A spokesman said: 'We of course close accounts without any cancellation fees if a customer has passed away. 'In this instance, the account was in the husband's name, and given this exceptional circumstance we have closed the account and waived the balance as gesture of goodwill.'","Terry Conway, 73, was heartbroken when Pauline, his wife of 52 years, died .

"A rare collection of 36 classic Corvettes that were hidden away for 25 years is being prepared for sale - and one model alone is expected to sell for half a million dollars. The classic American muscle cars were originally won in a competition organised by music channel VH1 and were then sold to German-born graphic artist Peter Max who wanted to incorporate them in his work. The collection consists of every model of Corvette released between 1953 and 1989. Scroll down for video . A rare collection of 36 classic Corvettes that were hidden away for more than 20 years are being prepared for sale - and one model alone is expected to sell for half a million dollars; pictured above is the co-owner of the collection, Adam Heller . The classic American muscle cars were originally won in a competition organised by music channel VH1 and were then sold to German-born graphic artist Peter Max. The cars were all released consecutively between 1953 and 1989 . Mr Heller had reportedly offered to work with Mr Max to restore the cars for sale and then split the proceeds, something the artist declined. However, Mr Max was then said to have asked Mr Heller if he wanted to buy the collection outright . Though Mr Max started to carry out his plan for the cars, issues such as a tax fraud case forced them on the backburner and he eventually sold the fleet to members of the Heller family. Real estate broker Adam Heller said the family now has a 'museum of Corvettes'. The 32-year-old said: 'We can go back in time with these cars. We started off by picking up cars from the mid 1970s and now we have one from 1958. 'It's covered in dust but it's in very good condition considering its age.' The most valuable car in the collection is a 1953 Corvette - one of only 300 ever made. Another vehicle in the collection was produced in 1955, and was one of only 700 ever made. The thick layer of dust covering the cars was said to have protected the paintwork, with some of the vehicles only needing minor restoration . While some of the cars would only take a matters of weeks to restore, others would take up to a year, a Corvette expert said . Chris Mazzilli, a Corvette expert and owner of Dream Cars Consulting on Long Island, USA, poses next to a 1969 Corvette Stingray . Mr Mazzilli said one of the cars, a 1953 Corvette would undergo a full frame one restoration, meaning that the body would be removed from the chassis and 'everything will be refurbished and gone through'; the vehicle is expected to become the most valuable 1953 Corvette in the world . One of the most valuable cars in the collection, a 1955 Corvette - one of only 700 ever made - gets a good working over at the garage . The Vintage Auto Restoration Garage in Hickville, where the collection of Corvettes is being restored before being offered for sale . Mr Heller said: 'We're putting a substantial amount of money that's well over six figures into just one of the individual cars. 'I think that by the time we get done on this restoration we will have the most valuable 1953 Corvette in the world.' Chris Mazzilli, a Corvette expert and owner of Dream Cars Consulting on Long Island, USA said the car will be worth around half a million dollars when it is fully restored. The 49-year-old added: 'It's number 291 of 300 and will be getting a full frame one restoration which means that the body will be removed from the chassis and everything will be refurbished and gone through.' He said the thick layer of dust that covered the cars had protected the paintwork, and some vehicles would need little in the way of restoration. Some would take around two weeks, and would simply need a few hoses and belts changed, while others would require 'more than a years worth of work'. When the restorations are complete Mr Heller, who lives and works in New York City, will attempt to sell the collection in its entirety to one lucky bidder. Mr Heller had reportedly offered to work with Mr Max to restore the cars for sale and then split the proceeds, something the artists declined.

"In private, even the stylish former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis admitted to tiring of the all-black attire long considered chic in New York City. Writing to Bill Hamilton, then the design director at Carolina Herrera, Onassis once wrote: 'I just love this suit and will wear it everywhere as I am SO sick of everyone constantly in black. Like Mediterranean villages where everyone is in mourning for 20 years.' The handwritten note - accompanied by her own sketch of a suit with a single-breasted jacket - is among a few dozen pieces of Onassis' personal correspondence making a rare appearance at auction on Saturday in Florida. Scroll down for video . First lady in red: 'I am SO sick of everyone constantly in black,' Jackie Kennedy Onassis once wrote to Bill Hamilton, design director at Carolina Herrera. Pictured, Onassis in a red  Christian Dior two-piece in 1962 . Rico Baca, auctioneer and co-owner of Palm Beach Modern Auctions said that the notes about clothes and furniture she was buying show the human side of the widow of President John Kennedy and tycoon Aristotle Onassis. 'In these notes you get a sense of how someone famous can make the average person comfortable,' said Mr Baca, who is preparing the personal correspondence for auction on Saturday. 'She really did go out of her way to make people feel appreciated.' Mostly written on her signature blue stationery, all the notes end with Onassis giving thanks for the work Mr Hamilton and interior designer Richard Keith Langham did for her from the mid-80s until her death in 1994. Under the hammer: A selection of  Onassis' personal notes and photos, written between the 80s and early 90s (pictured), will be up for auction in Florida on Saturday .

Prep: Mumbi O'Brien, with Palm Beach Modern Auctions, lays out handwritten notes and drawings into 30 lots for the upcoming auction . Some notes offer Onassis' polite yet firm opinions on shoulder pads, the shape of a jacket, slim pant legs and the weight of chairs. Mr Hamilton remembers how Onassis would arrive for fittings with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil in her handbag, ready to work through lunch to get the details right. 'To get the point across she would do drawings of ideas she wanted, from a canopy bed to a jacket. 'We spent a lot of time selecting fabrics,' Mr Hamilton said. 'She knew when she went out she had to look perfect.'

Other notes simply express Onassis' appreciation for work done by designers she considered friends. 'I hope life gives you back all the nice things that you put into it for other people,' she wrote Mr Langham on the back of a postcard of the Louvre in Paris. Among the correspondence to Mr Langham is a copy of a book about Onassis' restoration of the White House when she was first lady. 'What fun it would have been to work with you then,' Onassis said in an accompanying note. The auction  will also include photographs by Bob Davidoff, who spent decades as the Kennedy family's photographer in Palm Beach, Mr Baca said. The black-and-white prints show Onassis' classic yet trendsetting style in tailored pants, big sunglasses and simple yet elegant shift dresses.

"Threats: A sign hanging in a precinct in Queens tells officers that they are allowed no sick or vacation days if the slowdown continues. Figures from last week suggest the drop in arrests is easing . A work slowdown by New York City police that began after the slaying of two officers may have started to ease last week, according to the police commissioner and the latest figures for arrests and summonses released on Monday. For a third week in a row, arrests and court summonses were still markedly lower than at this time a year ago, but the drop was not quite as dramatic as seen in the preceding two weeks. It comes after were threatened with no vacation days or sick time unless they stop their slowdown and issue more tickets. A paper sign posted on the wall of a precinct in Queens read 'No Excusals' and warned officers that all requests have to be approved by the C.O. The slowdown exacerbated the crisis faced by Mayor Bill de Blasio as he struggles to mend an exceptionally deep rift between City Hall and the nation's largest police force over the mayor's support for critics of the police. Police Commissioner William Bratton, who took the unusual step of calling a news conference on Monday to release the weekly figures, told reporters at police headquarters he remained 'concerned' by the decrease in police activity. 'We are pleased with the fact that officers are beginning to reengage again,' Bratton said. In the week ending on Sunday, police made 4,690 arrests across the city, a decline of 38 percent from the 7,580 arrests recorded in the same week a year ago. Two weeks ago, arrests were down nearly 60 percent. The number of criminal court summonses issued during the week ending on Sunday was 1,484, down 71 percent from 5,051 recorded in the same week the previous year. Two weeks ago, summonses were down more than 90 percent compared with a year earlier. During the slowdown, there was also a moderate decline in reports of murder, robbery and other serious crime, the data showed. De Blasio and Bratton have been hesitant to give a definitive reason for the slowdown. They have declined to link it to the evident anger toward the mayor among police officers, hundreds of whom took to turning their backs on de Blasio at public events after the two policemen were ambushed on Dec. 20 by a man who said he wanted to avenge the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers. Worries: Commissioner William Bratton took the unusual step of calling a news conference to release the weekly figures and reporters  he remained 'concerned' by the decrease in police activity . Although de Blasio has spoken in warm superlatives about his police department, he has angered police by his support for protesters and activists who say the city's policing methods are hostile toward non-white New Yorkers. Police union leaders have said they have not sanctioned a slowdown, and Bratton did not contradict that on Monday. Neither de Blasio nor Bratton said whether officers involved in the slowdown would be punished. 'By definition, every public servant needs to do their job,' de Blasio said earlier on Monday at an unrelated news conference, but added that he would leave any decisions about punishment to Bratton.","Latest figures for arrests and summonses have risen from two weeks ago .

"Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson has slammed reports that he had sexual relations with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'. In a passionate rebuttal on the Today show on Tuesday, the Duchess of York said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations. Prince Andrew has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with the underage girl. Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which Ferguson, 55, repeated during her interview. Adamant: Sarah Ferguson passionately defended her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, as she appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning. She called accusations against him 'salacious lies' 'I won't stand by - because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you - and not support him so publicly,' she told Matt Lauer. She said the claims against her former husband - whom she called 'a great father and humongously good man' - were 'shockingly accusatory allegations which I don't think are right'. 'I won't stand by and have his character defamed,' she said. 'My integrity and the American people know my integrity and my integrity is of a great man and I will not have one word said about him on any level. Any level.' The pair, who divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, remain good friends, she said. They have two daughters together, Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24. 'The great news is that Andrew and I and the girls are the best family unit there ever is,' she said. All smiles: The Duchess of York smiled as she left the Today studios in New York on Tuesday morning . Proud: She was seen carrying a bag showing the faces of her two daughters, Eugenie, left, and Beatrice . Andrew has faced mounting controversy after he was named in U.S. court documents as having sex with a woman when she was a minor. Virginia Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims. Attorney and former Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz said the accusations were 'totally false and made up'. The accusation, which is contained in a motion filed in Florida, is part of a lawsuit over how federal prosecutors handled Epstein's case. He was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. Two years after his 2009 release, Epstein was pictured in New York City with the prince, and their friendship was a source of controversy.

Andrew ultimately stepped down from his role as a U.K. trade ambassador in July 2011.

"This is the first glimpse of a £475million car production line hailed as the next step in Britain's manufacturing industry. The vast tangle of metal at Ford's plant in Dagenham, east London - whose history is so famous it was turned into a film - will produce 350,000 low-carbon diesel engines a year when the conveyers start rolling in November. Made by hundreds of workers and creating 300 new jobs, the two-litre engines will be shipped off to showrooms around Britain as well as countries across the world. Once the production line is running the plant, which produced 790,000 diesel engines in 2013 and exported 85 per cent of them, will hope to produce 1million units a year. The move was announced in October after the government's Regional Growth Fund provided £8.9million of the cost. Opened in 1931, the Dagenham plant employs around 3,000 people and was made famous in 1968 when its female machinists walked out of their jobs making seats, furious that they earned less for their jobs than men. The 187 women, who brought Ford to its knees and were a key milestone in the equal pay battle, had their experiences made into the 2010 Bafta-nominated film Made in Dagenham starring Sally Hawkins and Rosamund Pike.

"Parasitic flatworms that can cause liver and blood diseases in humans could become more common as global temperatures rise, according to a new study. Palaeobiologists at the University of Missouri have found evidence in ancient shellfish fossils from around 9,600 years ago of high levels of parasite infestations. These trematode flatworms spend part of their life cycle in molluscs like clams, snails and mussels before then infecting fish, and later fish-eating birds and mammals. The scientists found that during the Holocene, when temperatures were about 2.5°C warmer than they are today and sea levels were higher, molluscs suffered from far greater levels of infection. The researchers studied pits left by parasites in fossilised clam shells like the one above from 9,600 years ago . The scientists found that during the Holocene, when temperatures were about 2.5°C warmer than they are today and sea levels were higher, molluscs suffered from far greater levels of infection. They warn that as global temperatures are due to increase by up to 4°C by the end of the century and sea levels are due to rise, it could mean these parasites could become a growing problem to human health. Marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water. They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. Climate change experts predict that over the next century, the acidity levels of the world's oceans could drop from pH8 to pH7.5. In taste tests shrimp raised in the waters with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. Dr John Huntley, a geological scientist at the University of MIssouri who led the study, said: 'When compared to documented rises in sea level more than 9,300 years ago, we found that we currently are creating conditions for an increase in trematodes in present-day estuarine environments. 'This could have harmful implications for both animal and human health, including many of the world's fisheries.' Dr Huntley and his colleagues studied the fossilised shells of ancient clams collected from the Pearl River Delta in China. They looked at the oval shaped pits that form in the clam shells as the clams grow around the parasites. Dr Huntley said: 'Because they have soft bodies, trematodes do not leave body fossils. 'However, infected clam shells develop oval-shaped pits where the clam grew around the parasite in order to keep it out.' The mouth of an adult liver fluke, a type of trematode that can infect humans, magnified by 22 times. These parasites  could become more common as temperatures warm and sea levels rise, according to new research . Dr Huntley compared the pits in shells from clams found in the Pearl River Delta in China and those from Italy. Experts warn that as global temperatures are due to increase by up to 4°C by the end of the century and sea levels are due to rise, it may mean parasites could become a growing problem to human health . The researchers then compared these findings to clams found in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Italy. Using data that includes highly detailed descriptions of climate change and radiocarbon dating, they noticed clam shells contained more pits in the fossils during times of sea level rise both in China and Italy, when esturies would have been flooded with brackish water. Trematode infections such as liver flukes, blood flukes and Heterophyes heterophyes can infect humans after eating infected fish. At least 56 million people globally suffer from one or more food-borne trematode infections, according to the World Health Organisation.

The symptoms can include inflammation, fever and can even be fatal. At least 56 million people globally suffer from one or more food-borne trematode infections, according to the World Health Organisation. Dr Huntley, whose study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, warned that rising sea levels and global temperatures due to climate change could result in a growth in the number of infections. He said: 'The insights offered by our high-resolution Holocene data are that trematode-prevalence values in brackish settings will be significantly higher during the initial stage of rapid sea-level rise in the coming centuries and will significantly decrease by the maximum flooding stage. 'An increase in trematode prevalence will have significant implications for ecological and human health.'

"As the world's most popular social network, it has more than 1.3billion active users. Now, Facebook is tapping  its 185million US-based users to help find and return missing children. From Tuesday, the company is sending out Amber Alerts that are geographically pinpointed. They will appear on the timelines of users who are in a search area where a child has been abducted. Speaking of the initiative, launched in partnership with National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), the center's founder, John Walsh, said: 'This is a game changer.' Scroll down for video . Initiative: From Tuesday, Facebook is sending out Amber Alerts that are geographically pinpointed. Above, an Amber Alert (left), how it will appear on users' timelines (center) and how users can share it on the site (right) The 69-year-old host of CNN's The Hunt told USA Today: 'Facebook is the 700-pound gorilla, 'It will put information about missing children into the hands of Facebook users immediately.' Emily Vacher, trust and safety manager at Facebook and former FBI agent, said the alerts will include the missing child's photo and any other information that could be deemed relevant. She added that the 'comprehensive' alerts will be appear on users' timelines automatically. However, this will only be around one or two times a year, when they may be in a position to help, she said. 'When people see this on Facebook we want them to know that this is a very rare occurrence,' she said. 'If you see an Amber Alert delivered, it means you are actually in a position to be able to help. Support: NCMEC founder John Walsh (left) described the initiative as 'a game changer', while Emily Vacher (right), Facebook's trust and safety manager, said the alerts will be sent to users who may be able to help . Example: The 'comprehensive' alerts will be appear on Facebook users' timelines automatically. They will include the missing child's photo and any other information that could be deemed relevant (pictured) 'The best chance of finding a child is when the right information gets to the people at the right time.' She added that users will be able to delete the post should they desire, but Facebook hopes they will take the time to read the information, share it with their friends and keep an eye out instead. Millions of people  already use Facebook to share stories about missing children. In recent years, several children have been reunited with their families as a result of information shared on the site. Indeed, last March, a missing 11-year-old girl was found in a South Carolina motel room after a clerk saw an Amber Alert that was shared on Facebook, according to the company and previous reports. Success: The Amber Alert warning system was founded in 1996. Above, the first successful recovery of a child from the system was Rae-Leigh Bradbury (pictured with her parents at the NCMEC) in Arlington, Texas in 1998 . The company hopes that the new Amber Alerts initiative will help locate more missing US youngsters. The Amber Alert warning system was founded in 1996 following the brutal kidnapping and murder of nine-year-old Amber Hagerman in Arlington, Texas. It was named in the youngster's honor. Since then, more than 700 children in America have been found as a direct result of the alerts. They are now issued over TV and radio, on highway signs, as text messages and over the Internet. Ms Vacher said Facebook's Amber Alert distribution tool is 'very comprehensive' and complements other systems that are currently in place. Tragic: The 1996 Amber Alert system launch followed the brutal kidnapping and murder of nine-year-old Amber Hagerman (pictured, above, in a family photo) in Arlington, Texas. The iniative was named in the girl's honor . Text alerts and highway signs, for example, do not include photos of missing children, while the text alerts are limited to some 90 characters, she said. On Tuesday, John Ryan, NCMEC president and chief executive said he was optimistic about the Facebook initiative because of the social network’s enormous reach. The majority of the site's US users log on using their cellphones, meaning they will see the alerts at almost all hours of the day, even when they are out and about, he said. 'It’s the closest thing to real time that we can hope for,' he added.","From Tuesday, Facebook is sending out Amber Alerts to 185m US users .

"In the dock: Owner Akhtar Khan will be sentenced after his staff used an unsafe meat slicer shortly after it cut off a man's fingers . A part-time supermarket worker's hand had to be amputated after it got stuck in a faulty meat slicer, a court has heard. But despite the brutal accident staff at Ash Food Fair in Birmingham began using the machine an hour after it sliced off Nasa Iqbal's fingers and mangled his hand after they washed it down with Fairy Liquid and hot water. Owner Akhtar Khan has admitted a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act at Birmingham Magistrates' Court and will now be sentenced next month. Barry Berlin, prosecuting for Birmingham City Council said the small supermarket's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before Mr Iqbal lost his fingers. Staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage, the city's magistrates' court heard. Fellow workers heard Mr Iqbal screaming on the morning of October 12 last year as he placed his right hand inside the machine, which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop. A paramedic only recovered three of Mr Iqbal's fingers after the machine was dismantled. But an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it. Mr Berlin said: 'He found, not withstanding the accident, the unguarded mincer was still being used to mince meat products falling through into the lower opening.' In the evening two officers from the city council also discovered meat and herbs were still being passed through the machine. But the officers issued a prohibition notice banning its use until stronger chemicals had been used to disinfect it. Simon Morgan, defending, said there had been arrangements to repair the guard, but there had been an unacceptable delay before the accident occurred. Mr Khan will appear at Birmingham City Council for sentencing by a judge on February 16.

"Katie Wilson's stomach pains were a symptom of the cervical cancer she was suffering from - but doctors dismissed them as 'growing pains' A young woman is battling advanced cervical cancer after doctors dismissed her symptoms as growing pains. Kirstie Wilson, 20, from Bexleyheath, Kent, was diagnosed with the disease three years ago after refusing to accept the original diagnosis. After being dismissed by her GP three times, she begged to be referred to a specialist. It was only then that she received the crucial smear test that detected abnormal cells. Despite undergoing surgery and being given the all-clear, the disease has now returned with a vengeance. The cancer has now spread to her liver and spleen and chemotherapy is no longer working to shrink her tumours. But instead of giving up, Miss Wilson has searched for medical trials in a desperate bid to save her life - and started on one last month. She said: 'I had all the symptoms of cervical cancer but because I was 17 at the time, doctors ignored my concerns. 'I was bleeding inbetween periods and I was in agony, but doctors diagnosed me with thrush and growing pains. 'You know your own body and I knew there was something seriously wrong when the pain and bleeding persisted.' Miss Wilson visited her doctors a total of three times before she was referred to a specialist. She added: 'It took me four months of going back and forth to my GP before I was given a smear test. 'I wish I had been given a smear test when I first visited my doctor, as it might have saved my life.' The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young. When her GP dismissed the symptoms three times, Miss Wilson (right, with best friend Amy, left) begged to be referred to a specialist. It was only then she received the crucial smear test that detected abnormal cells . When Miss Wilson was first diagnosed with cancer in May 2012, she underwent radical surgery to remove her cervix and save any hope she of having children . When Miss Wilson was first diagnosed with cancer in May 2012, she underwent surgery known as a radical trachelectomy. This removed her cervix but meant she would be able to have children in future. The operation was a success and she was cancer-free for nearly two years. Some recognised symptoms associated with cervical cancer include: . Abnormal bleeding: during or after sexual intercourse, or between periods . Post menopausal bleeding, if you are not on HRT or have stopped it for six weeks . Unusual and/or unpleasant vaginal discharge . Discomfort or pain during sex . Lower back pain . Source: Jo's Trust . 'I had smear tests every three months and every time they came back normal,' Miss Wilson said. But by April 2014, her joy at beating cancer so quickly had turned to fear when her stomach became abnormally bloated. Miss Wilson said: 'I looked about eight months pregnant and I was struggling to breathe. 'I knew something was really wrong when I couldn't keep up and dance with my friends on a night out. 'My best friend Amy came with me to A&E the following day as I was in agony and struggling to walk.' There, Miss Wilson had two litres of fluid drained from her chest and a further eight litres from her stomach. A biopsy then confirmed her worst fears. 'The cancer had returned and despite several clear check-up smear tests, it had spread to my liver and spleen, she said. 'Doctors believe my cancer wasn't spotted on my smears as it was so small.' The next step was intense chemotherapy - something that left her devastated. But by April 2014, Miss Wilson began to fear the worst when her stomach became abnormally bloated. 'I looked about eight months pregnant and I was struggling to breathe,' she said . Tests revealed the worst - the cancer had returned and spread - meaning she would need chemotherapy . Cervical screening is not a test for cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities, which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix . The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young. According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year. In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31. She added: 'I was heartbroken when I realised the chemo would make my thick blonde hair fall out. 'I've always enjoyed styling it and knowing I would lose it was awful.' Fortunately, she was offered a  'cold cap treatment'. This involved freezing her head to -4C during her chemotherapy so her hair follicles weren't destroyed. Miss Wilson said: 'I can't praise the cold cap enough. 'My hair did still fall out in clumps, but it meant I kept a little pony tail at the back and my scalp was still mainly covered with thin hair. 'My friends and I began gluing hair extensions inside hats so that when I went out, no-one would know I was ill, they were amazing and felt comfier than wigs.' But after three months of chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed that Kirstie's tumours weren't shrinking - she had become immune to the drugs. 'I was heartbroken when I realised the chemo would make my thick blonde hair fall out (left),' said Miss Wilson. Fortunately, she was offered a 'cold cap treatment', which involved freezing her head to -4C during chemotherapy so her hair follicles weren't destroyed. This meant her scalp was still mainly covered with a thin layer of hair . There was no other treatment available for Miss Wilson on the NHS and she was told to make a list of things she wanted to do before she became too ill.'I was devastated but I needed to stay focused on how to beat cancer rather than a bucket list. 'I wasn't ready to give up and even though my mum, Karen and dad, Gary, were distraught with the prognosis, they knew we needed to find a new treatment plan and quick,' she said. 'My dad took it upon himself to research medical trials in the UK, Germany and Chicago.' She spent a month without having any treatment before a medical trial at the University College London Hospital became available to her. She said: 'My hair had just grown back and I refused to undergo any more treatment that would leave me feeling unwell as well as bald, I had already suffered enough. 'But this new trial was a type of chemotherapy that wouldn't damage my hair alongside a drug that is still in the testing phase so I couldn't wait to start, it gave me hope. 'Doctors have made it clear that my treatment plan may not cure me but it will prolong my life. 'My fertility has been ruined due to chemotherapy which upset me as I had always wanted children but I can't change any of what's happened to me so I'm trying to live my life to the full. 'I'm just hoping for a miracle.' Instead of giving up, Miss Wilson (pictured with her father) has searched for medical trial in a desperate bid to save her life - which she started last month . Throughout Miss Wilson's cancer battle she has raised more than £6,000 for Cancer Research and Macmillan alongside her friends and family. She added: added: 'I just wanted to give something back to the charities that have helped me. 'I have been supported religiously by my mum, dad, brother, Dale, and best friends, Amy and Victoria. 'Amy works for a company called CXC Global and they paid for me to have hair extensions that were over £200 as well as organising a trip to meet my idol Chelsea captain, John Terry. 'I couldn't ask for a better support network, they each help keep me strong and positive.' Miss Wilson will have a CT scan this month to see if her new treatment is working to shrink the tumours. She said: 'I hope other young women read my story and look out for cervical cancer symptoms. 'I strongly believe that no matter your age a smear test should be given on demand.'","Kirstie Wilson, 20, was diagnosed with the disease three years ago .

"Brian Harvey vented his anger at the music industry as he smashed up a platinum disc . Former East 17 frontman Brian Harvey vented his anger at the music industry as he smashed up platinum discs he was awarded with the band and then posted a bizarre video of his outburst online. In the expletive-packed burst of anger, he rants: 'East 17, one million sales - this is what it f****** means,' before the destruction begins.

He concludes the outburst: 'That's what I think of your f****** music industry.' Then, in a later film posted on his YouTube channel, he is seen in the alley once more tidying up and placing the debris in a bin. In the follow-up, he returns to tidy up and says: 'I'm a peaceful person, and I pick my rubbish up.' East 17 sold 18 million records during their career.

"Who shot the victims, should police have gone in earlier and why didn't authorities negotiate with Man Haron Monis to release hostages are all questions that will be examined at an inquest into the Sydney siege in two weeks' time. The NSW Coroner has fast-tracked the inquiry into the fatal Lindt cafe stand-off which resulted in the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson, barrister Katrina Dawson and injuries suffered by some of the 18 hostages Man Haron Monis held for more than 16 hours from the morning of December 15. The inquest will open on Thursday, January 29 to determine 'how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented', a spokesman for the NSW Coroner's Court said. Scroll down for video . Did they act too late? The inquest into the Sydney siege will determine whether Tactical Operations Unit officers (pictured) stormed the cafe too late or that in the interests of saving lives their timing was right . How exactly did they die? The NSW Coroner will examine ballistics evidence to determine whether rounds or a ricochet from semi automatic police weapons fatally wounded 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson (left) and if Tori Johnson (right) was killed by Man Monis' shotgun . What really went on? Many questions remain for the coroner to decide what actually occurred inside the Lindt cafe (pictured a day after the siege ended) and what could be done differently to prevent its reoccurrence . Who shot him dead? The death of Han Maron Monis (pictured) in a hail of police gunfire is not doubted and while some would not care, but the NSW Coroner will examine ballistics to determine which shots killed the gunman . The inquest may be held at one of Sydney's two coroner's courts - in the inner western suburb of Glebe, where Monis's body was taken following his death at the siege's end, and at Westmead 26 kilometres from the city centre. However,  NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will determine over the next fortnight how large a venue is needed for the number of witnesses required, including lawyers representing victims and police officers. Following his determination on what happened inside the Lindt cafe, Mr Barnes will make recommendations to governments and other agencies to protect future public health and safety. Did he act alone? Man Haron Monis (pictured behind the Lindt cafe window soon after taking command of the cafe on the morning of December 15) may not have been a lone wolf and the coroner will examine if anyone else was involved in planning his deadly attack . What happened inside? The inquest into the siege will find exactly what went on during the 16 hours, how hostages escaped (pictured) and why others remained inside until the violent end around 2am on day two . These are the questions that the community urgently needs to be answered: . 1. How did barrister Katrina Dawson die? Reports that the 38-year-old mother of three died when struck by a police bullet which may have ricochet when the Tactical Operations Unit officers stormed the cafe will be investigated. Ms Dawson reportedly suffered a heart attack, perhaps as a result of bleeding heavily from her wounds. 2. How did cafe manager Tori Johnson die? The Coroner will examine whether Mr Johnson, 34, was shot from behind by hostage taker Man Haron Monis's shotgun . 3. How did Man Haron Monis die? The gunman was shot dead by police semi-automatic weapons, but the coroner will examine ballistics to determine how many rounds and from what direction the fatal bullets came. Who injured the hostages? Four or more of the hostages as well as police suffered injuries including gunshot wounds to the leg and facial wounds, which will come under the investigator's microscope at the hearing . Did he intend to die? Speculation has been rife that Man Haron Monis (pictured) planned to die to avoid prison for sexual assault and murder related offences, but the inquest will determine his intent . Did he have bombs? After Monis wore a supposedly loaded backpack into the Lindt cafe and told hostages he had planted bombs, explosive experts (pictured, above) attended the siege but it is not yet known whether the claims were a hoax . 4. What caused the injuries of the hostages? Four or more of the hostages as well as police suffered injuries including gunshot wounds to the leg and facial wounds, which will come under the investigator's microscope at the hearing. 5. Did the police act properly in holding off, or should they have gone in earlier? There has been much speculation as to whether NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione's senior command should have stormed the cafe earlier in the siege, whether that would have caused more or less loss of life and if it is true that military troops such as specially trained SAS soldiers should have been called into assist. 6.  Were there explosives in the backpack worn by Monis and, as he claimed, planted around the cafe and the Sydney CBD? And where and how did the gunman obtain the shotgun and any explosives that may have been present? Could lives have been saved? There has been much speculation as to whether NSW Police  should have stormed the cafe earlier in the siege, whether that would have caused more or less loss of life including that of victim Katrina Dawson (pictured, on the order of service for her funeral) Should troops have been called in? The inquest should settle whether troops such as the elite trained SAS should have been called in  to forgo a bloody end for hostages (pictured) shot after the 16 hour siege . 7. Did Man Haron Monis intend to die? Public speculation about gunman Monis's intentions, given pending prosecutions against him over sexual assault and murder related charges and a failed court appeal over his hate campaign against Australian soldiers appear to have concluded he intended to die in a fainal blaze of 'glory' in the siege. The Coroner will examine correspondence and social media posts ot determine Monis's intentions. 8. Should police have responded to Monis's demands - for an ISIS flag and audience with Prime Minister Tony Abbott - in exchange for hostages and should offers by Islamic leaders and lawyers to negotiate with him been accepted? Coroner Barnes will sift through the facts of the police response to the situation hour by hour until the siege's end. 9. Did anyone else know about Monis's plans for the siege and is there footage of him casing the premises? Were there other individuals who knew about the siege and who may have helped in planning it? Computer records will help determine whether Monis was alone in planning the siege. What will the hostages say? Lawyers for the hostages and police involved in the Martin Place siege will pack a courtroom for the inquest into the bloody incident which starts on January 29 and runs for several weeks . What are the lessons to be learned? In the aftermath of the Sydney siege at Martin Place, many unknowns remained as people paid their respects with flowers (pictured) but a public inquest should answer the questions . 10. What could have been done to prevent the action taken by Man Haron Monis and what lessons can authorities learn to stop another siege in the future? Despite a high security alert by police and other authorities across NSW and other states over Islamic State related activities, Monis slipped through the net, and the Coroner will be looking at what measures - including greater security around public places which don't have iconic status like the Harbour Bridge or Opera House -  might prevent a repeat incident in the interests of community safety. Another question is should ASIO have nabbed Monis years ago? Hindsight would say yes, that Monis should never have been taken off Australia's national security body's watch list years ago and, much like another Iranian mullah Mansour Laghaei, should have been deported back to his home country. Although the NSW Coroner's findings will feed into the wider investigation, this is a question for a Federal Government inquiry into the siege. Day one of the inquest will hear from the coroner and counsel assisting, who will outline the specific issues into which the inquiry will delve.","The  Coroner has fast-tracked an inquest into the Sydney Lindt cafe siege .

"One of London's largest penthouses has come up for sale with a staggering £8.9million price tag - because the flat is five times bigger than the average semi-detached house. The four-bedroom apartment overlooking the Thames on the South Bank boasts two private balcony terraces, looking out over the city's skyline. It is spread over three floors, with 4,600 sq ft of space - compared to 925 sq ft for the typical new-build family home with three bedrooms. Pricey: This penthouse, believed to be London's largest, has gone on the market with a price tag of £8.9million . Balcony: The property has two private terraces which overlook the London skyline, including sights such as St Paul's Cathedral . Airy: The flat's windows extend from floor to ceiling to help its residents make the most of the view . The astronomical price tag for the penthouse is explained by its location in Benbow House, right on the banks of the Thames. Among the popular attractions which are within a few minutes' walk of the building are the Globe theatre, Tate Modern and the Southbank Centre arts complex. The flat's interior features include floor-to-ceiling glass windows - allowing the owner to take full advantage of the view over London - a wood-panelled study and a library installed in an upstairs gallery. As well as the four double bedrooms, kitchen and dining room, and family room, it benefits from two underground parking spaces and a 24-hour concierge service. Location: Benbow House, left, is on the South Bank with a view over the river to the City of London skyline, right . Formal: A dining room separate to the kitchen will enable the property's new owner to host dinner parties overlooking the Thames . Bedroom: The sleeping areas are built into the roof of the building in a loft conversion style . The South Bank area has become increasingly fashionable after decades of being considered relatively shabby compared to the City of London and the West End, on the other side of the Thames. The Globe, a reconstruction of Shakespeare's 17th-century theatre, was opened in 1997, while the Tate Modern followed in 2000 after the renovation of the former Bankside Power Station. The Southbank Centre, which includes the National Theatre, British Film Institute and Royal Festival Hall, is another highlight of the area, and Borough Market is considered one of the top destinations for the capital's foodies.

Open: The dining room and drawing room areas have no walls to try and create a light, airy feel to the penthouse . Modernist: The bathroom uses a minimalist style to create an up-to-date aesthetic . A spokesman for Pastor Real Estate, which is selling the penthouse, said: 'This is a fantastic apartment in one of the most vibrant locations in central London, with breathtaking views of the London skyline and river. 'It is very centrally located, in the heart of a unique location that offers so much and is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after locations in London. 'The location, space, light and parking mean that the Penthouse at Benbow House appeals to both those working in the City and the arts.

"Australian Andrew Chan is among 20 death row prisoners scheduled for execution in Indonesia this year, an official says. Chan's name is on the list even though a letter rejecting his bid for presidential clemency has yet to be issued. It follows news that Chans fellow conspirator, 33-year-old Myuran Sukumaran, had his bid for clemency officially rejected, bringing him one step closer to facing the firing squad. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine mastermind Andrew Chan smiles in a holding cell at Denpasar Court after he was sentenced to death for heroin trafficking . A spokesman for Indonesia's attorney-general says the list assumes President Joko Widodo will stick by his pledge to deny mercy to drug smugglers. 'That's what the president said,' Tony Spontana said. 'It's clear and so we're confident.' Chan, who turned 31 on Monday, joins Myuran Sukumaran, 33, the other Bali Nine ringleader, on that list. Sukumaran learned his last-ditch appeal had been formally rejected last week. Myuran Sukumaran (left, with Andrew Chan) recently had his bid for clemency officially rejected, bringing him one step closer to facing the firing squad . Chan and Sukumaran's pleas for clemency were made more than two years ago, amid an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty in Indonesia. But hopes dimmed when Mr Joko declared he was against clemency for drug offenders late last year. Five or six convicts are to be executed imminently, and the 20 others will follow. The letter informing Sukumaran that his bid had failed said: 'there's not enough reason to give clemency to the convicted'. Chan's name is on the list of prisoners scheduled for execution this year, even though a letter rejecting his bid for presidential clemency has yet to be issued . However both men have made huge efforts in their rehabilitation, and help other inmates through art, cooking and mentoring programs. In a message on his supporters' Facebook page on Tuesday, Chan said he was humbled by the birthday wishes he received. 'I am standing strong - we are standing strong,' he wrote. 'We are trusting that the Indonesian president will see that the work we are doing and the work we want to do will make a positive difference in rehabilitating people here and in other places too.' Chan dreams of teaching hospitality classes and Sukumaran has more plans for his art. 'We are, with your encouragement, able to keep on doing that even in the current situation,' Chan wrote. The Sydney pair were sentenced to death over a plan to smuggle more than 8kg of heroin to Australia in 2005 . A potential new appeal avenue hinges on an argument between Indonesia's constitutional and supreme courts over how many times prisoners can seek judicial reviews. The newly-appointed head of the constitutional court, Arief Hidayat, told the Koran Tempo newspaper the president should meet senior judges to sort out the wrangle. He maintains his court's decision allowing multiple reviews should be applied uniformly. 'When the constitutional court has made a decision, it can't be interpreted any further,' he said. The Sydney pair were sentenced to death over a plan to smuggle more than 8kg of heroin to Australia in 2005.","Andrew Chan is among 20 death row prisoners scheduled for execution this year .

"The man accused of killing four people in a supermarket siege outside Paris last week had been on a US terror watch list, it has been reported. Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four Jewish shoppers at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket to the east of the city, had been on a US terror database 'for a while,' a law enforcement official has revealed. Coulibaly was on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), the government's central database that includes about one million names, CNN reported. Amedy Coulibaly (pictured), who killed four Jewish shoppers at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket to the east of the city, had been on a US terror database 'for a while,' Coulibaly (left) was on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), the government's central database that includes about one million names. His partner Hayat Boumeddiene (right) is still on the run . Amedy Coulibaly killed four Jewish shoppers at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket to the east of Paris before the siege was brought to an end (pictured) He is likely to have received help from others, including the two brothers suspected of shooting dead 12 people at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last week. US officials said after the attack that the brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, had been on a US terror watchlist 'for years.' French police say Coulibaly gunned down a policewoman in the suburb of Montrouge and may have shot a jogger on the outskirts of Paris before the bloody supermarket siege. In a video posted online on Sunday, a man identifying himself as Coulibaly claims responsibility for the Montrouge attack in the name of the Islamic State group, and says he 'co-ordinated' his actions with the Kouachi brothers. Coulibaly is likely to have received help from Cherif Kouachi (left) and his brother Said (right) - both suspected of shooting dead 12 people at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last week . Coulibaly and the brothers who carried out the Charlie Hebdo massacre were killed on Friday by police in a dramatic climax to two hostage dramas that played out during three days of terror in France. Coulibaly was a repeat criminal offender who had been convicted for extremist activity. The latest revelation that he was on a US watchlist is likely to pile more pressure on French security forces which have already been told to explain how the Kouachi brothers were allowed to drop off their radar - despite their activities having been monitored in the past. The hunt continues for Coulibaly's partner Hayat Boumeddiene. Intelligence sources in France believe she could have helped plan the attacks, possibly by supplying weapons. She was initially thought to have been involved in the siege at the kosher store last Friday but it has since emerged she had in fact fled Paris a week earlier, arriving in Turkey on January 2. She is now thought to be in Syria with Islamic State fighters.","Amedy Coulibaly was on US terror database 'for a while'

"Starbucks has become an unlikely wedding venue for couples who are eager to marry their caffeine addiction with their unwavering commitment to one another. The popular coffee chain, which has more than 12,000 locations around the country, has seen a huge increase in the number of patrons wanting to tie the knot in-store – with many choosing to document their coffee-fueled ceremonies on Instagram, using the hashtag #StarbucksWedding. One such couple, DeAnna Dodson, 31, and Jordan Senz, 32, chose to wed at a Starbucks in Janesville, Wisconsin, on New Year's Eve, and unsurprisingly the ceremony featured plenty of coffee puns. The Beloit, Wisconsin, couple told Walworth County Today that their vows included the statement: 'I promise to love you a latte.' Creating buzz: DeAnna Dodson, 31, and Jordan Senz, 32, tied the knot at a Starbucks in Janesville, Wisconsin, on New Year's Eve . 'I want to macchiato an honest woman out of you,' Mr Senz proclaimed to his bride, according to the Daily Independent. Naturally, the wedding party enjoyed a cup of java before going to breakfast. The couple, who met in 2001 while working at Burger King, had been engaged since 2007 but had put off the wedding for financial reasons. Happy couple: Another wedding took place two weeks ago in a Starbucks in Hillsborough, New Jersey . Sweet treats: A Starbucks in Ladue, Missouri, shared a photo of a bride and her bridesmaids holding cake pops . Finally, on December 17, Mr Senz called his fiancee and asked if they could hold their nuptials on the 31st. The final challenge was finding an officiant to marry them on a holiday. Mrs Senz said: 'I had gone online and found a reverend, Rev. Donnie [Onley] and we were either going to have to go to his home or pick a public location to meet him at. We said we'll meet him at Starbucks because we go to one every morning anyway.' Rather than holding the event at their usual Beloit Starbucks, they opted for the chain's Janesville location, 15 minutes north, in an effort to 'fly under the radar' and avoid unwanted attention for their unusual venue choice. Unusual ceremony: Another Instagram user shared this photo of a steampunk-themed wedding at Starbucks . The couple dressed casually, in jeans and sweatshirts, and didn't even tell Starbucks that they'd be holding their wedding there. Mr Senz told the Gazette Extra that the backdrop made perfect sense, since they start every morning at Starbucks. 'It just feels great, and it's a fun way to start the first official day of the rest of the year and our lives together.' And Mr and Mrs Senz are not alone - other couples and local Starbucks branches have been posting photos of ceremonies at the coffee chain on Instagram, using the hashtag #StarbucksWedding. Full cup: Happy couple Rachel Villaire and Jacob Kemp are seen tying the knot in another Starbucks . Newlyweds: Jenny Sunderland shared this photo of her and her husband Adam three weeks ago . Two weeks ago, a Starbucks in Hillsborough, New Jersey, posted a photo of a smiling couple holding a marriage certificate with the caption: 'After all, we are your third home.. Congratulations to the couple who just signed their marriage certificates! #HePutARingOnIt #MarriageMonday #StarbucksWedding #truelove.' Another Starbucks in Ladue, Missouri, shared a photo of a bride and her bridesmaids in its store with the words: 'Cake pops for everyone! #starbucks #tobeapartner #starbuckswedding.' Instagram user Carlee Reddick posted a photo from a ceremony she witnessed with the caption: 'Starbucks steampunk wedding. Yes this wedding happened inside starbucks. #Starbucks #starbuckspartner #tobeapartner #starbuckswedding.' And Tym Kemp shared a picture of a wedding ceremony he performed in a Starbucks, commenting: 'This one was really special.' There are currently 92 Instagram posts featuring the #StarbucksWedding hashtag and that number is likely to increase.","DeAnna Dodson, 31, and Jordan Senz, 32, tied the knot at a Starbucks in Janesville, Wisconsin, on New Year's Eve .

"New Year's Eve has always been a time for fresh beginnings, but for one 62-year-old from Darwen, Lancashire, midnight on December 31 was especially sweet. Steph Holmes rang in 2015 as a fully-fledged woman – 59 years after she started dressing as a girl. Steph, who is a retired computer sciences teacher, was handed strappy black heels as a Christmas present when she was just three years old, but only built up the courage to have full gender reassignment surgery earlier last year. Steph Holmes, 62,  from Lancashire, rang in the new year as a woman (right). It comes 59 years after the retired IT teacher started wearing girls' clothes. As a boy, his mother bought his first pair of heels aged 3 (left) For years afterwards, she secretly dressed as a woman, coming home from work and throwing on a dress and heels. But she never told anyone, not even her closest family. Now Steph is finally living openly as a woman after having the surgery last April. She has also set up a support group for other women called Chrysalis Transsexual Support Group. During her childhood as a boy called Stephen, Steph wore pretty dresses and always favoured pink over blue but when she hit her teenage years she reverted to boys' clothes. Steph with his mother Lilian before he underwent gender reassignment surgery . Steph as Stephen - as a young man, he tried desperately to fight his urges and engaged in manly hobbies . Steph said: 'My journey began when mum Lilian gave me a pair of black high heels for Christmas, 59 years ago. 'I hadn't even asked for them, she knew me so well. 'It might seem strange. I was a three-year-old boy. But I'd always been a bit different - I preferred pink to blue and dolls to toy cars. 'But mum couldn't care less and when we went shopping she'd let me choose the clothes I wanted. 'My father also turned a blind eye as I danced around in my new outfits. 'At primary school I had to wear a boy's uniform but as soon as I got through the front door though, I'd change into something pretty.' It wasn't until Steph started senior school that she began to realise she was different to most boys her age. She said: 'When I went to an all boys high school that I noticed how different I was. 'I stopped wearing girls' clothes and tried to lock away the urges.' After quitting the army aged 18, Steph, who was then still Stephen, grew his hair long . Steph used to dress as a woman even before her operation. Here she is, right, walking along Douglas seafront in the Isle of Man in 1962 with her mother, left. Keen to fight her natural urges, she even joined the army at 18 but quit two months later after realising she couldn't go through with it.' She said: 'That was when I grew my hair long. 'Mum loved it, often coming round to braid my hair, she called me ""the daughter I never had"".' Then, at the age of 19 Steph lost her virginity but it did not feel right, so she did not do it again. Relationships were few and far between. In her late 20s, she met a woman and wore her clothes in secret but when the lady found out, their romance ended. Steph said: 'From then on, I decided to be honest with future girlfriends and confessed on first dates.' This new attitude was a success and Steph went on to get married in her 40s. However, a few years later she finally realised she was transsexual. She said: 'I decided to tell my wife my dream of becoming a woman and she said, ""I can't support you"". 'I had to make the hardest choice of my life. My wife or life as a real woman. 'But I knew I couldn't keep living a lie.' Steph, pictured recovering from gender reassignment surgery, told her wife she needed to live as a woman . Steph is now happier than she has ever been. She has even met a woman and they are engaged . So in March 2010, she visited doctors to undergo full gender reassignment surgery. In 2012, she met a a 58-year-old woman called Fran, 58, from Stockport and the two women started a relationship. They are engaged but have not yet set a date for the wedding. Steph said: 'I feel complete.' 'I've got a wonderful partner and the body I should have been born into. I just wish mum could see me like this, but sadly she passed away a few years ago.'","Steph Holmes, 65, from Lancashire, rang in the new year as a woman .

"Representatives of the Paris tourist industry will set off on a world tour next month to reassure visitors and agents that the French capital is safe  after last week's fatal shootings by Islamist militants. France is the most visited country in the world. Almost 85 million foreigners a year support a 150 billion euro (£120 billion) industry that delivers seven per cent of the nation's GDP, according to government figures. In Ile-de-France, a region which includes Paris, 550,000 jobs depend on tourism, making it the country's biggest industry. The city had 47 million visitors in 2014, about half of them from abroad. French soldiers patrol next to the Eiffel Tower in Paris; the level of alert regarding terrorism is still at its peak . 'We're going to the UK at the end of February, to Los Angeles in March, Italy, Spain and Germany in April, Hong Kong in May and Tokyo in June,' said Francois Navarro, managing director of the Comite Regional du Tourisme Paris Ile-de-France, a body financed by the regional government. 'Given the importance of this event we told ourselves that this was the priority - that this was what was really needed,' he added. Prime Minister David Cameron joins other world leaders at the start of the defiant march through Paris . Armed French military on the streets at Place De La Nation; but there is set to be a tourism drive . Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Paris on Sunday in a massive show of unity and defiance in the face of terrorism that killed 17 people . In the meantime the organisation is telling embassies and tour operators that the city's museums, monuments, big stores and amusement parks have more police watching them, 'and at the airports, at this stage, it won't take longer to travel by plane even though security has been reinforced', he said. Earlier on Monday the French government said it would deploy 10,000 soldiers on home soil by Tuesday and post almost 5,000 extra police officers. Officials in Paris will be hoping the like of the Eiffel Tower will continue to see an influx of tourists to view it . Tourists in Paris are needed to stimulate the weak French economy, and the capital is confident the recent terror attacks will not affect this . The shooting dead of 17 people in three days marked the deadliest Islamist militant attacks in France for decades, and in any European city since 57 people were killed on London's transport system in 2005. Navarro said his organisation had made inquiries among tour operators and travel agents around the world, and that so far there had been no impact, with no cancellations expected. The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most famous monuments in Paris and enjoyed by tourists from all over . So far there had been no impact from the terror attacks, with no cancellations expected; so people will be able to enjoy the likes of The Louvre . He said he was confident Paris would manage a slight increase in the number of visitors this year, with growth notably coming from the Middle East, South Korea and China. In 2013, the vast majority of visitors to France were from other European countries, but about 3.1 million came from the United States and 1.7 million from China, according to government figures.","France, struggling with its economy, is most visited country in the world .

"Labour's flagship energy freeze policy was plunged into chaos last night as power companies finally started cutting their bills. In a major U-turn, the party was forced to issue a ‘clarification’ that the plan would be converted to a ‘cap’ if energy prices continue to fall. A senior source also warned that the idea – launched in a blaze of publicity by Ed Miliband in 2013 –may have to be ‘re-branded’ to make it clear that bills will not be frozen at a high level if tariffs are dropping. The source said: ‘The freeze was announced at a time when energy prices were rising inexorably – nobody was talking about prices coming down, or even thinking about it. Obviously, if bills are coming down at the election there may have to be a bit of rebranding to make it clear it will operate as a price cap instead.’ Scroll down for video . Business and energy minister Matt Hancock, pictured right,  said the shift of Labour's policy exposed the 'nonsensical' idea of trying to fix commodity markets . The move came after energy giant E.On yesterday became the first company to slash bills, announcing a modest 3.5 per cent fall in gas tariffs in response to a 30 per cent fall in wholesale prices. Chief executive Tony Cocker said the move was a ‘risk’ with Labour’s price freeze hovering in the background, amid enormous pressure for utility firms to cut bills in line with falling wholesale costs of oil and gas. Business and energy minister Matt Hancock last night said Labour’s shift of policy exposed the ‘nonsensical’ idea of trying to fix commodity markets. ‘Labour are in chaos and they must tell the public whether they want to freeze energy bills at higher rates or not,’ he said. ‘It underlines the massive threat posed by Labour and how they cannot be trusted with the nation’s finances.’ Mr Miliband, announcing his policy at Labour’s 2013 conference, said he would ‘freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017’. The idea was promoted with an image of an energy bill frozen in a block of ice – and it still features prominently on the party’s website. A Tory source last night likened the policy to a ‘melting ice cap’. However a Labour spokesman denied there had been a U-turn, saying: ‘It has always been a cap, which would stop energy companies putting up prices, but not stop them cutting them.’ The party will today highlight figures showing the average household’s energy bill is now £260 a year higher than in 2010 – with the poorest families hit the hardest. But Labour was unable to produce any documentation referring to its policy as a cap. Labour will force a Commons vote on the issue today. Mr Miliband’s price freeze has been blamed for keeping energy prices artificially high in recent months, as firms stockpile supplies at high prices. John Fingleton, former chairman of the Office of Fair Trading, warned that in any freeze ‘lower wholesale prices might not get passed on’. Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, warned that the policy acts a 'disincentive for them to cut prices' A senior source at one of Britain’s ‘Big Six’ energy firms said it would have cut bills already if it had not been for Mr Miliband’s pledge. ‘We already take a risk setting prices over one year,’ said the source. ‘When it’s nearly two years, you double the risk, especially with the increasing costs of distribution and of government social and environmental policies.’ Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, warned this week that the policy acts as a ‘disincentive for them to cut prices’. He said energy firms were ‘gaming the system’ to avoid having their prices frozen at a level they could not sustain.","Labour leader Ed Miliband launched the energy freeze policy in 2013 .

"The first conversation between our ancestors was about DIY and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago. This is according to an international study which found stone tool-making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the African savannah. It suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought, and that tool-making helped drive evolution. Scroll down for video . The researchers arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping'. This is when butchering 'flakes' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks, like basalt or flint . '[Tool-making] created the evolutionary advantage necessary for the development of modern human communication and teaching,' said Dr Thomas Morgan, lead author of the study at the University of California, Berkeley. 'Our data show this process was ongoing two and a half million years ago, which allows us to consider a very drawn-out and gradual evolution of the modern human capacity for language and suggests simple 'proto-languages' might be older than we previously thought.' The researchers, who included scientists at the University of Liverpool and St Andrews, arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping'. This is when butchering 'flakes' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks, like basalt or flint. This diagram shows the stone-knapping process. The study tested five different ways to convey Oldowan stone-knapping skills to more than 180 college students . The art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping' was used in the Stone Age to craft tools like hand axes (shown) Oldowan stone-knapping dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period in eastern Africa, and remained largely unchanged for 700,000 years until more sophisticated Acheulean hand-axes and cleavers were developed. Stone-knapping was practiced by some of our earliest ancestors, such as Homo habilis and the even older Australopithecus garhi, who walked on two legs, but whose facial features and brain size were closer to those of apes. In testing five different ways to convey Oldowan stone-knapping skills to more than 180 college students, the researchers found that the demonstration that used spoken communication – versus imitation, non-verbal presentations or gestures – yielded the highest volume and quality of flakes. It is hard for scientists to say precisely when humans started making tools because the more primitive remains look like a natural object rather than a human artefact. The oldest-known instruments are the Oldowan stone tools from Ethiopia, which date back about 2.6 million years. The Acheulean tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite. Towards the end of this period, the tools became more refined and then followed the so-called Levallois technique, which saw the creation of scrapers, slicers, needled and flattened needles. About 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by Neanderthals and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone. As human culture advanced, artefacts such as fish hooks, buttons and bone needles were used. To measure the rate of transmission of the ancient butchery technology, and establish whether more complex communication such as language would get the best results, study volunteers were divided into five- or 10-member 'learning chains.' The head of the chain received a knapping demonstration, the raw materials and five minutes to try their hand at it. That person then showed it to the next person in the chain, who in turn showed the next person, and so on. Their competence picked up significantly with verbal instruction. Dr Morgan explained: 'If someone is trying to learn a skill that has lots of subtlety to it, it helps to engage with a teacher and have them correct you. 'You learn so much faster when someone is telling you what to do.' As for what the results mean for the Oldowan hominins: 'They were probably not talking. These tools are the only tools they made for 700,000 years. 'So if people had language, they would have learned faster and developed newer technologies more rapidly.' He added: 'To sustain Acheulean technology, there must have been some kind of teaching, and maybe even a kind of language, going on, even just a simple proto-language using sounds or gestures for 'yes' or 'no,' or 'here' or 'there'.' The data suggest that when the Oldowan stone-tool industry started, it was most likely not being taught, but communication methods to teach it were developed later. 'At some point they reached a threshold level of communication that allowed Acheulean hand axes to start being taught and spread around successfully and that almost certainly involved some sort of teaching and proto-type language,' Dr Morgan said. The Acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - featured large stone hand axes (stock image shown) made from flint and quartzite. To sustain Acheulean technology, there must have been some kind of teaching using language, according to the study .","The study attempted to teach students art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping'

"Bureaucrats charged with bringing down obesity levels in America have cost taxpayers millions of dollars to upgrade their plane seats because they are too fat to fly in coach. Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services took 7,000 first and business class flights between 2009 and 2013, figures from the General Services Administration reveal. Almost three quarters of these premium tickets, which cost taxpayers a total of $31million, were justified as 'medical exemptions'. Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services took 7,000 first and business class flights over four years, and three quarters of them were justified as 'medical exemptions' This could mean the passenger was suffering from back pain, circulation issues, or was too fat to fit in coach seats, among other reasons. Figures obtained by the Washington Examiner showed that for 253 of these trips a one-way ticket cost more than $15,000. The data also showed HHS bosses booked more premium tickets than any other federal agency. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention booked the second highest number of premium seats, though their total came to just 3,000, less than half the HSS total. Other reasons given for the bookings were 'exceptional security circumstances,' no coach tickets being available, and that first or business class was 'required because of agency mission.' Federal employees are allowed to fly business or first class if their flight is longer than 14 hours, but only 1,400 of the 7,000 HHS flights met that criteria. The numbers will be particularly galling as the Department of Health and Human Services is charged with 'protecting the health of all Americans', including tackling obesity. HHS is charged with 'protecting the health of all Americans', including reducing obesity, which will make the numbers all the more galling . According to its own website, one of its keys goals is to 'help Americans achieve and maintain a healthy weight,' in part by promoting healthy choices in the workplace. They aim to become 'a model healthy workplace', while also investing in grants that promote healthy living in other offices. In September, the agency announced $212million in funding to battle diseases, including obesity. A spokesman for HHS told the New York Post: 'If someone is obese and too large for a seat, the doctor can put in a request. 'It’s not a rubber stamp approval. It’s not as easy as, ""My back hurts and I have a doctor’s note.""'","Health and Human Services staff took 7,000 premium flights in four years .

"Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a judge Tuesday to suspend jury selection for a month because of last week's deadly terrorist attacks in France.

According to the lawyers, a delay would allow some time 'for the extraordinary prejudice flowing from these events — and the comparison of those events to those at issue in this case — to diminish.' Scroll down for video . Appeal: Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (seen in courtroom sketch from January 5) asked a judge  to suspend jury selection because of last week's attacks in France . Comparison: The defense said the bloody events in Paris have again placed the 2013 marathon bombings that killed three and wounded 260 'at the center of a grim global drama' Legal team: Tsarnaev's lawyers, David Bruck, left, Judy Clarke, center, and Miriam Conrad, right, have asked repeatedly to delay the trial and to move it outside Massachusetts . They said potential jurors have been instructed to avoid media reports about Tsarnaev's case, but were exposed to reports about the massacre in France. 'Almost immediately after the attacks, the press, politicians, and commentators drew parallels between the French attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing,' the lawyers wrote. In the marathon case, authorities say Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planned and carried out the attack as retaliation for US wars in Muslim countries. Three people were killed and more than 260 were wounded when twin bombs exploded at the finish line April 15, 2013. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police days after the bombings. Dzhokhar, 21, could face the death penalty if convicted. In the Paris attacks, which began January 7 on the third day of jury selection in Tsarnaev's trial, two gunmen, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, burst into the Paris offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people.

On alert: In the harbor near the courthouse, heavily armed US Coast Guard boats plied the waters . Trail begins: More than 1,350 prospective jurors in the Boston bombing trial were called in to federal court in Boston last week to fill out lengthy juror questionnaires . A total of 17 people were shot dead in a three-day terrorist killing spree, including four hostages inside a kosher deli. The Kouachi brothers and a third gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, were killed by police in two raids. More than 1,350 prospective jurors in the Boston bombing trial were called in to federal court in Boston last week to fill out lengthy juror questionnaires. The judge will begin questioning individual jurors Thursday. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have asked repeatedly to delay the trial and to move it outside Massachusetts, where almost everyone seems to know someone connected to the marathon or personally affected by the 2013 bombings. Federal Judge George O'Toole Jr. has rejected the defense requests. Last week, officials in Boston drastically stepped up security measures in light of the attakc sin France. White SUVs from Homeland Security lineed up bumper-to-bumper in front of Boston's federal courthouse Friday while others periodically circled the block. Boston police officers patroled the perimeter on foot, and a dark special operations van was stationed near the entrance. In the harbor nearby, armed US Coast Guard boats plied the waters, and inside the court building officers with dogs roamed the hallways.

Perpetrators: Said (left) and Cherif Kouachi (right) targeted the magazine after it repeatedly published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive . Boston police spokesman Michael McCarthy said his department was not aware of any credible threats. Boston's federal courthouse is used to heightened security, most recently in 2013, when notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger was tried, convicted and sentenced there. Law enforcement officials will be keeping a watchful eye on the demonstrators and onlookers the proceedings periodically have drawn, as well as the hundreds of prospective jurors who have been filing in and out of the courthouse complex. They'll likely also be keeping tabs on social media, where Tsarnaev's supporters and bombing conspiracy theorists have been active. The heightened awareness extends to nearby businesses along the rapidly developing waterfront.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers said the events in Paris have again placed the 2013 marathon bombings 'at the center of a grim global drama'

"Its first season won over audiences as a gritty and down-to-earth crime drama. But viewers seem to have turned on Broadchurch, criticising the new series' 'soap opera' plotlines and branding it a 'fancy EastEnders'. As character Joe Miller goes on trial for the murder of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer, many viewers have also been left frustrated by the 'unrealistic' court scenes. Scroll down for video . Viewers of the second show of series two of Broadchurch complained about legal inaccuracies as the trial of Joe Miller, whose previous admission for killing 11-year-old Danny Latimer, was ruled inadmissible . Millions of viewers have tuned in for the return of the ITV drama, starring David Tennant as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy and Olivia Coleman as his partner, DS Ellie Miller - also wife of murder suspect Joe Miller. During last night's show it was the initial crown court scenes that attracted criticism. Viewers complained about normal legal processes being subverted - with some commenting on potential witnesses sitting in court, listening to proceedings before they gave evidence. They also noted that despite his not guilty plea just a few weeks before, Miller's trial appears to have come round a lot quicker than is normal in the current British judicial system. In reality, it can take several months for cases to be heard. Marc Willers QC, a human rights barrister, tweeted: 'Broadchurch ruined for me by totally unrealistic court room scenes. 'Very annoying for lawyers watching such twaddle.' In last night's episode most of the key witnesses are shown sitting in court despite the fact only a couple have given evidence so far, including suspect Mark Latimer as he watches Beth in the witness stand. Wee Scottish Mummy added: 'Am I only one who thought Broadchurch was v unrealistic last night? A criminal trial starting w'in weeks, witnesses listening in court etc?' Judge Meera Syal last night ruled that the killer’s confession – which Joe Miller had given willingly – was in fact inadmissible. Viewers complained about unrealistic scenes and proper court processes not being followed in Broadchurch . Other viewers commented on the unrealistic timescales with Joe Miller's trial starting weeks after his plea . Experts also complained about legal arguments being conducted in front of a jury - when this would normally take place behind closed doors in front of a judge to ensure members of the jury are not prejudiced. The first series of Broadchurch premiered in March 2013 and was nominated for seven BAFTA awards. It focused on the death of 11-year-old Danny Latimer and the impact of grief and media attention on the town. Most of the cast has returned for the second series. It was a bad night for DI Alec Hardy and DS Ellie Miller in Broadchurch last night as Miller's trial began . Around 7.2million people tuned in for the first installment of the second series but some complained that they were forced to use subtitles to understand what was happening, because David Tenant mumbled and actors spoke in strong Scottish accents. Viewers dipped to 6.1million last night - a record low for the series. A spokeswoman for Kudos, who produced the drama said: 'The scripts for Broadchurch are thoroughly researched and we take legal advice. However, Broadchurch is fictional story-telling and as happens with television drama creative decisions are taken to heighten the dramatic effect.'","Second episode of series two of Broadchurch criticised for inaccuracies .

"Moshe Feiglin called for concentration camps in Gaza in his action plan . An Israeli official has called for concentration camps in Gaza and ‘the conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters’. Moshe Feiglin, Deputy Speaker of the Israeli Knesset and member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud Party, posted the inflammatory message on his Facebook page at the weekend. He lays out a detailed plan for the destruction of Gaza -  which includes shipping its residents across the world - in a letter he addressed to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The message, which received more than 2,000 likes on his page, lists four action points which he wants to be enforced as soon as possible. Feiglin details the first one as 'defining the enemy' and states: 'The strategic enemy is extremist Arab Islam in all its varieties, from Iran to Gaza, which seeks to annihilate Israel in its entirety. The immediate enemy is Hamas. (Not the tunnels, not the rockets, but Hamas.)' He says another important part of his plan is the 'conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters.' Moshe Feiglin is Deputy Speaker of the Israeli Knesset and member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud Party, and posted the message on his Facebook page at the weekend . He lays out a detailed plan for the destruction of Gaza - which includes shipping its residents across the world - in a letter he addressed to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . The Gaza war, now in its fourth week, has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead. Feiglin details how he wants the Israeli PM 'to turn Gaza into Jaffa, a flourishing Israeli city with a minimum number of hostile civilians.' In 1948 Jaffa was a Palestinian town but there was an exodus of most of its Arab population when it fell to the fledgling Israeli army and right-wing Jewish militias. In the letter he expresses his desire for the IDF to find areas on the Sinai border to establish 'tent encampments...until relevant emigration destinations are determined.' He says that the supply of electricity and water to the Gaza would be disconnected before being 'shelled with maximum fire power.' In his plan the supply of electricity and water to the Gaza would be disconnected before being 'shelled with maximum fire power' Feiglin  states: 'The strategic enemy is extremist Arab Islam in all its varieties, from Iran to Gaza, which seeks to annihilate Israel in its entirety. The immediate enemy is Hamas. (Not the tunnels, not the rockets, but Hamas.)' Feiglin explains how the IDF would then 'exterminate nests of resistance, in the event that any should remain.' Part of his plan includes shipping the people living in Gaza across the world. He says to encourage the movement those who willingly agree to emigrate will be given 'a generous economic support package.' But those who resist leaving their home will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. Then Israeli law will be extended to cover the entire Gaza Strip and 'the city of Gaza and its suburbs will be rebuilt as true Israeli touristic and commercial cities.' A second Gaza ceasefire collapsed in just six minutes this morning after an Israeli F16 jet destroyed a house in a beach-side refugee camp, killing an eight-year-old girl and wounding dozens. Israel announced the temporary ceasefire to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid and allow some of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by an almost four-week-old war to go home. Hamas said it would not be observing the truce, and warned people to exercise extreme caution when venturing out onto the streets after earlier temporary ceasefire arrangements collapsed into a frenzy of bloodshed. Feiglin’s Facebook page is verifiable as it is linked from his official page on the Knesset website.

"A dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists. Researchers at Wisconsin University in Madison have been using computer algorithms to analyse the whoops and songs produced by the apes. Gibbons have one of the loudest calls in the natural world, creating whoops that can travel for miles through the dense the forests where they live in south east Asia. The researchers studied the calls of white-handed gibbons like the one above to decode what the calls mean . Some species even have enlarged throat sacks that serve as a resonating chamber to amplify their call. Now after hours of studying the animals, zoologist Dr Angela Dassow believes she can recognise what the gibbons are saying to each other. Building on work started by primate biologist Dr Esther Clarke, from the University of St Andrews, she has identified 26 basic sounds like 'wa', 'hoo', 'oo' and 'waoo' that white handed gibbons use to communicate. Gibbons singing usually consists of a crescendo of notes, particularly in response to predators. This usually starts with a series of soft 'hoo' noises that are only audible at close range but this rapidly grows to become much louder. In most studied cases these songs are produced in response to predators but they also duet together in social song. Working with Professor Michael Coen, a computer scientist at Wisconsin University, Dr Dassow is now attempting to unpick how these sounds are used to form rudimentary 'words' and 'phrases', much like in human language. For example, a series of 'woos', 'hoos' are used by gibbons in the group to warn that a predator such as a leopard or snake is in the area. Miss Dassow and Professor Coen have found that these calls also contain information about what the predator is doing - standing still, walking or climbing. They have also found that dominant females also tend to use more of these basic sounds than others in the group and believe it may be because they are issuing instructions. Speaking to New Scientist, Professor Coen said: 'If the predator is stationary, there's an extra ""adjective"" afterwards. 'A male may be saying, ""We're being attacked"", but the females are the alphas, so maybe they're the ones giving instructions on what to do.' Writing in her PhD thesis, Dr Dassow added: 'Gibbon vocal productions that are unexpectedly governed by rules and statistical distributions common in human speech.' Professor Coen and Dr Dassow created  a computer algorithm that is able to analyse the sounds produced by the gibbons by measuring subtle variations in the frequency of the calls. The technique, called Cepstral Self-Similarity Matrices, has enabled them to unpick the 'language' being used by white handed gibbons in far more detail than has been possible in the past. White handed gibbons, like the one above, are endangered in the rain forests they inhabit in southeast Asia . The algorithm is able to detect 25 different sounds in this way. However, while most humans would struggle to detect these subtlety different calls, Dr Dassow says he can hear 26 different sounds as the software fails to detect a variation in one of the calls. Dr Dassow said: 'For example, predator alarm calls share basic properties, statistical phonemic distributions and overall structure but each displays unique sequences associated with a particular predator. 'We view these as semantic units within the calls identifying the predator, as opposed to behavioral exhortations intended to trigger responses within the social group.' Professor Coen has also programmed a piano keyboard to play the different components of gibbon song, opening up the possibility of being able to 'talk' back to the gibbons. They have yet to test it as they have concentrated on predator warning calls and want to examine some of the more intimate interactions between the gibbons before they do. The researchers hope to study the calls white handed gibbons like the one above in the wild in Thailand . An example of a white handed gibbon singing at while in an enclosure at a zoo . The researchers are also planning to apply the technique to other animals such as rats and dolphins in the hope of producing a kind of Rosetta Stone for animal communication. They claim to have already identified 29 different sounds produced by rats. Their work could also provide a new way of looking at how humans developed their own language skills. Whoops and similar calls are thought to have been used by our ancestors to communicate before they developed more complex language. Dr Esther Clarke, who first started the work studying the meanings of gibbon song and now works at Durham University, said: 'Not unlike humans, gibbons assemble a finite number of call units into more complex structures to convey different messages. 'Our data show that distant individuals are able to distinguish between different song types and infer meaning.'

"The entry for Indigenous Australian on Wikipedia was one of the most viewed pages during 2014 gaining 4.7million hits on May 24 alone . Popular pages on Wikipedia during 2014 have been revealed with one of the most read entries being 'Indigenous Australian'. For eight days running starting on May 18, the entry was the most viewed page reaching a peak of 4.7million hits on May 24. But despite being one of the most read pages on the encyclopedia site last year, it is unclear why so many people worldwide were searching for the term. The list of last year's most viewed Wikipedia pages has been compiled by website Quartz, who analysed the top viewed page every day of last year. During the study, they found that most of the top results followed big news events, with the profile of actor Robin Williams being viewed more than 5.1million times on August 12, the day after his death. The profile for fellow actor Philip Seymour Hoffman was also the top viewed page with 1.7million hits on February 2, the day of his death. During early March, the entry for Crimea was the most-well read, which coincided with the region's annexation by Russia. Meanwhile during most of June, while the FIFA World Cup was taking place in Brazil, its entry on Wikipedia was the most viewed on almost half of the days in the month. But for other pages, such as 'Indigenous Australian', researchers are unable to say why they were so popular, although one explanation is that during this time Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot announced cuts to programmes that help his country's aboriginal population. Another possible explanation is it came in the lead up to National Sorry Day, which is in honour of the Stolen Generations in Australia. Other pages which also received high page views for no apparent explanation is the entry for the dinosaur species triceratops, which received 1.1million hits on March 28. There were also two consecutive days of more than a million views of the Malware page and the entry explaining the meaning of alliteration was the most viewed entry for seven consecutive days.

However, the site explained: 'Because the data measure page views and not unique visitors, they are subject to distortion from bots, or software that requests pages programatically. 'A software developer could accidentally write a bot that views a page tens of thousands of times instead of once. This helps explain the very large numbers of views for random pages like Malware.' The results almost mirror the most searched for terms on Google last year, which also saw the World Cup being one of the most popular searches.

"A new set of stamps featuring characters from Alice in Wonderland is set to go on sale today to mark the 150th anniversary of Lewis Carroll's classic children's book. The set features 10 scenes including the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and Alice herself. Award-winning illustrator Grahame Baker-Smith was commissioned to design the stamps and to coincide with the launch, Royal Mail has collaborated with children's publisher Walker Books to create a book based on the stamp artwork. Royal Mail has commissioned a new set of stamps featuring characters from Alice in Wonderland to mark the 150th anniversary of the Lewis Carroll book . Award-winning illustrator Grahame Baker-Smith was commissioned to design the stamps, which are set to go on sale . The story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, tells the story of a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world . Andrew Hammond, director of stamps and collectibles at Royal Mail, said: 'The story of Alice in Wonderland remains a perennial favourite of children, and indeed adults, around the world. 'It is fitting that in its 150th anniversary year it is celebrated with a wonderful set of stamps featuring striking images that do justice to such an iconic tale.' The story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which was originally entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground, tells the story of a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world. It is thought that the character of Alice may have been based on Alice Liddell, who struck up a friendship with Lewis Carroll when he was a don at Oxford . The story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, was originally entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground . The character White Rabbit is described as being always late in the books, so it is apt that he is the face of the new second class stamp . The story of Alice and the Cheshire Cat, pictured, was written down as a Christmas gift by Carroll to Alice in 1864 . The story came about as a result of a friendship between Carroll, while he was a young don at Christ Church in Oxford, and the children of the dean of the college, one of whom was Alice Liddell. Originally a story made up to entertain the children on a boat trip, Alice asked for it to be written down, which Carroll eventually did as a Christmas gift in 1864, complete with his own illustrations. Last year it was revealed that the original handwritten, illustrated manuscript will travel to the U.S. as part of the story's 150th anniversary. As well as the new set of stamps, the original manuscripts of the book will travel to the U.S. as part of the story's 150th anniversary later this year . Royal Mail has also collaborated with children's publisher Walker Books to create a book based on the stamp artwork . The British Library confirmed that it will loan the book to libraries in New York and Philadelphia as well as displaying the original manuscripts in late 2015 . The British Library confirmed that it will loan the book to New York's Morgan Library and Museum as well as the Rosenbach Museum of the Free Library of Philadelphia. The British Library also will display the book in late 2015 as part of an exhibition marking the anniversary since its 1865 publication. The library also plans a major exhibition next year marking the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.","The stamps are being launched to mark the 150th anniversary of the book .

"The pilots of a Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Minneapolis declared an emergency soon after takeoff Tuesday when they began having trouble controlling their Boeing 757. Flight 2116 safely returned to Los Angeles International Airport after circling off the Southern California coast for about an hour to burn fuel. There were no reports of injuries among the 152 people on board. One passenger, Nathan Smith, revealed that everyone on the plane was 'unnerved' and that some were in 'tears.' Scroll down for audio . The Delta Air Lines Boeing 757, right, sits parked after making an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport . The Boring 757 touched down safely an hour after it took off from LAX . 'It was almost like we were on the water, on a boat,' Smith told KTLA. 'The higher we got, it kind of got worse.' Within minutes of takeoff, the crew calmly declared an emergency and an unidentified person in the cockpit explained, 'we got a yaw problem, and we're having a little trouble controlling the airplane,' according to recording on LiveATC.net, an independent website that monitors and posts communications between pilots and air traffic controllers. Yaw refers to the left-or-right movement of an aircraft's nose, and controlling it is important to avoid not just the feeling of sliding but also a more dangerous problem called a Dutch roll — an exaggerated tail-wagging, rocking motion that can lead to a total loss of control. Pilots said that it's not unusual for a crew to declare an emergency and cut short a flight, but the Delta pilot's comment that he didn't have full command of the plane made Tuesday's incident more serious. 'Any time you have a flight-control problem in a commercial airplane, it's an emergency,' said John Nance, a former military and airline pilot. A look at the plane's route as it tried to burn of fuel before landing . The plane took off at 8.39am, and the tracking website FlightAware showed it making arcing turns about 5,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean before returning. During that period, the crew told air traffic controllers they wanted time to speak with Delta officials. 'If it was a super emergency, he wouldn't burn down fuel. He'd just come down and bang it on the ground,' said Michael Barr, a former pilot and aviation safety instructor at the University of Southern California. But if the pilots could maintain control, the prudent course was to burn fuel to get to a proper landing weight and return to 'get it back to maintenance and figure out what it was before taking it any further,' Barr said. Upon touching down shortly after 9.30am, the plane rolled back to a terminal, followed across the airfield by emergency vehicles. In an emailed statement, Delta called the problem 'a potential systems issue' without elaborating. A spokesman, Morgan Durrant, said it was 'too soon' to get into more detail and that the airline was focused on rebooking customers on other flights.","A Delta flight out of Los Angeles headed to Minneapolis was forced to make an emergency landing back at LAX Tuesday morning .

"The castle where Queen Victoria honeymooned in Perthshire is set to be turned into a luxury six-star hotel. Work was due to begin today at the 19th century Taymouth Castle at Kenmore, with the new hotel expected to open in six months. It is hoped that the estate will become one of Scotland's most exclusive retreats. Taymouth Castle in Perthshire, where Queen Victoria honeymooned, is set to be turned into a luxury six-star hotel . Plans for the hotel include selling rooms to guests in timeshare style - giving guests the opportunity to ‘buy a bit of a castle.’ In 2004, it was reported that plans to redevelop the castle as a luxury hotel with 150 rooms had been approved by Perth and Kinross Council. However, work stopped in late 2006 and in April 2009 the company restoring Taymouth Castle was declared insolvent. Former police inspector turned property developer Robin Barrasford has now taken over the project and is planning to invest £3.2million renovating the historic building, which has already received £23million to help with restoration. The castle and its contents were sold in 1922 and it became a hotel with a James Braid-designed 18-hole golf course. Former police inspector turned property developer Robin Barrasford has now taken over the project and is planning a £3.2 renovation of the historic building . The grand interiors of the building reflect its prestigious place in history as Queen Victoria's chosen honeymoon spot . The building has already undergone a £23million restoration, and another £3.2million needs to be spent on it . The site operated as a Polish hospital during the war and was later leased to a civil defence school. The 450-acre estate had been described as one of Scotland’s most beautiful properties before it fell into disrepair. Mr Barrasford says his experience in developing similar projects around the world, including two castles in France, will stand him in good stead. He believes he can deliver the project - and a huge jobs boost for the local area - while the people who came before had to contend with the global financial crash. The hotel rooms will be available in a timeshare capacity, so guests can have them for a certain number of weeks each year . In 2004, it was reported that plans to redevelop the castle as a luxury hotel with 150 rooms had been approved by Perth and Kinross Council. However, work stopped in late 2006 and company restoring Taymouth Castle was declared insolvent . The 450-acre estate had been described as one of Scotland’s most beautiful properties before it fell into disrepair . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert honeymooned at the property . Mr Barrasford, 44, a former teacher and police inspector based in Devon, said: ‘They had really great motives without the ability to create an end product.’ He said he had been working away for around a year ‘behind the scenes’ but is now ready to go public about his involvement at Taymouth. He said: ‘I have never seen anything like this, without doubt it is the most wonderful opportunity I have seen in hotel/holiday homes.’ Mr Barrasford gave up his career in the police to spend more time with his family, and has been involved in delivering 2500 holiday properties in 10 countries over the past decade. He said he is keen to move on with the project - and claimed the golf course should be open by the end of March and the hotel ready for a ‘soft launch’ in six months. Work was set to begin today on the 13 rooms in the main castle, paving the way for the east wing which will have 42 rooms sold on a ‘fractional’ basis. Mr Barrasford says this is a model which has worked well in America and involves paying £30,000 to own one thirteenth of a room for four weeks a year. He already has strong interest from people who have already bought from him before - particularly Scottish ex-pats. He added: ‘For anyone with Scottish lineage, it is a chance to buy a bit of a castle. You end up with hundreds of owners, not one faceless entity.’ Mr Barrasford has Scottish roots and family in Dunblane. He says that locals are supportive of his plans. Mr Barrasford he is also keen that all the staff recruited will be Scottish-based. He added: ‘We have a Michelin star at one of the castles in France, that is something we will aim for at Taymouth.’","New hotel at the 450-acre estate in Perthshire is set to open in six months, according to developers .

"Tinder has bought a picture sharing site similar to Snapchat amid rumours it is set to add picture sharing to its app. The firm already offers a 'moments' feature for users that allows them to share pictures with all their matches. However, the new firm, Tappy, would allow Tinder to allow users to send individual users pictures. Tinder has bought a picture sharing site similar to Snapchat amid rumours it is set to add picture sharing to its app. Tappy is a mobile messenger that uses photos and ephemerality to put a new face on text messaging. All messages disappear after 24 hours, and Tappy's conversations must begin with a photo. All Tappy messages disappear after 24 hours, and Tappy's conversations must begin with a photo. From there, you can turn that particular photo into a chat thread, with a single individual or a group. Launched in July 2014, Tappy promised: 'It's like having a live chat room attached to your fun and wacky moments.' 'We're growing and recruiting like crazy,'  Sean Rad, cofounder and CEO of Tinder told Techcrunch. 'It's incredibly difficult to find talented people to join us fast enough to keep up with our roadmap for 2015, which includes some ambitious plans. Rad also revealed Tinder is now seeing 1.5 billion swipes every day, 21 million matches each day, and just yesterday surpassed the 5 billion match mark. Tinder Moments is one feature from Tappy is expected to be used in. The feature, used daily by more than fifty percent of Tinder's users, lets people send all their matches a photo message. However, Tinder has never allowed users to privately send each other photos through the app. 'We're very good at connecting people, but there's this 'what happens after that?' moment that we want to improve,' said Rad. 'We not only want to get better at the way we use criteria to connect people, but we want to broaden the reasons for connecting in the first place. 'The Tappy team will help us tackle both fronts, the pre-match experience of creating that first connection and the post-match experience of communicating with that person.' Tappy is a mobile messenger that uses photos and ephemerality to put a new face on text messaging. The new features could also be added to a new 'plus' version of the app. A new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘undo’ button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service. The app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called Passport, which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations. The new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations. While this feature may well be used by well-travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook-ups, the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life. Tinder Plus will be the premium version of the free Tinder dating app. It will be rolled out in the UK, Brazil and Germany first on a trial basis. There is no set date for its launch, but in the beginning Tinder will charge differing amounts for the service to find its 'sweet spot'. Prices will range from 99cents (62p and £20 (£12.50), before a global rate is set. Tinder Plus will include an 'undo' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left. A 'Passport' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations.

"Channel 4  launched a new set of diversity targets which could see executives lose bonuses if these are not met, after Lenny Henry inspired the debate by criticising representation of BAME groups . Bosses at Channel 4 could see their bonuses cut if they fail to meet new diversity targets, aimed at getting more women and people from ethnic minority groups onto screens and working in television. Under the measures six per cent of the workforce, on and off screen, will be lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender while 20 per cent of workers will be from ethnic minority groups in the next five years. Comedian Lenny Henry is said to have 'turbocharged' the debate and inspired Channel 4 to launch the charter after he launched a scathing attack on the industry for failing to improve representation of black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups on and off screen. The targets have been designed to improve the representation of people from minority communities as well as the disabled and have been backed by more investment - which has been doubled to £5million. It will mean 50 per cent of the lead roles in television shows will have to be taken by females, while 15 per cent of guests and presenters in entertainment programmes will have to be from a minority sector such as BAME or disabled. Drama and comedies will need to feature at least one lead character who is disabled or from a BAME or LGBT group. Failure to meet the self imposed targets will mean top executives could see their bonuses cut, in line with the new measures that stipulate meeting targets 'is linked to annual variable pay.' David Abraham, the Channel 4 chief executive who could lose up to 30 per cent of his salary if he fails to meet the targets, said: 'It will be a black mark against that person.' Comedian Lenny Henry last year attacked broadcasters during the BAFTA lecture for failing to represent minority groups both in programmes and behind the scenes. Mr Abraham said Henry had 'definitely turbocharged the discussion … he has drawn attention to some very specific issues which I think are important and have formed part of the initiative today.' He added: 'We have a rich heritage in pioneering programming that has reshaped how we think about diversity from Desmond's and Queer as Folk through to the 2012 Paralympics, but like all media organisations, there is more we can do. 'The launch of our 360° Charter is an opportunity for us to change how we think about diversity and ensure that it's at the very heart of everything that we do, on and off-screen . Channel four has pledged £5million of funding to ensure it meets the new diversity targets it has set . The diversity charter was drawn up by Oona King, diversity executive at Channel 4, after it was revealed that fewer people from BAME backgrounds were now working in television compared to five years ago. She said the broadcaster was not looking to hire people purely because they were black or from a minority group but told the Guardian that Channel 4  needed to 'look harder for people who are talented, from those groups. Sometimes it is hard to find people'. Ms King said the targets would be difficult to achieve and said previous attempts had not been transparent enough or backed by enough funding. * The top 120 leaders meet the national averages for BAME (15 per cent), gender (50:50), disability (6 per cent) and LGBT (6 per cent) representation by 2020. * All staff will also share the same targets with a higher target for BAME representation (20 per cent) reflecting the greater ethnic diversity of the workforce in London around Channel 4's main headquarters. * Funding for seven diverse Deputy Commissioning Editors over two years. * Investing in a new generation of on and off-screen disabled talent for Rio 2016.  Channel 4 will recruit 30 production trainees with disabilities who will be given extensive training  and, alongside two new disabled presenters, will work on broadcast of the Rio 2016 Paralympics. * Leadership objective setting and incentivisation to ensure that all Channel 4's senior managers and editorial staff have specific and measurable diversity objectives and that their success in meeting them is linked to annual variable pay. * Investing in indies led by BAME entrepreneurs and those from other diverse backgrounds with the Channel 4 Growth Fund.","Channel 4 launched diversity targets to get minority groups on television .

"Medieval men dug them to harvest medicinal salt, but today Romania’s Turda salt mine complex has been turned into a theme park, with the help of some ingenious engineering.

Medieval men dug them to harvest medicinal salt, but now-a-days Romania’s Turda salt mine complex has been turned into a theme park, with the help of some ingenious engineering. This image shows a ferris wheel in a stalactite- strewn cavern . While it is possible that the mines near the city of Turda were first dug during Roman occupation, it is thought that they were founded shortly before 1075 after engineers stumbled across evidence of medieval tunnels in 1876. The first official document that mentions their existence was written by the Hungarian chancellery in 1271 and the mines’ success grew from there. In the early years, a ‘staircase of the rich people’ provided access to the mines' depths to observe the workers. To fix each step in place, labourers had to cut parallel slots in the wall. Later, three wells were used to extract the salt and were expanded in the 19th century when table salt was still very much in demand.

These benefits include a constant air temperature of 12°C and humidity between 73 to 80 per cent, which is believed to help respiratory problems.

"Nicky Morgan introduced guidelines forcing schools to promote British values . Ofsted inspectors asked ten year olds at a Christian school if they knew what lesbians 'did' to check they were being taught about British values, it has been claimed. Grindon Hall Christian School has made a formal complaint over an 'intrusive' inspection conducted in the wake of the Trojan Horse controversy over Islamist attempts to infiltrate schools. Inspectors are also said to have questioned pupils about transsexuality and asked if any of their friends felt trapped in the 'wrong body'. The school is among a growing number to complain they have been unfairly penalised by rules designed to combat extremism. There are claims that some schools – mainly those with a religious ethos or located in rural areas with few ethnic minority pupils – have been put under undue pressure by a new requirement to promote British values. Grindon Hall, which teaches pupils aged four to 18, has a Christian ethos but no faith-based selection criteria, resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions. Principal Chris Gray was a supporter of the British values initiative when details were published last year but inspectors' unannounced visit to the school last November led him to complain to Ofsted that the 'tenor of the inspection was negative and hostile'. It was 'as if the data collected had to fit a pre-determined outcome', he said, and many of the questions 'seem to betray an underlying disrespect for the Christian faith'. Pupils were asked whether anyone in their school had two mums or dads. When the inspectors were giving feedback to staff on their findings, 'it was suggested that a response from one child to the effect of querying how it is possible to have two mums was viewed as indicating a lack of awareness of lesbian relationships', the complaint letter said. Grindon Hall Christian School has formally complained about Ofsted inspectors whose questioning of pupils 'crossed the line' 'I understand the child concerned was merely thinking in biological terms. In addition, I have also heard reports of primary schoolchildren being asked if they knew of any boys or girls who thought they were in the 'wrong body'. The so-called Trojan Horse plot was an alleged attempt to introduce a hardline Islamist ethos into six Birmingham schools. It was revealed in a letter leaked in March last year, alleged to be from Islamists detailing how to wrest control of a school and speculating about using the scheme in other cities. It included claims that male and female pupils were segregated, non-Muslim staff were driven out and a strict religious agenda was imposed. A three-month Ofsted inquiry, which reported in June last year, found the schools did not do enough to protect children from extremism. In the wake of the findings, the Department for Education announced that all schools must promote 'British values' of tolerance and fairness and warned that teachers would be banned from the profession if they allowed extremists into schools. Proposals would also allow Ofsted to visit any school without warning, saying the schools in the plot had previously been able to stage a 'cover-up'. 'Another parent has complained to me that her ten-year-old daughter was asked if she knew what lesbians 'did'.' They also allegedly questioned children as young as six about their knowledge of Hindu festivals and the Jewish Torah. He suggested that the questioning of pupils 'crossed the line into harassment'. Sixth-formers at the school have also prepared written complaints, claiming that inspectors appeared to be 'manipulating' the conversation during group discussions about racism and homophobia, seemingly determined to 'discredit' the school. The guidelines, introduced by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan last year, require schools actively to promote 'British values' including democracy, liberty and tolerance.' Other institutions said to have unfairly fallen foul of the rules include a Christian school in Reading, Berkshire, that says it was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies. In another case, a high-performing primary school in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, was marked down because pupils lacked 'first-hand experience of the diverse make-up of modern British society'. Inspectors made no allowance for the fact that 97 per cent of the population of the town is white. An Ofsted spokesman said it would be 'considering the issues raised by the school' and added: 'Ofsted does not require evidence that schools 'promote' other faiths. Instead, inspectors must ensure that pupils are able to express views which are neither intolerant nor discriminatory towards others.'","Primary school children were asked about lesbian sex and transsexuals .

"What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? It is probably a little like driving a 7.5 ton truck into a 25 ton granite boulder. The US government has funded a series of tests to smash a series of vehicles into giant pieces of rock - all in the name of science. Researchers at Penn State University conducted the experiments to help them model how pieces of rock are able to withstand collisions. They have been developing a method of determining whether naturally occurring boulders can be used as security barriers around government buildings. By filming the collisions with high speed cameras, they were able to study the impact and see how much the boulder moved. Crash-test dummies are getting bigger to reflect the expanding waistlines and larger bottoms of many modern motorists. Manufacturer Humanetics have developed a new model after studies found that obese drivers are 78 percent more likely to die in a car crash. Dummies have traditionally been modeled on a person weighing about 167 pounds with a healthy body mass index. The new super-sized dummies are based on the measurements of a 273-pound person with a BMI of 35 - which is considered to be obese. Humanetics has also been developing an age-appropriate dummy to better reflect our aging population. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the outcome of the collisions depended upon three variables - the size of the boulder, the speed and size of the truck and the soil the boulder was embedded in. They found that when a medium-sized truck weighing around 7.5 tons and travelling at 30mph crashes into a five ton boulder of American black granite burined four feet deep, the boulder becomes dislodged from the soil and the truck continued travelling over the top of the boulder. However, when faced with a larger 25 ton boulder of Rockville white granite, buried about seven feet deep, the boulder moved only slightly and stopped the truck. The team were able to use their model to predict the outcome of the crashes. However, they found that if the boulder was hit at an angle and it had not been buried enough, it would rotate out of the way and allow the truck to continue. The researchers now say that their model is ready for use in the field by officials at the Depeartment of State to help them find ways of protecting embassies abroad. Scientists drove a 7.5 ton truck into a 25 ton white granite boulder (above) with some rather predictable results . The US Department of State funded the work to help protect its embassies abroad, but many like this US Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, use man-made barriers and anti-ram technology to protect the buildings . Dr Tong Qiu, a civil engineer at Penn State University who led the study, said: 'We provided a tool for the Department of State to be able to size a boulder for embassy protection. 'It's a quick assessment tool so they can do it very quickly. 'You can design all kinds of systems, but then the system has to be deployable overseas. 'For the Department of State, sometimes they just want to have a quick evaluation. They want to come up with things maybe on the fly, as a first approximation.' Using a smaller five ton granite boulder, seen above, meant the rock rolled and launched the truck into the air . Their findings are published in the International Journal of Impact Engineering. They hope they can be used to help officials find anti-ram barriers that can be quickly installed outside public buildings. While some government buildings adopt expensive artificial barriers specifically designed to stop vehicles in their tracks before they can get close, others have tried to use local rocks. However, predicting how these will respond to an impact is less predictable, so the Department of State asked the Penn State team to investigate. The 25 ton boulder moved slightly but not much was left of the truck after the crash as can be seen above . Using the Penn State Larson Institute Crash Safety Research Facility, they installed the two boulders on a track before smashing the vehicles into them. Alexander Allen Brown, one of the authors of the study who is now at Lafayette College in Pennseylvannia, told Popular Science: 'Watching crash tests is a harrowing experience, just the sound and the vibrations from it as you’re standing on the sideline, it’s so percussive it shakes you to your core. 'It turns out that in order to have a boulder buried in sand and have it work, it needs to be big. Really really big.'

"Sacha Baron Cohen reportedly asked for a receipt for a £3.50 pint so he could claim it on expenses . He may be a millionaire after having built a career as a successful comedian, writer and actor. But now it appears comedian Baron Cohen, best known for his roles as Ali G and Borat, could be watching his spending. While working on his latest film Grimsby he asked for a receipt for a pint, so he could claim it back on expenses. The comedian and writer has already offended Grimsby residents by painting it as a north Lincolnshire town largely populated by 20 stone women and 'tattooed fatties' in his latest film. And when he visited local pub the Corporation Arms, the comedian reportedly asked for a receipt for his £3.50 pint so he could claim the money back while he did his research. Nev Carrick, landlord at the pub, told the Sun: 'I told him we don't do receipts, but he needed one, so we had to write one on the back of a beer mat.' Baron Cohen, who is expecting his third child with wife Isla Fisher, has received several Bafta awards for his work as well as a Golden Globe for best actor in Borat. As well as being a comedian he is also a successful screenwriter and actor, having recently appeared in Sweeney Todd and Les Miserables. Throughout his career he has offended nations and religions. His portrayal of mankini-wearing Borat from Kazakhstan in 2006 upset the country. And in 2012 he appeared on the red carpet as a character from the Dictator, claiming to have spilled the ashes of leader Kim Jong-il - much to the displeasure of North Korea. In 2008 he was banned from all Milan fashion weeks after he brought a show to an abrupt halt when he leapt on stage as his character Bruno. In his latest offering, a film titled Grimsby, Baron Cohen appears to be taking on the town. Locals have accused him of 'kicking us while we are down' after channel four documentary Skint focused on the poverty and high levels of unemployment in the area. He is known to have recruited six, 20-stone 'revolting' women to depict female footballer supporters from the coastal town. Football violence and hooliganism abounds throughout the film and Baron Cohen himself takes on the character of a dim witted supporter. Baron Cohen is said to have asked for a receipt for a £3.50 pint he bought while at The Corporation Arms pub . In photos taken for the film Baron Cohen is seen, dressed in a football shirt, flip flops and socks, walking through litter strewn streets full of boarded up shops. Actors are seen lying around the streets, fighting and drunk and women are seen as large and heavily tattooed. Rebel Wilson, known for her roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect, plays a character called Fat Amy in Grimsby. The film is scheduled for release this year but locals are unhappy about the depiction of their town and its residents.

Grimsby councillor Matthew Brown previously said he was 'disappointed' with the film and felt it painted the town in a bad light.

"It could mean the end of the TV remote - and even the computer keyboard. Apple has been granted a patent for 'Minority Report'-style 3D gesture controls. The system uses a 3D camera to track movement, and use it to control an on screen interface - which could be a computer or the much anticipated Apple TV. Apple's US Patent 8933876 relates to 'three dimensional user interface session control' - and in this image, the system is being used with a computer to control an on screen interface. Tom Hanks in Minority Report, which predicted gesture control systems . It was announced late last year that Apple bought  Israeli company Primesense, which developed Microsoft's Kinect sensor, for around $350 million dollars . A representative for PrimseSense confirmed the deal at the time, but so far Apple has only said: 'Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.' Although Apple hasn't announced what they'll be using motion-sensor technology for, industry insiders have already begin throwing around ideas - including a rumored Apple manufactured television, . The latest US Patent No. 8933876 relates to 'three dimensional user interface session control.' The diagrams included in the patent show the technology being used to control a desktop computer. But it could also be applied to Apple TV, or to Apple's iOS devices. It also details how users would interact. For example, in a scenario invoking a soft bar (shown in the illustration above as a system dock), a user raises their hand to unlock and activate motion tracking. In 2013, the Cupertino company bought the Israeli startup PrimeSense for a reported £360 million — one of its largest acquisitions at the time. PrimeSense had previously helped Microsoft develop its motion-sensing Kinect technology. If the user drops their hand out of the sensing hardware's field of view, the session is likewise dropped, with the example soft bar falling offscreen. The patent suggests users could unlock their Macs by 'swiping' upward in the air. In 2013 Apple was also granted a patent for a 3D camera. The patent details a system capable of capturing low-resolution images that can be refocused even after they’ve been taken and processed. A 3D camera - which Apple has also patented - tracks a user's hand . The patent application also reveals the same system being used to control a TV - perhaps the much anticipated Apple TV? It would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image, similar to the technology seen in Lytro cameras, meaning the shots appear in 3D rather than 2D. According to patent papers, which were originally filed in 2011, photographers could take an image and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different shots. These images would be taken through what’s called a microlens array. According to Apple's patent, this array would be detachable and could be removed when the user wanted to take a traditional high-resolution photo. A similar array is already used in Lytro’s Light Field Cameras.","Patent shows system that could control a TV, Mac, or even an iPad .

"Continued sightings of a five-metre great white shark off the Newcastle coast have closed beaches for a fourth straight day. Swimmers and surfers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday. The coastal stretch between Nobbys and Stockton beaches in Newcastle remain closed for a fourth consecutive day after lifeguards spotted the large shark on Monday morning. Council Lifesavers have voiced their frustration at the timing of the shark appearances, but have vowed that they will not be reopening the beaches until the sharks have left the area. Scroll down for video . Following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, the entire coastline remains shut down . Nobbys Beach inspector Scott Hammerton told Daily Mail Australia he was called to the northern end of Burwood Beach at about 2.30pm on Tuesday. ‘I got a call from some patrolling water police about a large shark sighting. They confirmed it was a great white, five-metres in length and very thickset.’ ‘It came up to their boat to have a look then it gave them a flick with it’s tail and went underwater. It dashed off towards the surf zone where they lost it. It just disappeared under the rocks,’ he said. Earlier in the day, lifeguards spotted another large shark off Stockton breakwall as well as another sighting at Dudley. Mr Hammerton said council lifeguards, water police and a Westpac Rescue Helicopter would continue to search the beaches until the sharks had left. ‘We’ve gotta keep going. These are big sharks that could cause harm to swimmers and we aren’t going to take any risks.’ ‘This is the peak of the season and we want people to be enjoying themselves out in the water, however we are not going to budge and let people in the water until they have left.’ Mr Hammerton if there are no sightings after a thorough search on Wednesday morning, they may reopen the beach. Swimmers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at a beach . Newcastle beaches have been closed for a fourth straight day following the sighting of a great white shark . When asked why the sharks are sticking around, he said there are two prevailing theories. ‘One idea is that it’s a great white sanctuary. They might be coming in close to the shore to offer warm water to give birth and raise their young.’ ‘The other idea is that the sharks started appeared in line with a cold current on Saturday. There has been a lot of marine activity in the area since then and the sharks may be following suite,’ he said. Newcastle City Council beach inspector Mick Body says the closure has been the longest in his memory. 'We're a little bit frustrated, especially today because it's such a nice day,' he said. 'We are still searching and being cautious, we're constantly getting sightings from members of the public.' Mr Body said he was waiting for the Westpac Life Saver Helicopter to fly over the coastline and hopefully give the all clear. The helicopter has been busy with medical emergencies throughout Tuesday. While some surfers have found the waves too tempting, most had kept clear of the water since the shark was first seen on Saturday afternoon at Merewether Beach. The latest sighting at Dudley beach on Tuesday morning could indicate the shark was moving south of Newcastle, reversing its northbound route overnight. Several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday . Although a jet ski has been patrolling the beaches, Mr Body said a helicopter was needed to get a good look. 'They might see more action in the ocean than we can see on a jet ski,' he said. The helicopter will be searching for a shadow of the shark close to shore or behind the break. Increased marine activity and overcast and warm weather are thought to be possible reasons for the shark's prolonged presence. Rob Townsend, life sciences manager at Manly Sea Life Sanctuary, said the shark's behaviour in staying close to the coastline was not unusual. 'It may be hunting eagle rays, which are a favourite food for sharks and are found close to the shore,' he said. 'Great whites are very variable. They spend time in the surf where they are sometimes spotted by lifeguards and then they also have their massive oceanic migration where they travel to South Africa. They are very adaptable.' He added that people were better safe than sorry and should keep out of the water while the shark continues to be spotted. Lifeguards spotted the shark on Monday and are monitoring its progress between Nobbys and Stockton . Nearby resident, 14-year-old keen surfer Nicholas Tonks captured a photograph of the five-metre shark swimming behind a lifesaver on a jetski on Saturday. 'My house is pretty close to the beach so when I heard the shark alarm go off, I grabbed my camera and quickly dashed down,' the young photographer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was overlooking the beach and saw a lot of jetskis around so I looked through the lens of my camera and snapped a few shots. It wasn't until I got home, I realised I got a picture of the shark.' 'There were no attacks reported but the lifeguards did a great job to maintain and get everyone out of the water - they were very visual on their jetskis as well.' 'It's quite irregular to have them hanging around constantly,' he said. It comes just less than a week after multiple sharks were spotted at the iconic Bondi Beach, forcing beachgoers out of the water and shutting down for a couple of hours until it was all clear again.","The area between Nobbys and Stockton beaches was closed for four days .

"His job is to discipline Tory MPs – but Michael Gove was on the receiving end of a dressing down yesterday in front of his Cabinet colleagues. The PM's Chief Whip had broken one of the most basic rules of government ... and allowed his phone to go off during the ministers' weekly conference. The former Education Secretary's mobile rang as Chancellor George Osborne spoke about the latest drop in inflation, The Times reported. Instead of quickly muting the sound, Mr Gove fumbled for 'quite a while' before he was able to switch it off. The ringtone was described variously as a 'female ballad' and 'Jazz-FM style' music for 'after a heavy night out'. The Prime Minister was forced to stop a cabinet meeting to ask chief whip, Michael Gove, to switch his mobile phone off . When asked why he had chosen the ringtone, Mr Gove said it was an 'in-joke'. David Cameron is said to have interrupted the meeting and asked Mr Gove to turn off his phone immediately, before reminding him that mobiles are banned from the Cabinet meeting room; ministers typically leave them in a box outside for security reasons. The reaction from Mr Cameron – a long-standing friend of Mr Gove – was described as a 'public b******ing' by witnesses. Mr Gove was moved in the summer reshuffle, which saw him replaced as Education Secretary by Nicky Morgan. The change was viewed as a demotion by some, but the PM stressed that he wanted one of his 'big hitters' to take over as Chief Whip. Mr Gove may take solace from the fact that he is not the first high-profile politician to forget to switch off his mobile. Gordon Brown's speech at the Davos economic summit in 2009 was interrupted when his own phone went off. Ministers who were at the meeting reportedly said that Mr Cameron's reaction was like a public b******ing'","Michael Gove's mobile phone reportedly rang during cabinet meeting .

"House prices soared by 10 per cent over the past year - driven 'in large part' by runaway prices in London, official figures revealed this morning. Homes in the capital were £65,000 more expensive in November than at the same time last year – a 15.3 per cent increase in 12 months. Excluding London and the wider South East, house prices increased by 7.1 per cent across the rest of the country, the Office for National Statistics said. House prices in the UK were up 10% in the 12 months to November, the Office for National Statistics said. The boom was driven 'in large part' by the runaway prices in London - with properties up 15.3 per cent . But there were some signs that the great house price boom was easing off. In the month between October and November last year, house prices grew 0.2% - compared to an increase of 0.6% during the same period a year earlier. London homes are also slightly down compared to August - falling 2.5 per cent in three months. However, this is still 36.1 per cent higher than in January 2008. Housing charity Shelter said the booming housing market was making it impossible for an increasing number of families to get on the property ladder. Chief executive Campbell Robb, said: 'With house prices still sky-high, it's no surprise that homeownership in the UK is now below the European average. 'Shelter hears from people every day who are desperate to put down roots for their family, but have lost hope of ever having a home of their own. Something's just not right when millions of people are stuck in a ""rent-trap"", with barely enough money left over each month to make ends meet, let alone save up for a deposit.' In the year to November, prices grew 10.4 per cent in England, 3.1 per cent in Wales, 4.4 per cent in Scotland and 11.7 per cent in Northern Ireland. Every region in England recorded higher house price growth more than Scotland and Wales. Britain's housing boom continued in the 12 months to November, but was showing signs of slowing down with house price growth falling from 10.4 per cent to 10 per cent . Britain's five year house price boom has benefited Conservative supporting areas much more than Labour constituencies . Prices grew fastest in the South East and East Anglia – up 10.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent respectively. House price growth was weakest in the West Midlands - with properties up 5.1 per cent - followed by Yorkshire & The Humber and the North East, recording 5.3 per cent and 5.9 per cent. The booming property market is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get on their foot on the housing ladder. In November, prices paid by first-time buyers were 11 per cent higher on average than at the same time the year before - with the average price paid hitting £208,000. The average UK house price in October was £271,000 – with properties in England the most expensive at £283,000. Homes in Wales cost £171,000 on average, £194,000 in Scotland and £147,000 in Northern Ireland. In London meanwhile the average house costs £501,000 – almost three and a half times more than in the North East which has the lowest average house prices at £155,000. London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of £271,000.","Britain's housing boom is being fuelled by 15% price rises in London .

"The Duchess of Cornwall’s brother died after a night of champagne, whisky and dance, an inquest heard yesterday. Mark Shand, 62, stumbled and smashed his head outside a New York luxury hotel. He went into a coma and died nine hours later. The coroner said alcohol played a major role in the tragedy last April. Mr Shand had suffered major bleeding on the brain, according to a post-mortem examination. Scroll down for video . Mark Shand, the younger brother of Camilla Parker Bowles (pictured together), had enjoyed five whiskies and a glass of champagne before dancing to his favourite Rolling Stones song on the night of his death . A contributing factor was that his skull was unusually thin – just one millimetre in places – and had fractured. Just hours before he died Mr Shand was hosting an auction for his endangered species charity, The Elephant Trust. Attended by Princess Eugenie, the Sotheby’s event raised nearly £1million and was followed by dinner and then a party at the exclusive Diamond Horseshoe club off Times Square. Mr Shand’s group then went to the Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, according to his colleague Alexandra Bowes-Lyon. Ruth Powys, the girlfriend of Mark Shand, pictured with the conservationist just hours before his death as he hosted The Fabergé Big Egg Hunt at Sothebys in New York . Alexandra Bowes-Lyon, a 29-year-old socialite who works for the trust, said she spent the night by Mr Shand's side. Above, Miss Bowes-Lyon leaves the inquest with Mr Shand's brother-in-law Simon Elliot . ‘At one point Mark’s favourite Rolling Stones track came on and we got up to dance,’ the 29-year-old socialite told the inquest. ‘We were only there for about half an hour. Mark suggested we went outside for a cigarette. ‘We were standing outside just talking. He stumbled back and fell straight back. He took one step but then he fell straight down rather than stumbled. ‘He had seemed just like normal Mark up until then – it was very sudden.’ By this point Mr Shand had downed five whiskies and a glass of champagne. The Rolling Stones tune is thought to have been Satisfaction. Mark Deverell, the pathologist who examined his body, concluded that Mr Shand died as a result of intra-cranial haemorrhage with a skull fracture and blunt trauma. The inquest heard that because Mr Shand’s body had been embalmed it was ‘unsuitable’ for scientists to carry out a toxicology report. Mr Shand had been hosting an auction  in aid of his charity The Elephant Trust, which protects Asian elephants, on the evening of his death. Above, Mr Shand (right) with Cara Delevingne and her father, Charles . However a blood sample taken from Mr Shand at the Bellevue Hospital Centre in New York showed he had 210 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood – more than twice the UK drink drive limit. Sheriff Payne, the Dorset coroner, recorded a verdict of accidental death at the hearing in Bournemouth. Mr Payne said: ‘The post-mortem examination showed there were no signs of a heart attack so sadly alcohol plays a prominent part in the outcome. ‘It is also significant that he had a very thin skull in parts. What someone else with a normal skull might have survived he did not in this case. ‘I therefore record a verdict that Mark Roland Shand’s death was an accident. ‘It was an entirely unexpected event at the end of what was a very successful and enjoyable evening for his charity.’ Miss Bowes-Lyon, who flew over from her home in New York for the inquest, said she was at Mr Shand’s side all day and he had been very happy with the results of the auction. Mr Shand, who lived in the Dorset village of Stourpaine, was the younger brother of Camilla Parker Bowles and their sister Annabel Elliot. Mr Shand was a passionate conservationist and founded the charity Elephant Family after saving one Indian elephant, Tara (pictured) from a life of misery before riding her on a thousand-mile trip . Annabel’s husband Simon, a Dorset landowner and son of Air Chief Marshal Sir William Elliot and Rosemary Chancellor, was also at the inquest. Mr Shand had not written a will and his estate, worth close to £1million, went to his 20-year-old daughter Ayesha who is an art student in Italy. He attended Milton Abbey school in Dorset until the age of 16 when he was expelled for smoking cannabis. He then worked as a porter for Sotheby’s before setting up a business selling Cartier jewellery. In 1988, Mr Shand travelled to India where he found his love of elephants. He gave up his job selling jewellery in 2002 and founded his charity that protects Asian elephants. His 1992 book, Travels On My Elephant, documented a 600-mile journey across India.

"Republican congressman Randy Weber went after President Barack Obama on Twitter for his absence at the Paris solidarity march on Sunday and compared him to Hitler . A GOP congressman compared President Barack Obama to Hitler while criticizing the U.S. leader for neglecting to attend a solidarity march in France last weekend. Texas Rep. Randy Weber tweeted: 'Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all the wrong reasons.) Obama couldn't do it for right reasons. Weber notably misspelled Hitler's first name, which was Adolf, not Adolph. A conservative congressman who was among a group of 25 Republicans last week who revolted against House Speaker John Boehner, Weber has excoriated Obama in the past over his plans to give 'amnesty' to millions of immigrants residing in the country illegally. Ahead of last year's State of the Union address he used a Nazi-era term for military police to in a tweet attacking Obama and suggested that the Democratic president was purposefully misleading the American people. 'On floor of house waitin on ""Kommandant-In-Chef""... the Socialistic dictator who's been feeding US a line or is it ""A-Lying?""' Weber first tried to justify his tweet invoking reviled German dictator Hitler in his verbal assault on Obama, telling the Dallas Morning News it was meant to 'start a discussion' about the president's foreign policies. 'Hitler reminds us that there’s evil in the world. Obama doesn’t seem to get it. This is about his foreign policy, his actions or lack thereof,' Weber said. But after the controversy over his tweet raged on, he apologized in full. 'It was not my intention to trivialize the Holocaust nor to compare the President to Adolf Hitler,' Weber said in a statement, this time spelling Hilter's first name correctly. 'The mention of Hitler was meant to represent the face of evil that still exists in the world today. I now realize that the use of Hitler invokes pain and emotional trauma for those affected by the atrocities of the Holocaust and victims of anti-Semitism and hate,' he professed. Prior to Weber's retraction, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had gone for the jugular over the matter, calling his tweet  'beyond vile and insulting.' Twitter users also blasted him. '[W]hat the hell is wrong with you. Moron,' Jack Hutton said in a reply. 'So you're saying... Obama is worse than Hitler?' another user asked. 'I mean, geez. If you're going to the Reductio ad Hitlerum route at least spell ""Adolf"" correctly,' a user named Josh Terry lampooned. New York Rep. Steve Israel, who is Jewish, said in a statement that the tweet was 'vile and stoops to a new low level by desecrating the victims of the Holocaust to make a political point.' 'At a time when we should be coming together in the wake of the attacks in Paris, Rep. Weber turned instead to hate. 'While I, too, disagree with the President's absence in Paris, there is a proper way to express that disagreement, unlike Rep. Weber's tweet,' the Democrat said, chastizing Weber for having a 'complete lack of judgment.' Hitler once visited France's capitol city in 1940 after it was under German control. During the brief trip he viewed the tomb of famed French emperor Napoleon and marveled at the city's architecture, drawing inspiration from Paris for the construction of public buildings in his own country's capitol, Berlin. He also arranged for two WWI memorials, one honoring British nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed by a German firing squad for aiding Allied soldiers, and the other French General Charles Mangin, be destroyed, as they represented German defeat. Obama last visited the Paris in June when he attended a service commemorating D-Day and the liberation of northern France from Hitler's forces. Since the Sunday unity rally in Paris memorializing the victims of a terrorist attack on satirical publication Charlie Hebdo, Obama has been assailed by Republicans and the media for sitting out the major event, which attracted millions. 'The absence is symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage, and it is dangerous. The attack on Paris, just like previous assaults on Israel and other allies, is an attack on our shared values,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a presumed candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said Monday in an op-ed for Time. 'Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies. We should never hesitate to speak the truth. In Paris or anywhere else in the world,' Cruz wrote. Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris on another matter, but he did not march for undisclosed reasons. The U.S. ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, was the highest-ranking American to march. The White House's failure to send a visible U.S. representation at the event that was attended by more than 40 other world leaders fueled a sparring match between 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and members of the press on Monday as reporter after reporter demanded that the president's spokesman explain the  goof up. The West Wing's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, acknowledged that the president's advisers made a mistake in not ordering a cabinet-level official to the march. 'I think it’s fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there,' he said. Without directly blaming West Wing staff, Earnest confessed that Obama was not involved in the decision-making process. He also confirmed that both the president and vice president were resting at home over the weekend, though the Obama administration official adamantly denied that either U.S. leader could have marched in Paris  without their security detail 'significantly' impeding the experience of other marchers, which he said was a major concern of the White House. Earnest said 'had the circumstances been a little bit different, I think the President himself would have liked to have had the opportunity,' pointing out that the White House was informed of the march just 36 hours before it was to take place. The president's spokesman was won't to detail the White House discussions that precipitated the international incident. 'But I think suffice it to say there should not be, and there is not any doubt in the minds of the people in France or people around the world, and certainly not among our enemies, about how committed to a strong relationship that the United States is with France, and committed to the same kinds of values that they are,' he said.","'Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris.

"Nearly half of Britons think at least one anti-Semitic view presented to them was 'definitely or probably true', a survey has revealed. One in eight said they thought Jews talked about the Holocaust to get sympathy, the poll found. One in four believed Jewish people 'chase money more than others', while one in six felt Jews thought they were better than other people and had too much power in the media. Scroll down for video . Jewish organisations in Britain have called for a zero tolerance approach to anti-semitism . The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA), which commissioned the YouGov study, said the findings were a 'shocking wake-up call' and warned that anti-Semitism would grow unless it was met by 'zero tolerance'. The group said the survey also revealed that people who said they would vote Ukip in the General Election 'consistently believed more anti-Semitic statements to be true', by an average margin of nine per cent. Some 269,000 Jewish people live in Britain, or 0.4 per cent of the population, according to the CAA. Last year saw the most anti-Semitic incidents recorded by police since records began 30 years ago, the campaign said. Chairman Gideon Falter said: 'The results of our survey are a shocking wake-up call straight after the atrocities in Paris. Britain is at a tipping point.' The survey found that one in four Britons think Jewish people chase money more than others while one in six claimed that Jews thought they were better than others and had too much power in the media. Footballer Nicholas Anelka, pictured, was fined £80,000 last year for making an anti-Semitic gesture . One in ten said Jews were not has honest in business and one in five said they questioned their loyalty to Britain due to their connection with Israel. Ten percent of those questioned would not be happy if a relative married a Jew. In a separate survey carried out by the CAA, more than half of British Jews feared they had no future in the UK and a quarter said they have considered leaving the country in the last two years. The poll of 2,230 British Jews found 56 per cent felt that anti-Semitism now echoes the 1930s, while 58 per cent believed Jews may have no long-term future in Europe. Some 45 per cent felt their family was threatened by Islamist extremism, while 63 per cent thought authorities let too much anti-Semitism go unpunished. Mr Falter added: 'Britain is at a tipping point. Unless anti-Semitism is met with zero tolerance, it will grow and British Jews will increasingly question their place in their own country. Britain's Jews must be shown that they are not alone.' Communities secretary Eric Pickles said British society would be diminished without Jewish people . Jonathan Sacerdoti, who is also from the campaign, said: 'Jewish people have contributed to almost every part of British life, yet rising anti-Semitism here and across Europe means that now more than ever Jews are afraid. Some are even reconsidering their future here. 'British values of tolerance and pluralism must be upheld, so that minority groups like Jews feel comfortable and protected.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'Jews are an important part of the British community, and we would be diminished without them. 'Anyone who peddles anti-Semitic views is attacking Britain and British values. 'This Government has done much to enhance Britain's status as a safe, tolerant place for Jewish people but we are not complacent. We remain committed to tackling it wherever and whenever it occurs and continue to take a zero-tolerance approach. 'Those who commit hate crimes will be punished with the full force of the law.' A Jewish mother who moved to the UK a decade ago said she no longer discusses her religion with new people she meets amid fears about a rise in anti-Semitism. Mother-of-three Aurelie, who is originally from France, arrived in Britain with her husband and said anti-Semitism is so widespread in her homeland that the family has decided not to move back. 'I know I will never go back to France,' the 37-year-old said. 'You've seen the news last week. That's how my country is getting, worse and worse.' Aurelie, who did not wish to give her surname, said her mother is a teacher and 'she gets bullied (about her religion) in the school, by the children. It's a primary school.' She added: 'When people ask about my background I don't say I'm French-Jewish any more. I just say I'm French.' Last month, Aurelie made the decision to cover up the Jewish school uniforms worn by her two older children - aged seven and 10 - and has gently asked them not to volunteer information about their religion to other youngsters. For now, she says, she is happy living in London and proud to call herself British. 'But if there is an attack on Jewish people here in the future we'd consider moving to America,' she added. Aurelie hopes local authorities will do more to make British Jews feel safe. 'That's what they didn't do in France,' she said. 'The only way to keep the Jewish community here is to make them feel safe and make them feel they can be themselves.'

Mr Spencer even imported Baconnaise (bacon mayonnaise) from America to top the burger. 'I am a bacon fiend,' he said. 'I made roses out of bacon for Valentine's Day last year and handed them to customers. They went down really well. 'Anything to do with bacon, I adore.' The self-confessed 'bacon fiend' will donate £5 from each £15 burger sold to North Devon Hospice . The bacon-crazy 32-year-old said the meal is 'something for the blokes' following the hype around the Fifty Shades Of Grey series. 'My head chef came up with the initial idea and it was to coincide with the hype around Fifty Shades Of Grey,' he said. 'It's a bit quirky, a bit different. We're giving something back for the blokes, but women are more than welcome to try it.' Mr Spencer was particularly keen to stick to pork products due to his own love for it. Other ingredients include unsmoked back bacon, unsmoked streaky bacon, smoked back and smoked streaky bacon, turkey bacon, prosciutto, pancetta and a sausage patty. The burger bar has already raised £350 for the hospice in November 2013 with the same tasty treat. 'We have had people asking when it is coming back since the first time,' he said. 'It's great that people get so involved.' It's not the first calorific challenge Mr Spencer has set his customers. The restaurant also offers a 8,500-calorie totem burger - made of four huge burgers, a toasted cheese sandwich and chili-cheese fries.","15 Shades of Bacon burger available at Custom House, Barnstaple, Devon .

"The mayor of Doral, Florida was forced to take back his request to give Donald Trump a key to the city after receiving complaints from the community this week. On Monday, Mayor Luigi Boria asked the city to honor Trump and Miss Universe President Paula M Shugart with keys to the city. But just two hours later, Boria redacted the key for Trump after news of the key spread and the community became outraged. No key for you: Luigi Boria, the mayor of Doral, Florida, asked the city to honor Donald Trump with a key this week for choosing them as host city for the Miss Universe pageant. He redacted that request just two hours later when community members expressed outrage. Boria pictured to the right of Trump, in a brown suit on January 9 at a Miss Universe welcome event . 'Trump doesn’t deserve my key,' Boria later said. 'I think it’s appropriate for Miss Universe and the Miss Universe organization to have the key. It doesn’t make sense for Trump to have one.' Boria still wants to give a key to Shugart, and make January 25 Doral's official 'Miss Universe Day'. Though Trump has invested some $300million into the city for the Miss Universe pageant later this month,  the billionaire businessman has become a controversial figure in Doral for his golf course there - the Trump National Doral. Residents surrounding the golf course are upset he obstructed their views by planting a barrier of palm trees around the course. 'Keys to the City should be reserved to be given to dignitaries and people of high importance, not to businessmen that benefit from our City,' Doral resident Claudia Spangaro Mariaca told the Miami Herald. 'Giving the Trump organization or the Miss Universe organization a Key at this time when there is so much controversy in our City would be a mistake, and a disloyal move from our Council.' Unpopular: Trump has become a controversial figure in Doral for planting tall palm trees around his golf course, and obstructing residents' views. Pictured above with Mayor Boria and Miss Universe Gabriela Isler in October at the Trump National Doral course . This isn't the first time that Boria has been criticized for his excessive gift of the town keys and is known in the community as 'the city's locksmith'. Last year, the City Council held a intervention on key giving saying they should only be awarded to people of 'very high commitment and importance'. The 88 Miss Universe competitors started gathering in Doral last week in preparation for the January 25 pageant. They have been attending charity events across town, while also hitting the links at Red Tiger - the just-opened course at Trump National Doral. And it appears that Doral isn't the only city in Florida where Trump is less than popular. News of the Trump's cancelled key  came the same day that he filed a $100million lawsuit against Palm Beach County, Florida.

"The Russian billionaire who owns the Brooklyn Nets has decided to sell the NBA team amid concerns about its   financial losses and performance on court, according to reports. Mikhail Prokhorov, 49, has apparently retained investment adviser Evercore Partners to sell his share of the basketball franchise, which he bought for a staggering $223million in May 2010. The businessman, who is worth an estimated $11.1billion, currently holds 80 per cent of the Nets, as well as 45 per cent of the Barclays Center, the club's two-and-a-half-year-old arena in New York. Of these, only the team is for sale, two sources close to the matter told Bloomberg News. Looking to sell? Mikhail Prokhorov (pictured) has retained investment adviser Evercore Partners to sell his share of the basketball franchise, which he bought for a staggering $223million in May 2010, it is claimed . 'It’s a unique asset which is going to garner national and international interest,' Sal Galatioto, founder of Galatioto Sports Partners, which has sold several NBA teams, told the broadcaster. According to valuations expert Peter Schwartz, the Nets is believed to be worth around $1.3billion. But its sale price could exceed $2billion - surpassing the amount that Microsoft's Steve Ballmer spent on the LA Clippers last year - because of its home in the No 1 US media market, Mr Schwartz said. The sale would also involve the buyer gaining control of the team. According to ESPN, sources have  said Prokhorov's decision to sell up comes amid worries about the team's $144million loss in basketball-related business in the financial year 2013-14. This loss was a whopping $131million more than the next highest team, Grantland.com reported. Team: The businessman, who is worth an estimated $11.1billion, currently holds 80 per cent of the Nets (pictured: Brook Lopex, left), as well as 45 per cent of the Barclays Center, the club's arena in New York . Owner: Of these, only the team is for sale, two sources close to the matter said. Above, Prokhorov is pictured drinking champagne with American rapper and Nets investor Jay-Z, after he purchased the team in 2010 . Prokhorov, one of the world's richest men, is also said to be concerned about the Nets' performance on court. The team is currently in last place in the NBA Eastern Conference, with a record of 16-22. Despite the reports - all of which have stemmed from sources who have insisted on anonymity - Prokhorov's spokesman, Ellen Pinchuk, has denied that he the tycoon selling the Nets. 'As we have been saying for many months, team ownership is open to listening to offers,' she said. 'That’s part of the business. There is nothing imminent in terms of the sale of any stake in the team.' The rumors come seven months after Prokhorov was said to be listening to offers for the Nets, who have the highest payroll in the league at $91million. At the time, he denied any interest in selling. But in October, the Nets and Dodgers were reported to be discussing a merger of sorts that some believed would have been a straight sale. However, it later emerged that talks had broken down. In November, Prokhorov was noncommital about selling the Nets, telling the Washington Post: 'My position is that I will not give up control of the team. 'But you know, I am quite happy when somebody sending me a nice offer without taking my control of team. I think, for the time being, nothing is imminent, but still I think it’s not bad just to listen.' Denial: Prokhorov, who ran against Vladimir Putin (pictured) for president two years ago, denies the reports . Prokhorov, who ran against Vladimir Putin for Russian president two years ago, has lost more than $1billion since November, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This is due to the dramatic weakening of Russia's currency, the ruble, against the dollar last month after an interest rate hike led to panic among investors. If the reports are true, the Nets are the second NBA team to go on the market after the Atlanta Hawks, who were put up for sale on January 8.","Mikhail Prokhorov, 49, bought Brooklyn Nets for $223million in May 2010 .

"Fears have been sparked that a serial killer is stalking canals in Manchester after more than 60 bodies were pulled from waterways in just six years. Professor Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University, said the death toll was 'alarming' and claimed it was possible a killer was at large. Some of the 61 bodies were discovered around Canal Street - home to many of the city's gay bars and restaurants and known as the 'Gay Village'. Scroll down for video . Chris Brahney, 22, was found dead in the Manchester Ship Canal ten days after going missing from a Stone Roses concert in June 2012 (left) while the body of Souvik Pal, 18, (right) was found in the Bridgewater Canal . He told the Daily Star Sunday: 'It is extremely unlikely that such an alarming number of bodies found in the canals is the result of accidents or suicides. 'Canals are not popular suicide spots, especially for men. They are, however, popular dumping sites. And water can be a sure way to erase DNA evidence. 'Suffolk strangler Steve Wright dumped some of his prostitute victims in water so any traces of him would be washed away.' However Greater Manchester Police has dismissed his claims about a serial killer being on the loose and insist that each individual case is investigated thoroughly. A spokesman from the force said: 'Greater Manchester Police is committed to thoroughly investigating each and every unexplained death in Manchester and approach each one as potentially suspicious in its initial stages. Some of the bodies had been found in waterways by Canal Street - the Gay Village of the city . 'Only after a robust investigation into the circumstances of each death would investigators deem one to be 'non-suspicious' and pass the file to the coroner. 'The coroner's post mortem would then ascertain the cause of death, which would then be recorded accordingly by the investigating officer. 'None of our investigations are carried out in isolation and as we have said publicly before, we have established no link between the various incidents recorded. The death of 22-year-old Chris Brahney, from Timperley in Altrincham, was one of the examples cited by Professor Jackson. Mr Brahney was found dead in the Manchester Ship Canal ten days after going missing from a Stone Roses concert in Heaton Park in June 2012. He had become separated from his friends following the gig, sparking a massive manhunt across the region. At an inquest into his death, deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley recorded an open verdict and admitted she simply could not say how he had ended up in the water. In another death, the body of Manchester University student Souvik Pal, 18, was found in the Bridgewater Canal. The discovery was made three weeks after he was told to leave a New Year's Eve party at the Warehouse Project dance night in Trafford Park. He had been seen walking away from the venue with a mystery man and CCTV footage shows only one of the two men returning to the nightclub.

"BBC Radio 4 and Newsnight host Eddie Mair reveals he's been sober since last summer, deciding to give up booze after 'convivial Saturday lunches' turned into hangovers that could last for days . The morning after the night before is often harder to bear the older you get – as the BBC’s Eddie Mair will agree. The Radio 4 and Newsnight host says he has given up alcohol after too many ‘convivial lunches’ which left him suffering for two days afterwards. The 49-year-old also admitted that the ‘indignity of stumbling on to trains and slurring at taxi drivers’ at his age prompted him to quit alcohol. Writing in this week’s Radio Times, he revealed he had been sober since last summer and had managed to stay off drink throughout Christmas. He said: ‘I’d been thinking about stopping for some time. Boozing on a school night had long been abandoned. When I was in my twenties I could knock it back, get a good night’s sleep and be bright as a daisy in the morning. ‘Painful experience in my 40s told me that was no longer best practice. I generally confined alcohol to weekends. Convivial Saturday lunches with like-minded friends (for that read drinking sessions with nibbles) had been a long-established tradition. 'Even those, however, began to lose their lustre thanks to hangovers lasting through Sunday and sometimes Monday.’ Mr Mair said he had ‘learnt a lot’ by going sober and joked that he had even received a ‘surprise thank you card from my liver’. ‘Here I am many months later and to my surprise I don’t really miss it much,’ he added. He admitted he had had a mixed reaction from friends, many of whom doubted he could ‘be having any fun’ without a drink, while others became his ‘best friends for life’ when they realised he could be the designated driver. In his column, the PM presenter also bemoaned the fact that it was difficult to find non-alcoholic beer and wine in British pubs, in contrast to many bars in Europe. Mair has previously revealed that he was once so hungover while working on a Sunday morning radio programme that he had to go outside during a pre-recorded section to vomit. Writing about working in the broadcasting industry in The Guardian in 2002, he said he was always sober and in bed by 10pm before early morning shows except when he was on location when ‘all common sense goes out the window’. The 49-year-old said many friends doubted he could 'be having any fun' without a drink, while others became his 'best friend for life' when they realised he could be designated driver . He added: ‘When I was at Five Live, preparing for an early Sunday live transmission from Birmingham, the producers and I went out for a “quick bite to eat” the night before. 'I vaguely remember being asked to leave the restaurant in the early hours. During a taped segment the next morning I had to go outside to throw up. ‘More recently, BH (Broadcasting House, the Radio 4 Sunday morning programme) from Cardiff was looking good on the Saturday night so we had “some wine” at dinner. 'I recall sincerely discussing, at 2 o’clock on Sunday morning, whether we shouldn’t all just stay up rather than go to bed. 'Wisely we did go to bed but had to ask our cabbie at 6am to find us a place that would serve bacon butties and Mars bars.’ Mair joined the BBC in 1987, working for Radio Scotland, and started co-hosting PM in 1998. He has also presented Newsnight on BBC2.","Mr Mair, 49, said drinking began to lose lustre as hangovers lasted days .

"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sent a strong signal Tuesday to 2016-watchers that Benghazi isn't dead as a presidential campaign issue, slamming former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for failing to prevent the 2012 terror attack in the Libyan port city that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other American personnel. 'We have to defend ourselves,' he told a conservative audience at a summit hosted by Heritage Action for America. 'We also have to defend our diplomatic missions around the world.' 'I put a lot of blame at the feet of Hillary Clinton for not defending the embassy – or the consulate – in Benghazi. I think she did a terrible job. And I think that it's inexcusable, basically, when you're asked for security that you not provide it.' Paul added in a calculated barb at Clinton, who is the Democratic Party's presumptive 2016 front-runner, that protecting American assets 'is the job of the Commander-in-Chief, and that is the job of the executive branch.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke to the Heritage Action for America 'Opportunity for All, Favoritism to None' policy summit on January 13 . HILLARY'S WAR: Sen. Rand Paul has said that if he had been president when the Benghazi terror attack occurred, he would have removed then-Secretary Clinton from her post . The Benghazi attack, a carefully planned paramilitary assault on America's diplomatic compound and a nearby CIA annex facility, came on the 11th anniversary of the far deadlier 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S. mainland. Republicans in Congress have never let the issue go, hosting a ricocheting series of Capitol HIll hearings in a handful of different House committees before consolidating their gripes last year into a single investigative panel helmed by South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. With Democrats in control of the Senate until last week, however, Congress's upper chamber saw little action on the controversy that bombarded the entire Obama administration, for a time, with unrelenting partisan barba. Paul and a few other hard-charging GOPers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have taken every opportunity to be heard on Benghazi, including Tuesday's quick departure into partisan cage-fighting. Clinton led America's diplomatic corps when the terror attack erupted, and later enraged Republicans by suggesting in Senate testimony that it made little difference whether it was planned or spontaneously erupted. Her expected White House run could be complicated by unresolved questions related to the scandal. Paul's comments came a day before he is scheduled to barnstorm through the early presidential primary state of New Hampshire, making six meet-and-greet stops on Wednesday in the space of eight hours. On Tuesday the Kentucky senator was answering a question about America's proper role in arbitrating disputes in the Middle East. 'I think that no matter what we do, we have to defend ourselves,' the senator said. 'So printing cartoons – it shouldn't engender people murdering you. So we do have to protect ourselves. France has to defend themselves.' Paul is seen as a small-government Republican whose potential presidency would resist the temptation to intervene in global conflicts. 'I don't want to be in the middle of the ""long war."" he said Tuesday, 'because I don't think there really is an answer in this long war and that much of this war should be left to be fought by the Middle East.' But 'we can't leave our embassies unprotected,' he added, resuming his swipe at Clinton. 'So we have a couple of choices: We either come home completely, and bring everything home, or we defend our embassies and our interests. At this point, what I would say is that we defend our interests.' DEVASTATION: The 2012 attack killed four people including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, and was carried out by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group called Ansar al-Shariah . A senior aide to another Republican senator told DailyMail.com that Paul is having a hard time threading the needle. 'Rand is fighting a losing battle,' the aide said. 'You can't tell one audience that we have to isolate ourselves and then tell another one that Hillary Clinton wasn't tough enough on Libyan terrorists. It's not credible.' But Paul's camp is insisting that he won't waver on Hillary. The senator 'believes Mrs. Clinton’s dereliction of duty and indifferent response to the tragic events that occurred in Benghazi are utterly inexcusable,' RANDPAC communications director Sergio Gor told DailyMail.com . 'As he stated during her appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Paul would have removed Secretary Clinton from her post' if he had been president at the time. 'Senator Paul declared Libya as ""Hillary's War,"" Gor added, 'due to her desire to act unilaterally without Congressional approval or authorization, thus circumventing Congress.' But the senator finds himself triangulated between condemning both the kind of proactive Middle Eastern nation-flattening that characterized the George W. Bush administration, and the more reluctant participation that has marked Barack Obama's time in office. 'Every time we've gotten involved to topple a secular dictator, it's been replaced by chaos and the rise of radical Islam,' Paul said. 'And that would be in Hillary's war in Libya; that would also be in the Republican war in Iraq.' 'HILLARY'S WAR': Sen. Paul took time during his Q&A on Tuesday to Bash Hillary Clinton over the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks . Paul signaled a willingness to grab hold of Republicans' hard line on Islamist terror, less than a week after a dozen staffers of the Parisian humor weekly Charlie Hebdo were slaughtered over cartoonish depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. 'Printing cartoons,' he said, 'shouldn't engender people murdering you.' He staked out less emotional territory, however, by outlining what he said was 'a war going on between what I call civilized Islam and barbaric Islam.' 'Some conservatives like to criticise the president and say, ""Why is he being so nice to Islam?"" I think sometimes what he's trying to do is point out that there's a difference.' Believing that 'everybody in Islam is an enemy of the United States,' he warned, assumes a future that includes 'a horrific, terrible kind of war with, you know, a billion people hating America.' 'I don't think that's true. I think the vast majority of Islam is peace-loving and civilized. But if it's 5 or 10 per cent of Islam, that's a lot of people.'","Libertarian firebrand starts pummelling the presumptive Democratic frontrunner a day before barnstorming through New Hampshire .

"Celebrities may finally have a way to ward off unwanted street photographers' roving camera lenses once and for all thanks to a clever new clothing collection which is designed to ruin any images taken using flash photography. Paul McCartney's DJ, Chris Holmes, has debuted The Anti-Paparazzi Collection, a line of reflective clothing that intentionally ruins shutterbugs' highly-coveted photos by deflecting the light from their cameras. The collection includes a hooded jacket, an infinity scarf, and a blazer that look like everyday pieces, but essentially act as a mirror when hit with bright light, rendering the wearer practically invisible in flash photography. Stealthy clothing: DJ Chris Holmes's ""Anti-Paparazzi"" collection includes a highly-reflective blazer, infinity scarf and hooded jacket that intentionally ruin photos . Invisible man: Mr. Holmes said the line is 'perfect for those who don't want their picture taken' Mr. Holmes said he was inspired to create the collection for Betabrand's Think Tank competition after he realized the reflective outfits he was wearing to his performances were causing the camera flashes to bounce off his clothing and wash out the pictures. 'While I wasn't thrilled that many of these photos were ruined because of my clothing, it gave me the epiphany that perhaps I could use this technology for a greater purpose,' he wrote on the site. 'That's what lead me to create the Anti-Paparazzi Collection, which uses reflective threads to render paparazzi-shot photos worthless - perfect for those who don't want their picture taken. The contest allows voters to decide which clothing items deserve to be funded and made.

In November, the model was actually spotted sporting a similar reflective silver coat, a one-of-a-kind design made especially for her.

"As House Republicans push a bill this week that funds the Department of Homeland Security while blocking President Barack Obama's dramatic immigration policy shifts, Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday that the White House should start listening to Americans' concerns about 'amnesty' run amok. And in a testy meeting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he had a chance to press his case. Boehner told reporters that during a late-morning meeting with Obama he would 'make it clear to the president that we're listening to the American people. ... We hope he'll start to listen too.' GOP messaging has become more animated and insistent in the week since they took over both houses of Congress. The speaker cast his party as constitutional defenders on Tuesday and insisted that the White House is playing games. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . BULLY PULPIT: President Barack Obama did his best to muscle Republican leaders in Congress on Tuesday an hour after House Speaker John Boehner (left) slammed him for acting outside the US Constitution . House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio told reporters on Tuesday that President Obama's 'overreach' on immigration had prompted his caucus to play hardball . 'Our goal here is to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Our second goal is to stop the president's executive overreach,' he said. 'This is not the way our government was intended to work. 'The president said 22 times that he didn't have the authority to do what he eventually did. He knows the truth here! And so do the American people.' A post-meeting 'readout' report from the speaker's office said Boehner 'reminded the president that he himself had stated publicly many times in the past that he did not have the power to rewrite immigration law through executive action.' The House bill funding DHS past its current February 27 budget expiration is expected to pass by Wednesday, when GOP House members leave Washington for a two-day policy retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania. 'We're voting to block the president's overreach – his executive overreach, which I believe is beyond his constitutional duty and frankly violates the Constitution itself,' Boehner said Tuesday. 'This is not about actually the issue of immigration. What it is is, it's about – the president acting lawlessly.' Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he plans to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants by giving them residency cards and work permits. Congressional Democrats say leaving Homeland Security's budget up in the air while the status of those millions is debated risks sending the world the wrong message. They cite last week's deadly terror attacks in France as Exhibit A. Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, the Democrats' second-in-command, said Tuesday on MSNBC that there is virtually unanimous bipartisan support for funding the agency but Republican leaders are standing in the way. Conservatives in Boehner's caucus, he claimed, 'want to have confrontation' on immigration and other issues. CONFRONTATION: Obama hosted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (right) and other congressional leaders from both parties at the White House on Tuesday, setting the stage for a dramatic immigration battle . But Republicans say it's Obama who wants to see a clash of two of the three branches of America's divided government. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California bashed the president for issuing 'five veto threats on bipartisan bills' in the week since Congress came back into session. Democrats came away from November's bruising midterm election speaking optimistically about working with Republicans on tax reform. At the beginning of his meeting with Capitol Hill leaders, Obama 'said he'd be looking for areas of bipartisan agreement and that the key was to work as a team,' according to a White House press pool report, which added that the president 'cited cybersecurity, trade, taxes, and ""streamlining government"".' But so far January has been consumed by partisan rancor focusing on the Keystone XL pipeline, the immigration battle and other areas where neither party has shown any flexibility.","'The president said 22 times that he didn't have the authority to do the things he eventually did,' House Speaker John Boehner claimed Tuesday .

"During his time as an aide, Reggie Love developed a very personal bond with U.S. president Barack Obama. The 'bodyman' worked for the president during the 2008 presidential campaign and Obama's first years in the White House. In his memoir Power Forward: My Presidential Education, extracts of which have been published in the Washington Post, Love recounts a moment when his professional relationship with the president turned personal. Love wrote that he was staying in a hotel during the presidential election campaign when he had a female friend to stay. Scroll down for video . Barging in: Reggie Love, (left) Obama's former personal aide, has revealed in his memoir how the President once entered his hotel room while he had a female guest staying the night . The next morning Love was getting ready for the day ahead but the woman was in bed when, using the Secret Service master key, Obama opened the door, walked in, and said: 'Hey, Reggie, we need to go over the schedule.' After noticing the guest lying on the bed he said: 'Oh, I apologize' before hurrying back out. His terrified friend, with the cover pulled up to her throat, then asked: 'Was that... ?' To which Love replied: 'Senator Barack Obama.' Later in the day, the campaign team boarded a plane to their next destination and Obama started arguing with his campaign staff over their progress. To lighten the mood, Love told Obama: 'You know, sir, if it’s any consolation, I’m having the time of my life.' 'And the senator said to me, “Well, Reggie, it’s actually not a consolation to me that my campaign for president can help subsidize your love life.”' 'Bodyman': Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage. The response drew a laugh from David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, but Love had a comeback. He said: 'Actually, sir, I got way more action in college.' Love applied for an internship at the White House in 2006 after studying at Duke where he also played wide receiver for the football team. Love was appointed 'deputy political director' and Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage. Love left his position at the end of 2011 to pursue an MBA.

"A recently-imposed ban restricting large cruise ships from passing through Italy’s historic city of Venice has been lifted. The city’s regional court of appeal overturned the regulations, which were only implemented in November, and which prevented all ships over 96,000 gross tons from sailing along the Guidecca Canal to the city’s main cruise terminal. It also limited the number of ships over 40,000 gross tonnes from sailing along the route to just five a day. No more: Large cruise ships will longer be able to sail in Saint Mark's basin and the Giudecca Canal . The restrictions were imposed after stars including Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica. However, while the move paves the way for the towering vessels, dubbed ‘skyscrapers of the sea’, to once again sail through Venice, no changes will be seen in the near future. The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which represents 53 major cruise lines, said itineraries for 2015 had already been finalised and larger ships would continue to steer clear of Venice for the rest of the year. Among those above the 96,000 GT limit are Princess Cruises’ Regal Princess and Emerald Princess, Celebrity Cruises’ Equinox and Silhouette as well as some Costa Cruises and MSC vessels. Plea: Hollywood stars Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cate Blanchett signed a petition in June . Instead, the cruise lines have agreed to wait for an alternative route to Venice’s cruise terminal  to be drawn up and investigated. An environmental impact assessment on its construction is expected in March while the project would require an estimated 18 months for completion. ‘We acknowledge and respect the verdict of Veneto’s Regional Administrative Court,’ said CLIA, in a statement. Stunning views: There has been a long-standing concern the ships might cause damage and omit smog . ‘CLIA and its member lines have chosen to voluntarily refrain from bringing ships above 96,000 tons to Venice until a new navigational route becomes operational. ‘We are looking forward to welcoming a final decision by the Italian government on the alternative route for big ships in Venice.’ The restriction had been put in place to prevent damage to the fragile buildings and environment in Venice. Environmental groups have been protesting against the large ships for a number of years citing the destruction and potential for flooding of the historic landmarks. However, the tribunal was urged by numerous tourism groups and the Venice Passenger Terminal (VTP) to overturn the ban, with ports and cruise industry employees arguing that the ships bring in millions of euros to the Venice economy. The huge cruise ships have been criticised for dwarfing Venice's Byzantine architecture . The VTP had predicted losses of just under 300,000 passengers a year as a result of the ban. Meanwhile, UNESCO's president of the Italian National Commission was reportedly appalled by the decision, claiming that the public interest should take precedent over cruise ships. Last year, the number of cruise ships sailing through Venice was capped at 708, compared to 809 in 2012. The huge liners dubbed the 'skyscrapers of the sea' have been able to pass within 1,000ft of the iconic St. Mark's Square, granting a stunning view to those aboard but dwarfing Venice's Byzantine architecture. The decision comes after Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica. The huge liners dubbed the 'skyscrapers of the sea' have been able to pass within 1,000ft of the iconic St. Mark's Square, granting a stunning view to those aboard . Other big-screen figures also on the list of endorsees included Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, Sir Michael Caine, Edward Norton, Susan Sarandon and Isabella Rossellini. Julie Christie, whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller Don’t Look Now – was set in Venice, also signed the petition. The open letter, penned by the celebrities and addressed to the Italian Prime Minister, read: 'Having prevailed against flood, pestilence, and war for more than thirteen centuries, Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, and unparalleled UNESCO Word Heritage site, now, in a moment of relative tranquility, finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners, indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe. 'Since the flood of 1966, Italy and countless Italian and international supporters have contributed to the defence of the world's most fragile city, eternally subject to destruction. 'The absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction, of one of humanity’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable. 'We urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the Big Ships in front of San Marco and along the Giudecca Canal putting an end to this senseless devastation.'","Regional court of appeal overturns ban which was imposed in November .

"A huge brawl which erupted on the platform of an inner-city train station between three young men had to be broken up by transit officers who were forced pull the boys off each other. Footage shows the trio starting throwing punches at each other just before 1pm on Monday at Perth train station, as staff scramble to control the scuffle. One female officer puts on a particularly impressive show, grabbing the second and third men and dragging one off the other after their fellow fighter had already been pinned down by  her colleagues. Scroll down for video . Footage of a vicious fight at a Perth train station on Monday afternoon has appeared online .

Uploaded to Facebook on Monday the video has had over 131,000 views since then, with 3000 people liking it and hundreds more commenting on the fight. Station staff are very quick to respond to the commotion, with two men jumping in initially, managing to restrain the boy in the blue shorts while the two others continue to rumble. Two more guards quickly arrive on the scene shortly after as the man wearing all black pins the one in white to the floor pounding him with punches. The video shows three men, one dressed in all black, one in blue shorts and another in a white singlet . Station staff responded quickly to the fight (left), with one female station guard pulling of a particularly impressive take-down (right) A female staff member then jumps into the mix along with two other colleagues and she and another man pull one boy out of the fight while two other guards tackle the final member of the trio. 'It is gratifying to see the speed and efficiency of the transit officers in responding and putting a stop to the fighting,' Perth Public Transport Authority spokesman David Hynes told Daily Mail Australia in a statement. 'Had this occurred elsewhere, for example at a shopping centre or in the street, it is unlikely that it would have been resolved anywhere near as quickly. 'This is a graphic reminder of the PTA’s zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour on our network,' Mr Hynes said.","A huge fight erupted at Perth train station between three men on Monday .

"American airports have had security increased after al-Qaeda published instructions on how to make an 'undetectable' bomb to bring down passenger jets. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that the TSA will now begin searching more travelers, especially in wake of the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris. While Johnson said that there was 'no specific, credible threat' of an imminent attack, recent calls by al-Qaeda and ISIS to attack Western civilians, police and soldiers left them with little choice but to urge on the side of caution. TSA: Airport security will be stepped up at all US airports in light of the Paris terror attacks and new al-Qaeda threats . The latest edition of al-Qaeda's English-language, online magazine, Inspire outlines how to make the bomb from household goods and without using metal components that would show up in airport security checks. Al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), writes that it has spared 'no effort in simplifying the idea' so that every 'determined Muslim can prepare'. The 'hidden bomb' instructions are contained in the latest edition of Inspire which features a civilian airliner on its cover. 'This group, AQAP, is absolutely determined… to try and [carry] out an attack on a U.S.-bound airplane,' said Matt Olsen, former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant. Chilling:  Al-Qaeda's house magazine (above) calls for high-profile airlines British Airways, easyJet, AA, Delta, United and Air France to be targeted by bombers to 'crush the enemy's economy'. Police are investigating . Journal: The magazine has been connected to the Boston Marathon bombings in April last year . 'The prospect of AQAP trying to get a bomb on an airplane has been, for the past several years, at the top of the list for concerns of the U.S. counterterrorism community.' The magazine tells readers how to make the device from 'simple materials that are readily available around the globe', then goes on to tell them whereabouts on a plane to detonate the device to cause maximum damage. Charlie Hebdo magazine killers, Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, are thought to have travelled to Yemen to be trained by AQAP, where at least one of them met Anwar al-Awlaki, the group's former spiritual leader. Awlaki, who was killed by U.S. forces in 2011, founded the quarterly published Inspire magazine, which has been linked to seven out of 10 terror plots against British targets since 2010, the Sunday Times reports. In 2009, AQAP sent Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a graduate of University College London, on a mission to blow up a passenger jet over Detroit. He hid the bomb in his underwear, but it failed to detonate. Abdulmutallab was jailed for life in 2012. The magazine tells readers how to make the device from 'simple materials that are readily available around the globe', then goes on to tell them whereabouts on a plane to detonate the device to cause maximum damage; above is a picture from the magazine showing a man heading for the airport . The newspaper quoted an explosives expert who was sceptical the bomb AQAP was advising readers on how to build would evade detection. The expert wasn't sure how effective it would be either, saying it was more likely to burn rapidly, 'in the manner of a firework'. In the same issue of the magazine the group called for a new generation of 'lone wolf' terrorists to blow up American Airlines, United and Delta planes using bombs made in their kitchens. AQAP wrote that the high-profile airlines should be targeted in a bid to gain headlines and 'crush the enemy's economy'. Released on Christmas Eve, the disturbing publication names the four companies because of their size - including United, the 'world's largest airline with 86,852 employees'. Praised: The Boston bombings (left is suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) and 'underpants bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right) are both mentioned in the magazine, whose possession in the past has led to arrests . Also targeted are Air France and British carriers British Airways and easyJet - alongside high-profile U.S. figures Bill Gates and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. Continental Airlines is also singled out despite the fact that it stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United to form United Continental Holdings. The latest edition has been published four years after the first issue of Inspire contained a notorious explosives guide called Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. The guide was suspected to have been the template for explosives which killed three and injured more than 250 in last year's Boston Marathon bombings.","Department of Homeland Security announce increased screening by TSA .

"A bad batch of bootleg liquor killed at least 28 people and sent 160 others to hospitals in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Many of the victims had gathered to watch a cricket match on Sunday evening in a village about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of the state capital, Lucknow, government official Anil Garg said Tuesday. By midday Tuesday, 28 people had died, including 11 in a nearby village, police officer Mukul Goel said. Indian women mourn around the bodies of two men who died after consuming a bad batch of bootleg liquor about 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) southwest of Lucknow, India, Tuesday . Many of the victims had gathered to watch a cricket match Sunday evening and drank the poisonous brew . Doctors in Lucknow said some of those hospitalised were in serious condition and were breathing with respirators, and some had lost their eyesight. Police arrested the shop owner who sold the pouches of homemade alcohol for about 20p (30 cents) each. A raid of the shop uncovered large containers of chemicals, which were sent to a laboratory for testing, district official R.K. Pandey said. 'The symptoms gave a clear indication that these patients were served methyl alcohol,' which despite being toxic is sometimes mixed with ethyl alcohol to make a brew cheaper, said Dr Kausar Usman, head of the trauma center at Lucknow's King George's Medical College. Deaths from drinking illegally brewed alcohol are common in India because the poor cannot afford licensed liquor. Villager Rajesh Kumar, whose two older brothers became ill on Monday after drinking the liquor, said the shop in Datli village was well known for selling inexpensive alcohol and that many men came from surrounding villages to buy it. The state's highest elected official, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, suspended six police officers suspected of taking bribes to ignore complaints about the shop and its alcohol, and announced that a 'drive will be launched against those involved in the illicit liquor trade.

"A Canadian judge was left stumped when faced with a tangled family feud stemming from a grisly throat-slashing incident on a Caribbean vacation. Cathy Clayson, a bank manager from Ajax, has accused her estranged husband, Paul Martin, of attacking her with a hooked gutting knife, strangling her and leaving her for dead along a dirt road in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in December 2010. Martin, a 47-year-old school teacher, was acquitted in Jamaica three years ago of wound with intent after spending four months in prison. He said, she sad: Paul Martin (right), 47, was acquitted in Jamaica in 2011 of attempting to kill his wife, Cathy Clayson (left), who is now suing him in civil court in Canada . The husband has maintained his innocence, claiming that his wife attacked him first and injured her own neck in the melee. Last year, Clayson, 38, filed a civil lawsuit against her husband seeking a divorce, more than $300,000 in damages, custody of their two children, ages 6 and 9, an end to Martin's visitation rights and a declaration that her husband had tried to kill her on December 23, 2010. But according to his ruling handed down late last month, Ontario Superior Court Justice Roger Timms could make neither heads nor tails of the couple's puzzling case. 'The parties have both told too many lies. They have both distorted and exaggerated the truth too often,' Timms wrote in his decision from December 30 cited by Toronto Star. 'They have both said too many nonsensical and illogical things.' The judge did suggest that the evidence supports Martin's version of events, and that nothing points to a premeditated attack. Grisly getaway: Clayson claimed Martin (pictured) took her to a secluded spot in Montego Bay on the last day of their 2010 vacation and slashed her twice across her throat . After sidestepping the issue of the attempted murder, Timms granted Clayson full custody of their two children but ruled that Martin should have equal and unsupervised access . Justice Timms' ruling came five months after the conclusion of the civil trial in Oshawa, during which Martin chose to represent himself and at one point cross-examined his estranged wife, marking their first encounter since the alleged attack on the last day of their ill-fated tropical getaway. Cathy Clayson has since retained high-powered attorney Marie Henein, who also represents disgraced former CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi in his sex abuse case. Last week, Henein filed an appeal on Clayson's behalf claiming that Justice Timms was biased against the woman. The notice of appeal alleges that Timms ‘misapprehended material facts’ and ‘minimized and justified the numerous inconsistencies and exaggerations’ in Martin’s evidence. During the trial in May, Clayson recounted in court how on December 18, 2010, she and Martin decided to travel to an all-inclusive resort in Montego Bay, Jamaica, even though their marriage was on the brink of collapse. On the final day of their vacation, with only three hours left before their flight home, Clayson said her husband insisted they drive to a remote spot to take pictures on a cliff. According to Clayson, Martin pulled over their rental car on a secluded dirt road, took out a hooked knife and slashed her twice across the throat, opening a 4-inch gash. A struggle ensued inside the car, during which the married school teacher allegedly attempted to strangle his wounded spouse. He then left her for dead on the side of the road and headed to a police station, where he claimed the couple had been robbed by bandits.

He's at a loss: Canadian Justice Roger Timms wrote in December 30 decision the couple told too many lies, making it impossible to determine what happened . Martin later changed his story, accusing Clayson of attacking him first and injuring her own throat in the process. A Good Samartian discovered Cathy Clayson and took her to the hospital. In his decision partially siding with Martin, Judge Timms wrote that a forensic expert found no blood in any section of the backseat of the rental car, even though Clayson was bleeding from her neck, and that it was 'impossible' for her to get a cut on the inside of her thumb while shielding her neck from the blade with her hand.","Paul Martin, 47, was acquitted in Jamaica in 2011 of attempting to kill his wife, Cathy Clayson .

"An autistic college student, 20, cried all day as he waited for a school bus that never came. That's because he was suspended from his classes for 'sexual assault' on January 5 for hugging and kissing a stranger, says his troubled mother. Brian Ferguson was in a special needs program at Navarro College in Waxahachie, Texas when he saw a woman in the hallway he thought he knew and went in to hug her and give her a friendly kiss, says mother Staci Martin. 'He gave her a hug and kissed her on the top of her head,' Martin said told NBC. Scroll down for video . Cried all day: When Brian Ferguson heard he could not return to school he cried all day and sat waiting for a bus to take him to his beloved campus . 'He's 6'5"", so when he gives hugs, he'll give you a big hug and kiss you right here on the top of your scalp,' she said as she described her son's innocent nature. Martin claims that the college banned her son from classes and called his actions 'sexual assault' despite it being what she says is an honest mistake. 'And then they labelled it ""sexual assault"" because of the kissing,' Martin said. 'They said a kiss is considered an assault.' Martin said her son was utterly devastated upon learning he could not go back to school and cried all day long as he waited for a phantom bus to arrive. 'He cried the whole next day,' she said. 'He got up for school, waited for the bus. I told him it wasn't coming.' Navarro College has refused to elaborate on why it issued the punishment. Heartbroken: Staci Martin said her son greets people by giving them a hug and a kiss on the head and says he meant absolutely no harm and is bored staying at home . A one-sentence statement from the school said that 'any decisions about students' enrollment in the special-needs program are made by the individual school district,' reports NBC. Martin claims that a college dean told her that her son is 'no longer welcome back.' Ferguson's sister Justine Colquitt, also a student at the school, wrote about the suspension in a Facebook post that's since gone viral. 'To completely kick him out of school and alter his whole course of life, it's just completely ridiculous,' she wrote. Administrators at Waxahachie High said on Friday that Ferguson could return to class at the high school, but not to the college. Ferguson said he wants nothing more than to return to school. He has apologized for offending anyone. 'I want to go back to school,' Ferguson said when prompted by his mother. 'I'm bored staying at home.' When CBS contacted the college they were informed that the student was actually 'welcome back at the college' - something that came as a surprise to Martin. The school told CBS that they are meeting with the young woman he kissed and the mother tomorrow to discuss the future and that ‘there are no hard feelings.’ Hope to return: Officials at Navarro college originally said that Ferguson could no longer return but they now say they are working to amend the situation .","'He's 6'5"", so when he gives hugs, he'll give you a big hug and kiss you right here on the top of your scalp,' said Staci Martin of he son Brian Ferguson .

"Paul Clitheroe said talking about financial issues was one of the key to healthy relationship . Not only is he one of Australia's most respected financial advisers but he has been married for 32 years - so he knows a thing or two about juggling a healthy marriage and money matters. So what is Paul Clitheroe's key to a successful relationship? Talking to your partner about financial issues openly and honestly. Clitheroe says knowing about your family's financial situation could also make separation easier and save you money if the relationship turns sour. Clitheroe, who is a regular contributor on Channel 9, shares his tips in his new book - Money, Marriage and Divorce - which is a manual to help navigate the tricky topic. The 59-year-old told Daily Mail Australia it was never too early in a relationship to approach the subject. 'Like any normal couple, [my wife and I] have our arguments, we both have different money attitudes but we have spoken about it ever since we started dating,' Clitheroe said. 'If you can start to talk about money, if you can keep doing that, you have better chance [of staying together].' In his book, Clitheroe shares his advice on what to expect when you separate or get divorced from your partner. He said it was important not to fall into the trap that your experience would be like someone else's who was in a similar situation. 'In a perfect world you'd be able to go into the divorce process, where you may need mediator, and come to agreement relatively quickly,' Clitheroe said. 'But every divorce is personal and completely individual. The reality is that you can have a very similar circumstances, but could get different outcomes because of different attitudes to divorce. 'It can become very emotional and very illogical. 'I do see couples who fight so bitterly over money and at times you sometimes find there's hardly enough money to split at the end.' The 59-year-old told Daily Mail Australia it was never too early in a relationship to approach the subject of money . Clitheroe said in these situations it was best to come to a compromise, adding it was also important for both parties to understand and know about the family's financial affairs as it makes the process 'more comfortable'. 'I saw a situation recently where a couple, after legal negotiations, he would get 52% and she would get 48%,' he said. 'They went onto fight in court for two years and fighting about principle and spent over a million dollars in legal fees. 'They both know they were going to financial losers, but they wanted to get out of the divorce as the winner. 'A lot of this stuff is a lot about emotional things like that the dog is yours or the vase is yours but it's really difficult to split these things in half. 'We know it doesn't make sense but people spend a lot of money wanting to come out a winner.' The financial adviser also believes both parties in a relationship should understand their financial affairs . Drawing from research done by Relationships Australia, Clitheroe said there were three primary danger zones for relationships. They are the seven-year itch, the 40s and the silvers - which is where Clitheroe and his wife lie on the spectrum going into their 60s. In his book, the adviser focuses on the 40s as the median age for divorce in females is 42.2 years and in males it is 44.8 years, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. Clitheroe shares his tips in his new book - Money, Marriage and Divorce . Divorce rates are also rising in couples over 50 and Clithroe said it made sense that these periods of life were a dangerous time for marriage as it was a period where couples were placed under a lot of pressure. 'Society has very high expectations about living, with holidays, mortgages, kids are expensive - so there's a lot of work pressure. Probably both parties are working to support very big mortgage these days,' Clitheroe said. 'So it's not surprisingly you're not spending time together because you're working hard.' In his book, Clitheroe said women were often hit hard during a separation or divorce. 'Both parties to a couple can expect a significant change in their financial wellbeing,' he wrote. 'Looking purely for financial issues, women generally fare worse - at least in the early years following separation.' Clitheroe points to a 2012 study by the Australian Institute of Family studies that said women suffered more because most became primary caregivers to children, which made it more challenging for them to further their career and take on part-time work. This means their superannuation diminishes. Money, Marriage and Divorce by Paul Clithroe is out now. Debunking some myths . Myth 1: It wasn’t my fault, therefore I'll get more . Let’s debunk this myth right now. Even if you view your spouse as being at fault for the breakdown of the relationship (or vice versa), this will not impact the way property is divided between you. The idea that you did nothing wrong so you should receive a greater share of your combined assets is a common misconception – possibly fuelled by soap-opera scriptwriters who see fit to have a jilted spouse declare, ‘I’ll take you to the cleaners for this!’ Prior to 1975, the reason for divorce may have been considered in a property settlement – an unfaithful spouse, for example, may have been awarded a smaller slice of the matrimonial pie. But that’s not the case these days. This may seem extremely unfair, especially if, for instance, your other half has been unfaithful while you’ve devoted ten, 20 or 30 years of your life to supporting his or her career, raising the children and looking after the family in general. Nonetheless, that’s how the law stands, and you can’t bank on the circumstances of your break-up leading to a property settlement that leans in your favour. Myth 2: The kids will live with me, so I’ll be entitled to the lion’s share of the assets . The role of family law today is to determine a fair and reasonable financial outcome for separating couples and to ensure any parenting arrangements are in your children’s best interests. Bearing this in mind, you cannot assume your ex will simply go along with whatever parenting agreement you suggest. Nor is it sensible to second-guess how the property or assets you’ve acquired during your relationship will be divided. This will be determined through negotiation with your former spouse – and hopefully not the intervention of the family law courts – a potentially very drawn-out and expensive process. Myth 3: Everything will be divided equally . The property settlement process has a number of stages. The first involves identifying and valuing all the assets (including superannuation), as well as liabilities belonging jointly and individually to each member of a couple. Both parties have a legal duty to make full and frank disclosure about their financial situation: if you believe your ex could be hiding assets, you need to speak with your lawyer. When it comes to assets like businesses, it’s possible to arrange a market valuation from professional valuers or accountants. The second stage is to assess the contributions each party made to those assets. You don’t have to be a working spouse to add value here. Contributions can be monetary, but your efforts as a parent or homemaker will also be considered. Don’t feel you’ll be disadvantaged if you gave up your own career to raise a family. The next step of a property settlement will normally involve making an adjustment for the future needs of each party. This can take into account differences like health, age and income, as well as care of children. The fourth and final stage is looking at the overall result to check that it is ‘just and equitable’ – the standard benchmark used by family law courts. Again, there is no hard and fast rule about who gets what. Nor is there a single calculation that determines how assets are divided – if there were, I’d provide it here. Each case is judged, and determined, on its individual circumstances.","Paul Clitheroe has penned a new book called Money, Marriage and Divorce .

The new partnership with Tregothnan estate, near Truro, will see one million bags of home-grown tea being brewed on FGW trains this year, making it one of the plantation's largest customers. A British tea company has inked a deal to supply one million teabags to First Great Western Trains. To celebrate, passengers on board a FGW train from Paddington to Cornwall were treated to a quintessentially English tea party, complete with the world's largest fully-functioning tea pot, which brews over 300 cups . Tregothnan estate near Truro, Cornwall will supply First Great Western Trains with the teabags . Tregothnan, home to the Boscawen family, began supplying England's first and only tea, which partly comprises locally-grown leaves, in 2005. Home to the Boscawen family, the private Tregothnan estate near Truro has persevered in pioneering botanical firsts since 1334. They first began supplying England’s first and only tea in 2005. As well as growing English tea and a range of herbal infusions, they also produce sustainable coppiced charcoal, Cornish Manuka and wildflower honeys, and Kea plum jam. British flowers from the Tregothnan estate and surrounding lands are cut for their range of hand-tied seasonal English bouquets. The new venture will mean six new jobs in propagating, horticulture, guest services, website and social media, processing, blending and packing at Tregothnan. This will contribute to the company's expected growth of 60 per cent this year. Jonathan Jones, director of Tregothnan, said 'This is a truly historic partnership for us - it is great to see a company like First Great Western investing in the region and supporting local suppliers. 'One million tea bags will see us hire new staff and roll out more goods than ever.' The tea will be available from FGW's Express Café, Night Riviera Sleeper Café and the Pullman. Jo Elliott, from FGW, said 'We are thrilled to be working with a local supplier to bring quality, home-grown produce to our passengers. 'We aim to source all the produce on our trains from local suppliers and producers, and by choosing a Cornish supplier from within our network, First Great Western is a step closer to achieving that goal.' Jonathan Jones, director of Tregothnan (pictured) calls the partnership 'truly historic' Nutritionist Angela Dowden investigates the most popular types of tea and gives them a health rating out of five. Oolong tea . Oolong tea . Cuppa quota: 1-2 cups daily. Health rating: 4/5 . A cross between green and black tea, this partially fermented variety has a light, delicate flavour often likened to peaches. Healthwise, it has almost as much antioxidant power as the better known green tea, so drinking it regularly will help to boost your defences against heart disease and cancer. Japanese researchers found that exposing human stomach cancer cells to an extract of oolong tea stimulated an increase in tumour cell destruction. Drink it after a meal as a digestive aid, or after alcohol as a protection against a hangover. Jasmine is a scented oolong tea with the same health properties, prepared by piling jasmine flowers next to dried green leaves so they absorb the fragrance. Breakfast tea . Cuppa quota: 1-2 cups daily. Any type of black tea is better not drunk with meals because it can reduce iron absorption. Health rating: 4/5 . Black (fermented) tea supplies 75 per cent of the UK population's intake of dietary flavonoids - antioxidants which reduce blood-clotting and the deposition of cholesterol in blood vessels. Breakfast blends are among the best contributors because they contain a traditionally strong mixture of Indian Assam and Ceylon varieties. Results from one study suggest that higher intake of flavonoids protect against coronary heart disease. Breakfast tea provides more stimulant properties than other teas, but not the harsh jolt of coffee because the caffeine it contains is quite poorly absorbed. Ordinary teabags are also one of the largest providers of fluoride in our diets - on average, tea provides up to 70 per cent of our total intake of this mineral, which can help in reducing tooth decay. Green tea . Early grey tea . Cuppa quota: 3-4 cups daily. Health rating: 3/4 . Its delicate flavour comes from added bergamot (a type of citrus fruit) which, according to traditional herbal medicine, helps protect against colds and chest infections. A favourite time to drink a cup of fragrant Earl Grey is after eating, when it can help to digest a fatty meal. Essential oils in tea aid digestion by encouraging digestive enzyme production. However, Earl Grey's more delicate flavour means it has a lower content of disease protective antioxidants. Green tea . Cuppa quota: Around a mugful daily. Health rating: 5/5 . Green tea has half the caffeine content of black tea, and laboratory tests suggest it has an even higher antioxidant activity. The growth of cancer cells isolated from the lung, breast and stomach can be inhibited by incubation with epigallocatechin gallate, one of green tea's active ingredients. And research suggests that regular consumption may help prevent prostate cancer deaths. Green tea also seems to stimulate beneficial gut bacteria called Bifidobacteria, which help keep gastric infections at bay and maintain digestive health. It seems about half a pint of green tea is needed daily to exert these beneficial effects.","The teabags will be supplied by Tregothnan estate near Truro, Cornwall .

"People who live in central London are meaner than those in the suburbs, who are happier, calmer and even a little bit boring, a study has revealed. Residents in Westminster, Camden, Kensington and Chelsea were deemed to be less considerate while those living in Bromley and Croydon were the nicest, according to researchers. The study by Cambridge University psychologists found those with specific personality traits tended to live in the same area, for example the most sociable people flock to boroughs in south London. This map shows the level of agreeableness by residents in London is more so in the outskirts, with the least agreeable people living in central parts of the city . Meanwhile those living in central areas were far more open to trying new experiences than their neighbours on the outskirts, who become progressively less adventurous the further out they are. The researchers also found higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of London and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west, north east, and south London. In those areas, the most agreeable and conscientious types tended to be slightly more satisfied, suggesting that these traits are more important determinants of life satisfaction. Those with the most volatile personalities lived in Hackney, Barnet and Lewisham, while the residents of Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth were most emotionally stable, according to the Telegraph. The most emotionally stable Londoners live in western central London - areas like Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth - while those in Hackney, Barnet and Lewisham are more volatile, according to the study . There are higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of London (west central) and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west, north east, and south London . While the study, undertaken by an international team of researchers, shows the most miserable Londoners live in Hounslow, Ealing, Hillingdon, Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Harrow. Psychologists found the least agreeable areas were in western central London - an area with the highest crime rate, busiest pedestrian traffic and some of the highest housing prices in the capital. Researchers believe this could support the idea that residents of big cities tend to be less considerate towards other people. Dr Markus Jokela, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, said: 'It’s very common for people to talk about where is the best place to live. 'But most research has tended to look at factors such as income and low crime rates, and only on a very broad geographical scale, failing to consider individual differences in personality. 'As a result, studies imply that all people would be equally happy in the same places. 'It’s a one-size-fits-all conclusion that, as we show, is misleading because one’s level of happiness is dependent on whether their environment is suited to their personality.' The most sociable Londoners flock to south of the river while the further out you live, the least extrovert the residents are . The more conscientious Londoners live on the outskirts with the least choosing boroughs in the north . Dr Jason Rentfrow, from the Department of Psychology at Cambridge University, said the findings could prove useful for those deciding on an area to live. He said: 'Together, these findings not only add to our understanding of the ways in which features of our personalities relate to our physical environments, but they also provide potentially useful information for choosing a place to live. 'Granted, most people don't have the luxury of complete control over where they live, but given their budgets, people can decide whether it's more important to live in the centre of town, where daily life is vibrant and accommodation is small, or further out where daily life is slower but space is more plentiful. 'Making the decision that fits with your personality could have an effect on your overall life satisfaction.' Psychologists used data from the BBC's Big Personality Test and honed in on the 56,000 Londoners to examine how associations between personality and life satisfaction differed across the 216 postal districts. The research, funded by the Kone Foundation and the Academy of Finland, was published  in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Those most open to trying new experiences live closest to the centre of the capital, with suburb residents significantly less adventurous .","Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea home to least agreeable people .

"This is the incredible moment when a Peruvian police officer crosses five lanes of busy traffic to rescue a stranded puppy. Juan Manuel Iman Zena, 34, had spotted the terrified young dog on the busy Panamericana Sur, in the Peruvian capital Lima. Concerned about its welfare, and fearing it could cause a major accident, the brave officer took his life in his hands as he strode out onto the highway, ordering traffic to stop, to pick up the puppy. Scroll down for video . Juan Manuel Iman Zena (pictured with the rescued puppy) had spotted the terrified young animal on the busy Panamericana Sur, in the Peruvian capital Lima . Video footage of the incident has since gone viral, turning Mr Zena into an internet star. But despite his online fame, the officer insists; 'I was only doing my job. 'I could see that there was no way the young dog was going to make it back and it's amazing he even managed to get the central reservation in the first place,' said Mr Zena. 'I knew it was about to be hit at any moment, and was worried that if a car tried to swerve it might cause an accident.' Concerned about the puppy's welfare, and fearing it could cause a major accident, the brave officer took his life in his hands as he strode out onto the highway to pick up the puppy . The officer orders traffic to stop and slowly approached the young dog before grabbing it by the scruff of its neck . Realising he could be hit 'any moment', he quickly carries with the animal to his motorbike across the road where he can check its collar . The video shows him starting to wave down traffic before eventually crossing the highway and slowly approaching the puppy. He then grabs the dog by the scruff of the neck and carries it back to the safety of his motorbike. There he puts the animal on a makeshift lead and checks the collar to help track down the owners. On the video a child can also be heard saying excitedly: 'He saved it.' Mr Zena added: 'I had an easy job with the last part, the telephone number for the owners was on the collar and I simply called them and they were very grateful to be reunited with their pet.' Video footage of the incident has since gone viral, turning Mr Zena into an internet star but despite his new online fame, he insists he was only doing his job . The video, shot by witness Carolina Carol, attracted widespread praise for the police officer from animal welfare protection organisations in the country and resulted in him being praised by his superiors. The president of the Peruvian Animal Protection Association, Cecilia Degregori, wrote in the Facebook profile of the group that it was great to see positive news about dogs and people in the media for a change. She said: 'Unfortunately, we see daily reports of cruelty and indifference against animals and we are fighting to change this attitude. However I must say to this policeman, with your behaviour we are proud of you and the Peruvian police and we see in you hope for the future for change.'","Juan Manuel Iman Zena spotted the puppy on a busy road in Lima, Peru .

"In 1948, the US government launched several inquiries into UFO sightings, which many believed were sparked by Cold War paranoia. In what became known as 'Project Blue Book,' more than 12,000 encounters with UFOs were looked into by the Air Force. Now, decades after the files were closed, the microfilms have been made available online for free – allowing anyone to re-examine the evidence. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the staff of Project Blue Book, which recorded more than 12,000 encounters with UFOs. Sitting in the centre is Hector Quintanilla, the last chief officer of Project Blue Book . The USAF says that the Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files. The files, which can be accessed here, were previously only available by visiting the National Archives in Washington, according to a report in openminds.tv. 'There is plenty of work for amateur investigators to try to come up with explanations they never had time to consider or research,' Nigel Watson author of the UFO investigations Manual told MailOnline. One case that Mr Watson is particularly intrigued in for historical reasons is a report filed by Kenneth Arnold which led to the popular term 'flying saucers'. Mr Arnold saw nine UFOs over Mount Rainier, on 24 June 1947 and the US government agencies took an interest in reports. A similar sighting (pictured) occurred over Tulsa, Oklahoma on July 12, 1947 . The information was transferred online after John Greenewald, who runs a website called The Black Vault, submitted thousands of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests . Project Blue Book was the name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969. It was the third study of its kind. The first two were projects Sign (1947) and Grudge (1949). The aim was to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and to scientifically analyse UFO-related data. The USAF says that Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files. A termination order was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its project ended in January 1970. Mr Arnold saw nine UFOs over Mount Rainier, on 24 June 1947 and the US government agencies took an interest in reports. A similar sighting occurred over Tulsa, Oklahoma, just a month later on July 12, 1947 . 'They flew in a diagonal formation that stretched about five miles from the first to last craft, and they bobbed about erratically,' said Mr Watson. 'He estimated that they travelled faster than 1,000 miles per hour as they flew from Mount Rainier to Mount Adams.' When describing the sight to newspaper reporters, Mr Arnold said it was 'like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.' This, said Mr Watson, reveals that the term flying saucer came from the description of the movement of the craft rather than their appearance. 'Explanations from mirages, secret aircraft to the flight of pelicans have all been used to try to explain his sighting but it still remains a mystery,' he added. The once-top secret files were previously only available by visiting the National Archives in Washington .","The files relate to USAF investigations into UFO from 1947-1969 .

"Friends and family of a Denver woman are enraged that a pastor cancelled her funeral services after they were scheduled to begin over his objection to a same-sex kiss in the memorial video. Vanessa Collier died on December 30, and her family paid the New Hope Ministries $400 to have her funeral service there on January 10. Then, at 10:15am, 15 minutes after the service was supposed to begin, the family was told they could no longer move forward as the family refused to remove a kiss between Collier, a lesbian, and her wife in the memorial video. Collier, 33, also had two daughters, Kylee M. Bounthavilay and Maddison G. Morris. Scroll down for video . The funeral service for Vanessa Collier (left with wife Christina Higley) was cancelled on Saturday 15 minutes after they were scheduled to have begun . The pastor said he would not move forward because of a kiss between Collier and her wife (above) that was featured in the memorial video . This after the family had already paid New Hope ministries (above) and been seated for the service . 'I am a child of a lesbian mother and if my mom was to die, I would want dignity in her death,' Collier's friend Jose Silva told ABC 7. 'I am against bigotry and stand with my friend Vanessa Collier's family in seeking an apology and refund from Pastor Ray Chavez and New Hope Ministries. The acts that took place at her funeral were wrong and no family should ever have to go through that.' Pastor Ray Chavez, the man who cancelled the services, has refused to comment. As a result, pallbearers were forced to moved the woman's body and casket to a nearby funeral homes that was able to provide a venue for the service at the last second. What's more, the family said the ministry had the videos that day before, but did not review them until the morning of the service. They did however refund the family's money . 'We don't want overt, open homosexuality in our sanctuary,' said Gary Rolando, a pastor at New Hope Ministries. Pastor Ray Chavez (above with wife Lola), the man who cancelled the services, has refused to comment . 'I am a child of a lesbian mother and if my mom was to die, I would want dignity in her death,' said Collier's friend Jose Silva as protesters gathered on Tuesday (above) 'You will not find Jesus at New Hope but you will find HYPOCRISY,' said one sign (above) at the protest . 'As a result, it was a very difficult day,' he added. 'We had to call the pall bearers… it was a logistical nightmare, but was handled as professionally as I've ever seen.' On Tuesday, friends and family of Collier were back at new Hope Ministries protesting the events that happened over the weekend. 'You will not find Jesus at New Hope but you will find HYPOCRISY,' said one. Said Rolando, 'New Hope is very sorry. It's very sad that it happened the way that it did.'","Friends and family of Vanessa Collier are outraged after New Hope Ministries cancelled her funeral service after it was to have started .

"A former 'Mother of the Year' who admitted to terrorizing a couple after they outbid her for her dream home has been ordered to keep away from them for 10 years. Kathy J. Rowe, 53, expressed her regret as she was sentenced in San Diego, California on Friday, where she was also handed down a year of electronic surveillance and five years of probation. Court records document how Rowe tormented Jerry Rice, 40, and Janice Ruhter, 37, for months after they moved into the home in the upscale neighborhood of Carmel Valley in 2011. Soon after the move, they noticed their home was mysteriously listed for sale online. Their mail stopped over Christmas and they were inundated with more than $1,000 worth of magazines and books they had not ordered, People reported. Scroll down for video . Heading home: Kathy Rowe, 53, smiles after she is sentenced to five years probation in court on Friday for terrorizing a couple who outbid her for her 'dream home' in San Diego, California in 2011 . Then on Valentine's Day, a neighbor confronted Rice demanding to know why he had sent a card to his wife. Eight other wives in the neighborhood also received similar cards. But most shocking was when Rice typed his wife's name into an internet search engine and discovered that there were ads inviting men to their home for a 'Carmel Valley Freak Show'. Rowe, pretending to be the couple, had advertised for men to visit the home and force themselves upon Ruhter, claiming it was her fantasy to be raped. The wife's photo and address were included in the postings, which were made sometime between October 2011 and June 2012. 'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at my door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' Rowe wrote to one man who responded, according to reports. One man decided to follow up on the offer, but was thwarted once by a locked gate and a second time when the husband answered the door. Cruel: Rowe had pretended to be new homeowner Janice Ruhter, pictured giving an impact statement to the court on Friday, when she advertised for men to go to the house for sex . Fears: Victim Jerry Rice, right, told the court he believes that if police had not got involved and caught Rowe, she would have carried on until harm came to a member of his family . 'Regrets': Rowe, pictured with her attorney Brad Patton, said she never intended to cause any harm . After the posts emerged, Rowe, a county administrative analyst who was named as a San Diego 'Mother of the Year' in 2007 for how she cared for her disabled daughter, was charged with  solicitation of rape and stalking charges. The prosecutor said the charges were filed because Rowe's actions went far beyond a prank. In December, Rowe entered a plea bargain over the stalking charges, in exchange for prosecutors to drop felony charges of soliciting rape and sodomy and misdemeanor charges of identity theft and harassment. Conviction of soliciting rape would have required Rowe to register for life as a sex offender. In court on Friday, Rowe apologized to the couple for what she had put them through. 'I just wanted to say how humiliated I am by my behavior – that this is not representative of who I am. I've never behaved like this – never will again,' she said, Fox5 reported. She said she acted due to the stress she was under and never intended to cause the couple any harm - but in court, the couple said they felt terrorized. 'Dream home': Rowe, who had been named as one of the city's top moms in 2007, said it was devastating when she lost the home, pictured due to a miscommunication with real estate agents in 2011 . Luxury: She said that the home had been perfect for her the family in part because it had a swimming pool (pictured), to provide exercise for her husband following a heart attack . Inside: She repeatedly encouraged strange men to go to the home, pictured, to have sex with Ruhter . 'The home should be a place of safety and sanctuary,' Ruhter said. 'But I never truly felt this way in our house. I felt most secure away from my home. The house became my prison.' Rice added: 'Had law enforcement not intervened in this case, I am certain Mrs. Rowe would have continued her attacks until she successfully brought physical harm to a member of my family.' In a letter to a judge last year, Rowe explained it had been 'devastating' when she lost the house due to mis-communication with real estate agents, and a more attractive bid from the other couple. She had her heart set on the home because it was a single story, to accommodate her severely disabled daughter, and had a pool, to provide exercise for her husband following a heart attack. 'The anger and grief over losing that house (and especially in the way we did) drove me to behave in a very childish way and to do what I thought were childish pranks to let off steam and ease the pain,' Rowe said. 'I never intended for them to be hurtful.'","Jerry Rice and Janie Ruhter are now in counseling after the stress of being harassed took its toll on their marriage .

In 2012 Mr Giannasca was found not guilty of killing his wife Carmel Giannasca, who went missing from their home on or about January 12 2002. Mr Giannasca had been charged with murdering Mrs Giannasca, who was 33 at the time of her disappearance, and whose body has never been found. He reported to police that she was missing three weeks after she was last seen. Police had alleged Mr and Mrs Giannasca had argued the night before her disappearance over allegations his father Antonio had sexually abused a girl. However, the alleged abuse victim - now an adult - said she could not remember if she had mentioned the alleged abuse to the couple before Mrs Giannasca's disappearance while being cross-examined during the murder trial. Mr Giannasca administered CPR but paramedics pronounced the 86-year-old dead at the scene at Rookwood . Mr Giannasca's barrister, David Dalton, SC, said the alleged abuse occurred after Mrs Giannasca's disappearance. He said his client's wife could have been kidnapped or ended up anonymously in a psychiatric ward. A NSW Supreme Court jury found Mr Giannasca not guilty for both a charge of murder and an alternate charge of manslaughter. Mrs Giannasca is still listed on the national missing persons register.

"Mass die-offs of certain animals has increased in frequency every year for seven decades, according to a new study. Researchers found that such events, which can kill more than 90 per cent of a population, are increasing among birds, fish and marine invertebrates. The reasons for the die-offs are diverse, with effects tied to humans such as environmental contamination accounting for about a fifth of them. Three US institutions say mass die-offs are now more common. They have increased by one event per year for 70 years. Pictured are dead tilapia floating near Salton Sea Beach in California, US on 19 Januray 11. They were killed by erosion and high toxicity levels from farm runoff . The research was carried out by three US institutions - the University of San Diego, Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley - and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mass mortality events occur when a large percentage of a population dies in a short time frame. While they are rare and fall sort of an extinction, they still pack a devastating punch. The analysis of 727 published MMEs from across the globe, affecting 2,407 animal populations, found that the magnitude of such events since 1940 has been intensifying for birds, fishes and marine invertebrates, decreasing for reptiles and amphibians and staying the same for mammals. The most severe events were those with multiple causes, the paper shows. Although mass mortality events are often a natural event 'the most alarming and interesting result was the sheer magnitude of some of these mortality events,' Dr Adam Siepielski of the University of San Diego said. 'Billions of individuals dying are just huge numbers to comprehend. The study provides yet another example of the challenges to life that organisms are confronted with on a planet increasingly dominated by the influence of humans in the environment.' 'This is the first attempt to quantify patterns in the frequency, magnitude and cause of such mass kill events,' said study senior author Dr Stephanie Carlson, an associate professor at UC Berkeley's Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management. The researchers reviewed incidents of mass kills documented in scientific literature. Although they came across some sporadic studies dating back to the 1800s, the analysis focused on the period from 1940 to the present. The researchers acknowledged that some of their findings may be due to an increase in the reporting of mass die-offs in recent decades. But they noted that even after accounting for some of this reporting bias, there was still an increase in mass die-offs for certain animals. Overall, disease was the primary culprit, accounting for 26 per cent of the mass die-offs. Direct effects tied to humans, such as environmental contamination, caused 19 percent of the mass kills. Biotoxicity triggered by events such as algae blooms accounted for a significant proportion of deaths, and processes directly influenced by climate - including weather extremes, thermal stress, oxygen stress or starvation - collectively contributed to about 25 percent of mass mortality events. The most severe events were those with multiple causes, the study found. Overall, disease was the primary culprit, accounting for 26 per cent of the mass die-offs. Direct effects tied to humans, such as environmental contamination (stock image shown), caused 19 per cent of the mass kills . Biotoxicity  triggered by events such as algae blooms accounted for a significant proportion of deaths (stock image shown), and processes directly influenced by climate - including weather extremes, thermal stress, oxygen stress or starvation - collectively contributed to about 25 percent of mass mortality events . Dr Carlson, a fish ecologist, and her UC Berkeley graduate students had observed such die-offs in their studies of fish in California streams and estuaries, originally piquing their interest in the topic. 'The catastrophic nature of sudden, mass die-offs of animal populations inherently captures human attention,' said Dr Carlson. 'In our studies, we have come across mass kills of federal fish species during the summer drought season as small streams dry up. 'The majority of studies we reviewed were of fish. When oxygen levels are depressed in the water column, the impact can affect a variety of species.' The study found that the number of mass mortality events has been increasing by about one event per year over the 70 years the study covered. 'While this might not seem like much, one additional mass mortality event per year over 70 years translates into a considerable increase in the number of these events being reported each year,' said study co-lead author Dr Adam Siepielski, an assistant professor of biology at the University of San Diego. 'Going from one event to 70 each year is a substantial increase, especially given the increased magnitudes of mass mortality events for some of these organisms.' 'The catastrophic nature of sudden, mass die-offs of animal populations inherently captures human attention,' said Dr Carlson. 'In our studies, we have come across mass kills of federal fish species during the summer drought season as small streams dry up' (stock image shown) This study suggests that in addition to monitoring physical changes such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, it is important to document the biological response to regional and global environmental change. The researchers highlighted ways to improve documentation of such events in the future, including the possible use of citizen science to record mass mortality events in real time. 'The initial patterns are a bit surprising, in terms of the documented changes to frequencies of occurrences, magnitudes of each event and the causes of mass mortality,' said study co-lead author Dr Samuel Fey, a postdoctoral fellow in ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale. 'Yet these data show that we have a lot of room to improve how we document and study these types of rare events.'","Three US institutions say mass die-offs are now more common .

"An Idaho prosecutor has apologized for arresting a nine-year-old boy who allegedly stole  a pack of chewing gum from a local grocery store. The unidentified boy from Post Falls was detained last Tuesday at a youth detention center on petty theft charges before being released Friday after a court hearing. On Monday Barry McHugh, prosecuting attorney in Kootenai County, admitted  his office made a 'mistake' and they should have followed a different course of action given the suspect's age. Unusual: Barry McHugh, Prosecuting Attorney in Kootenai County, issued an arrest warrant for a nine-year-old boy who was then detained over an alleged theft of a pack of chewing gum . Although it is not uncommon to press charges in cases of theft of smaller items, such as a pack of chewing gum, it is extremely rare to issue an arrest warrant for someone so young. McHugh said he resorted to such measures after the boy 'failed to appear' in court for the alleged theft. However, now he believes he should have instead sought a child protection investigation that would have led to a more informed decision. 'I have concluded that my office's request to have an arrest warrant issued was a mistake under the circumstances,' McHugh said in a statement. 'I regret this having taken place and will do everything in my power to avoid this type of mistake in the future.' First District Court Judge Lansing Haynes authorized the warrant requested by McHugh's office after the boy twice failed to show up in court. Surprise: Post Falls Chief of Police Scott Haug said it is the first time in his 30 years in law enforcement that he's ever seen an arrest warrant issued for someone as young as nine . Post Falls Police Chief Scott Haug said it was later discovered the child missed court because his relatives had no way of getting him to the courthouse. The child was taken into custody on January 6. He apparently was not handcuffed or searched on arrest. 'He was not treated like an adult, and simply given a ride to the Juvenile Detention Center,' Haug told the Coeur d'Alene Press. 'No officer wants to do this. It's unfortunate that it got to this point.' Haug added that he had never seen an arrest warrant for someone so young in his 30-year career in the force. News of the incident quickly gained widespread attention, with many commenters criticizing the lawmakers involved for being 'idiotic' and 'extreme'. The case against the boy remains pending. Security video involving the arrest cannot be released because it involves a minor.","Boy, nine, was arrested for failing to show up in court over gum theft .

"A Virginia lawmaker who resigned his seat following a sex scandal involving a teenage employee won it back during a special election Tuesday. Apparently plenty of voters in Joseph Morrissey's Richmond-area House of Delegates district were OK with his conviction in the scandal involving his 17-year-old secretary, whose nude photo was found on his cellphone and allegedly shared with a friend. Morrissey has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying his phone was hacked. The young woman, who denies they had sex, is now pregnant. But he successfully conducted a political campaign – for the seat he was forced to vacate upon his guilty plea to the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor – from behind bars. With all the precincts reporting, Morrissey defeated Democrat Kevin Sullivan and Republican Matt Walton by a comfortable margin. He won 42 percent of the vote, compared to 33 percent for Sullivan and 24 percent for Walton. Joe Morrissey (left) crushed the competition for his old Virginia House seat on Tuesday, including rival Matt Walton (right), despite having to wear a court-ordered ankle bracelet and sleeping each night behind bars; he learned of his victory via a jailhouse pay phone . HANDS UP, DON'T JUDGE: Morrissey has said he might try to commute to the statehouse from jail during his sentence related to an alleged sexual relationship with an underage girl . 'This is a victory for the ages,' University of Mary Washington political science professor Stephen Farnsworth told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 'Rarely has a politician with as many problems emerged victorious. For a man who has more baggage than Amtrak to win speaks volumes for his ability to connect with the district despite all of his liabilities.' Prosecutors in Morrissey's criminal case said that in addition to the sexual relationship he carried on with Myrna Pride, now an 18-year-old college freshman, he sent a naked photo of her to a friend. Part of the evidence against him, which he read to reporters on the courthouse steps in July, was a text allegedly from his young paramour to a third-party, reading: 'OMG, I just f***ed my boss.' He claimed the photo and the text messages were planted by a 24-year-old woman named Brittany McKinney, who grew jealous after Pride rejected her lesbian advances. But special prosecutor William Neely told the Richmond Times-Dispatch at the time that Morrissey 'had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it.' Morrissey's victory was not unprecedented: Through four previous elections, most voters overlooked or even embraced the lawmaker's flamboyant history of fistfights, contempt-of-court citations and disbarment. The 57-year-old bachelor, who fathered three children out of wedlock with three different women, repeatedly won at least 70 percent of the vote as a Democrat. Morrissey said in a telephone interview that the results show people aren't interested in the drama that landed him in jail. 'They're interested in my body of work in the General Assembly,' Morrissey told the Associated Press. 'Nobody works harder for their constituents than I do.' He also said Sullivan's ads focusing on his latest scrape with the law backfired: 'People hate negative campaigns.' The lawmaker has made a career of never backing down. He hung boxing gloves in his office and promised 'Joe will fight for you' in campaign ads on city buses. In 2013 he waved an AK-47 rifle inside the House chamber while arguing for gun control. That brought back memories of a 1994 incident when police recovered an Uzi submachine gun in from a heroin dealer – a gun that police had loaned Morrissey, then a prosecutor, for use as a prop when he spoke at schools about drugs and violence. The 57-year-old has seen his law license suspended and revoked, has paid a $500,000 judgment to a man he brutally beat in 1999, lost a job teaching law in Australia for hiding his disbarment, and earned his nickname – 'Fightin' Joe' – for engaging in a courtroom fistfight while he was a prosecutor in 1991. He resigned his seat — effective Tuesday, the day of this special election — as part of a plea deal. The misdemeanor conviction allowed him to avoid a felony trial that could have barred him from office and put him in prison for years. He originally faced grand jury indictments on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor, possession of pornographic images of an underage female, and solicitation to obtain the images. But Morrissey wouldn't give up — he promptly quit his party to run as an independent for his seat, sleeping in jail and wearing an electronic monitoring device as he campaigned during the day. Legislators from both parties denounced him as unfit to serve and began studying how to expel him if he won. 'Mr. Morrissey's election tonight does not change the fact that his actions fall grievously short of the standards of a public servant in the House of Delegates,' House Speaker William Howell, a Republican, said in a statement. MUG SHOT: Morrissey has been in and out of jail for decades, in between suspensions and revocations of his law license . NOT SHOOTING STRAIGHT: Morrissey brandished an AK-47 during a floor debate about gun rights, but had earlier admitted losing track of an Uzi that law enforcement officers had loaned him for use as a prop during speeches . House Democratic Minority Leader David Toscano and party caucus chairman Scott Surovell said in a joint statement that Morrissey's 'conviction and actions over the past two months were reprehensible, and we will be exploring every avenue in regard to his status as a member of the House of Delegates.' According to House Clerk G. Paul Nardo, it takes two-thirds of the 100-member House to expel a member – something that hasn't happened since 1876. The Virginia Constitution says a legislator can be kicked out for 'disorderly' behavior – which isn't defined. Morrissey vowed to wage a voting rights battle on behalf of the people who re-elected him if his foes try to remove him. His latest troubles began when Coleman Pride told authorities that the lawmaker was preying on his daughter when she worked at his law office in 2013 — allegations he repeated in campaign ads last week for Morrissey's Democratic opponent. But Morrissey's staunchest defender is Myrna Pride, now 18, who went public this month with her side of the story. She insists she never had sex with Morrissey but has refused to identify the father of her unborn child. And she publicly defended Morrissey on Monday in a radio interview. Richmond radio host Jack Gravely was interviewing Coleman Pride on WLEE about his daughter's relationship with Morrissey when the lawmaker called in to defend himself. Ms. Pride then showed up at the broadcast studio in person, accusing her father and others of manufacturing the entire scandal to get back at Morrissey for his help in a dispute over her father's child support. It was Morrissey's role in that family dispute that reportedly prompted police to serve a search warrant of his office Monday afternoon, with only hours to go before the voting started. Morrissey called that a political dirty trick. 'The only person that has shown any respect or kindness, or been there for me, is Mr. Morrissey,' Myrna Pride told a WTVR reporter on Monday. 'Right now it's a friendship. I don't speak with him often. I call here and there to check on him. I want to see how his spirits are going.' Morrissey supported her in turn. 'She is a very smart young lady,' he told the radio host. 'She is kind, she is considerate. She will go on to do very well.' OPPOSITION: On Sunday, Jan. 11, women protested against Morrissey as he left the Richmond Crusade for Voters, Inc. 74th District forum . Neely, the special prosecutor, has a long history with Morrissey. He unsuccessfully opposed the reinstatement of the politician's law license in 2011, claiming he 'completely lacks any moral compass' and engaged in 'notoriously unethical practices.' That opinion came with a litany of evidence. He landed two fists on the face of a flamboyant defense attorney during the 1991 courtroom brawl, landing in jail. In 1993 the Virginia State Bar Association yanked his license to practice law after he was indicted on a bribery charge. That case concerned his decision to dismiss a rape charge against a defendant whose father allegedly paid his victim $25,000 to get himself off the hook, and another $25,000 to a list of charities Morrissey chose. Charges against Morrissey in that case were later dismissed. Five years later, his license was suspended a second time after a 90-day stint in jail for contempt of court, for tainting a drug prosecution by leaking information to reporters. A judge in that proceeding banned him from arguing cases in court for two years. In 1999 Morrissey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after physically assaulting a home contractor. According to a legal brief filed by the home contractor's attorneys, Morrissey shouted, 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to beat your head in,' before beating the victim and 'smash(ing) his head into the corner of a brick wall.' In 2002 the victim won a judgment against him in civil court, which he paid off with a $500,000 check in 2007, The Daily Caller reported. But Morrissey wasn't as diligent with his community-service sentence: A court found he tried submitted phony documentation showing how many hours he had worked off, and sent him to jail for another 90 days. The bar association 'disbarred' him for that offense, tearing up his law license permanently – but relented a decade later and reinstated him in 2012. But meanwhile, Morrissey made headlines for losing his job teaching law in Australia when authorities there learned of his disbarment in the U.S.","Last year Joseph Morrissey was arrested for allegedly sleeping with a 17-year-old office assistant and sending a naked picture of the now-pregnant 18-year-old to a friend .

"Convicted pedophile and former Queensland Labor leader Keith Wright has died in Vietnam. Wright became head of the party in the early 1980s and came within 3000 votes of toppling Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1983. He transferred to federal politics in 1984 as the Labor MP for Capricornia. However, the former Rockhampton teacher and Baptist preacher's career came to a halt when he was jailed in 1993 for nine years, for raping and indecently dealing with two young girls. Convicted child sex offender Keith Wright has died in Vietnam at the age of 72 . Wright was released on home detention in early 1999 and later granted parole. He moved with his new wife to Asia, where he has worked in literacy programs, which he felt was his opportunity to 'contribute to society' in the wake of his indiscretions. He emphasised that he did not work with children in his new role. In 2009, he publicly apologised to his two young victims, telling The Courier-Mail: 'I profoundly regret it all. I am so sorry.' 'Yes, I really blew it man,' Wright said. 'I was so stupid.' Wright apologised for his actions in 2009, saying 'I regret it for the girls, I regret it for my family, I regret it for myself and I regret it for those in the community who looked up to me' 'I regret it for the girls, I regret it for my family, I regret it for myself and I regret it for those in the community who looked up to me.'

"The three French police officers killed in last week's terrorist attacks have been awarded the country's highest decoration today at an emotional ceremony led by the Muslim mother of slain policeman Ahmed Merabet. Mr Merabet was killed during the terrorist's killing spree last week when he was gunned down in the middle of the street by Said and Cherif Kouachi as he attempted to defend the staff of Charlie Hebdo. In a moving tribute, President Hollande told hundreds of people that Mr Merabet, Franck Brinsolaro and Clarissa Jean-Philippe 'died so that we could live free'. The coffins of the three slain officers - who were posthumously awarded the country's highest honour - were carried at a solemn funeral ceremony attended by the president. Scroll down for video .

Here he is pictured as he is acknowledged by French President Francois Hollande (left) French President Francois Hollande embraces the mother of Clarissa Jean-Philippe, who was shot dead the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack . Mr Merabet, a 40-year-old Muslim, was executed by the killers as he lay injured on a Paris sidewalk as they fled Charlie Hebdo's offices. Mr Brinsolaro, 49, was providing security for the editor of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, and Ms Jean-Philippe, 27, was shot dead the day after the massacre. The Marseillaise anthem rang out under grey skies as a grim-faced Hollande pinned the country's highest decoration, the Legion d'honneur, onto coffins draped in the red, white and blue flag, surrounded by weeping families and uniformed colleagues. Established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, the Order is the highest award in France. Chopin's funeral march was played as the coffins, draped in French flags, were carried from the building. 'Our great and beautiful France will never break, will never yield, never bend' in the face of the Islamist threat that is 'still there, inside and outside' the country, said Hollande.

Flanked by hundreds of officers at police headquarters in central Paris, he told the crowd: 'They died so that we could live free.' He vowed that France will be 'merciless in the face of anti-Semitic, anti-Muslims acts, and unrelenting against those who defend and carry out terrorism, notably the jihadists who go to Iraq and Syria'. At the ceremony in the capital, Hollande went first to the family of Mr Merabet, the French Muslim policeman killed in the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo. The country has been shaken to its core by the bloodshed that began with a jihadist assault on the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine on Wednesday and ended in a bloody hostage drama at a Jewish supermarket two days later. The satirical newspaper lampooned religions and had been threatened repeatedly for its caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. Seventeen people were killed in the attacks, along with the gunmen. Meanwhile, the four Jewish kosher deli victims were today laid to rest at a funeral in Israel, where, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for Jews to emigrate to Israel for their own safety amid rising anti-Semitism. Thousands of mourners streamed towards the cemetery at Givat Ha Shaul, situated on a hill known as 'the Mount of Repose' in Jerusalem, as helicopters and surveillance balloons circled overhead.

"Many people start the New Year hoping to lose weight but when you are the Prime Minister all eyes are on attempts to shed a few pounds. David Cameron today revealed he has given up bread as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight, which involves cutting out carbs and running every other day. The extreme regime means the Premier will have to shelve his breadmaker, which he famously admitted using instead of buying budget loaves. David Cameron today revealed he has given up bread as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight, which involves cutting out carbs and running every other day . Mr Cameron decided to embark on a New Year diet after feeling a 'tightening around the belt buckle' over Christmas. The Prime Minister has now revealed his plan to lose weight depends on cutting out carbohydrates. Quizzed about his weight loss today, he told BBC Radio Sussex: 'I’m trying hard, it is a great patriotic struggle.' He attempted to blame the day job for his struggle, but admitted it was 'feeble'. 'It’s difficult when you’re own the road a lot,' he began. 'This sounds like a feeble excuse.' Mr Cameron went on: 'I’m trying my hardest, I’m trying to go for a run every other day. I’m trying to cut the intake.' Pressed on whether his weakness was cake or other sweet treats, Mr Cameron said his 'downfall' was snacking in the middle of the day. 'That’s the thing you’ve got to cut out isn’t it. I’m giving up the bread, bread’s off. Cut the carbs and go for a run. 'It worked before, maybe it will work again, who knows.' But he said the being in the public eye meant he had to try to stay trim. 'That’s the trouble... I can’t get away with it because people can judge pretty clearly whether the pounds have come off or gone on.' The new regime means the Prime Minister won't be able to enjoy toast in the morning when he catches up on the headlines using his iPad . David Cameron pictured leaving Downing Street today and taking part in the Great Brook Run at Christmas . David Cameron is not the only politician to have struggled with his weight. Tory heavyweight Boris Johnson has admitted tipping the scales at more than 16 stone and a half stone and now needs to cut back 'through guts and determination, by sheer will‎power, by eating less'. 'I have a bad habit of eating the children's supper for breakfast,' the London Mayor revealed. Tory Chancellor George Osborne and former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond have both used the 5:2 diet to shed the pounds. But none have come close to Labour peer Lord Falconer who lost five stone thanks to a regime of Diet Coke and apples. In 2013, he revealed the existence of his breadmaker while being grilled about the rising cost of living. Asked to identify a 47p budget loaf, he instead he ended up promoting artisan bread flour made in the Cotswolds, costing five times more than a supermarket brand. Four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the Cabinet. A combination of stress, eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds. The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread. In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’ But today he insisted he never felt like he could not be 'bothered' with the hassle of running the country. 'I’m passionate about this job, it’s a huge honour to do it. I’m putting myself forward for a full term and the British people are my boss and if they want me to do that they’ll vote for me and if they don’t they’ll chuck me out and get somebody else to do the job. 'But it’s an honour to do it. I’m relatively young – at 48. I try to stay relatively fit and healthy. 'I don’t think I’ve gone mad yet although I’m sure that will come.' The Federation of Bakers, fearing others might follow suit, warned the Prime Minister against giving up bread. Director Gordon Polson said: 'To David Cameron, and anyone else who is cutting bread from their diet this January in the hope of losing weight, we urge them not to act so fast. 'Cutting bread from the diet could lead to compromising other essential nutrient intakes, such as fibre, calcium, protein and magnesium. 'For those keeping fit, such as David Cameron who is a keen runner, starchy foods such as bread are crucial for keeping energy levels up. 'Not to mention bread is packed full of dietary fibre, keeping you fuller for longer, which could help Mr Cameron resist the temptation of reaching for that mid-afternoon snack or nibbling between meals.' All politicians fear being asked about the price of a pint of milk or a loaf of bread. None are struggling to make ends meet and few will notice the price as they - or their spouses - order online or whizz around Waitrose. In 2013 David Cameron admitted being unsure about how much a supermarket loaf cost, but then compounded the error by revealing he didn't know because he bakes his own using a bread-making machine. Giving up bread will be a struggle for Mr Cameron who has previously recommended a Panasonic breadmaker and the Cotswold Crunch flour made near his Oxfordshire constituency . The Prime Minister was asked the price of a ‘value’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living. He guessed it was more than £1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘the value stuff’. Instead he uses a £100 breadmaker and a brand of Cotswolds artisan flour which costs around £4.40 a bag. In comparison a 1.5kg bag of Tesco’s own brand flour costs only 65p. Reminded that he was being asked about a value sliced loaf, he said: ‘I don’t buy the value stuff... I’ve got a breadmaker which I delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways.’ He rejected suggestions that making bread at home takes too long, telling LBC radio: ‘You think ahead. A little plug for the flour made in my constituency: The Cotswold Crunch. 'You get some of that – beautifully milled in the Cotswolds – you pop that in your breadmaker. ‘You can set the timer overnight so when you wake up there’s this wonderful smell wafting through your kitchen. It takes 30 seconds to put your ingredients in.’ It is understood the Camerons have the cheapest Panasonic model of breadmaker, which starts at £100.","David Cameron reveals details of his 'cut the carbs and go for a run' regime .

"Missing: While one teenagers in Oklahoma has been charged with the murder of Anne Hill, 16, her body has not been recovered . Nine months after the disappearance and alleged murder of Oklahoma teen, Anne Hill, her parents are pleading for the public's help to find her body. In October, authorities charged 16-year-old Chadd Raymond with first degree murder and Chloe Marie Thomas, 17, with accessory to commit murder, but no trace of the missing teen has since been found. Thomas has allegedly told investigators that Raymond dumped Hill's body with her assistance in a 'wooded area in an unknown location', but claims to not remember exactly where in rural Edmond that place was. Sunday would have been Hill's 17th birthday and PI, Darcie Scoon, coordinator with the Center for Search and Investigation has been charged by her family with finding her body. She says they have already scoured 2,000 rural acres and covered more than 200 miles without success. And last month, the state dropped its charges against Thomas pending another case in juvenile court. Prosecutors allege that Hill, Raymond and Thomas were watching a movie at either Thomas or Raymonds house when Raymond fatally strangled Hill. Thomas has allegedly told investigators that her and Raymond dumped Hill's body in the back seat of her white Chevrolet and drove her to a location she can't remember and dumped the body. Recovery: The Edmond teenager was last seen in April after driving to see a film at a friends house . Campaign: The family of Anne Hill want to find the body of their daughter so that they can bury her nine months after she disappeared . Thomas has reportedly told police they covered the body with sticks and leaves and then left her car abandoned in an Edmond neighborhood. Raymond denies all of this and has entered a plea of not guilty. Scoon has issued a map which reveals where she believes the body could have been dumped and issued the following advisories of where to keep a look out. • Oil or pump site areas in a largely open field; . • Is rural with wooded areas in the perimeter; . • Is in close proximity of a highway — a 5-mile or less drive; . • Has a white building (possibly a house) of some type between the highway and well site; and . • Could possibly be near an exit with a natural or manmade rock formation. (information from the Edmond Sun) Scoon has said that some locations are higher priority than others. Detained: Chadd Raymond, 16, (left) and Chloe Thomas, 17, (right) from Edmond, Oklahoma, were arrested and charged with murder in connection with the disappearance of 16-year-old Anne Hill. Charges against Thomas have since been dropped . Search area: Thomas has allegedly told investigators that Raymond dumped Hill's body with her assistance in a 'wooded area in an unknown location', but claims to not remember exactly where in rural Edmond that place was. The honor student at Casady School in Oklahoma City was reported missing nine months agp from her home in Piedmont after she told her mother she was going to watch a film at a friend's house but never returned. Known to her friends as Annie Jo, she had just received the keys to her first car, a white Chevrolet, and seemed to be upset by an early curfew, so she stopped answering her phone at 11pm the night she vanished. Her car was found in the Edmond, Oklahoma, more a week later when a resident recognized it from a flier that had been handed out in the area. A week after she vanished, her mother Lori Hill told KFOR NewsChannel 4: 'Vivacious, outgoing, never met a stranger,' said Lori Hill in April. 'That's not a kid that's planning on running away. That's not a kid that doesn't want to be with her family. That's my Annie Jo.' While she was missing, her mother also left a voice mail message on her phone which said: 'Anne, I hope that’s you, I love you and miss you. 'I’ll come get you wherever you are, just leave me a message or call your brothers, we all want you home. Anne, I hope it’s you.' River sites: Scoon has issued a map which reveals where she believes the body could have been dumped and issued the following advisories of where to keep a look out.

In a statement, Royal Caribbean said the ‘22-year-old male guest from Oasis of the Seas (pictured) went overboard near Cozumel, Mexico . It is not yet known how the passenger came to be in the water. However, the incident is raising questions over whether cruise ships have the proper technology to detect when someone goes overboard. Disney has credited a combination of passengers and crew from the Magic with spotting the man in the water, lowering a lifeboat, and getting him aboard the Magic. The man was immediately transported to shore for treatment. In a statement, Royal Caribbean said the ‘22-year-old male guest from Oasis of the Seas went overboard near Cozumel, Mexico. ‘He was spotted by a crew member from another cruise ship, and picked up. We are grateful for the other ship's assistance.’ Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said the cruise line has not yet provided additional comment, beyond its statement. Scott Sanders, founder of The Disney Cruise Line Blog, said such a rescue at sea by the Magic crew is unusual. The rescue mission was launched by Disney Magic after passengers and crew spotted someone bobbing in the water . ‘It's pretty darn fortunate that they were sailing in the vicinity,’ said Sanders, whose blog is not affiliated with Disney. Jim Walker, a maritime attorney who reported on the incident on his Cruise Law News website, said the case points out the need for cruise ships to have better monitoring systems for detecting when someone falls off or jumps from a ship. He said systems he would support include motion sensors and thermal detection systems that would indicate if someone goes overboard. After the dramatic rescue, the 22-year-old was immediately taken to shore for traetement . He also favours linking such systems to an alarm notification for crew so that an immediate search-and-rescue operation could begin. The Oasis of the Seas is the world's largest cruise ship, with a capacity of 6,360. The ship — which is based at Port Everglades, near Fort Lauderdale — was on a seven-night cruise to the Western Caribbean when the incident occurred. The vessel has the capacity to house 5,400 passengers and 2,394 crew. It cost £800m and took three years to build in Turku, Finland before it was launched in 2009. At 1,187ft, the Oasis of the Seas is longer than the Shard and wider than Boeing 747.","22-year-old had been a guest on Royal Caribbean ship Oasis of the Seas .

Bridesmaids were decked out in matching orange dresses and clutched small color coordinated bouquets, while the groomsmen were decked out in gray shirts, suspenders and orange bow-ties. Jessa wore a $1598 pale blush gown from Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas, with a fully beaded bodice of Swarovski crystals and pearls. She'd had some of the tulle in the dress removed so it would fall exactly the way she wanted it to.

Welcome to the clan: In another photo, Ben offers his new mother-in-law Michelle Duggar, 48, a restrained hug . Jessa's sister Jinger, 20, acted as maid of honor, and the elegant reception - during which Ben and Jessa finally allowed themselves to be seen locking lips - was decked out with beautiful white roses and peach flowers. Pastor Mike Schadt later discussed the couple's decision to not kiss at the altar to the room full of friends and family. Because no kiss was happening, he asked Jessa's parents to offer the crowd a kiss instead. 'So, now you've seen a Duggar kiss,' Schadt joked. 'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private. It was important to the both of them.'

It was important to the both of them' After posing for photos, the newlyweds then attended their reception where they were cheered on. There was said to be no alcohol and no dancing, in accordance to the family's religious beliefs. One thing that was missing was a wedding cake. 'I don't really like it,' Jessa said. The two decided to go with ice cream sundaes instead. Toppings included chocolate, caramel, candy and cookies. Jessa had chocolate while her spouse enjoyed mint chip. Ben and Jessa left the reception in a horse-drawn carriage as bubbles were blown into the air. Speaking of her modest  wedding dress, Jessa told People last year: 'It was the second dress I tried on. I love it.' Tesori Bridal co-owners Lindsey Stavely and Erin Bridges added they didn't know if she would like it because it wasn't 'traditional white.' Ms Bridges then said, 'She kept coming back to this dress and all her sisters were like, ""the second one, the second one,"" so everyone agreed.' Just so: Jessa had some of the tulle in the dress removed so it would fall exactly the way she wanted it to . All done!

Restraint: There was said to be no alcohol and no dancing at the reception, in accordance to the family's religious beliefs . Joyous: The newlyweds beam as they pose for a post-ceremony photo . The evening before  the wedding, Ben and Jessa reportedly enjoyed a relaxed rehearsal dinner where they ate Frito pie followed by pumpkin pie and apple caramel streusel, and washed it down with iced tea. 'I'm so happy to have so many friends here from so many places,' Jessa apparently said during the evening. 'And I'm so grateful for my parents. Their influence has been so special to me. I look forward to a long, happy, marriage.' Meanwhile Ben added: 'When I look at all the faces surrounding us tonight, I don't know how to thank all of you for investing in our lives, and in our life together. Y'all make us feel so special.' Jessa and Ben, whose one-year courtship was arranged by Jim Bob, got engaged on August 14, planning their wedding in just 11 weeks. Smooch: Since their first kiss at the wedding, Jessa and Ben have evidently been practicing. Jessa posted this snap of the couple to Instagram in November, captioned, 'It's great living with your best friend' Locked down: Jessa and Ben, whose one-year courtship was arranged by Jim Bob, got engaged on August 14, planning their wedding in just 11 weeks . During their courtship they were only allowed to hug from the side - and not have their chests touch, as the Duggar family believes the act would be too sensual. Things moved on to hand-holding after Seewald popped the question. At the time of their engagement, the couple said: 'God has written an amazing story through our courtship, and another chapter has just begun! We are thrilled to see what the future holds.' Since then, Jessa and Ben have been gushing over married life. They received their wedding photos on Christmas Day, with Jessa announcing on Instagram: 'Yay! We just received our entire wedding album. Perfect timing! So excited to share with friends and family over Christmas!' Ben echoed: 'So happy to have just gotten all of our wedding pictures in! I'm SO blessed to be married to the Love of my life! God has greatly blessed me!' Mark Kurowski's Instagram account can be found here.

"A report has revealed how desperate migrants are able to 'shop around' online to find human traffickers willing to take them to Europe. They use social media sites that work like an online travel agent before gangs send them floating across the Mediterranean on lethal scrapyard cargo ships they have bought on the internet. Information gathered from migrants rescued at sea 'confirms that social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are widely used to share information on how to enter the EU illegally,' an EU document reveals. Desperate migrants are able to 'shop around' online to find human traffickers willing to take them to Europe. Pictured are immigrants in Crete after being rescued from a crippled smuggling ship in November . A baby looks out from the window of a bus after disembarking from a crippled freighter carrying hundreds of refugees trying to migrate to Europe, at the coastal Cretan port of Ierapetra, Greece . Details of how migrants are being smuggled in to the continent were compiled by European security experts in a report seen by The Associated Press. The document underscores the ingenuity and flexibility of human traffickers, as Libya's mounting chaos forces them to turn away from the country as the preferred departure point. With thousands of sub-Saharan Africans willing to pay as much as 2,000 euros (about £1,550) for a spot in an overcrowded dinghy - and wealthier Syrians now paying out 9,600 euros (£7,500) for a place aboard a rusty cargo ship - criminal gangs from Turkey are homing in on a share of the profits. Social media is becoming a versatile tool in the hands of migrants and smugglers. Many use members-only Facebook accounts to share information about how to enter the EU illegally and elude authorities once inside. Last week, smugglers sent the Sierra-Leone-flagged Ezadeen at full throttle in rough seas towards the Italian coast with hundreds of people locked inside. Migrants are pictured waiting to disembark from the ship . 'Would-be migrants exchange information that can vary from routes to be used, asylum-related general information, facilitators' contacts and also warnings regarding certain facilitators that usually just take advantage of migrants in order to obtain money from them,'  the EU document says. One Facebook page, with several thousand likes, provides contacts via Viber and WhatsApp to an Istanbul office where secure payments for travel from Turkey to Greece can be made. Another has regularly updated information on travel document requirements in several countries, including Turkey. The Internet is also being used for buying cargo ships that carry migrants across the Mediterranean, according to EU border agency Frontex. It says that More than a thousand migrants were rescued in two incidents in the last few weeks alone. Frontex spokeswoman Izabella Cooper said one of the vessels used last week appears to have been purchased online from a scrapyard. A report suggests about 15 cargo ships with would-be asylum seekers aboard have tried to reach Europe since August . Migrants use social media sites that work like an online travel agent before gangs send them floating across the Mediterranean on lethal scrapyard cargo ships they have bought on the internet . While the smugglers share information online, there is little evidence they work as one gang. The nationalities of crews have often been Russian or Egyptian, and Frontex analysts have been unable to establish any pattern that might link the smugglers to any larger criminal enterprise. 'There is no evidence of these networks being connected. This might just be a new business opportunity that someone has picked up in Turkey,' Cooper told AP. Almost 170,000 people were rescued in the Mediterranean last year, but hundreds died and more are missing. EU border authorities are struggling against opportunistic tactics, such as migrants scuttling boats and throwing motors overboard once they spot a coast guard ship. Under international law, that turns the encounter into a search-and-rescue mission obliging the coast guard to haul the vessel to European shores. Last week, smugglers sent the Sierra-Leone-flagged Ezadeen at full throttle in rough seas towards the Italian coast with hundreds of people locked inside. They then abandoned ship in high seas. A Frontex vessel from Iceland eventually managed to tow the Ezadeen to Italy. 'It's like from the movies. You would never think that ghost ships going on full speed could happen in real life,' Cooper said, 'let alone with more than 360 people on board.'","Migrants are using social media sites that work like an online travel agent .

"One of England's least wanted dogs has finally been rehomed - after almost seven years in kennels. Jed the lurcher was taken in as a four-month-old puppy in 2007, but instead of quickly settling into a new home, Jed spent the next 50 dog years at the rescue centre as he was overlooked by around 17,000 potential suitors. Then, just before Christmas, following a MailOnline appeal, Ian Woodcock and Elizabeth Marsh came forward to give the dog a new home. Ian Woodcock, left, pictured along with a Dogs Trust staff member and Jed the lurcher, centre . Jed the lurcher spent seven years at the Dogs Trust centre in Darlington with Nikki Holroyd, right . Following his good fortune, Jed the lucher, pictured, now lives in Whitby, North Yorkshire . The couple, both 49, travelled to the Dogs Trust Centre in Darlington and fell in love with Jed, adopting the delighted dog. Jed now lives in Whitby, North Yorkshire, and spends his days going for long walks on the moors, sleeping by the fire and playing with his new toy collection. Mr Woodcock, a chemical engineer, said: 'Jed is settling in really well and we absolutely adore him, he is always by my side and we already can't imagine life without him. 'If dogs can have a sense of humour then Jed certainly has one, he is already very attached to my wife and I and he likes to be with us all of the time. 'His new favourite trick involves moving his duvet in front of the door and falling asleep so that we can't leave the room. 'He thoroughly enjoyed his first Christmas as part of the family, especially his favourite roasted bone from the butchers. 'We are really looking forward to the future with Jed, after so long without a home we can't wait to make 2015 as special as possible for him.' One of Jed's favourite places is now lying in front of the fire at his home in Whitby, North Yorkshire . Jed the lurcher, pictured, spends a great deal of his time being walked through the North Yorkshire moors . When Jed was taken in by the Dogs Trust it was hoped that as a young puppy he would quickly find a home. There was interest and a couple of families tried to take him on but on both occasions he had to be returned because he was too energetic. Beverly Watson, rehoming centre assistant manager at Dogs Trust Darlington, said: 'We are so delighted that Jed had finally found such a fantastic home after searching for so many years. 'He is such a character and we all became so attached to him in all the time he was with us, so it really is the best New Year present we could ask for to see how happy he is with Ian and Elizabeth. 'I've worked in animal welfare for ten years and to see Jed get rehomed is undoubtedly one of the highlights. 'It just goes to show there is a happy home out there for every dog in our care and as Dogs Trust never puts a healthy dog down we will make sure they find it however long it takes.'","Jed the lurcher was taken in by the Dogs Trust as a young puppy in 2007 .

"A U.S. police officer has been suspended after telling an African-American suspect he was pursuing that 'You're gonna get your ass shot, boy!'. Seattle police released the dash cam video following a public disclosure request and 'in the interests of fostering better police transparency'. The officer involved was suspended for 15 days. A U.S. police officer has been suspended for 15 days for telling an African-American suspect he was pursuing that 'You're gonna get your ass shot, boy!' The dash cam video shows an officer on foot, left, chasing the offender who is a few meters ahead of him . The suspended officer, who is in the patrol car which recorded the video, closes in on the offender . The clip, from October 7, 2013, shows the officer pursuing an African-American suspect in his patrol car as the man runs through down town Seattle. The offender manages to evade the officer, who turns his car around at one point and chases him along the footpath, as he cackles loudly. He is then heard saying: You're gonna get your ass shot, boy!'. The offender then runs off down an alleyway before the officer catches him in his patrol car. He is then heard telling the man to 'stop' and 'back up' before yelling an expletive at him. Half a dozen other officers then turn up to help arrest the man, who repeatedly tells his arresting officer than he is complying with his instructions, and to 'calm down'. He then turns and runs in the opposite direction, the officer than cackles loudly before warning him that he risked getting 'your ass shot' The offender eventually stops after being chased down the alleyway by the officer in the car . Seattle police said they did not receive any complaints from the public about the arrest, and released the video 'in the interests of fostering better police transparency' Seattle police did not say what crime the man had committed, but an officer can be overheard on the video talking about 'locating the female victim'. Before the video plays, Seattle police explain that 'no public complaint' ever surfaced about the incident. A front line supervisor had raised concerns with his mangers, the video explained, and the officer involved was then investigated by the office of Professional Accountability. The video goes on to say that the Seattle police department 'implemented a new bias free policing program' that was mandatory for all officers, and issued a new 'bias free policing policy'. 'The department is committed to constitutional and equitable policing for all of Seattle's residents', the video said.","The suspect is seen running from police in down town Seattle .

"Town halls have spent tens of millions of pounds rehiring staff they had made redundant, it was reported last night. Much of the cash has gone on agency social workers but an increasing amount is paid to interim managers and consultants, who can earn £1,000 a day. Some have returned after receiving big redundancy packages. Birmingham City Council headquarters: The local authority topped the list of councils who spent the most on agency and consultancy workers since 2010-2011, with £155million spent since that financial year . An investigation by The Times revealed that dozens of authorities have spent more than £50million on agency and consultancy workers since 2010-11, with five spending more than £100million. The total figure spent on such workers over that period is £5billion. The peak was in 2013-14 when more than £1.2 billion was spent. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of Taxpayers Alliance, said: ‘This [£5billion] is a scandalous figure and one that needs to be justified. 'Scandalous': Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of Taxpayers Alliance, said the councils must stop the revolving door of rehiring redundant workers . ‘There have been all sorts of promises about bringing the cost of administering down. Taxpayers will be particularly concerned at the number of former employees re-employed on more expensive contracts. The lucrative revolving door needs to rapidly come to a halt.’ A freedom of information requested by The Times revealed that the biggest councils, the counties and London boroughs were among the worst offenders. Birmingham City Council topped the list, spending £155 million since 2010-11, followed by Essex County Council on £133.5million and Kent County Council on £127million. Seventeen London boroughs also spent between £50million and £125million on agency and consultancy staff. Louise Tibbert, president of the Public Sector People Management Association and head of HR at Hertfordshire county council, said that social workers often went back to councils where they had worked before, but this was also the case for higher-paid staff. She said: ‘Many go to the private sector for better pay in legal, finance and HR or general management roles. There is a big chance that local government will pay the same for them to come back as consultants.’ Over the past five years councils have had their budgets slashed by more than £20billion and lost more than 400,000 jobs. Some councils have been forced to close or reduce a range of services including road maintenance, street cleaning and home care for elderly after having their central funding slashed by almost 40 per cent since 2010. Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, said that too many jobs were cut too quickly in search for early big savings and councils had found that they could not provide their services without bringing the staff back.","Freedom of Information requests revealed how much was spent .

"The devastating bushfires which swept across parts of South Australia and Victoria in recent weeks have left many native animals burnt, orphaned and homeless. After an appeal last week the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) were inundated with mittens for koalas who had their paws scorched in the fires, but now it's the little joeys who need help. Many joeys, some very young, have been left injured and without their mothers and so wildlife carers need pouches they can keep the native animals warm and safe in. Scroll down for video . The International Fund for Animal Welfare are appealing for cotton pouches to care for joeys left injured and orphaned from the bushfires . The little guy is one of many joeys burnt in the devastating bushfires in the Adelaide Hills region . 'It's not just koalas that have been affected by these fires,' Josey Sharrad from IFAW told Daily Mail Australia. She said kangaroos, wallabies, possums and many other species had also been severely affected by the out-of-control infernos and so Project Pouch was launched. 'Vets and wildlife carers use very simple cotton pouches to keep these animals warms,' Ms Sharrad said. Project Pouch asks supporters to sew simple cotton pouches so wildlife carers can carry the native animals in them . 'The good thing about the pouches is that wildlife carers use these pouches all year around.' Those caring for the injured or orphaned native animals can go through up to six pouches a day she added, and so it is important for there to be a stockpile of them. Many of the joeys also had their feet and paws scorched in the blaze and so they've been wrapped up in bandages to help their injuries heal. Many kangaroos have been left with bad burns on their paws and legs leaving them in bandages to heal . A vet tends to a kangaroo's injuries sustained in the Adelaide Hills fire, and the joey is expected to make a full recovery . The pattern for people wishing to sew pouches is available on the IFAW website, and there are five different sizes the organisation is appealing for. IFAW has asked the members of the Australian public send the pouches to their Sydney office, but despite receiving mittens from Europe, the UK, Germany, China and many other parts of the world have suggested international donors sit this one out. Anyone outside of Australia who still wishes to support these little joeys can donate on the organisation's website, or support one of the local initiatives IFAW is conducting closer to home. The cotton pouches are also used to care for other native wildlife such as possums and wombats .","Many kangaroo joeys have been left injured and orphaned by the bushfires .

"A former New York financier found guilty of earning almost a million dollars from insider trading, who famously bolted from a press pack and lost his flip-flops, is hoping to become a North Dakota truck driver. Michael Lucarelli, 52, pleaded guilty to a federal securities fraud charge last September and now hopes to begin a new life on the open road, driving trucks, it's been reported. It's understood that he is working towards earning a truck driver's licence while living in North Dakota with his brother. However, he may not realise his dream as he faces several years in jail and may have to pay back almost $900,000 that he obtained fraudulently. On the run: Michael Lucarelli was found guilty of earning almost a million dollars from insider trading - he famously bolted from a press pack in Auugust 2014 and lost his flip-flops. He hopes to become a North Dakota truck driver . Michael Lucarelli, 52, pleaded guilty to a federal securities fraud charge last September . A sentencing memo said he expects 'to be licensed and to drive tractor trailers', according to the New York Daily News. It also said he 'will never again trade another stock or work in any stock related field'. Mr Lucarelli was ridiculed last August when he ran from media waiting for him outside a court in New York following a hearing for his case. He ran out of his sandals racing down the sidewalk in a tank top and slacks, earning him a mocking 'Moment of Zen' on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart. In a September hearing he described his crime to U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, Lucarelli apologized and paused briefly to cry. After Mr Lucarelli lost his sandals while running from the press he was mocked on the Daily Show With Jon Stewart . One of Mr Lucarelli's sandals that got left behind last August when he ran from the press . He had used non-public information from drafts of press releases to earn nearly a million dollars. He said long hours at Manhattan-based investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates Inc., where he was director of market intelligence, his failure to take vacation for two years and complications from Crohn's disease that led to a dependence on  cocaine, were in part to blame for his illegal trading over the last year. He said commissions for his work sometimes were not paid in a timely manner. 'Fueled by anger at not getting paid and a dependence on drugs, I made a serious mistake,' Lucarelli said. He added that it was the first time he had run afoul of the law in his quarter of a century in the business. 'I apologize to the court for my decision to trade on material nonpublic information,' he said. 'I wasn't strong enough to resist. I'm very remorseful.' The judge asked several questions about the trades he carried out in the securities of 13 of the firm's clients. 'Because of the physical pain and the dependence on drugs, I can't remember,' he said in one answer. In a release, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in September: 'For using his company's and clients' secrets for his own personal gain, he now faces time in federal prison and the forfeiture of over $900,000 that he unlawfully obtained.' His attorney Patrick W. McGinley said Lucarelli has no money and will await sentencing at the home of his brother in North Dakota. The lawyer said his client has 'no ability to live here anymore.' He is due for sentencing next month and could face up to four years in jail.","Michael Lucarelli pleaded guilty to a fraud charge last September .

"Employees at a Texas industrial plant where four died of toxic poisoning last November may have been exposed to potentially deadly gas for years, new findings suggest. State records obtained by the Houston Chronicle indicate that the DuPont factory in La Porte, Houston, reported regular malfunctions with its multimillion-dollar exhaust and ventilation systems in 2009 and 2010 but nothing was done to resolve the problem. Based on these disclosures, it's believed that factory staff could have been subjected to dangerous levels of methyl mercaptan - a sulphurous-smelling colorless gas which can irritate the skin, eyes and lungs. Employees at a Texas industrial plant where four died of toxic poisoning last November may have been exposed to potentially deadly gases for years, new findings suggest . Repeated exposure may cause damage to the liver and kidneys or affect the blood cells causing anemia. High levels can cause loss of consciousness and death. As much as 600 parts per million of methyl mercaptan an hour could have filled a poorly ventilated room at the DuPont facility, according to estimations. But federal guidelines say workers shouldn't be exposed to more than an average of 10 ppm per day of the gas, which is used to manufacture crop-protection products such as insecticides and fungicides. Four employees at the DuPont plant died after being exposed to methyl mercaptan during a hazardous leak on November 15. A fifth worker was hospitalized and later released after being held for observation. Jeff Suggs, emergency management coordinator for La Porte, said the chemical release was not toxic for those living nearby, but that it caused a smell that's similar to rotten eggs. State records obtained by the Houston Chronicle indicate that the DuPont factory in La Porte, Houston, reported regular malfunctions with its multimillion-dollar exhaust and ventilation systems in 2009 and 2010 but nothing was done to resolve the problem . Federal officials and the state agency are still investigating the incident. DuPont declined to comment on its workers' potentially prolonged exposure to the gas in light of the new findings. 'Considering individual issues in isolation or speculating can lead to inaccurate conclusions,' DuPont spokesman Aaron Woods said. 'DuPont is committed to maintaining the integrity of ongoing investigations. To that end, it is premature for us to comment or provide additional information outside of these processes.' The La Porte plant has more than 300 DuPont employees. Four other companies are also tenants at the complex.","Newly-obtained state recordsindicate that the DuPont factory in La Porte, Houston, reported regular malfunctions with its ventilation systems .

"The widower of right-to-die advocate Brittany Maynard has spoken of his wife's final hours with terminal brain cancer, saying a seizure reinforced her decision to take her own life later that day. Speaking on The Meredith Vieira Show, Dan Diaz, 43, said his 29-year-old spouse had already decided to  take a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home  to end months of suffering. But he said a 'small seizure' she suffered on the morning of November 1 - the planned date of her death - reminded her of the painful and downhill struggle she was facing if she chose not to do so. 'It was a reminder of what she was risking because what was coming next was losing her eyesight, becoming paralyzed, inability to speak and she’d be essentially trapped in her own body,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Opening up: Dan Diaz (pictured), 43, the grieving widower of Brittany Maynard, has spoken of his wife's final hours with terminal brain cancer, saying a 'seizure' reinforced her decision to take her own life later that day . Couple: Speaking on The Meredith Vieira Show, Mr Diaz said his 29-year-old spouse had already decided to take a lethal dose of drugs - prescribed by her doctor - at her Oregon home to end months of suffering . Reminder: But he said a 'small seizure' she suffered on the morning of November 1 - the planned date of her death - reminded her of the painful struggle she was facing if she chose not to do so. Above, Miss Maynard . In the hours after the seizure, Mr Diaz said he and Miss Maynard both slept in until 9am. They then collected their pet dogs and joined their friends and family for a hike near their home, he said. 'We got back to the house and she just knew it was her time,' he added. Miss Maynard, who was diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer - last January and given six months to live, took her own life that evening. She passed away in her husband's arms and surrounded by her family and friends at her Portland home, the Oregon-based group Compassion & Choices said at the time. Speaking of his acceptance of his wife's decision to die, Mr Diaz explained: 'You don’t want to let go of your loved one but to suggest that she should suffer for me, for anyone, no. 'That’s what you struggle with - here’s the person I love and I don’t want to see her go.' Television appearance: In the hours after the seizure, Mr Diaz said he and Miss Maynard both slept in until 9am. They then collected their pet dogs and joined their friends and family for a hike near their home, he said . 'We got back to the house and she just knew it was her time,' Mr Diaz (pictured) told The Meredit Vieria Show . He added that Miss Maynard had never questioned taking a lethal concoction of drugs to end her life, despite reports at the time suggesting that she may be having second thoughts. Many of these reports cited videos and photos in which Miss Maynard appeared to be in good spirits. 'The weeks leading up to Brittany’s death, her symptoms were getting bad,' he told the show, which will air later this week. 'Those videos were taped 2 weeks before, 3 weeks before. 'Brittany’s seizures were getting worse, they were getting more intense, they were becoming more frequent. The pain she was feeling, the discomfort, the headaches and when those seizures hit. 'There was one instance where we had to go to the hospital. She couldn’t speak for four hours, and the last seizure she had was the most horrific and scary for her. Bucket list wish: Miss Maynard (seen with Mr Diaz at the Grand Canyon weeks before her death,  passed away in her husband's arms and surrounded by her family and friends at her Portland home . Happier times: Miss Maynard was diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer - last January and given six months to live. Above, she and Mr Diaz on their wedding day . 'Unfortunately, that video, just because of when it came out it gave the impression, ""oh, well she looks healthy"", but that was not the case whatsoever. Her health was deteriorating daily.' On the day of her death, Miss Maynard posted an emotional message to her loved ones and supporters via Facebook. It read: 'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. 'Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more. 'The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type. 'Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' In the weeks leading up to her death - committed under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act - Miss Maynard hit headlines around the world and became the face of the  right-to-die movement. Fulfiling her dreams: Miss Maynard is pictured with her mother at the Grand Canyon - one of her dying wishes . In an interview with People, which will feature in the magazine's Friday edition, Mr Diaz said life in the wake of his wife's death often feels lonely, saying: 'I have good days and bad days.' He added: 'The feeling of loss is always there – particularly in the morning when I first wake up. And at night, when the house is quiet and I'm just there with the dogs. I think about her every day.' On the cover he beams in a photo with his late wife, taken three weeks before her death . Mr Diaz, who remains on leave from his job as a senior manager in the food industry, is now focused on fulfilling a promise he made to Miss Maynard to help get right-to-die laws passed nationwide. His efforts are starting with the couple's home state of California, which they moved away from following Miss Maynard's diagnosis in a bid to allow her to end her own life legally in Oregon. Mr Diaz's full interview with The Meredith Vieira Show' will air on January 14.

"A recently published study has found that police equipped with body cameras reduced their use of force by around 50 percent and complaints by the public against them dropped by almost 90 percent. The startling figures were revealed as part of a research study conducted by the University of Cambridge and was based on a 12-month trial conducted among 1,000 officers in Rialto, California. The dramatic results have led to a clamor across the country from police chiefs keen to equip their officers with cameras, especially in light of increased community tensions toward perceived police brutality, caused by the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The year-long study which began in 2012 had its findings published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology in November and answered the hotly debated topic of whether cameras could reduce police force and, crucially, the number of complaints filed by the public. Scroll down for video . Nationwide initiatives: New York Police Department (NYPD) Officer Joshua Jones wears a body camera during a mock traffic stop to demonstrate how the cameras will be used during a press conference on December 3, 2014 in New York City . 'This is a promising tool for police officcers, which is likely to be a game changer not only for the professionalization of policing, but in terms of police-public relations,' said Dr. Barak Ariel, the lead author of the study and a lecturer in Experimental Criminology at the University of Cambridge in England. Speaking to Newsweek magazine, Dr. Ariel pointed to the fact that his findings and body cameras could be a salve for frayed police relations with the public. The LAPD now plans to equip 7,000 of its officers with body cameras and the NYPD and Chicago police forces are planning similar trials. Indeed with the shooting by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City, protests sparked against police brutality across the country. The anger in these two cases was exacerbated by the failure of a grand jury to indict the officers involved, despite Garner's police incident being recorded on cellphone. Then, on November 22, a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio, shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice after the boy was caught waving a BB gun around a public park. Many law enforcement officials support cameras' use and say they are effective. The police department in Rialto, California, found after a yearlong University of Cambridge study last year that the cameras led to an 89 percent drop in complaints against officers and an almost 50 percent drop in police force . Anger: Protesters walking down a New York City street in reaction to the failure of a grand jury to indict a police officer for the chokehold death of loose cigarette seller, Eric Garner . Pointing to the trust-building effects of the cameras, the study wrote, 'The use of force by police, particularly if excessive, has a lasting effect on public perceptions of police and police community relations......and can potentially tarnish their relationship with the community.' The study by the University of Cambridge's Institute of Criminology began in February 2012 with the Rialto, California police department. They serve 100,000 people and 1,000 police were assigned body cameras randomly, while others did not wear them as a control for the study. Each camera weighs around a quarter of a pound and carries batteries that last up to 12 hours. Once the shift was over, the camera's video was reviewed and the researchers concluded that officers not wearing the cameras used force roughly less than 50 percent than if they were not. The study's authors believe this is because they were aware of beig filmed. Fury: Officer Darren Wilson stands over the body of Michael Brown - the unarmed black teenager shot dead in August of last year . 'With institutionalized body-worn-camera use, an officer is obliged to issue a warning from the start that an encounter is being filmed, impacting the psyche of all involved by conveying a straightforward, pragmatic message: we are all being watched, videotaped and expected to follow the rules,' said Dr. Ariel to Newsweek. 'Police subcultures of illegitimate force responses are likely to be affected by the cameras, because misconduct cannot go undetected — an external set of behavioural norms is being applied and enforced through the cameras,' he says. 'Police-public encounters become more transparent and the curtain of silence that protects misconduct can more easily be unveiled, which makes misconduct less likely.' While the researchers could not be sure whether the cameras affected the behavior of both police and the public, the reduction in use of force and complaints was stark. Police body cameras have become a rallying cry in the wake of racially charged decisions by grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City, but experts caution that increased use of the devices may raise more questions than answers. Often what is filmed may appear excessive to a person unfamiliar with police work, even though the conduct may be legal. 'There's this saying in policing: 'It's lawful, but awful.' It's technically legal to do that, but it's a terrible thing to do ... We have to work on the awful piece, that's what we need to focus on,' said Jim Bueermann, who heads the nonprofit Police Foundation. Officers in one of every six departments around the country now patrol with tiny cameras on their chests, lapels or sunglasses. And President Barack Obama wants to spend $74 million to equip another 50,000 with them around the country. Tensions: Protesters are pushed back by police on August 19, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. Violent outbreaks took place in Ferguson after the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown . A camera captured a white New York police officer applying a chokehold that led to the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. In Ferguson, Missouri, there was no camera showing what happened when a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, a black man. In both cases, grand juries declined to indict the officers. Many law enforcement officials support cameras' use and say they are effective. The police department in Rialto, California, found after a yearlong University of Cambridge study last year that the cameras led to an 89 percent drop in complaints against officers, possibly reining in misbehavior on the part of the public and officers as well as ultimately limiting department liability. 'If it were up to me, every officer walking around in a uniform would be wearing a body camera,' said Martin J. Mayer, a California-based attorney who has defended law enforcement agencies for more than 40 years. Most civil libertarians support their expansion despite concerns about the development of policies governing their use and their impact on privacy. Rank-and-file officers worry about being constantly under watch, or that an errant comment may be used by a supervisor to derail their careers. Officers, however, generally have the law on their side. A 1989 U.S. Supreme Court case concluded that claims an officer used excessive force must be judged by whether the officer's actions were ' 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them' at the time. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio holds up a body camera that the New York Police Department (NYPD) will begin using during a press conference on December 3, 2014 in New York City . With video evidence, 'we're being forced to confront exactly what these legal standards mean,' said Peter Bibring, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California. 'It provides the public a much better foundation to draw their own conclusions about what police are actually doing, and whether they believe it's appropriate.' Mayer said that in most states the penal code allows officers to use 'the amount of force necessary to repel and overcome' force used by an individual. 'It's not just to match. It's to overcome it,' he said. Camera footage provides an independent record from the officer's perspective and tangible evidence that cannot be changed, unlike often malleable and faulty eyewitness accounts, experts say. But video is limited, only showing what's in front of it after the camera is turned on. That allows for interpretation and ambiguity that can inflame the public, regardless of what the law allows. 'At the end of the day, if people don't like the lack of an indictment, then they have to look at what the legal standard is in these cases. Sometimes that's the law,' Bueermann said.","Year-long study conducted by University of Cambridge with police in Rialto, California .

"An advertisement from 1987 predicting the future prices of groceries, airfares and property has surfaced online exposing its hilariously incorrect calculations. The pamphlet advertising superannuation in South Australia features a list of items comparing their 1987 price with 'what they will cost' in 2010. Some of the predictions grossly overestimated the price of items - including $99.81 movie tickets for two, $1086.22 for a kid's bicycle and $8807.19 return airfares to London. A 1987 pamphlet advertising superannuation in South Australia has surfaced online . It compares prices between 1987 and 2010, with some grossly overestimated predictions including $8807.19 return airfares to London . Current prices for those items sit at $40 for movie tickets, kid's bikes for $100-$200 and flights from Adelaide to London for about $2000. Other predictions were way under the mark - including a first home for $293,573.18. The Real Estate Institute of SA said median house prices in 2010 were $406,000 in Adelaide and $379,000 South Australia-wide. The ad posted to Reddit, which was released before the Keating government introduced compulsory superannuation in 1992, aims to get people to invest more money in their super accounts. Other predictions were way under the mark - including a first home for $293,573.18 . The list predicted it would $1086.22 for a kid's bicycle, based on an average inflation rate of 8 per cent a year . 'If you want a reasonable lifestyle by the time you retire, now is the time to act,' the pamphlet reads. 'These figures are not ""pie-in-the-sky""; they are based on an average inflation rate of 8% a year – which has been the figure for the past 20 years.' The ad assumes that inflation is the only thing that will have an impact on the price of items, but fails to predict a number of other influences. The housing bubble saw property prices rise at an even higher rate, while increased competition in the airline industry has kept travel prices relatively low. The price of a 'family saloon car' or sedan was estimated to rise to $105,686 – whereas a person can easily purchase that type of car for $20,000-$25,000 . The ad assumes that inflation is the only thing that will have an impact on the price of items, but fails to predict a number of other influences . Other incorrect predictions include a taxi fare from Adelaide to Dulwich for $26.42, with the current price actually sitting between $11 and $16. The price of a 'family saloon car' or sedan was estimated to rise to $105,686 – whereas a person can easily purchase that type of car for $20,000-$25,000. The chart also predicted the pension would rise to $623.54 for singles and $1039.83 for couples. In 2010, the pension actually sat at $701.10 for singles and $1057 for couples. Some prices, such as a $35.22 bottle of wine and a $7.63 tram fare to Glenelg, were not so far off the mark.","Pamphlet advertising superannuation in South Australia surfaced online .

"It was a diet forced upon families during the Second World War. But one Forties fanatic is planning on living off food rationing for a month to mark the 75th anniversary of its introduction in the UK. Louise Rhucroft, from Acklam, Middlesbrough, will be living off forgotten dishes such as Woolton pie, mince slices and corn beef pie to raise money for the Royal British Legion. Scroll down for video . Louise Rhucroft is following a strict rationed diet for four weeks to mark 75 years since the introduction of rationing on January 8. She is hoping to raise money for The Royal British Legion . The 34-year-old is only buying food that was allowed in a 1940s ration book . A typical day's food intake during this month would be oatmeal and water with a touch of sugar for breakfast; soup, stew or left overs from the night before for lunch and something substantial such as pie for dinner. 100g of bacon and ham . 450g of meat . 50g of butter . 50g of cheese . 100g of margarine . 100g of cooking fat . Three pints of milk . 112g of preserves (450 to last whole month) 1 shell egg (to last whole month) 225g sugar . 50g of tea . 87g of sweets (350g to last whole month) The 34-year-old, who started the project on January 8, starts her day with oatmeal with water, followed by leftovers for lunch and a hefty pie for tea. And one of the unexpected benefits of sticking to a rations' diet has been the cost of Louise's shopping - which has dropped to just £10 a week. She said: 'I have always wanted to do it. 'I am obsessed with the 1940s and 1950s.  I decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at Christmas. Louise admits she used to 'buy everything going' but realised the huge difference in lifestyles when she watched a wartime programme on TV. 'I watched the BBC Wartime Farm Christmas special and saw how they came together as a community. It is so different how we used to do Christmas,' she said. 'It has made me realise how much money I waste on food. I have hardly spent anything. 'I am so used to convenience and just grabbing something out of the freezer or ringing for a takeaway. 'I feel 10 times better for it. I don't think I want to go back to eating as much as I used to, but I am looking forward to having something stodgy and a glass of wine. Forgotten dishes such as Woolton pie, mince slices and corn beef pie, feature heavily in her meals . The occupational therapist prepares wartime meals like bean medley (left) and corn beef hash (right) Louise got 2015 off to a good start by using her 16-point monthly allowance to buy a tin of corned beef and ditching the alcohol - which was hard to come by in those days. The challenge has meant that she must concentrate her allowances - a tin of Spam would cost eight points - although that hasn't seen her lacking for food. Rations for the month have included meat, butter, cheese, margarine, cooking fat, milk, sugar, preserves, tea, eggs and sweets. And while at first glance the list might not look that bad, Ms Rhucroft's 50 grams of cheese and three pints of milk have to last her a week. Ms Rhucroft says she 'decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at Christmas' Ms Rhucroft said: 'I have had the good, old corned beef, but I have avoided the Spam so far. 'I have also eaten a lot of vegetables and a lot of soup.' So far, her favourite meal has been fish cakes in which she uses  cod, mashed potato a carrot and half a rasher of bacon to make. The bean medley - made up mainly of 84 grams haricot beans, a teaspoon of treacle, 141 grams of mixed vegetables and 14 grams of chopped bacon - is her worst meal. 'I hate baked beans, so I don't know why I thought I would give it a try,' she said. 'But in those days you would not have been able to waste it, so I have fought my way through, even if I hated eating it.' Louise will be continuing with her challenge until 29 January.To donate, visit www.justgiving.com/Louise-Rhucroft1. Baked fish cakes with leeks and cabbage .

"Two men are accused of handling £100,000 taken from women who were snared by an 'elaborate and cruel' dating scam and a separate swindle that promised large fake lottery wins. Sufyan Yesufu, of Bristol, allegedly received more than £7,000 belonging to a woman taken in by a fraudster she met on dating website eHarmony who was persuaded to send money to Nigerian bank accounts. He is also accused of handling tens of thousands of pounds from two American women who were duped by the promise of a fake lottery win. Samuel Hukporti, of Sheffield, is also said to have received cash from one of the victims. They are both accused of handling money which had been obtained by 'elaborate and cruel deceptions' by the promise of love or great wealth. Two men are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of handling and receiving money obtained from women who were duped in three separate frauds - one involving an online dating swindle and the other a lottery scam . Neither man is accused of carrying out the three separate frauds directly but are thought to have been part of 'various arrangements made to receive, distribute and spend' the money. Denise Richards, from Australia, was the victim of the first fraud. Ms Richards was 56 when she struck up an online romance with ‘Charles Carroll’ on dating website eHarmony. ‘They corresponded by email at first and then they started to speak over the telephone,’ Thomas Payne, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey. ‘Ms Richards was totally taken in by Charles and she told him on numerous occasions that she loved him. ‘Charles emphasised to Ms Richards that he was a wealthy man and was working in London for an oil company and was owed approximately $2.5m for work he was doing for them.’ But 'Charles' soon started demanding money, saying he needed a $6,000 for a barrister to help retrieve his unpaid wages and $12,000 for an ‘access code’ to his bank account. Ms Richards, who lived in New South Wales, was asked to send thousands to four men in Nigeria. ‘Among the people who received money from Ms Richards was the defendant Mr Yesufu,’ said Mr Payne, who told the court she sent the equivalent of £7,611.60 to him. A laptop seized from Yesufu’s Bristol home had photographs of paperwork from the transfer, the jury was told. One of the women, of Australia, was duped by a man she met through online dating website eHarmony . The other two cases concern a fake lottery scam, where two women were duped to send over cash to release large sums of money they had supposedly won. Adelle Allen, of California, received a letter ‘out of the blue’ saying she had won $715,810 in the Spanish National Lottery. Excited at the prospect of the win, Ms Allen started pouring thousands of dollars into releasing the promised winnings, which she was told increased to over a million dollars, jurors heard. Yesufu is said to have received £71,094.03 in money transfers made between 4 October 2006 and 17 May 2007. Hukporti claimed £14,284.53 on 23 October 2007 from the victim, jurors heard. The cash was deposited into bank accounts with little to no cash in them and spent or withdrawn rapidly after the transfers, the court heard. Mr Payne added: ‘In fact she hadn’t won anything at all, this was just a cruel ruse to trick her into handing over money... ‘The fact is that poor Ms Allen was taken in by it and, in the hope of claiming her winnings, she parted with a substantial sum of her own money and all for nothing.’ He added: ‘In this case the defence do not dispute that the sums Ms Allen was tricked into handing over are criminal property because they were the proceeds of a fraud.’ Grace James, of Virginia, was also fooled into sending thousands to Yesufu, the court heard. Ms James received an email informing her she had won £4.5m in the National Lottery and was instructed to set up a bank account to receive her winnings, sending thousands overseas to unlock her prize, including £25,000 to Yesufu. Mr Payne added: ‘A sad and familiar picture emerges. ‘She took out loans to raise the money and has been left in a parlous financial position.' Mr Payne said the case concerns three separate frauds where people were duped into sending large sums which were transferred to bank accounts controlled by different people, including Hukporti and Yesufu. He added: ‘In each case the defendants were the recipients of sums of money obtained from people who were the victims of elaborate and cruel deceptions. ‘The victims were snared by promises of great wealth or love and were induced to part with huge sums of money.' Yesufu, of Bristol denies three counts of acquiring criminal property and a single charge of entering into a money laundering arrangement. Hukporti, of Sheffield, denied a single count of acquiring criminal property.

"Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos has denied punching a TOWIE star, claiming she remained calm during a confrontation in which he insulted her mentally ill mother, a court has heard. Contostavlos, 26, is currently attempting to overturn a conviction for assaulting Savvas Morgan - who posted a link to a sex tape of her on his website - at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The singer was convicted last summer of punching Mr Morgan in the face at the August 2013 V Festival. Contostavlos (pictured) claims celebrity blogger and TOWIE star Savvas Morgan insulted her mentally ill mother during a confrontation in 2013. She is now appealing a conviction for assaulting him . According to Mr Morgan, Contostavlos had a grudge against him since he published a link to a sex tape leaked by her ex-boyfriend rapper Justin Edwards in 2012. But today Contostavlos insisted she remained calm during the ‘kerfaffle’ while Mr Morgan labelled her a ‘b****’ and a ‘s***.’ Contostavlos said she asked Mr Morgan 'diplomatically' to stop following her 15-strong entourage as they headed towards her Winnebago at the festival for a party. Mr Morgan was a celebrity blogger and was trying to talk to former Sugababe Mutya Buena, a friend of Contostavlos. Contostavlos said she pointed out to Mr Morgan he was not invited. ‘I became aware of Vas (Mr Morgan) because he came and spoke to Mutya. We had been standing next to each other walking,’ she said. ‘I think I made a bit of space between us and after the conversation I warned her off from him, saying he sold people stories about celebrities. ‘We were going back to the Winnebago and, because the festival was finished [for the night,] I hoped he was leaving. ‘He continued to follow us to the opening of the Winnebago area. The people going into that area were only going there for one reason; to come back to mine. There was nowhere else he could have been going. ‘I turned around and said something along the lines of “right stop, turn around, you are not following me”.' Contostavlos is attempting to overturn a conviction for punching celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan (pictured) Contostavlos denied storming up to Mr Morgan aggressively, explaining she only needed to turn around to confront him. She said she told him to ‘go away in a ‘calm’ and ‘diplomatic’ manner. ‘I was calm and relaxed until his instant reaction, which was aggressive. I didn’t want to get into an argument or confrontation, she said. Contostavlos told the court Mr Morgan became aggressive, moving towards her and using abusive language. He called her a ‘s***,’ ‘w****,’ ‘a nobody’ and went on to insult her mentally ill mother, it was said. Contostavlos admitted using terms such as ‘b******’ and ‘d***head,’ but said she kept her hands behind her back during the incident. The scuffle, which lasted around four minutes, escalated when Contostavlos’ personal assistant Gareth Varey confronted Mr Morgan. Eventually Contostavlos was led away by her tour manager towards the Winnebago as the argument continued. Mr Morgan was left with a swollen eye after the incident. Contostavlos claimed it was out of character for her to argue and was adamant she did not become violent. She described herself as a ‘fighter’ - but only emotionally. Contostavlos claimed Mr Morgan once turned up outside her hotel room in Los Angeles and also appeared unexpectedly to her 23rd birthday party. She was convicted of punching Mr Morgan at V Festival on 25 July 2014, leaving him with ‘swelling’ for the next 48 hours. Gareth Varey, Contostavlos's assistant, who was a dancer on a 2010 N-Dubz tour, told how he ran over to Mr Morgan when he saw him 'towering over' the singer. 'They [Contostavlos and Mr Morgan] were in a heated argument and I heard her saying: ""Stop following me."" 'They were face-to-face, but what made me panic was how Vas was towering over her. People started walking towards them both as the voices raised in volume. I ran over but slipped because it had been raining - by this time he was screaming all sorts of things at her.' Mr Morgan called Contostavlos a 's***,' a 's***' and mentioned her sex tape, Mr Varey claimed. 'He was referencing various ludicrous claims about her financial situation, and even said he would ruin her,' Mr Varey added. 'He said this aggressively and loudly, it was very heated. 'It was a war of words.' Tulisa Contostavlos (pictured centre) has denied punching celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan during a confrontation at the 2013 V Festival. Here she is pictured leaving Snaresbrook Crown Court . Mr Varey insisted that neither he nor Contostavlos had hit Mr Morgan. He continued: 'Tulisa and I are mature enough to have an argument and not hit somebody, he claimed. Everybody has their day-to-day arguments without launching themselves at someone.' Contostavlos claims Mr Morgan had only become famous off the back of the animosity between the two and added it was the only reason he got a job on ITV3’s reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. Following her conviction, the singer was was fined £200, and ordered to pay £100 compensation and a £20 victim surcharge, as well as £2,700 towards prosecution costs. Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, north London, is appealing one count of assault. The hearing continues.

"Corporate manslaugher; Alan Catterall, 54, was burned to death at work when the door slammed shut on the industrial oven he was cleaning . A factory supervisor's widow has hailed a 'landmark' verdict of corporate manslaughter after her husband was burned to death inside an industrial oven at work. Relatives of Alan Catterall, 54, wept as plastic kayak manufacturer Pyranha Mouldings became one of the first companies in the country to be convicted of the charge following a five week trial. Mr Catterall's widow, Pearl, said: 'I am definitely happy with the verdict and hopefully it is a landmark for other cases like this.' 'But it does not change the fact that Alan is no longer with us and his family miss him desperately. He has missed his son’s wedding and birth of his grandson and will not see his two daughters marry. 'Alan was a hard-working, conscientious man and he gave Pyranha Mouldings everything. It hurts that they have not admitted any failings in their health and safety procedures.' Mr Catterall died after he was trapped inside the industrial oven at the company's factory in Premier Point, Runcorn, Cheshire, on December 23, 2010. The father-of-three from Halewood, Liverpool, had gone inside to clean molten plastic escaping from a mould while the oven was switched off after a fault developed. But when the fault was repaired his colleague Mark Francis turned the power, causing the doors to slam shut and lock from the outside. In a cruel twist, Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter. During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said no-one realised Mr Catterall was trapped inside the oven until smoke started seeping out and the 'horrific' circumstances of his death discovered. 'The design of the oven was such that the moment it was switched on the doors automatically shut and coked with metal pins which dropped into place on the outside,' Mr Thomas said. 'Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven. There was no means of escape and no means of raising the alarm.' As the temperature soared, Mr Catterall desperately tried to prise open the oven door with a crowbar but could not do so. His shouts for help were drowned out by the din of the noisy factory. The court heard he died after suffering severe burns and shock. Pyranha Mouldings was found guilty by a majority verdict of 10-2 and unanimously convicted of two health and safety breaches. Technical director Peter Mackereth, 60, of Iso Vivoid, Llangollen, North Wales, was unanimously found guilty of two health and safety breaches. He was responsible for health and safety at the factory. High Court judge, Mr Justice McDuff, adjourned sentence for financial reports and will pass sentence in Leeds at a date to be fixed. The oven where Mr Catterall died: As the temperature soared, Mr Catterall desperately prise open the oven door with a crowbar but could not do so. His shouts for help were drowned out by the din of the noisy factory . Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years. He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company - which had between 90 and 100 employees - where his wife Pearl and daughter also worked. Mackereth said experts helped design the oven where Mr Catterall died, he and maintained he looked at the safety aspects of the design and considered safety in terms of the detailed design. But Martin Heywood, the investigating inspector at the Health and Safety Executive, said, 'The doors were set to automatically close whenever the electrical supply was switched back on, which meant there was a high risk of someone being trapped inside. 'There had been no risk assessments and staff had not received suitable training on how to use the new ovens and there were no written instructions on cleaning and maintenance. 'If Pyranha Mouldings and the individual prosecuted over Alan's death had properly considered the risks to employees when they designed, installed and operated the ovens then he would still be here today.' Detective inspector Gary Smith, from Cheshire Police, welcomed the verdicts. He said, 'Alan’s death was a tragedy. He had worked hard at Pyranha Mouldings for many years and sadly ended up losing his life at his place of work. 'Alan’s family have suffered greatly over the years. This has been an extremely difficult process for them and I hope the successful conclusion today will help bring about a degree of closure.'","Alan Catterall died after he was trapped inside the oven at his work .
