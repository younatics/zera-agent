"(Rolling Stone) -- So here's the great pop album everybody was hoping Adam Lambert would make, ever since he ran wild on ""American Idol"" three years ago. It wasn't just Glambert's dynamite-with-a-laser-beam voice that got him into our national knickers: It was his warmth, his humor, his burlesque bravado. His 2010 debut, ""For Your Entertainment,"" was a typical ""Idol"" quickie -- decent, but it needed more personality. ""Trespassing"" delivers, with a mix of tinsel disco-club sleaze and leather-boy love ballads. While he excels in a radio cheddar bomb like ""Naked Love,"" he gets deeper in slow jams like ""Underneath"" and ""Outlaws of Love."" But all over ""Trespassing,"" Glambert sings everything like Zeus in a thong. See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(Rolling Stone) -- The past month has been a time of frenzied activity for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. They taped two TV appearances, played special gigs at the Apollo Theater and SXSW, and launched a world tour in support of Springsteen's new LP, ""Wrecking Ball."" Late last week, Rolling Stone chatted separately with E Street Band guitarists Steven Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren about the new E Street Band and how they're carrying on after the loss of Clarence Clemons. Rolling Stone: You guys almost always do rehearsal shows before launching a big tour. Why didn't those happen this time? Nils Lofgren: Previously, the rehearsal shows were kind of a last-minute thing. I think probably what happened is that we were putting our own show together, which inevitably heads towards rehearsal shows. But because of the new record, we made commitments. We did the Grammys, two nights on ""Jimmy Fallon"" and the Apollo Show. Next on the horizon was the SXSW show. All of a sudden it was like, ""Gosh, we have five different shows to prepare."" Bruce always takes the time to slant the shows to the occasion, and we had to get our own show up and we just ran out of time. Steven Van Zandt: It was interesting to witness our own extremes with the Apollo Show and the SXSW show. We went from emphasizing soul music at the Apollo to flipping 180 degrees for a Woody Guthrie celebration at SXSW. It was quite interesting to have that reinforced and have it be totally integrated in the work -- not doing either extreme as a sort of specialty, gimmicky show, but actually having those roots so firmly planted in the material -- and to be reminded how wide and varied the identity of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band actually is at this point. It's some kind of example of Americana in all of its forms. Rolling Stone: It was a pretty bold move to debut the new band and new show at the Apollo, considering it was being broadcast live. Van Zandt: To do our first show as a broadcast, that's real balls. I'm proud of us for pulling it off. It was pretty close to flawless, I have to say. Keep in mind, we have a brand new five-piece horn section. We're still working on horn parts. We're still working on vocal parts with the singers. We have a couple new people involved. I took it for granted, but they were probably a bit nervous. They did great, though. We spent a lot of time thinking about this show and talking about it. The horn section was a good answer to the unanswerable: ""How do you replace Clarence Clemons?"" Well, you don't. It's real simple. The same way you replace Danny Federici. You don't. You have somebody else playing those parts, but you have to do something else, you have to morph it into a hybrid of what you were. It's not going to be the same. Rolling Stone: How long ago did rehearsals begin? Lofgren: They've been off and on, but we got together in the second week of January. We had to address what was in front of us, which was a lot, and kind of take our time and experiment and let things evolve. There's so many changes. Certainly the biggest change of all is Clarence, which is a terrible loss. I've been in the band for 28 years, and I'm pretty sure it's accurate to say that the band has never gone on the road with three-and-a-half albums of new material. When Bruce put out the ""Darkness On The Edge of Town"" package, there were 23 unreleased songs and they never toured behind that. And then you had 11 new songs. All this material is really valid and great and we've never integrated it into our show, which is already hundreds of songs that we haven't presented in over two years. It was an abnormal amount of new material to disseminate. It's just a giant, beautiful jigsaw puzzle of music. Van Zandt: Usually we start rehearsals two weeks before the first show and kick around some ideas for the set, maybe do six rehearsals, period. Each tour has its own energy, and the writing is the script for the show. It's like a Broadway show or a movie. You have to start with the script, and that's always a new album for us. We've never been a nostalgia band. Every single time we go out, we're saying something new, something that's been on Bruce's mind in that period. In this case, instead of our usual five or six days, we did 10 or 12. We probably had 40 horn charts. That's a lot of work just to outline the charts, never mind tweak them and really get into the details of arranging, which, of course, I love to do, and Bruce is also really good at. So that's going on, and we have to integrate this new album, adapt it -- in this case, a little more adaptation, because it was a solo album. This is the first time this has ever happened, where he's touring with the E Street Band behind a solo album. But it's good, and we had the whole new album down in two days. Then you start kicking around ideas and doing older things. ""My City of Ruins"" ended up playing a major role in this show, really for the first time. It's always been an emotional song but sort of a specialty song, maybe an encore. This time it ended up playing a very, very different and central role. This is the most difficult task ever. How do you address Clarence and Danny? How do you address that? You talk to ten different people and they're going to have ten different ideas. But it's really not easy. You're trying to do something that's very, very emotional, and at the same time, you don't want to make the show a funeral. You want to make sure the show is a celebration of life. It's a very delicate, very fine line to walk. And (Bruce) comes up with this rap -- it's so f****** great, and so perfect. I'm awestruck. This guy still inspires me after 45 f****** years of doing this. I'm like, ""Jesus Christ, that's so f****** good, so important."" It's such an important moment in the show...It's probably the best start of a tour, I think ever, honestly. Rolling Stone: I'm sure it was hard the first time you walked onstage without Clarence. Lofgren: The first time that hit me the hardest was the Grammys. I'm standing there, and there's nobody to my right. It hit me hard. That's someone I'll miss the rest of my life, but I still love playing and it doesn't take away from the power of the songs of the band. Van Zandt: It's emotional for me to walk onstage without Clarence, and it always will be. I still honestly once in a while get that feeling with Danny. I look over there and say, ""Oh yeah, Danny's no longer..."" That's never going to change. So I think the more people onstage, the more that helps. The more the configuration is different, the more that eases your emotional pain. In other words, you're not trying to replace them, you're doing a different thing. Through the years, since we started playing in 1965, you do a lot of different things. I've been in horn bands. I've been in country bands. You go into 100 different configurations in your life. Now it feels like another one. It's almost like you're in a different band, in a sense, even though the core of the band is still there. See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Vampire Weekend's headlining gig at the Pitchfork Music Festival in July will mark the band's first live performance in nearly a year, but the Brooklyn-based indie rockers have been keeping busy. As bassist Chris Baio tells Rolling Stone, they've been hard at work on the follow-up to their 2010 LP, ""Contra."" ""We've started many songs,"" Baio says. ""Obviously we haven't been rushing it. We take it very seriously. We'll be incredibly psyched to share it with the world when it's done."" The band has amassed plenty of material, but as frontman Ezra Koenig echoed in a recent chat with Rolling Stone, they aren't working with any deadline in mind. ""We do have a ton of stuff,"" said Koenig. ""It would be cool if it was [released] this year. I always want to release music as soon as possible, but more and more I'm realizing it's something you almost have no control over. We just never want to be in a position [where] when we put out something, we feel could've benefited from more time."" Baio, in particular, has been making the most of his time off the road. On May 21, the 27-year-old will release his debut solo EP, ""Sunburn,"" under his DJ moniker Baio. A three-track set of undulating dance grooves that capture a vibe the bassist describes as ""hopeful melancholy,"" it's the culmination of a hobby Baio took up half a decade ago as a student at Columbia University in New York. ""I had always really loved electronic music and dance music,"" says Baio. ""Then when the band started, that kind of got put aside for awhile. But I found that while on tour a lot of nights, I would still feel like I had a lot of energy. And there are opportunities when you play in a band to go out and DJ."" Given the band's extremely light tour schedule last year, Baio had time to reacquaint himself with his love of DJ'ing. ""I'd lock myself in my little office in my apartment with CDJs and a mixer and just practice mixing all day,"" he says. ""I did that quite a bit while we were touring the last record and realized when we finished touring that I really wanted to pursue it."" Baio started work on the EP last February. His first completed track was ""Sunburn Modern"" -- a cut whose title, Baio says, was inspired by a nasty, ""modern art""-looking sunburn he received last year while on a trip to Mexico with his girlfriend. The bassist says he plans to continue releasing additional solo tunes; he says he already has ""a bunch of songs"" completed and several others he's currently working on. ""It's definitely something I plan on pursuing in the foreseeable future,"" he adds. Baio does admit that there are drawbacks to going at it alone. ""When you DJ, people can be incredibly rude to you in a hilarious way,"" he says. ""A lot of times there will be pretty drunk people who just come up to you and tell you they really hate what you're doing. Something like that will sting for two seconds, but it's not worth not putting yourself out there as an artist."" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(EW.com) -- Ladies, what have you done to Jack White? On the former White Stripes frontman's first solo album (which is also his first full-length since his 2011 divorce from model and Third Man labelmate Karen Elson), he thinks you're all out to get him, you liberated women who got ''freedom in the 21st century,'' who feel ''no responsibility, no guilt or morals,'' who want to cut off his arms and store them in the icebox or drill holes in his lifeboat with your spike heels. He tapped an all-female band to back him on ""Saturday Night Live"" recently, but here he's still dreaming of the old days, when men were men, and girls would ''hold their hands behind them.'' If White's afraid of modern women, it's because he's always fetishized the past; he's a man so bugged out by technology, he once built a guitar from three nails, some wood, and a Coke bottle. Musically, that nostalgia for simpler times works here. Now a Nashville resident, he's recruited pedal-steel players, harpists, and violinists for a set so vintage in style -- with nods to '70s country (''Blunderbuss''), '60s garage (''Sixteen Saltines''), classic rock (''Freedom at 21''), and the blues (''I'm Shakin''') -- that it's sequenced to play on vinyl. There's a certain Opryland jam-session charm to it all, but ""Blunderbuss"" lacks the electric jolt that made previous outfits the White Stripes and the Dead Weather so exciting. Maybe because it's also missing the awesome battle-of-the-sexes tension between White and his ''sisters'' in those groups. He's right that a modern woman should know her place -- and sometimes, that place is right in front of the band. B . See the full article at EW.com.

"(Rolling Stone) -- The company that owns ""American Idol"" is restructuring in light of the show's ratings drop and developing projects for its other assets, including the creative exploitation of Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali, the New York Times reports. CKx, which will change its name to Core Media Group, has especially big plans in store for Presley: an upgrade of the Graceland museum is in the works, as well as a possible drama series based on the singer's early life. Core is also in talks with Sony about a potential duets album, which would pair contemporary singers with Presley in much the same way that past duets albums have done with Frank Sinatra. A subsequent tour may see singers performing alongside an Elvis hologram. Meanwhile, Core is also planning a revamp of ""Idol,"" which comes on the tail of the show's 30% ratings decline in its 11th season this year. The drop coincides with the rise of newer singing competitions, like NBC's ""The Voice"" and Fox's ""The X Factor."" ""'Idol' is still the gold standard,"" Core's new president Marc Graboff told the Times. ""It's very viable, but it definitely needs to be refreshed and it will be."" Graboff says the company will reteam with original ""Idol"" creator Simon Fuller to help make the changes, which include a likely overhaul of ""Idol's"" voting system. The current one has produced winners of a similar profile for five seasons straight, most recently 21-year-old Georgia rocker Phillip Phillips. ""They're being called W.G.W.G.'s -- white guys with guitars,"" said Graboff. It's possible that the judges panel (currently Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez and Randy Jackson) will see a change, too, said Graboff -- but that decision falls under the purview of Fox, which broadcasts ""Idol."" ""We hope it will stay as big a revenue stream as it has been,"" said Graboff. ""But no matter how big the stream is, my job is to diversify us away from it as much as possible.""

"(RollingStone.com) -- It was a scene straight out of ""The Day After Tomorrow"": a sea of confused, disgruntled people flooding the streets of Chicago, left to wonder about their fate. The cause of this mayhem: severe thunderstorms, which temporarily forced the evacuation of the second day of Lollapalooza on Saturday. All was not lost, however: after a nearly three-hour delay, festival officials reopened the gates and Lolla was officially back on. The suspension did have some irreparable effects. Several performances -- including those by Alabama Shakes, B.o.B., Temper Trap and Neon Indian -- were cancelled, and others were pushed back a few hours or shortened. There was also the reality that Grant Park was now a full-on mud bath. Still, despite being one of the most chaotic days in Lollapalooza's storied history, when Red Hot Chili Peppers took the main stage in late evening, the earlier trouble hardly mattered. These weren't the same Chilis that last played Lollapalooza in 2006: guitarist Josh Klinghoffer was added to the mix following the departure of John Frusciante in 2009. The Anthony Kiedis-led crew delivered a set comprised largely of the classics, aside from opening with the otherworldly percussion of new tune ""Monarchy of Roses"" (off 2011 album I'm With You), and their trademark fusion of rock, punk and funk riffs was on full display. The setlist included everything from the melodic (""Snow (Hey Oh),"" ""Under the Bridge"") to the mosh-pit friendly rockers (""Can't Stop"") and even the Afrobeat-inspired (""Throw Away Your Television""). The city of Chicago had extended the festival's curfew in light of the day's earlier evacuation, so the band plowed on into the night, finishing their set with a two-song encore that included ""Brendan's Death Song"" and ""Give It Away."" Kiedis donned his usual attire, or lack thereof: the singer was shirtless and wore a mesh hat saluting the Los Angeles punk act OFF! Flea expressed his love for the fans and pleaded that everyone continue supporting live music ""because it's all we got."" After kicking off with his monster hit ""Levels,"" which liberally samples Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold on Me,"" superstar DJ Avicii shifted through a familiar formula: searing, emotional vocal samples with giant synthesizer riffs. Each track sent more young fans scrambling towards the Bud Light stage, many caked with mud. As his visuals lit up the night sky, framed by Chicago's beautiful skyscrapers, fans reacted: ""Avicii is one of the hottest techno acts in the world,"" explained one. Another put things in perspective: ""Deadmau5 is cooler, man."" Fellow EDM leader Calvin Harris inspired mud-dancing and excessive fist-pumping at Perry's Stage. ""Lollapalooza, I wanna see you jump up and down,"" the Scottish party-starter instructed the neon-clad masses. Over the past year, Harris has been able to successfully bridge the gap between progressive house and pop music, and his Saturday set mirrored his genre-crossing: when he wasn't unleashing bass-throbbing beats during ""You Used to Hold Me,"" the DJ was dropping the needle on his radio hits, Rihanna's ""We Found Love"" and his own ""Feel So Close."" As Avicii and the Chilis battled it out for main-stage supremacy, Frank Ocean took to the more intimate Google Play Stage. ""I see we had a little rain,"" the breakout R&B singer remarked, wearing his usual red and white bandana. ""I'm glad you all came back."" Ocean's set was an entirely suave affair: he began by sitting on a chair, serenading the adoring crowd with a cover of Sade's ""By Your Side"" as acoustic guitars backed him lightly. Later, thanks to his crack four-piece band, Ocean brought a heavier hand to the Channel ORANGE cut ""Thinkin' Bout You"" and the nostalgia, ULTRA hit ""Novacane."" Ocean capped his set with the gospel-tinged ""Bad Religion"" -- which he said spoke of his previous love affair with a man -- and the tragic epic ""Pyramid."" The Weeknd, also known as the Canadian singer Abel Tesfaye, is often compared to Ocean for his floating falsetto and mysterious air. When he played the Red Bull Stage earlier in the afternoon, he peppered his set with cuts from his trio of popular mixtapes, beginning with House of Balloons in early 2011 and concluding with last December's Echoes of Silence. After a winsome ""High for This,"" the Balloons opener and first song many heard from Tesfaye, the singer blew an adoring kiss to the crowd. Fittingly enough, no band appeared to enjoy Lollapalooza as much as Fun. The ""We Are Young"" group had the unenviable task of reopening the festival post-thunderstorm and more than succeeded in the challenge. Frontman Nate Ruess, wearing neon yellow sneakers and unhinged suspenders, bounded onstage to open with ""One Foot,"" followed it up with ""Why Am I the One?"" and, despite volume issues, never let up until he brought the house down with the band's breakout single. Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand played an expectedly energetic set that mostly stuck to the basics of mid-2000s dance-rock. Lead singer Alex Kapranos, clad in a black button-up, shook off the post-storm humidity with ease, offering career highlight tracks like ""Michael"" and ""Take Me Out"" early in the set, then tossing out a surprise cover of Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" before concluding with an impressive drum solo feature. Twin Shadow's set was too brief -- they began nearly fifteen minutes late as they conducted an eleventh-hour soundcheck -- but what they did play was a romantic, emotionally direct show reminiscent of Eighties teen flicks. Shrouded by a smoke machine, lead singer George Lewis Jr. and his band made the most of their time with minimal stage patter that was as heart-on-sleeve as their music: ""Turned out to be such a beautiful night."" A set highlight was ""At My Heels,"" for which Lewis poured genuine energy into the performance. Star Slinger took to Perry's Stage in a blue-striped polo shirt. His performance seemed disjointed, varying between predictable and electrifying. At some points, he covered obvious tracks, including the hip-hop staple ""Crossroads"" by Bone Thugs N Harmony and Nicki Minaj and 2 Chainz's current hit ""Beez in the Trap."" He was most interesting when he invigorated the set with British rave concepts, mixing transcendent piano lines and helium vocals into his emotionally fraught atmosphere.

"(EW.com) -- It's no wonder Gotye tapped Kimbra as the object of his obsessive longing on the chart-topping single ''Somebody That I Used to Know.'' After all, who wouldn't get hung up on the New Zealand sprite's bewitching wail and gift for teleporting spryly across the sonic pop spectrum? Gotye's inescapable hit is actually a misleading entry point into Kimbra's universe; her sparkling debut wants little to do with his bleeding-heart Sting-isms. She's more interested in multiculti chaos, darting between musical branches and gleefully snatching the juiciest fruits: funked-out horns, orchestral indie shimmer, radio bounce, sexy cabaret slink. She shifts effortlessly from harmonizing with herself a cappella to growling over a hiccupy hand-clap groove, before bursting into a dance- and-shout refrain -- and that's just the opening track, ''Settle Down.'' The rest of ""Vows"" is equally fresh and surprising, its genre leaps held together by Kimbra's pliant coo -- a remarkably expressive instrument that can evoke toughness, heartbreak, and humor over the course of a single line.

"(Rolling Stone) -- There's a promising premise on the boil here. What if Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) spent the last days of his life trying to nab a serial killer who's been using macabre ideas from Poe's short stories to off his victims? ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" anyone? OK, ""The Raven"" sounds like a TV series that gets canceled soon after its debut. But it has compensations, chief of which is John Cusack, who plays Poe with just the right blend of romantic longing and tortuous doubt. Director James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta""), an assistant to the Wachowski brothers on ""The Matrix,"" pulls us in with the period atmosphere. A few days before his death, Poe was found on a park bench in Baltimore, babbling incoherently. So much for truth. Booze and syphilis reportedly contributed to Poe's demise. But the script, by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare, posits that he's been poisoned by a crazed fan who adores and loathes him in equal measure. Cue the flashbacks and a feeble fictional story about how Poe's heiress fiancee, Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve), gets interred alive (""The Premature Burial"") and Poe labors to help police detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) find Emily before her breath runs nevermore. None of this huggermugger generates much excitement. What drew me into the film most was the depiction of Poe's life as an impoverished poet, trying to make a few bucks by composing detective fiction while fiercely criticizing the work of other writers. In one scene, the anguished Poe wagers that at least one person in a pub will recognize him as an author, best known for ""The Raven."" Cusack captures that desperation vividly enough to make you wish this was the real Poe story, which ""The Raven"" onscreen leaves buried alive. See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- A Tulane University football player was hospitalized after fracturing his spine during a game Saturday, leaving him motionless on the field, a team doctor said. Devon Walker was injured when he collided head-on with one of his teammates while trying to tackle a Tulsa ball carrier near the end of the first half in the two teams' game. The Tulane senior lay motionless on the Tulsa field as trainers and doctors rushed onto the field. Dr. Felix Savoie, orthopedist for Tulane University and chief of sports medicine at the school, said Walker ""never completely lost consciousness"" and was breathing throughout the ordeal. SI: NFL week 1 storylines . ""It went as well as it can go,"" Savoie said of the emergency aid effort, complimenting the Tulsa medical staff and Tulane trainers for effectively stabilizing Walker. ""I do not think, based on the information we have, that his life was ever in danger."" Savoie said Walker has a ""cervical spine fracture"" as well as an edema -- or swelling from a build-up of excess fluid -- in his neck. Walker was in traction and in stable condition Saturday night at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, according to the Tulane doctor. ""The plan currently is for him to have surgery in the next day or two,"" Savoie said. ""There are great spine surgeons and neurosurgeons involved. That's kind of all we know at this point."" According to his bio on the Tulane athletics website, Walker is a 21-year-old senior majoring in cell and molecular biology. The New Orleans native -- who weighs 173 pounds and stands 6 feet 1 inch tall -- plays safety for the Green Wave, a team he's played with since walking onto the team and playing nine games as a freshman. Tulane, which was trailing 35-3 at the time of Walker's injury, went on to lose the game at H.A. Chapman Stadium by a 45-10 score. Tulsa's coach Bill Blankenship later issued a statement, posted on the football team's Twitter page, saying, ""Our hearts and prayers are with Devon Walker right now and his family."" After the game, Green Wave head coach Curtis Johnson explained how he'd told his players after Walker went down to ""play one play at a time and let's do what Devon would do -- ... go out and play his butt off."" The coach described the mood in Tulane's locker room as ""somber,"" calling Saturday ""one of the most difficult days ever."" ""I thought about just saying, 'Hey, look, let's not even do anything else, let's just get on the road and go,"" he said. Walker is planning to attend medical school after graduation, according to Johnson. He described the senior as a ""self-made man"" who was ""probably the emotional leader"" of his time, thanks to his ""infectious"" spirit. ""He loves life, and he loves football,"" Johnson said. ""(Walker is) a very, very good kid, a very smart kid."" Walker isn't the only football player who suffered a frightening injury Saturday. Arkansas cornerback Tevin Mitchel was carted off the field on a stretcher after a big hit during the Razorbacks' game against the University of Louisiana at Monroe.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Denver's stately Ellie Caulkins Opera House hosted the kickoff of Death Cab for Cutie's intimate theater tour last night, beginning a 22-date jaunt that finds the indie-pop band collaborating with San Francisco's Magik*Magik Orchestra. The string octet, which is supporting the band for the entirety of the tour, is a smart addition to Death Cab's rich melodic sound, especially since they're sampling only lightly from their most recent album, ""Codes and Keys,"" in favor of a more buffet-like approach to their indie-to-major catalog. Leader Ben Gibbard seems determined to showcase tunes that will push the new orchestral arrangements to the fore, instead of trotting out another new-album-plus-greatest-hits setlist. A lanky, moppy-haired Gibbard took the stage in silhouette after a brief overture to the ""Transatlanticism"" sleeper ""Passenger Seat,"" bathed in blue backlight and breathing softly into the mic over the song's dreamy notes. He slow-burned into ""Different Names for the Same Things,"" and the rest of his band soon joined him to speed the crescendo, each member dressed in black and seeming acutely aware of their classical environs. It didn't take long for Gibbard and diminutive Magik*Magik director Minna Choi to share a few smiles, but despite the warm exchange, it was clear that a lot was riding on this opening. The seated, sold-out crowd was dotted with more tweens and retirees than your average club show, and the band leaned more toward buttoned-down professionalism than rock & roll abandon, affecting a sort of politely feverish ""Ed Sullivan Show"" image with their tight mannerisms and colorful stage lighting. The domino effect of audience members rising to see over the folks in front of them took hold during ""Codes and Keys,"" though it quickly subsided when Gibbard eased into the pensive ""No Joy in Mudville."" ""Part of the fun of doing a tour like this is we get to play some songs we haven't done in awhile,"" Gibbard said before playing the tune, and it was clear what he meant as Magik*Magik's languid arrangements enveloped ""Mudville's"" downtempo beat. Gibbard isn't known for burying his emotions, at least in song, but it was reassuring to hear him gush over Death Cab's slowcore opening act, ""Low,"" who delivered a typically monk-like set of calm harmony and clanging guitar. ""Words really can't describe the feeling that we get to share the stage with Low,"" Gibbard said as he launched into ""Soul Meets Body,"" a crowd-pleaser. ""They're one of our favorite bands of all time, so this one goes out to them."" Back up went the teenagers and the tipsy, 30-something fan boys and girls, who were right to stay on their feet as Gibbard ended the main set a song later with the buoyant ""Codes and Keys"" closer, ""Stay Young, Go Dancing."" An encore was all but ensured, but the band at least mixed it up with an acoustic version of ""Steadier Footing,"" which found drummer Jason McGerr smacking an upright trap set practically shoulder-to-shoulder with his mates. ""Jason looks like he stole that drum kit from Tito Puente,"" Gibbard quipped, in one of the night's few unscripted moments. An unusually vulnerable ""I Will Follow You Into the Dark"" highlighted the six-song appendage, contrasted by another one of the night's few moments of abandon, a cacophonous ""Transatlanticism"" that gave the sleepy show the slap it needed to continue on for another 20-plus dates. Setlist: . ""Passenger Seat / Different Names for the Same Thing"" ""A Movie Script Ending"" ""Title and Registration"" ""Grapevine Fires"" ""Codes and Keys"" ""No Joy in Mudville"" ""Little Fury Bugs"" ""Death of an Interior Decorator"" ""You Are a Tourist"" ""Bend to Squares"" ""Hindsight"" ""Army Corps of Architects"" ""What Sarah Said"" ""Soul Meets Body"" ""Stay Young, Go Dancing"" Encore: .

"(CNN) -- A Delaware doctor and his wife were arrested this week after their daughter told authorities that she was punished by ""waterboarding,"" police said. The 11-year-old girl said her father, pediatrician Melvin Morse, would hold her face under a running faucet causing the water to shoot up her nose, according to Delaware State Police. The punishments occurred four times between 2009 and 2011. Pauline Morse, the girl's mother, apparently witnessed the abuse and failed to stop it, police said. Attorneys for Pauline Morse could not be immediately reached for comment. But Melvin Morse's attorney said he doesn't believe the allegations, though hasn't yet spoken to his client about them. ""The guy is a caring sensitive individual,"" said Joe Hurley, a Wilmington-based attorney. ""It's unimaginable that he would expose his child to that kind of danger. He's very interested in caring for people. It doesn't equate that he would do that to his own child."" Morse has written on near-death experiences among children, authoring a 1991 book called ""Closer to the Light."" He was also interviewed by CNN's Larry King about the subject, and runs a nonprofit called The Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness. Authorities were first alerted to allegations of abuse in July when they went to Morse's Georgetown home. His daughter accused him of grabbing her by the ankle, dragging her across a gravel driveway and spanking her, police said. Morse was arrested four days later and posted bond. But his attorney offered a different account of what transpired that day. Hurley said the family returned from a trip when their daughter refused to get out of the car, sitting there for about four hours. Morse then picked her up and carried her out of the car a short distance to the house, his attorney said. ""There was no dragging involved,"" Hurley added. The following morning, he said, she visited a friend's house and recounted the incident there. A phone call describing the alleged abuse was then apparently made to authorities, Hurley said. It's not clear who made the call. But it was during a follow-up police interview with the child on Monday that she made the allegation that her father had ""waterboarded"" her as punishment, a term she said he used, according to police. Morse and his wife were arrested Tuesday. Both face charges of reckless endangerment, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child, police said. He is being held on $14,500 bail, while his wife was released after posting similar bail. Both were ordered to have no contact with their 11-year-old daughter or her 5-year-old sister, who are currently in protective custody. Do you own your child's body? The Delaware Department of Justice issued an emergency petition Wednesday to have Morse's medical license suspended. The couple are expected to appear at a preliminary hearing in coming weeks.

"(CNN) -- A week after Facebook's bungled IPO comes fresh news to tantalize, or torment, the company's investors. The social-networking behemoth may be making a phone. Facebook hopes to release its own smartphone by next year, according to a New York Times report quoting anonymous sources at the company and others who have been briefed on Facebook's plans. Facebook has already hired more than half a dozen former Apple engineers who worked on the iPhone, the report said. We've heard this before. In 2010, TechCrunch reported that Facebook was building software for a phone and partnering with a third party to make the hardware. Citing their own sources, tech blog AllThingsD said last year the phone was code-named ""Buffy"" and would run on a version of Android modified to integrate Facebook's services. Facebook's iPhone: The most ill-fated idea since Palm Pre? But Sunday's Times report added new specifics such as an interview with a former iPhone engineer who said he recently met with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who ""peppered him with questions about the inner workings of smartphones,"" including the types of chips used. ""It did not sound like idle intellectual curiosity, the engineer said."" A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the report Monday. The company had referred the New York Times to a previous statement that said in part, ""We're working across the entire mobile industry; with operators, hardware manufacturers, OS providers, and application developers."" A Facebook-built smartphone could allow users to more seamlessly send messages, post updates and share photos or article links. Although it makes apps for iPhones and iPads, Facebook is still not integrated into Apple's mobile operating system, for example. The news arrives amid speculation that Facebook, facing new pressure as a public company, will need to develop fresh sources of mobile revenue and exert greater control over its mobile products as users spend more time networking on phones or tablets instead of laptops or desktops. Opinion: Was Facebook's botched IPO a conspiracy? ""Mark (Zuckerberg) is worried that if he doesn't create a mobile phone in the near future that Facebook will simply become an app on other mobile platforms,"" a Facebook employee told the New York Times. It also comes days after rival Google closed its $12.9 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a deal that could let Google make its own smartphone, too. Many tech bloggers believe such a move would be a bad idea for Facebook, in part because there's no clear-cut consumer need for a Facebook phone. Henry Blodget of Business Insider wrote that Facebook would face stiff competition in the hardware business, an area where it has no experience and where profit margins are historically low. ""So instead of building a phone, which seems like a desperate move, Facebook should partner with every operating system and carrier and hardware maker it can to try to embed this social platform within every mobile platform,"" Blodget said. ""And it should build great apps to float on top of these systems."" In a post titled ""It'll Be A Miracle If The Facebook Phone Doesn't Suck,"" TechCrunch's Alexia Tsotsis was more blunt. ""Making phone hardware is hard work, much harder than anything Facebook has ever attempted in the past,"" she wrote. ""Basically, there are a million ways this project will fail, and just one way it will work: Facebook ostensibly could succeed by tapping into the opening in the mobile market where people want an alternative to poorly designed Android phones â€” targeting people who would buy something other than an iPhone if the price point was $150 less and the design were at least a little bit more ambitious than what is currently available on Android.""","Facebook hopes to release its own smartphone by next year, says New York Times report .

"(CNN) -- While the Republican nominees beat their drums and stomp their feet and whoop ""class warfare,"" we're reminded of another kind of war on class: That is people's seeming inability to be decent and sophisticated online. This isn't a new problem. In the musical ""Chicago,"" Velma and Mama Morton lament: ""Why is it everyone now is a pain in the a**? Whatever happened to class?"" But back in Prohibition-era Illinois, offenses were limited to whatever went down in letters, telephone calls and real-life interactions. Nowadays, when we're virtually connected to a gazillion people at any given time (formally reducing our six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon and everyone else to a mere 4.74 -- score!), those dodgy, ill-advised and just plain rude acts are happening at arm's length all the time. While we can't do anything about the fact that ""no one even says oops when they're passing their gas"" and ""even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass"" (yep, ""Chicago"" again), we offer the following solutions in the war on class. Identify your own faux pas and make the Web a bit less of a bubbling swamp of vulgarity. Tacky tactic: Posting detailed, passive-aggressive grievances about other people in your circle on your blog, Facebook, Twitter, etc., a la ""It's really interesting to me how SOME people think it's totally OK to be nice to your face and then send texts to your boyfriend telling him he could do better, ESPECIALLY when said people wear fake colored contact lenses and ill-fitting clothes and are named Jenny Jenkins. #justsaying."" Classy fix: When you have beef with one person and yet feel the need to involve hundreds of others, you don't come off as righteous. You look childish and a bit foolish. In fact, research shows that gossipmongers are seen as unlikable and weak. If you have something to say to someone, say it to her face (book): E-mail or message her privately. Or better yet, call her or ask whether you can talk in person and -- calmly and without screeching or flailing about -- talk it out. Staying cool as a cucumber won't just be classy, it'll scare the crap out of whomever you're confronting. A classy foe is so much more persuasive than a hysterical one. Tacky tactic: Making big announcements via TMI photos: the new baby, seconds after birth and still gooey; your newly deceased father-in-law on a gurney, moments before they wheeled him away; you passed out next to the toilet after celebrating your new job offer, etc. Classy fix: Honestly, most big announcements don't require an accompanying photo. A cheerful update about the baby's weight and health, a solemn link to the service announcement and an excited sentence about your new gig would suffice. Eventually your friends and loved ones will want you to share a photo of the cleaned-up baby. But trust us: Your friends want you to be out there celebrating achievements and dealing with losses, not busily tapping away on your smartphone every second of the day. (To put it another way: You're not nearly as interesting to everyone else as you think you are. Hard truth of the day.) Tacky tactic: Assuming every digital contact is a willing financial supporter (and prefers to be contacted a dozen times a day). So you're planning a self-booked, 12-country mission trip? Forming a nonprofit to neuter feral cats in the neighborhood? Kicking off that company of hard-plastic containers for the transportation of raw fruit that you've been talking about? Good for you. Not so good for us if you continue tagging us in daily Facebook notes or spamming us with bullying messages along the lines of ""Your contribution is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL to the success of Spay & Play, so it is ESSENTIAL that you donate as much as you can."" Classy fix: Use a carrot, not a stick, to drum up support. Set up a Kickstarter campaign with a low funding limit and offer incentives for different contributions. Send kind, flattering, personalized appeals to different potential donors (""I thought this might interest you since you're familiar with startup nonprofits, and I'd love to take you out for coffee and benefit from your wisdom even if a financial contribution isn't possible right now"") and leave them alone if one followup note goes unanswered. At the end of the day, like when you're penniless in your 11th country or chest-deep in feral kitties, you want a venture funded by willing donors and well-wishing supporters, not ticked-off friends who are paying you hush money.","The Web is full of people who use tacky tactics on their social media platforms .

"(CNN) -- Florida A&M University says it is not responsible for the death of a drum major last year, and that he broke the law and school policies when he willingly took part in the hazing that left him dead. In court papers filed Monday night, the school asked a judge to drop a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of 26-year-old Robert Champion. ""Mr. Champion should have refused to participate in the planned hazing event and reported it to law enforcement or University administrators,"" the court documents say. ""Under these circumstances, Florida's taxpayers should not be held financially liable to Mr. Champion's Estate for the ultimate result of his own imprudent, avoidable and tragic decision and death."" The student's family lambasted the school Tuesday for denying responsibility. ""The Champion family is shocked at the defense FAMU has chosen in the brutal hazing death of Robert Champion,"" family attorney Christopher Chestnut said. ""We simply cannot ignore the audacity of an institution that blames students for their own deaths, yet for decades ignored the hazing epidemic occurring within its own walls."" In a message to CNN, school attorney Richard E. Mitchell said FAMU is not ""blaming the victim,"" but is saying ""that his voluntary participation in felony hazing, as a 26 year old grown man and band leader, bars his estate's alleged claim for taxpayer dollars as a matter of law."" FAMU is publicly funded. Champion died in November 2011 following his beating on a bus in Orlando, Florida, after a football game at which the school's famed marching band performed. The ritual, called ""Crossing Bus C,"" was an initiation in which pledges try to run down a bus's center aisle while being assaulted by senior members, according to some university band members. Fourteen people since have been charged in the case. They include 11 facing one count apiece of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death and two counts each of first-degree misdemeanor hazing. Three others each face a single count of first-degree misdemeanor hazing. In July, Champion's parents filed a lawsuit against the school's board of trustees, the company that owns the bus in which the abuse occurred, and the driver of the bus. The school, in its response filed Monday night, said Champion watched or at least heard two other students -- one female, one male -- undergoing hazing on the bus before he did, and there is ""no allegation or evidence"" that he attempted to stop the process before being hazed himself. ""Instead, Mr. Champion allowed himself to be subjected to an act of hazing known as a 'hot seat,' during which he allowed his adult body to be deprived of oxygen, punched, kicked and hit with objects,"" the court documents say. Champion's injuries ""arose from his participation in unlawful acts of hazing,"" so the school cannot be held legally liable, it argued. FAMU noted that many of Champion's ""co-conspirators are now under criminal prosecution for felony hazing, yet Plaintiff has not asserted any civil claims against any of Mr. Champion's identified hazers."" The family's lawsuit said FAMU ""has a long history of knowledge of and tolerance for hazing within the"" band, including incidents that led to hospitalizations over the years. FAMU students will have to sign anti-hazing pledge to take classes . In November, shortly before the incident involving Champion, the school's Dean Henry Kirby ""proposed imposing an immediate long-term suspension of the FAMU Band to combat the egregious hazing,"" but the school did not implement the proposal after opposition from the band director, the lawsuit alleges. It also argues that band members ""were under the control of FAMU at all times"" during the weekend when Champion died. The bus was operated ""pursuant to a valid Florida contract"" between the bus company, Fabulous Coach, and FAMU, the lawsuit says. The count accusing FAMU of wrongful death says the FAMU Board of Trustees owed Champion ""a duty of care"" and knew, or should have known, that the band engaged in conduct that violated laws and school policies. The board either ""negligently failed to have any policies or procedures governing, monitoring, or disciplining FAMU Band members for facilitation, participation or encouragement of hazing activities"" or failed to adequately implement such policies. FAMU president resigns in wake of hazing death . While an amount of money was not specified, the lawsuit sought damages for wrongful death as well as for the pain and suffering of the dead man's parents, Robert and Pamela Champion. FAMU trustees and school officials have taken numerous steps to strengthen rules against hazing since Champion's death, including setting up an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations. FAMU is creating two jobs: a special assistant to the president on hazing and a music compliance officer. About 60 people have applied for each position. The band was suspended through the 2012-13 school year. The band's longtime director retired, and the university's president stepped down. The school also launched a new website, StopHazingatFAMU.com. But accusations of hazing at the school haven't ended. Last week, the Torque Dance Team was suspended after a parent anonymously reported that hazing had occurred at an off-campus event over Labor Day weekend, the school said in a statement. The all-female dance team allegedly conducted hazing involving alcohol consumption and ""running up hills,"" university spokeswoman Sharon Saunders said. CNN's Josh Levs, Greg Botelho and George Howell contributed to this report.","The school says it is not ""blaming the victim"" in Robert Champion's death .

"(CNN) -- Two brothers who were released from prison Monday after nearly 25 years say their convictions were based on mistaken identity. Raymond and Thomas Highers, appearing on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Thursday, said they were in the neighborhood the 1987 night a drug dealer was killed in a Detroit home. But not only was a witness wrong about them being the men fleeing from the house, those two men weren't the killers either, one of the brothers said. ""They were more or less victims themselves of the crime and were told at gunpoint to leave,"" Raymond Highers told CNN. ""We were mistaken for those young, white men."" After Facebook posts lead to new trial, convicted brothers granted bond . The brothers were granted bond after a chance Facebook encounter led to new testimony from a man who says he was one of those two white teens who were at the house to buy drugs that night. John Hielscher, a teenager at the time of the killing, said in an affidavit that he went to the house with friends to buy marijuana and had a gun put to his head by a group of four or five young, African-American men, the Detroit Free Press reported. ""I can remember it as if it was yesterday. It was almost up to my head,"" Hielscher said in a recent interview with the newspaper. ""The gunman said, ""Get the f--- out of here."" As they were running away, they heard a shot, he said. Fearing repercussions, he put the night behind him. A former roommate, Kevin Zieleniewski, contacted Hielscher after he had a 2009 Facebook exchange with a woman who posted about the Highers being in prison. Their 1988 convictions were based partly on the testimony of a witness who saw two men go into the house and run out after a gunshot, said Valerie Newman, Thomas Highers' attorney. That led authorities to presume they were the killers and they were the Highers. With the new testimony ""those presumptions are evaporated,"" she said. ""The prosecution has absolutely no case."" Asked if the brothers, born 11 months apart and now 46, knew the men who allegedly were the killers, Timothy Highers said, ""Absolutely not. We got embroiled in it just by being in the neighborhood that night basically."" The Highers await a new trial after Wayne County Court Judge Lawrence Talon threw out their life sentences in July. A pretrial hearing is set for August 29. Under Michigan state law, a judge must review an inmate's conduct in prison before release, even if the inmate's conviction is set aside. On Monday, the Highers' former warden and a clinical psychologist testified on the brothers' behalf at a bond hearing. Carol Howes, former warden of the Lakeland Correctional Facility, where the brothers were periodically incarcerated, said she believes they're innocent. ""I've known them for over a decade. I've never known them to lie to me about anything,"" Howes told CNN. ""They have consistently said that they were innocent."" The brothers went home Monday after posting bond. ""We're feeling very happy and elated,"" Thomas Highers said Thursday. ""The last few days have been like a whirlwind ... meeting new family and getting to know everybody once again."" The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office is appealing the granting of a new trial. CNN's Julia Greenberg contributed to this report.","Raymond, Timothy Highers say they were in the neighborhood the night a drug dealer was killed .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq's Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who fled the country months ago, was sentenced to death Sunday, an official said. The verdict came on a day when a wave of violence across Iraq left at least 79 people dead and 270 wounded. Together, the death sentence and the violence raise questions about the stability of the country just nine months after U.S. troops were withdrawn. Al-Hashimi was sentenced to hang ""because he was involved directly in killing a female lawyer and a general with the Iraqi army,"" said Abdul Sattar al-Berqdar, a spokesman for Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council. ""There are many other charges against al-Hashimi, but this is one of the charges he was convicted of,"" al-Berqdar said. Al-Hashimi denies the charges, which include the accusation that he ran death squads. He called the accusations part of a ""black comedy"" in February. Attacks on Iraqi police, army kill dozens . ""Everybody knows that my case is a political case, from beginning to end, and that the charges against me are fabricated and far from the truth,"" al-Hashimi said in May. The death sentence raises the stakes in the controversy around Iraq's top Sunni Muslim politician, who accuses the country's Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of pushing the country towards a religious divide. The arrest warrant for al-Hashimi was issued soon after his Iraqiya party announced it would boycott Parliament, saying al-Maliki was cutting it out of the decision-making process. His Sunni-majority party has since ended its boycott, though al-Hashimi remains a fugitive. One of his political allies said Sunday that he did not receive a fair trial because he was not in Baghdad for it. Nada al-Jabouri, a lawmaker in Iraqiya bloc, also criticized the timing of the sentence, as ""Iraq is preparing for a big national reconciliation in the near future in order to achieve stability in this country."" ""This will not help,"" al-Jabouri said. Iraq's Central Criminal Court sentenced al-Hashimi's son-in-law Ahmed Qahtan to death alongside the politician. Qahtan is not in custody either. The death sentences are not final and can be appealed, Judicial Council spokesman al-Berqdar told CNN. Interpol issued a ""red notice"" for al-Hashimi in May, ""on suspicion of guiding and financing terrorist attacks in the country."" The notice calls on the 190 countries that belong to the international police organization to help locate and arrest him at the request of the Iraqi authorities. No apparent action has been taken to arrest him since the notice was issued four months ago. Al-Hashimi is now living in a Turkish government guest house in Istanbul. Before that, he lived in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region and also traveled to Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the invitation of those governments. In February, Iraq's top judicial committee accused al-Hashimi's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians from 2005 to 2011. Al-Hashimi said the nine-judge council was under the control of the Shiite-dominated central government and denied the charges. Charges against al-Hashimi appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men, identified as the vice president's security guards. Iraqi state television aired video of the confessions in December, but CNN has not been able to verify the men's identities independently. Among the confessions was one by a man who detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009. The person speaking said orders at times came directly from al-Hashimi and at times through his son-in-law, Qahtan, who is also a senior member of his staff. Al-Hashimi did not immediately respond to the sentencing on Sunday.","NEW: More than 79 people were killed in violence across Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Jesse Altman makes himself at home when he travels for work. Travel experts say you should negotiate a cheap room rate long before you get to your hotel. As he goes around the country selling his small company's coffee-energy drink hybrid, Whynatte Latte, he has found that staying in friends' homes saves him a substantial amount of money he might otherwise spend on lodging. ""For three nights, that's almost a thousand bucks right there,"" the Atlanta, Georgia, businessman said. ""A bottle of wine on the kitchen counter when you leave goes a long way -- or making sure the fridge is stocked. If we go out to dinner, we definitely cover the tab."" Many businesses are cutting back on travel budgets, and many small companies have to be inventive to trim costs. Staying with friends is an extreme exercise in frugality, but when it comes to lodging, several experts and frequent travelers stress the importance of considering every way to save money during these difficult financial times. ""The first thing that someone looking to save money should do, they need to think about what they actually want from a hotel,"" said business travel expert Joe Brancatelli. ""If you just need a bed and a shower, you don't need to stay at the Westin, go to Four Points."" Brancatelli, editor of joesentme.com, a Web site for business travelers, also suggested visiting a hotel's main company Web site to find the cheapest rates for price comparisons. You could also use a blind bidding site, such as Priceline, but it's a gamble because you don't know which hotel you'll get. For Brancatelli, it's worth it to choose a hotel and pay a bit extra. Other frequent travelers told CNN the ways they're thinking outside the box to stay within their tight travel budgets. Sharing a room or home . Shel Horowitz, owner of FrugalMarketing.com, says home stays offer big savings and a better way to enjoy the city. Home stays are rooms in residences that cost little, if anything at all. ""They are amazing -- not only do they save you money, but they give you a much more interesting trip,"" he said, pointing out that the owner of the home can steer you toward local attractions and eateries. Horowitz not only uses home stays when he is on the road, he also offers a room at his home for people visiting New York. He uses Servas, a nonprofit organization that promotes cross-cultural understanding by connecting travelers with hosts. Servas interviews and approves travelers and charges an annual fee for travelers. Other Web sites allow people to rent out their entire homes or rooms within their homes. Altman said he likes AirBed & Breakfast, on which people post pictures of the rooms for let and prices. Horowitz also said that conference attendees can often split a room with someone from another company. The meeting planner of a conference he recently attended set up a Facebook page for participants seeking roommates. In most cases, if you check with the conference planner, he or she can try to help you find a room to share. Call the hotel . If you decide it would be easiest to stay at a hotel, you need to pick up the phone, some of the frequent travelers said. Horowitz and Richard Laermer, CEO of RLM PR, urge business travelers to call their destination hotel and book through its reservation staff. Make sure you ask for the best rate and negotiate. Then go one step further and pit a few hotels against each other, Laermer said. You can get rooms for half price that way, he said. ""I think the phone is the killer app that everyone keeps forgetting about,"" he said. ""Pick up the phone, call the hotel and tell them you can get a better deal and ask them what they can do for you."" If you don't get the deal you want, consider another hotel that is substantially cheaper and close by. But don't go for the lowest price. ""I have found there isn't a whole lot of difference between the $60-a-night and the $200-a-night hotel,"" Horowitz said. ""But there is quite a bit of difference from the $29-a-night hotel and the $60-a-night hotel."" Brancatelli said to consider your time as a valuable commodity, so weigh the cost of negotiating against the time it would take to get a much lower rate. Rack up the points . Altman doesn't always stay with friends, so he tries to stay at a hotel chain where he can get points toward future stays or airline tickets. All major chains offer programs with free enrollment. Eileen Hanson, a vice president with Hilton Hotels, said members of a loyalty program also get extra perks, such as larger rooms or free Wi-Fi. But the best advantage is earning points, something even a person who only travels occasionally can do, she said. ""You can easily rack up enough points in just a few stays to earn enough points for a free night,"" she said. About 90 percent of reward redemptions at Hilton are for hotel stays. With the summer traveling season ahead, many chains are starting promotional periods this month to increase the number of loyalty points you can earn for each night's stay or items you can win. Crowne Plaza is offering loyalty club members the chance to earn a free set of high-end golf clubs, for instance. Hilton is adding bonus points. Points also can be earned across the brand. So if you choose an extended-stay hotel, you get rewards for giveaways, too. And increasingly, extended-stay hotels are becoming more attractive for business travelers, who can save money by using them as an apartment away from home. A growing number of travelers are buying groceries and cooking in their rooms, experts said. Still, the most important factor in hotel choice is the price of the room, said Gina LaBarre of Crowne Plaza, and hotels are taking a serious look at how much they charge so they can stay competitive. All the experts said planning ahead is the key to saving money. Figure out your lodging well in advance. Research and weigh your options. Save money where you can, but remember that comfort and convenience also have a value, especially when an important business meeting is involved. But watch the little costs, Brancatelli cautioned. For one, don't get room service; take a trip to a local restaurant instead. ""There's no need to buy a $30 club sandwich,"" he said.","Atlanta man stays with friends while on business, leaves presents as thanks .
Home stay organizations connect travelers, people willing to share spare room .
Experts recommend calling specific hotel you want to stay at and negotiating rate .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Police briefly detained famed Indian yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Monday after he tried to lead an anti-corruption march toward the national parliament building, a police spokesman said. ""Remove Congress and save the country,"" the yoga guru said to thousands of supporters before officers took him into custody, referring to the ruling Congress Party. The saffron-clad yoga teacher, whose televised breathing exercises are watched by millions, has been staging a demonstration since last week to demand repatriation of what he calls ""black money,"" or illegal Indian wealth in foreign banks. He also favors the creation of a strong anti-corruption watchdog agency to deal with endemic graft in the country, echoing a key demand raised by another veteran activist, Anna Hazare, whose hunger strikes last year galvanized huge public support. Ramdev was released shortly after police took him into custody, New Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said Monday. An unspecified number of Ramdev's supporters who had been taken into custody also were released, Bhagat said. There were no reports of disorder during Monday's demonstration, Bhagat said. Unlike last year, there were no attempts this year by the Indian government, led by the Congress Party, to negotiate with Ramdev and Hazare. Members of the party have in the past accused Ramdev of deceiving his followers and have questioned his wealthy lifestyle. For the past year, India has seen a series of anti-corruption protests in the wake of high-profile scandals that have shaken investor confidence in Asia's third largest economy and rocked the government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In June 2011, riot police broke up Ramdev's hunger strike in an overnight night raid in New Delhi. The crackdown gave fresh impetus to the nation's Hindu nationalist opposition to target the federal government over corruption issues. Recently, Hazare launched a new hunger strike to add pressure to his persistent demands for a tough anti-corruption law. Hazare and his supporters are also seeking special investigations into allegations of corruption they have made against more than a dozen of India's federal government ministers, including Singh. The government has denied the allegations. The 75-year-old former army driver ended the strike abruptly as crowds waned. He then announced he would work to give a new ""political alternative"" to Indians. Earlier this year, the Congress Party suffered electoral defeat in the key state of Uttar Pradesh in a result that was widely seen as a litmus test for Singh's government ahead of the 2014 national elections.","NEW: Baba Ramdev is released after short detention, police spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A mining company has found what may be the largest gold deposit ever found in the British Isles, the company's chairman said Tuesday. The price of gold is at historic highs, making new prospects very valuable. Drill samples indicate more than 1 million ounces of gold may lie below what is now rolling Irish countryside, said Richard Conroy, the chairman of Dublin, Ireland-based Conroy Diamonds and Gold. With the price of gold near historic highs, the find could be worth as much as $300 million on the market, Conroy told CNN. The company has been working for 10 years to find gold in a 1,500-square kilometer (600-square-mile) area spanning the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he said. The site where the company found the gold is near Clontibret, a village in the northern part of Ireland, he said. ""I think it's a major development in Ireland that we now have a significant gold resource,"" Conroy said. ""It's the largest amount of gold, the largest number of ounces, that's ever been reported in Ireland, or indeed in either Britain or Ireland."" The price of gold is currently around $900 an ounce on global commodities markets. Factoring in costs for mine construction and operation, Conroy said, the gold near Clontibret could fetch roughly $300 million. The company now plans to do more drilling at the site and conduct feasibility studies before moving ahead, he said. An analyst cautioned, however, that the reported amount of gold is still only an estimate. ""Until you've actually mined the stuff, there's always a moderate level of uncertainty,"" said William Tankard, a senior analyst at metals consultancy GFMS in London. One million ounces, if confirmed, would be significant for both Conroy and Ireland, Tankard said. Ireland has small precious metal deposits but nothing as large as Conroy's reported find, Tankard said. Conroy said only one gold mine is currently active in Ireland. ""By no means is it world-leading, but a million ounces is certainly worth thinking about,"" Tankard said. Tankard added that the quality of the gold -- including grade and how concentrated it is -- will also affect its value.","Company finds what may be largest gold deposit found in Britain or Ireland .

"(CNN)  -- A cargo ship off the coast of Somalia escaped pirates who attacked it Thursday with grenade launchers and machine guns, sparking a fire on board, the Russian Transportation Ministry said on its Web site. The pirates raced toward the ship, the Captain Maslov, in a high-speed boat late Thursday afternoon and attacked as it headed from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Mombasa, Kenya, the ministry said. The attack started a fire on board the Cypriot-owned, Russian-operated Captain Maslov, but the crew members were able to extinguish the flames, the ministry said. It said none of the 17 Russian crew members aboard was injured in the attack, which occurred about 300 miles off the Somali coast. Afterward, the Captain Maslov was able to escape the pirates by ""maneuvering,"" and continued to Mombasa, the ministry said. No other details were available. The ship is owned by Cyprus' Diataxis Shipping Company and is operated by a Russian shipping company, FESCO Transport Group. The ministry said Russia's Foreign Ministry, the Federal Security Service and the Defense Ministry were alerted to the attack, and the Russian government established contact with rescue centers in nearby Seychelles and Kenya. The attack was also reported to the Russian naval ship Neustrashimy, the ministry said. A day earlier Russia's navy said the Neustrashimy and a British frigate, HMS Cumberland, had rebuffed pirates' attempts to seize the Danish ship MV Powerful in the Gulf of Aden. It was not clear from the Russian navy when that incident occurred. The British Ministry of Defense said a crew from the Cumberland had boarded a small boat on Tuesday that ""they ... believe had been involved in an attack on the Danish-registered MV Powerful earlier in the day."" Two alleged pirates were killed during shooting between those aboard the small boat and Cumberland crew members, the statement said. A third person, a Yemeni national, died later from injuries, despite care from the Cumberland's doctor, it said. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Russian-operated ship attacked with grenade launchers, machine guns .

"(CNN) -- Seven suspected pirates were in the custody of Yemeni authorities early Friday, after they were picked up in the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden. International warships are now patrolling a vast area off the horn of Africa. The Royal Danish Navy said one of its warships, the HDMS Absalon, rescued the seven men Wednesday after they were found in a powerless skiff with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s aboard, navy spokesman Jesper Lynge told CNN. They were found approximately 75 nautical miles (140 kilometers) off the coast of Yemen after a distress call, Lynge said. A reporter on board the HDMS Absalon, Rasmus Tantholt, who works for Denmark's TV2, did not dispute the Danish navy's account. Video from TV2 showing the rescue of the suspected pirates clearly supports the Danish explanation. However, a Yemeni Interior Ministry official offered a different account of events, saying its coast guard rescued the suspected pirates Friday. The official said a coast guard patrol had detected a boat near a port near Balhaf, Yemen, and, believing its activity to be suspicious, chased it down. The coast guard exchanged fire with the men on board the boat, the official said, and the Somali boat overturned. The official said the coast guard rescued the men and took them into custody. Interrogation of the men led officials to suspect that they are Somali pirates. Despite the Yemeni official's contention, video showed the lone skiff floating helplessly before the Danish sent a small boat to get the men. Once the men were rescued, the Danish navy fired at the skiff, destroying it. Lynge said the men ""had been without propulsion on their small boat for several days without food or drinking water."" After giving the men medical treatment aboard the Absalon, the ship's crew turned them over to Yemen's coast guard Friday morning, Tantholt said. The skiff's small engine was broken, and the Danish vessel sank the boat to prevent any hazard to sea traffic. The men are suspected to be pirates because of the weapons on board, Lynge said. Pirates frequently use small boats to attack commercial vessels with small arms and grenades, but he said the Absalon crew could not connect the men ""directly with another pirate attack in the area."" He said the skiff was found in Yemeni waters, and the Absalon crew was instructed to hand over the men to Yemen's coast guard. Pirates have seized many ships in recent weeks in the waters of the Gulf of Aden, which separates Yemen from Somalia at the entrance to the Red Sea. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off the coast of Somalia and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. A multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, other NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters in the area. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. CNN's Katy Byron contributed to this report.","NEW: Video supports Danish navy's explanation that it rescued men .

"(CNN) -- A truck stop is an assault on the senses, especially on a hot summer day. There's the smell of diesel, the taste of exhaust fumes and the nerve-jangling, ever-present rumble of truck engines -- even when the drivers are asleep. Buck Threehouse, right, explains the BlueCool system to a trucker at a Georgia truck stop. Typically, truckers idle their engines during warm weather while they're resting, to keep the air conditioning on and the cabs cool. Some truckers use devices that cool cabs without idling. Most of these technologies either use batteries, which eventually wear out and have to be replaced, or fuel, which emits pollution. But Webasto, a company that makes trucking equipment, has found an alternative. ""It's old technology turned new,"" said John Thomas, director of commercial vehicles for Webasto Products, North America. ""Actually, some people call it 'high-tech ice.' "" Webasto calls the system BlueCool. The heart of the system is a 300-pound black box that's mounted on the truck's frame rail. As the trucker drives, the system sends refrigerant through a matrix of graphite and a water/glycol mixture inside the box, creating blocks of ice. When the truck is stopped, the driver turns on an air handler that circulates coolant around the ice and blows cold air from the unit into the bunk area of the cab. The fan and circulation pump use only 3.5 to 10 amps from the truck's battery -- which means there's no danger of draining the battery, Webasto says. ""When it's running it doesn't have any emissions or use any fuel,"" said Thomas. He said BlueCool can maintain a comfortable bunk temperature for up to ten hours. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates idling trucks consume nearly one gallon of fuel per hour, while emitting nitrogen oxides and particulates, which contribute to smog. A growing number of states and municipalities forbid trucks from idling for more than a few minutes. The pollution problem prompted Webasto to launch a campaign to raise awareness of the idling issue. It's called Make A Leap (Leap stands for Lowering Emissions and Particulates). The campaign's web site, http://www.makealeap.org/, is full of sobering state-by-state and national statistics. The site says 7.2 percent of the national daily oil consumption is attributed to heavy-duty truck idling. To decrease that percentage and increase awareness of BlueCool, Webasto hired a trucker named Buck Threehouse to take a BlueCool-equipped truck on a summer publicity tour of truck stops across the country. The tour coincided with spiking fuel prices and appears to have succeeded -- Webasto sold 500 BlueCool units in July, its best month ever. Threehouse said truckers have showed a lot of interest. ""What really sells the item -- they come and the truck's not idling. And all the trucks around me are idling,"" he said. Sometimes, he said, ""they wake me up at 3:00 in the morning and ask me for brochures. They can't [wait until daylight], they have to deliver a load. And then they keep apologizing to me for waking me up."" On a hot recent day at a Georgia truck stop, truckers were especially attracted by the prospect of burning less diesel. Mo Ndow, who owns a small fleet of trucks, said, ""Most drivers. . .are on the road 100 days a year, so basically the more days you're out there, the more money you spend trying to stay cool."" Ndow said his truckers currently use IdleAire, an electrical system trucks can plug into for cooling, heating, and other services like the Internet. But IdleAire is available only at a limited number of truck stops, and Ndow said he's considering BlueCool. Webasto's Thomas said the installation price of a BlueCool system is approximately $5500. The system pays for itself in less than a year, he said. It sounds like sales hype, but Thomas' comment is backed up by EPA statistics. The EPA estimates the typical truck idles 2400 hours per year. At $4 a gallon, that's $9600 in annual fuel costs.","A company has developed technology that cools truck cabs without engine idling .

"London (CNN) -- It's the time of year when hammers are poised at the world's major auction houses and the strength of the art market for the coming year is tested. Following a trend set in the last few years, Impressionist and Modern works of art are likely to be the big sellers. ""Impressionist and Modern art has been very strong for a number of years, but it seems to be getting stronger and stronger,"" said Deborah Allan, Head of the Impressionist & Modern Art Department at Bonhams auction house in London. ""It's amazing really, even with the huge financial problems that have been happening worldwide,"" she said. Bonhams clocked sales for works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso at their Impressionist and Modern Sale Tuesday. The star lots included a Modigliani portrait of a woman and a Picasso painting of Notre Dame in Paris, which sold for £1.3 million and $1.4 million (£825,250 and £864,450) respectively, both just shy of their $1.6 million upper estimates. On the same day, three works of art from the Elizabeth Taylor collection fetched a combined £13.7 million ($21.7m) at Christie's auction house, more than doubling their pre-sale low estimate of £6.2 million. An additional 35 works from the film star's fine art collection will be offered for sale on 8 February as part of Christie's continuing sales series devoted to Impressionist and Modern Art. Over at Sotheby's auction house in London, auctioneers also anticipate a healthy sale Wednesday, with star lots in the form of paintings by Claude Monet and Austrian painter Gustav Klimt. Dating from 1901, the painting by Klimt depicts the shore of a lake, bordered by birch trees, and is estimated to sell for between $9.5 million and $13 million (£6 million and £8 million). It is particularly unique because it has been in the same family collection for over 100 years, said Helena Newman, Chairman of Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art, Europe. See also: Leonardo: The man, the myth, the mystery . ""(The painting) hasn't been seen in a public exhibition or appeared at auction and it's rather exciting for the market place because that sort of thing only happens very rarely,"" she said. Interest in the Viennese symbolist painter, perhaps best-known for his 1907 painting ""Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" -- which sold in 2006 for a reported $135 million, at the time the highest sum ever paid for a painting -- has been steadily growing these last few years. A landscape painting by Klimt, which had been stolen by the Nazis and eventually returned to the heir of the original owner, sold at Sotheby's in New York in November 2011 for $40.4 million. With 2012 marking the 150th anniversary of the artist's birth, it is quite possible that the 1901 work ""Lakeshore with birches"" will smash its upper estimate at Sotheby's on Wednesday. Also included in the sale is a painting of a snowy landscape by Impressionist artist Claude Monet, which like the Klimt is entering the market after a long period -- nearly 100 years -- in a private collection. It is expected to sell for between $7 million and $10 million (£4.5 million and £6.5 million). ""It's from the mid-1880s, when Monet was at Giverny,"" said Newman of Sotheby's. ""There was an account of some snow falling and (Monet) immediately muffled himself up and went out and put his easel on the road in order to capture en plein air the extraordinary effect of the light,"" she explained. Despite a rocky year in the financial markets, Newman believes that the range and depth of works in the sale at Sotheby's reflects confidence in the market. See also: Picasso, Mondrian works stolen in Athens heist . ""Sellers have recognized that there is a huge global demand for a whole range of collectors both established and relatively new who are looking to buy top quality material of Impressionist and Modern art,"" she said. Allan at Bonhams echoed this, saying that the market for Impressionist and Modern art is particularly strong because as less great works with historical provenance come on the market, they become more and more expensive. ""I think also with the true globalization of buyers, (the market is now) so international, and with the internet and internet bidding, it's so easy to access our sales (and) it's really changed the market,"" she said. And paintings by Impressionists escape a recently implemented EU Artist's Resale Right Directive, which applies to European artists who have died in the past 70 years as well as living European artists -- though Newman doesn't believe the charge, which caps at a maximum of 12,500 Euros ($16,500) on a transaction, will deter buyers. ""The average lot value in our evening sale is £1.5 million ($1.9 million) so in the grand scheme of things I don't anticipate that it will have a measurable effect,"" said Newman.","Impressionist and Modern auction sales kick off in London; will test the strength of the global art market .
Popularity for Impressionist and Modern artworks still high, in spite of problems in the global financial markets .
Star lots of sales at Bonhams and Sotheby's include paintings by Monet, Klimt, Modigliani and Picasso .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Three British guards jumped overboard and were rescued from the water after battling in vain to prevent pirates hijacking a chemical tanker off the coast of Somalia. Three British security guards board a helicopter to be transferred to a Royal Navy vessel. The Liberian-flagged Biscaglia came under ""sustained and heavy attack"" early Friday morning, Nick Davis, Director of Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions (APMSS), said in a statement. The three APMSS-employed security guards -- all former British servicemen -- mounted ""sustained non-lethal resistance"" but were unable to stop the attackers seizing control of the ship, Davis said. The trio were airlifted to safety by a German naval helicopter and flown to a French frigate after the vessel summoned assistance from coalition warships. They were later transferred to a British Royal Navy ship. All three were unhurt, Davis said. ""I have spoken with my team leader on the phone and he informs me that the level of violence was significant and forced them reluctantly to leave the vessel after every effort was made to ensure the safety of the ships crew,"" Davis said. Pirates continued to shoot at the three in the water, Davis said. ""The hijacked vessel with pirates in control then attempted to run them down."" The Biscaglia is managed by Singapore-based Ishima and owned by Winged Foot Shipping in the Marshall Islands and was crewed by 25 Indians and two Bangladeshis who are believed to be still onboard. The vessel is believed to be on its way to an anchorage in Puntland, northeastern Somalia, Davis said. iReport.com: Share your view from 'Inside Africa' Also Friday, pirates released the Greek ship MV Centauri, which was hijacked in September off the coast of Somalia, according to Andrew Mwangura, the head of the Kenya Seafarers Association. There was no immediate information about the 25 crew members on board the ship when it was taken. A multinational naval force including vessels from the U.S., NATO member states, Russia and India has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters seas near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, following a sharp increase in pirate attacks in the region. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off the coast of Somalia coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center. The most high-profile hijacking so far came earlier this month, when pirates seized a Saudi oil tanker carrying $100 million worth of oil and a crew of 25, although that attack occurred outside the pirates' normal operational range, 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya. Pirates are still holding the ship. Another vessel held since September is the Ukrainian MV Farina, which was carrying a cargo of weapons and tanks and a crew of 22. In an interview provided to CNN this week, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue as long as life in Somalia remained desperate. ""The pirates are living between life and death,"" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. ""Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything."" The interview was conducted in August by journalists working for the Somali news organization, Garowe.","3 security guards battle pirates, jump overboard as tanker hijacked off Somalia .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A week after Samsung was ordered to pay $1 billion to Apple for patent infringements, a Japanese court has backed the South Korean company in another dispute with its U.S. rival. The Tokyo District Court on Friday ruled that Samsung did not infringe Apple's patents for its iPhone and iPad for some of its Galaxy smartphones and the Galaxy tablet. The case focused on technology used in Samsung's Galaxy S, Galaxy S2 and Galaxy Tab 7 devices to synchronize music and video with a computer -- technology Apple says its rival copied. However Judge Tamotsu Shoji disagreed and threw out Apple's 100 million yen ($1.27 million) claim and ordered the California-based tech giant to pay the costs of the lawsuit. It has 30 days to file an appeal. Samsung to fight U.S. court ruling . In a statement released by Samsung after the decision, it said: ""We have been strongly appealing that our products do not infringe the patents of Apple U.S. and its completely different technology. ""The verdict recognizes the lawfulness of our company. We think it is very appropriate."" A ruling against Samsung would have been a severe setback in one of its most lucrative markets. The South Korean company is already facing the prospect of a U.S. ban on Samsung smartphones and computer tablets found to have violated Apple's patents -- described by one Samsung executive as ""absolutely the worst scenario for us."" This followed last Friday's decision by a U.S. federal jury to order Samsung to pay Apple $1.05 billion for copying the look and feel of the iPhone and iPad design. A nine-person jury spent just two and a half days puzzling out its final verdict, with weeks of notes and memories of testimony, 109 pages of jury instructions, and boxes of evidence including a collection of contested smartphones and tablets as their guide. The lawsuit was the largest yet in the ongoing worldwide patent brawl between the two companies, which itself is just one battle in Apple's war against Google's Android mobile operating system. In another case just days before, a South Korean court found that both parties had infringed on each other's patents -- Samsung was ordered to pay $33,300 for infringing two of the intellectual property rights for Apple's iPhone and iPad, while Apple was found to have infringed Samsung's Wi-Fi technology and ordered to pay $22,000 in damages.

"(CNN) -- What do you see when you come across a big tire dump? One company pulverizes old tires into fine grains to use in other products. An eyesore? A nursery for mosquitoes? Potential for a headline-grabbing, months-long tire fire? Tony Cialone sees ""the nation's newest raw material."" Cialone is founder of Lehigh Technologies, a Naples, Florida, company that pulverizes rubber from used tires and factory scrap into powder as fine as talc. The powder can be used in manufacturing products that would benefit from the durability of rubber, such as longer-lasting paint, UV-resistant plastics and more elastic sealants. ""What makes a tire so difficult to dispose of -- it doesn't want to break down, it lasts forever ... it's the same type of attributes we can bring to new products,"" Cialone says. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that about a quarter of scrap tires are left in landfills each year. The rest are used as fuel, retreaded or recycled for other projects. The powder from Cialone's business also can be used in manufacturing new tires. Lehigh Technologies Chief Financial Officer Patrick George says that the rising prices for oil-based synthetic rubber and natural rubber are an incentive for companies to re-use rubber. Several years ago, while working in the business of recycling newspapers, bottles and cans, Cialone was asked to find a use for unwanted tires. Cialone says he talked with potential customers of recycled rubber to determine what they would need. Ultrafine particles, in large volume, was the answer. So he ended up in Germany at a company that did precision-grinding of pharmaceuticals for time-release capsules. ""I walked in with my bag of rubber and they threw me out,"" Cialone recalls. But they invited him back, ran the rubber through their process, and produced the powder Cialone was looking for. Cialone bought the company, and in 2006 put that process to work at a plant in suburban Atlanta. The process works like this: Lehigh brings in scrap rubber from tire manufacturers and rubber chips from tire recyclers who have already removed the steel and fiber. The rubber is sliced and diced, then frozen with liquid nitrogen to make it extremely brittle. Then it's shaken, crushed, cut and ground to various fine sizes for various needs. Several companies are testing out the powder in their products. ""We have a variety of customers, everyone from customers who manufacture tires, to customers who manufacture automotive parts like wheel wells, or bumpers, or paints and coatings, companies that are making rubberized flat bed inner liners, to companies that are using it for paints for home use, or backing to carpet underlayment,"" Cialone says. The plant can grind out up to 100 million pounds of powder per year. The company is planning to build an additional facility in 2008. Pulverizing rubber is not new, says Mike Blumenthal, senior technical director for the Rubber Manufacturers Association, a trade group. But Lehigh is grinding the powder finer than other companies. ""Lehigh could have an impact if they are successful because they will open up new opportunities that up to now have not been available,"" Blumenthal says.","About a quarter of scrap tires are left in landfills each year, according to the EPA .

"(CNN) -- A judge has ordered that the beard of Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood, be forcibly shaved ahead of his upcoming military trial, base spokesman Tyler Broadway said Thursday. Col. Gregory Gross issued the order, which will likely trigger an appeal that would further delay a case that has dragged on since the 2009 mass shooting. Hasan's attorney had filed an appeal when Gross threatened to order the shaving, but the appeals court said it wouldn't issue a decision until the shaving was actually ordered. Thursday's order by Gross opens the door for that appeal. The last time he was in court, Hasan told the judge, ""Your honor, in the name of almighty Allah, I am a Muslim. I believe that my religion requires me to wear a beard."" His defense team argued Hasan should be able to keep his beard under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, contending that shaving it would leave him in a ""perilous religious state,"" according to a news release from Fort Hood. The defense contends Hasan's faith is genuine and has gotten stronger in the past year. But government prosecutors argued he should have to shave his beard, saying having it long would make it harder for witnesses to identify him as the shooter in court. They also said that Hasan, by keeping his beard long, is trying to associate himself with radical Islamic fighters known as mujahedeen, the Fort Hood press release said. In his ruling, Gross determined that Hasan cannot keep the beard because it violates Army regulations. Even as he awaits trial for murder, Hasan is still an officer in the U.S. Army and subject to regulations. Hasan's court-martial had been scheduled to start last month at Fort Hood, in Killeen, Texas, where he is accused of wounding 32 in addition to killing 13 people. No further hearings are scheduled in his military trial, according to the Army base. His lawyers can now go to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, administered by the Judge Advocate General's Corps. The next step would be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, an independent tribunal with worldwide jurisdiction over active-duty members of the U.S. armed forces and others subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The District of Columbia-based court is made up of five civilian judges appointed for 15-year terms by the president. Decisions of the court are subject to direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The full appeals process could delay Hasan's criminal trial for months if not years. Accused Fort Hood shooter makes first statement in court .

"Tianjin, China (Financial Times) -- Wen Jiabao, China's premier, has promised Beijing will do more to boost flagging growth in the Chinese economy in the coming months as he delivered a spirited defence of his economic legacy and his decade in power. His speech at the World Economic Forum in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin on Tuesday is likely to be his last high-profile appearance on the global stage before he is replaced as the third-most-senior cadre in the Chinese Communist party next month. He is scheduled to step down as premier in March next year. Mr Wen acknowledged the downturn that has gathered pace in China in recent months. But he insisted his government still had the ability and the will to stabilise the economy, albeit at lower levels than the annual average 10.7 per cent growth seen throughout his time in office. ""Even though our government revenues slowed significantly in the past two months, by the end of July we still had about Rmb1tn [$158bn] in surplus on our government balance sheet and we have set aside around Rmb100bn as our stability and adjustment fund which we will not hesitate to use,"" Mr Wen said. He outlined a number of steps the government had taken this year to prop up the Chinese economy, including tax cuts, interest rate cuts, steady growth in the money supply and stepped up infrastructure investment. But he stressed that the government had not yet taken any extraordinary measures beyond the budget published at the start of the year and pledged that China would meet its target of expanding the economy by 7.5 per cent this year. The economy grew 7.8 per cent in the first half of the year and has deteriorated since then, putting it on track to grow by its lowest annual rate in 13 years. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Wen Jiabao acknowledged the downturn that has gathered pace in China .

"(CNN) -- Toyota's third-generation Prius, due at dealerships this spring, will have an optional solar panel on its roof. The panel will power a ventilation system that can cool the car without help from the engine, Toyota says. Solar Electric Vehicles in California makes a roof-mounted solar panel for a standard Toyota Prius. But it's a long way from the 2010 Prius to a solar-powered car, experts told CNN. Most agree that there just isn't enough space on a production car to get full power from solar panels. ""Being able to power a car entirely with solar is a pretty far-reaching goal,"" said Tony Markel, a senior engineer at the federal government's National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. In the new Prius, the solar panel will provide energy for a ventilation fan that will help cool the parked car on sunny, hot days. The driver can start the fan remotely before stepping into the car. Once the car is started, the air conditioning won't need as much energy from a battery to do the rest of the cooling. ""The best thing about using solar is that regardless of what you end up using it for, you're trying to use it to displace gasoline,"" added Markel. The question is, how much gasoline can solar power offset? Markel said his lab has modified a Prius to use electricity from the grid for its main batteries and a solar panel for the auxiliary systems. He believes the car gets an additional 5 miles of electric range from the panel. According to recent articles in Japan's Nikkei newspaper, Toyota has bigger plans for harnessing power from the sun. Nikkei reports that Toyota hopes to develop a vehicle powered entirely by solar panels. The project will take years, the paper reported. When contacted by CNN, however, a Toyota spokeswoman denied the existence of the project. ""At this time there are no plans that we know of to produce a concept or production version of a solar-powered car,"" said Amy K. Taylor, a communications administrator in Toyota's Environmental, Safety & Quality division. Motorists don't have to wait for a 2010 Prius to drive a solar-enhanced car, however. Greg Johanson, president of Solar Electric Vehicles in Westlake Village, California, said his company makes a roof-mounted panel for a standard Prius that enables the car to travel up to 15 additional miles a day. The system costs $3,500, and it takes about a week to make one, Johanson said. Billy Bautista, a project coordinator at the company, said Solar Electric Vehicles gets so many requests for the system that there is a backlog of several months. The company's Web site says motorists can install the panels themselves, although it recommends finding a ""qualified technician."" The system delivers about 165 watts of power per hour to an added battery, which helps powers the electric motor, Johanson said. But others said it would take a lot more power than that to replace an internal combustion engine. Eric Leonhardt, director of the Vehicle Research Institute at Western Washington University, said that even if solar cells worked far better than they do today, they wouldn't generate enough power for driving substantial distances. The best cells operate at about 33 percent efficiency, but the ones used on vehicles are only about 18 percent efficient, he said. Leonhardt said it would be more practical to use solar power to help charge a car's battery and use the more efficient panels mounted on a roof or over a parking area to supply the rest of the electricity needed to drive the engine. ""Solar panels really need a lot of area,"" he said. Leonhardt thinks Toyota's new Prius is a good first step toward using renewable energy. Some cars get hotter than 150 degrees inside when parked in the sun, so reducing the temperature could mean Toyota could use a smaller AC unit, he added. Johanson of Solar Electric Vehicles said he'd like to see Toyota bring the weight of a Prius down from 3,000 pounds to 2,000. He also hopes for a small gasoline engine and a larger electric motor. That will probably come in the future, when Toyota unveils a plug-in engine. In the meantime, Solar Electric Vehicles sells its version of a plug-in Prius, with a solar panel installed, for $25,000, Bautista said. Toyota is the largest automaker to incorporate solar power into a mass-produced car. But its solar panel is not the first for a car company. Audi uses one on its upscale A8 model, and Mazda tried one on its 929 in the 1990s. In addition, a French motor company, Venturi, has produced an electric-solar hybrid. The Eclectic model costs $30,000, looks like a souped-up golf cart and uses roof-mounted solar panels to help power an electric engine. It has a range of about 30 miles and has a top speed of about 30 mph. CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","The 2010 Toyota Prius, due this spring, will have an optional solar panel on its roof .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Ron Howard is one of Hollywood's biggest directors, but lately he's been delving outside of studio blockbusters to take on other kinds of projects. ""My kids are grown, and I feel that I can afford the time to just be a little, you know, a little more experimental,"" he tells Rolling Stone. The 58-year-old recently trailed Jay-Z for an upcoming documentary he's directing about the rapper's role in the Budweiser Made in America Festival due out in 2013; he's mentoring James Murphy on his first directorial project; and he'll soon return as the narrator of the upcoming season of ""Arrested Development."" Says Howard of the comedy series' new season, ""It's hilarious and it's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters, and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments."" So did you have fun hanging out with Jay-Z? I really did. The whole thing was interesting for me. I've never interviewed anybody, first of all. I'm pretty good at the initial instincts, and the very first time that I met [Jay-Z] some months back, we met with him in his office and there was just something that I really respected about him. I think he's pretty true to himself and pretty clear about what he thinks. Kind of the opposite of mercurial, I'd say. I don't know what the opposite of mercurial is, but he's I think tremendously focused. I've been around a lot of artists who are also good at business and . . . one minute they'll sound like an artist and the next minute they'll sound like the characters in ""Mad Men."" Jay-Z's a very good businessman and he talks about it and enjoys it, but he doesn't shift. He has a sense of what he thinks people might appreciate, because he sort of trusts that if he appreciates it, there are people out there who will as well. And that's what's interesting to me: that he's accomplished in those areas but I don't hear that sort of cynical, world-weary quality. Jay-Z Gets Assist From Kanye at Made in America . And when he's onstage, the confidence he has with the microphone is pretty amazing. I got to watch in the pit, right on the edge on the stage. I understood something that I never even really had thought about before. He really communicates, whereas I think some of the other hip hop artists -- they were great performers and they were dynamic and charismatic -- but on a consistent basis, every idea seemed to be a communication. I always thought that about Sinatra. It's a connection. It's a story they're telling you. And I was kind of knocked out by that. I've never seen Eminem live, but in our movie, 8 Mile, I felt like that was happening. You interviewed Odd Future. What was that like? I like their videos. I'm laughing one minute, then my jaw drops the next. But I think they're so wild and great and I really like them. [Tyler, the Creator] and I just started talking and he just kept looking at me kind of like squinting and saying, ""You're sick. You're sick."" [Laughs] I kind of knew it was a compliment, but I was joking later and said, ""I thought I looked fine!"" I was trying to describe them to somebody. It's kind of like there's the Marx Brothers and National Lampoon . . . this group chaos thing. It's pretty exciting to see that brand of anarchy and self expression adding up to so much. Jay-Z, actually, was really interested in them. He said to me that he, you know, Roc Nation, wanted to sign them and they went down the road discussing it, but ultimately Odd Future didn't want to be signed. They wanted to be self-reliant, self -contained. Were there any highlights from the festival? I think getting to talk to D'Angelo. Photos: Live at Made in America 2012 . That's a very rare interview. Yeah, and I don't think he's done very many. I wouldn't characterize it as probing, but, because it was on the subject of the event, I was glad to be able to share with him what I was hearing from everybody -- which is that everyone was so impressed with his reemergence and a kind of new level of musicianship. I heard that from several people. And I passed that along to him, so more than sort of the interview I was glad to be able to communicate that to him, and he was, I think, flattered to hear that. But you know, he's really focused and hard at it, and I think he's really glad to be out there. It was also fun to see Run-DMC. I talked to them both and they barely rehearsed. I remembered that when Henry Winkler and I, four years ago, did this Funny or Die sketch for Obama. It was so funny, because I was wearing this hair piece, Henry was wearing kind of Fonzie wig and we fell into it and I swear to God, I honestly dÃ©ja vÃ»'ed and thought I was back in the Arnold's parking lot doing a scene. It was so easy. So when I saw those guys, they just nailed it. I just thought, ""Well, yeah, you know, sometimes when a thing becomes a part of a fabric of your life, your history, that doesn't get so rusty."" When you were younger, because of Happy Days and American Graffiti, people associated you with music of the Fifties and early Sixties. What do you listen to? I've never been much of a consumer and we didn't listen to much music in the home except kind of at Christmas time, so it was all Bing [Crosby] and Nat King Cole and the Everly Brothers. But it never became a passion. I didn't really listen to music when I was doing homework or when I when I work on a script. I tend to drift to NPR and news. It's interesting that you're working with James Murphy, too. Oh, yeah. My kids are grown, and I feel that I can afford the time to just be a little, you know, a little more experimental about what I do with my time away from the movies and the TV shows, which are still my main drive. James Murphy just came through this project, Canon's Imagination. This is year two of that, and last year we did it and my daughter Bryce directed the film, and people send in pictures targeting their own photographs for certain narrative categories. And then the public votes and they narrow it down to 10, and last year I chose one from each category and handed it over to Bryce and she had to direct a movie. And it was successful. It was a great creative experiment. With James Murphy, we wanted somebody from the music world, and of course he's so creative and visual and a really talented and intelligent guy. So I'm actually dying to see what he does with this exercise. I think I'm going to be inspired by him. Theoretically, I'm supposed to be offering some guidance and support, but I think he's one of the ones I'm sort of most curious about seeing work with this whole program. Would you ever work with Jay-Z again? I would do a documentary about Jay-Z. Yes, I would. I mean, that's not what this is particularly, but he's central to it. But if I had a chance and I thought I could do it justice, you know, I think he's a great subject. He's a great subject. Definitely. How is it going with ""Arrested Development""? It's going great. There's a really good article that somebody did, an interview with Mitch Hurwitz. It's pretty funny. It's hilarious, and it's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments that are, you know, a brand new sort of five-alarm fires or however many alarms, whatever the maximum number of alarms is. I should remember that from ""Backdraft,"" but I don't. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Ron Howard says the new season of ""Arrested Development"" is ""hilarious and it's also really bold""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Environmentally friendly engineering is really right up Chicago's alley -- in a city project called Green Alleys. Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan. The program aims to stop polluted rainwater in the city's alleyways from ending up in adjacent Lake Michigan. Chicago's 13,000 alleys, which allow rear access to buildings, date back to the 1800s. The 1,900 miles of back alleys ease access for garbage collection, loading and parking. They also make up about 3,500 acres of impermeable surface, which has created a big problem. Many of the alleys were built without connections to storm sewers. Rainwater puddles on the pavement and can run into buildings, sometimes flooding basements. ""We wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing, putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system,"" said Janet Attarian, sustainability coordinator with the Chicago Department of Transportation. So, the extreme alley makeover started with the pavement. The alleys are being resurfaced with concrete, asphalt or paving stones that are permeable -- that is, water runs through them like a sieve to the dirt beneath. Microbes that thrive on stuff like fertilizer and oil are seeded into the pavement or migrate there naturally. They cleanse the water of pollutants from cars and lawns. The cleaner water makes its way into the groundwater, called an aquifer, and then flows into Lake Michigan. That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year. But only about 1 percent of that water finds its way back to the lake, Attarian said. ""So by infiltrating that aquifer, we have a chance to [give] some of that water back."" Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light. The surface is lighter in color, reflecting more sunlight and absorbing less. ""It's like putting on a white T-shirt instead of a black one on a hot summer day,"" Attarian said. ""It cools the city off and reduces our carbon footprint."" Other features of the Green Alley program include the use of recycled materials in pavement and energy-efficient light fixtures that direct light downward to reduce light pollution. How green are those alleys? Chicago has greened 40 of them, with 48 more scheduled to get the treatment this year.","Chicago covers alleys with special concrete that cleans polluted rain runoff .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The conspicuous absence from public view of China's presumptive next top leader is adding new uncertainty to the succession plan for the normally secretive Communist leadership. For ten days, Vice President Xi Jinping has dropped off the radar of state-run domestic news media, which usually meticulously record official activities of senior leaders. Xi is widely expected to succeed President Hu Jintao as the head of the ruling Communist Party next month before assuming the presidency early next year in a once-in-a-decade power transition. Party chiefs jockey for power ahead of leadership jamboree . The mystery of what is keeping him out of the spotlight at such a time has provoked growing speculation in a political atmosphere already rife with intrigue following the scandal that brought down the high-profile party official Bo Xilai earlier this year. Xi's absence was first noticed September 5, when he abruptly canceled meetings with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as other foreign dignitaries including the Singaporean prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. U.S. officials said their Chinese counterparts had blamed a ""scheduling conflict"" for the cancellation. Chinese officials declined to provide an explanation. Then Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, reported that Xi would meet the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, on Monday and journalists were invited to cover the occasion. When CNN called the Chinese Foreign Ministry to inquire about the event, a displeased official, who declined to be identified, said, ""If you don't see an event listed on our website, then it's not public and there is no need to call."" Monday has come and gone -- and Xi remains nowhere to be seen, adding fuel to an Internet firestorm running on rumors and gossip. Despite the Chinese censors' best efforts to ban discussion of the subject, unsubstantiated theories have proliferated online, with wild plot lines ranging from a car crash to an assassination attempt. Who are the next generation of Chinese leaders? Less fantastical are suggestions by some observers and media reports that Xi's absence from the public eye is the result of a health problem such as a back injury or a mild stroke. Rather than deflate the speculation with an official explanation, the Chinese authorities have so far remained silent. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, has dodged questions on the subject several days in a row. Major news websites like Netease dug up week-old photos of Xi on Monday and republished official accounts of his last public appearance on September 1. Sporting a dark suit and a purple tie, the 59-year-old leader looked well and was seen addressing students of the Central Party School in Beijing. Regardless of the cause of his subsequent absence, some analysts say the current frenzied speculation highlights the shortcomings of the Chinese authorities' stonewalling approach to the subject. ""In most countries including in Asia, people are entitled to know the health of their leaders, but in China this is still regarded as state secrets,"" said Willy Lam, a longtime China watcher who teaches politics and history at universities in Hong Kong and Japan. ""The Chinese leadership is worried about social stability,"" echoed David Zweig, a seasoned China observer and a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""But nothing creates greater social instability than this kind of lack of information about the leadership."" Already, China's leadership transition this year has been marred by extraordinary twists and turns. In April, Bo Xilai, once considered to be among party royalty and a fast-rising star within the party, was stripped of his leadership positions for an unspecified ""breach of party discipline."" He has not been seen publicly since. Disgraced Party chief looms large over China's leadership . Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted last month of murdering Neil Heywood, a British businessman, and received a suspended death sentence. And Bo's former police chief, Wang Lijun, whose attempt in February to seek asylum in a U.S. Consulate triggered the scandal, was charged last week with defection and bribe-taking. Wang is awaiting trial. Although most analysts agree the all-important 18th Communist Party Congress -- the meeting where a new generation of leaders, headed by Xi, is expected to be confirmed -- will be held in the middle of next month, the authorities have not announced the dates for the gathering of some 2,200 party delegates from around the country. ""More questions are now being asked about the transparency of Chinese politics since everything is in a black box,"" said Lam. Observers say the official silence could also signal last-minute negotiations among senior political figures before they present a facade of unity to the public. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining a united front since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. ""Xi Jinping is already projected to be a weak leader because he doesn't have a power base of his own,"" said Lam, who predicted Hu Jintao will remain the head of the Chinese military for two to three years after relinquishing his party and state titles to Xi. ""Hu could be the ultimate winner here -- he will be the power behind the throne.""","Xi Jinping hasn't been seen in public for more than a week and speculation is growing .

"(CNN) -- Prolific striker Michael Owen was confirmed as a Stoke City player on Wednesday after the English Premier League approved his transfer. Owen was a free agent after being released by Manchester United at the end of last season and had been linked with a number of clubs. But the 32-year-old opted for Stoke, the deal completed right on the Tuesday deadline for clubs to register players to be part of their 25-man English Premier League squads. He was made to sweat until the EPL board ruled he was eligible, leaving Owen to express his relief on his Twitter blog. ""It's official! Deal done. I'm a Stoke player. Can't wait to get going,"" he tweeted. Owen, who has agreed a one-year deal, will be paid according to the number of appearances he makes. He has scored 149 goals in the EPL, making him the league's equal sixth highest scorer since its inception in 1992. But he is seeking to re-establish his career after failing to make an impact at Manchester United, where he scored 17 goals in 49 appearances spread across three seasons -- most of those in cup competitions or as a substitute. There had been speculation that Owen would rejoin his first club Liverpool, where he scored 18 goals in his first full EPL season and went on to notch 179 in 306 appearances. Owen, who also played for Spanish club Real Madrid before an injury-ravaged return to England with Newcastle, is England's fourth-highest goal scorer with 40 from 89 international appearances. Liverpool boss Brendan Rogers is looking for a new striker after letting England international Andy Carroll join EPL rivals West Ham on loan for this season. Carroll made an influential debut in Saturday's 3-0 win over Fulham but went off late with a hamstring injury that will rule him out for six weeks. Liverpool had been linked with another free agent in former Italy international Alessandro Del Piero, but the 37-year-old confirmed on Wednesday that he will be joining Australian club Sydney FC. The former Juventus captain told reporters that Liverpool had been one of the clubs interested, but explained on his website why he decided to move Down Under to the lesser-known A-League as one of its marquee players. ""They really wanted to have me there. They weren't the only ones, but the project they presented, seemed to be specially tailored for me -- it won me over both as an athlete and a person,"" said the veteran striker, who has agreed a two-year contract. ""I was lucky to win everything during my career and to end it in Italy winning once again with the team of my life, Juventus. I was looking for something new, something different, something that wouldn't have things in common with my past, a totally new experience. And I have found it in Sydney.""","English Premier League approve transfer of Michael Owen to Stoke City .

"Tampa (CNN) -- As the other half of a billionaire political power couple, a mother, a doctor and philanthropist, Miriam Adelson's name carries a lot of credibility with Republican women. Adelson, an expert in drug addiction who has supported countless organizations, is seen as a champion of women's issues and groups. So, for the Republican women who sat on white couches on Tuesday in the pink carnation-decorated ""Woman Up"" pavilion at the Republican National Convention listening to a strategy session on using social media, they hoped that maybe, just maybe Adelson might appear. Adelson was a no-show yet her presence was felt. Her name filled a large banner in the room, a reminder of her powerful connection and large check book. The Adelsons donated $5 million to the YG Action Fund, a super PAC founded by the same former aides to Rep. Eric Cantor who founded the YG Network. ""Dr. Adelson is pretty unique,"" said Mary Anne Carter, policy director at the YG Network, a conservative think tank that put on the ""Woman Up"" event. ""She embodies a lot of the spirit here in the pavilion. She's a mom, a doctor ... she's supportive of conservative causes ... she's giving back."" As a physician, Miriam Adelson has spent decades studying the effectiveness of using methadone to treat drug addiction. She founded a substance abuse center and research clinic at Tel Aviv's Sourasky Medical Center and the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Research Clinic in Las Vegas. She still dons a lab coat every day, according to a profile in Forbes, studies the genetic connection to addiction and works with patients.""My priorities in life are my family, to be a good mother and a loving wife. Money is down on the list of my priorities,"" Adelson told Forbes. ""That is why I have no problem to change my expensive suit for the white 'lab coat.' Ask me which one I prefer, and I will tell you that with no doubt, it is the white one."" The Adelsons have given at least $36 million to various organizations and candidates this campaign season according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics.Their donations to super PACs, including $15 million to Winning Our Future -- which backed Newt Gingrich and helped to keep his candidacy alive -- and $10 million to Restore Our Future, the main super PAC supporting Republican nominee Mitt Romney. One of Adelson's priorities is supporting and protecting Israel, where she attended a speech and fundraiser for Romney during his trip there last month. Miriam Adelson began her medical career in Israel years ago and earned a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and Genetics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and her medical degree from Tel Aviv University's Sackler Medical School, according to the Forbes profile. She became the chief emergency room internist at the Rokach Hospital in Tel Aviv. While the couple's donations to super PACs are disclosed, Sheldon Adelson has said some of his political activity may also be made to non-profit groups that do not have to disclose their contributors. Several of these organizations are hoping for sizable gifts from the couple. Adelson has told friends he is willing to spend up to $100 million this election season to not only make sure a Republican is elected to the White House but to support GOP congressional candidates. Political observers credit Miriam Adelson with helping encourage her casino magnate husband to up the ante when it comes to spending money for Republican causes. In a year when much has been made of the so-called ""war on women,"" women like Adelson add weight to Republican causes, said Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express. Kremer said Miriam Adelson is able to use her platform to amplify the views of many Republican women. ""I think it's good that women are stepping up to the plate and getting involved,"" Kremer said. ""Politics has always been a man's game.""Both the hue and the view were decidedly rosy at the Woman's Up Pavilion. The Republican women there took time to sip iced coffee, shop for GOP elephant accessories and plot how they could marshal forces to educate voters about the economic crisis and voter identification fraud. In a nearby room, there were walls dedicated to the history of powerful women in American politics. Women like Miriam Adelson, said conservative activist Carter.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Violent clashes raged between tribes in southeastern Kenya on Tuesday, a day after at least 38 people were killed in the southeast of the country, the Red Cross said. Attackers in the Tana Delta region have set homes on fire, forcing people to flee, according to the Kenya Red Cross. The fighting comes a day after a mob of more than 300 people descended on the village of Kilelengwani in the remote Tana Delta, many of them armed with spears and machetes, the agency said on Monday. Men, women and children were killed, including seven police officers who had been deployed to the area as a buffer between warring tribes. That massacre came just days after nearly a dozen people were killed in the same region in what appears to be continued tit-for-tat violence that erupted last month. The violence is blamed on the Pokomo and Orma tribes prevalent in the region. The Pokomo are largely settled farmers, and the Orma are traditionally pastoralists, tending cattle and goat herds. There has been long-running tension between the two groups over grazing rights and water sources, but it boiled over last month when the Pokomo attacked an Orma village after an apparent land dispute. More than 50 people were killed in that attack, mostly women and children. The revenge attacks are the worst violence in Kenya since more than a thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were left homeless after a disputed election in late 2007. Kenya's security forces have been heavily criticized for being unable to quell the escalating violence along the Tana River. Samuel Kilele, the police commissioner of the coast, said hundreds of police were in the area, but rugged terrain and poor infrastructure made it hard to get there. He said four local administrators were being fired for their lack of a response. But in a move indicating the seriousness of the situation, he said the Kenyan military could be brought in to bring security to the region. ""If the situation proves more volatile, then the deployment of the army will be inevitable,"" Kilele said.","Attackers set homes on fire, forcing people to flee in the remove Tana Delta region .

"(CNN) -- A detainee who was found dead over the weekend at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was identified as Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif, 32, of Yemen. U.S. Southern Command released his name Tuesday after notifying his family. Latif had been detained at Guantanamo since January 2002. The detainee was found unresponsive Saturday afternoon during a routine check, Southern Command said. Lifesaving measures were performed, but the detainee died at the hospital. Judge slams efforts to limit Guantanamo detainee access to lawyers . An autopsy was conducted, Southern Command said Tuesday, though it will be some time before the results are known. The cause of death is under investigation. Suicide has not been ruled out, according to Southern Command Sgt. Shanda De Anda. Considered a foot soldier and one of Osama bin Laden's Yemeni bodyguards, Latif is mostly known for his legal fight for his freedom. In June, appeals from him and six other detainees contesting their open-ended custody were turned aside by the Supreme Court. Federal appeals court rules against Guantanamo detainee . A federal judge had ordered Latif's release, but the appeals court subsequently concluded that he was part of the al Qaeda terror group and that the government could detain him indefinitely. His lawyers say he went to Afghanistan and Pakistan for medical treatment for a head injury, but the U.S. military -- without revealing too many specifics publicly -- said he was there to train as a terrorist in a remote al Qaeda camp.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Julian Castro is ready for his close-up. The Mayor of San Antonio is already a hot commodity in his home state of Texas and throughout the Southwest. Tonight, when the 37-year-old steps up to the lectern and becomes the first Latino to deliver a keynote speech at the Democratic Convention, the rest of the country will get a chance to see what all the fuss is about. There's a lot to see. I've known Julian for eight years, and I've interviewed him a dozen times. He's one-half of a dynamic duo; his twin brother, Joaquin, a Texas state representative who is a shoo-in to win a new congressional seat in November, will introduce him tonight. Both are graduates of Stanford University and Harvard Law School. Preview Castro's speech . With the news that one brother would introduce another, what was already going to be a big story for the Latino community in America -- 50.5 million strong, 16 percent of the U.S. population on its way to 25 percent a few decades -- just became a huge story. The optics will be out of this world. According to the polls, Obama is still ahead of Romney by more than 30 points with Latino voters. But Obama's Latino support has taken a hit because of his heavy-handed immigration enforcement record. Now, thanks to the Castros, don't be surprised if that support jumps 5 points overnight. The twins' message will be something like this: Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of our family, we have lived the American Dream. We love our community and our country, and -- if you support this president and this party -- more of these types of stories will be written. Mitt Romney's Latino outreach efforts are about to take a direct hit. I spent the morning of the speech shadowing my friend from one media interview to another, and squeezing in a few questions of my own whenever I could: . -- About what it's like to live a moment like this: . ""The enormity of it is really impressive,"" Castro told me. ""This is one of those moments where you know you need to be enjoying it as it's happening, but that's also hard to do because it's moving so fast."" -- About what he hopes his 3Â½-year-old daughter Carina, who accompanied her father to Charlotte and knows only that ""Daddy is giving a big speech,"" takes away from tonight when she reads press clippings years from now: . ""What I hope is that one day when she watches it that she understands that her family came here and sacrificed and worked hard to achieve the American Dream,"" he said. ""And that this was the moment, the pinnacle of it. And I hope that she's very proud. And I also hope, like any dad, that she goes further than I did."" Live blog: Democratic National Convention . -- About what he hopes his speech will mean to his mother, Rosie, who a generation ago was active in the Raza Unida Party (a third party born in the 1970s out of frustration with both Democrats and Republicans: . ""I hope that my mother takes away that all her generation did, the sacrifices she made, the activism that she engaged in with folks of her generation, led us to this moment,"" Castro said. ""This is the wonderful progress that the country has achieved not just for them but for so many Americans, that America has lived up to its highest ideals and our family is one example of that."" -- Lastly, about the reaction he's getting from the large contingent of Spanish-language media that is covering the convention, whose audience is more Mexican than Mexican-American, more immigrant than native-born: . ""The interviews are always very warm,"" he said. ""You can hear in people's voices a certain pride and aspiration, and of course that feels very good to me. I just want to make sure that I do a great job, and that I don't let people down."" There is little chance of that. The Castros don't let people down; they lift people up. Get ready, America. A new generation offers a leader. And a population of people who helped build this remarkable country, and who have repeatedly answered the call to defend it, have finally come into their own. We Mexican-Americans are known for our humility. But is there pride in that? You had better believe it. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Members of Latin America's largest guerrilla group declared Thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with Colombian government negotiators for peace talks next month. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- known by the Spanish acronym FARC -- have waged a bloody civil war for five decades with the Colombian government and right-wing paramilitary groups. The group is considered by the United States government to be a terrorist organization. The discussions will begin on October 8 in Oslo, Norway, six FARC members said during a news conference held in Havana on Thursday. Time is right, but past failures haunt Colombia peace talks . Chile, Cuba, Venezuela and Norway have been named as countries that will aid in the negotiations. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said Tuesday he supports the effort and named government negotiators to attempt to hammer out a treaty. A possible peace deal will face many obstacles, including long-standing allegations that FARC guerrillas have enriched themselves with ransoms paid for kidnap victims and with drug trafficking. FARC commander Mauricio Jaramillo denied reports that guerrillas still hold prisoners in remote jungle camps. ""We no longer have any captives,"" Jaramillo said before asserting that kidnappings by criminal and paramilitary organizations are often blamed on the FARC. Negotiations between the FARC and the Colombian government broke down over 10 years ago. Then-President Andres Pastrana had ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group at the start of those peace talks. The government later said the guerrillas had used the area as a base for drug trafficking and kidnapping. Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says it is impossible to hold peace talks without first securing a unilateral cease fire and criticized the proposed negotiations. Five facts about Colombia's FARC rebels . Jaramillo said a cease fire would be proposed as soon as negotiators meet next month, but the FARC is prepared to continue fighting. ""There's enough of us to keep taking the fight to the government,"" he said. As part of a road map for a possible peace deal, the FARC has said the government will need to enact land reform for peasant farmers, help coca growers plant other crops and reintegrate thousands of FARC soldiers into Colombian society. FARC representatives also decried Colombia's extradition treaty with the United States, which has led to the convictions of several FARC commanders there. ""Anyone who breaks the law in Colombia should be tried in Colombia,"" said FARC negotiator Ricardo Tellez. ""There's no need that anyone should be turned over to another country."" The issue could prove to be the first challenge to the talks, since the FARC named commander Simon Trinidad as a member of the team who will negotiate a possible peace deal. Trinidad is serving 60 years in a U.S. federal prison after a 2007 conviction on drug trafficking and terrorism charges. FARC negotiators refused to say at the news conference whether Trinidad's inclusion is symbolic or if his release is an initial demand to the Colombian government. ""We have Simon Trinidad at the negotiating table,"" FARC negotiator Andres ParÃ­s said Thursday. Boos, gunfire greet Colombian president's arrival in FARC area .

"London (CNN) -- The best time to be taking over as chief executive of a bank is when all the bad news is out in public. The announcement of Antony Jenkins' appointment as the new chief executive of Britain's Barclays came just hours after the news that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had launched a second criminal investigation into the bank's activities. Barclays has denied wrongdoing. This latest one concerns fees paid to Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) during the bank's 2008 capital raising exercise. Last month the SFO said it was probing the manipulation of Libor and other benchmark lending rates, the scandal that earlier this year cost Barclays both its former chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius. On that basis, the ideal time for Jenkins to take over would have been in six months to a year from now when the investigations are completed -- and always assuming that nothing else comes out of the woodwork at crisis-prone Barclays along the way. The worst time would have been three months ago before the Libor scandal broke. Either way analysts and market watchers have been broadly positive about Jenkins' appointment, which was widely predicted in the financial press. Are some banks too big to prosecute? What Barclays needs more than anything is a period of stable management to allow it to make some critical changes. These include repairing the damage to the bank's reputation from the various scandals which have engulfed it. Barclays also needs to change the ""anything goes"" trading culture at the investment bank, and come up with an overall strategy that can provide growth against the backdrop of a poor economic environment and a raft of new regulations. It's not exactly an easy gig. But in many ways, the selection of Jenkins is quite a clever choice. He is from the consumer side of the business and has a track record of producing results. A report from Deutsche Bank comments that the two divisions he has run -- Barclaycard and retail and business banking -- are the only two currently meeting the bank's 13% return on equity targets. Jenkins has sat on the bank's group executive committee since 2009 but has managed to stay out of the negative headlines relating to the banking crisis. He started his career at Barclays back in 1983 as a graduate trainee but also worked for a considerable time at Citigroup, giving him breadth of experience. Levene: Culture of money must change . Most important of all he is not Bob Diamond. The brash style of the American investment banker -- who became the chief executive in 2011, after having spent more than a decade building up the markets business -- was known to have irritated UK regulators and played badly in a political environment where excessive risk taking by banks is blamed for causing the current crisis. To those who suggest that Jenkins doesn't know the investment banking business sufficiently to manage it effectively, the riposte must be that not being part of the deal making culture is one of his strengths. Barclays badly needs someone who has enough perspective on investment banking to ask tough questions about which parts of the business make sufficient returns to justify the risks being taken, and that genuinely provide customers with a service. Those activities that don't measure up should be junked. Age of irresponsibility? Besides, if Jenkins feels he lacks any knowledge of investment banking, he can simply walk down the corridor and speak to the new chairman of Barclays Sir David Walker who is a veteran of Morgan Stanley as well as the Bank of England and the UK treasury. It may be too early to talk of the Walker/Jenkins combo as the dream team but frankly it's the best that could be hoped for given the disarray at Barclays and the likelihood of their names being dragged into the mainstream press on almost any trumped up charge. With the new team in place the critical question is what will they deliver? The speculation that they might split investment and retail banking is probably ill-informed. New UK regulations, arising out of the commission led by Sir John Vickers, already stipulate that retail must be ring fenced so that depositors' funds are protected from any losses arising in the investment bank. Furthermore, if the bank is to make a decent living from providing genuine services to corporate customers -- as opposed to trading on its own account -- then the universal banking model of offering a broad range of services under one roof is the only sensible route to take. One key part of Jenkins' strategy is bound to be expanding those same services in the emerging markets, especially in fast expanding Africa where Barclays has a strong presence. One of its strengths is its ownership of Absa, the third largest bank in South Africa. Finally, Jenkins has to make sure that UK retail, the part of the bank he knows best, continues to improve, take market share and most importantly of all assist in the recovery of the bank's reputation. He would be helped in this task by a speedy result on the two SFO investigations -- into Libor manipulation and fees paid to the QIA -- and a minimum of fallout. But that's probably too much to ask for and Jenkins may have to accept that he spends the first six months to a year in his new job fighting fires.","Caplen: Ideal time for new Barclays' chief executive to take over would be six months to a year from now .

"(CNN) -- One of the most dominant theories of this year's presidential election is that President Barack Obama's re-election prospects have been undermined by high unemployment levels. Yet despite a dismal labor market, which saw a net increase of only 103,000 private-sector jobs for August, the president has been widening his lead over Mitt Romney in recent days. This raises the possibility that other factors are trumping high unemployment. To be sure, the fact that the unemployment rate has remained above 8% throughout Obama's first term has greatly contributed to the sense among many that his economic agenda has been a failure. Perhaps the most memorable speech at the Democratic National Convention, by former President Bill Clinton, was devoted to defending the current president's job creation record, a clear sign that Democrats recognize it as their central vulnerability. Opinion: Bill Clinton brings it for Obama . Yet one of the ironies of the 2012 presidential campaign is that the incumbent president has benefited from strong support among many of the constituencies that have been hardest-hit by high unemployment levels, particularly black Americans and Latino Americans. This has left the Romney campaign in the position of having to win over voters who've fared relatively well since 2008. Unfortunately, we don't have reliable or consistent data on the political preferences of the unemployed. The numbers we do have are fragmentary. For example, a recent survey of 18-to-29-year-old voters sponsored by the Youth Engagement Fund found that while only 14% of Romney voters were unemployed, almost a third of Obama voters were unemployed. Undecided voters fell somewhere in between, with 25% of them unemployed. This hardly settles the question, but the fact that the president fares so well with demographic groups that have experienced higher unemployment rates is nevertheless suggestive. Perhaps the most obvious explanation is that voters interpret economic data through the lens of their cultural and political affiliations. Voters who are disinclined to favor a Democratic incumbent will be more likely to interpret disappointing jobs numbers as an indictment of Obama while voters who are more favorably disposed towards Democrats will maintain that he is doing the best that can be expected of him in the face of powerful economic and political headwinds. With that in mind, we can learn a great deal by taking a closer look at different groups in different states. For example, of the three states with unemployment rates above 10%, two, California and Rhode Island, are heavily urban, coastal states that overwhelmingly support Obama. The third, Nevada, is more closely contested, though most surveys find that the state is leaning toward backing the president. This is despite the fact that Nevada is one of the states that has been most adversely impacted by the housing bust. The state is also 27% Latino. And though its electorate is considerably less so, the fact that Latinos tend to favor Democrats more strongly than do white Anglos has given the president a significant boost. Opinion: Three hurdles for Obama, Romney . The political configuration of states with unemployment levels from 8% to 10% is also quite interesting. Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina are all in the Romney column. Several of these states are part of the cultural region political analyst Sean Trende has called ""Greater Appalachia,"" a region that moved toward the GOP even as the rest of the country moved away from it between 2004 and 2008. Others, including Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina, have electorates that are defined by racial polarization. The large black minorities in these states tend to be strongly Democratic while the white majorities tend to be strongly Republican. Moreover, unemployment rates in the black population in these Deep South states tend to be much higher than unemployment rates in the white population. This implies that many of the president's strongest supporters in these states have been touched by unemployment, either directly or indirectly, while many of his staunchest critics have emerged unscathed. Many of the unemployed and underemployed households in these states have benefited from the extension of unemployment benefits, the expansion of eligibility for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and other social transfer programs that the president and congressional Democrats fought for as part of the 2009 fiscal stimulus law and in subsequent budget battles with congressional Republicans. The Obama-supporting states with unemployment levels between 8% and 10% -- such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in the northeastern United States, Illinois in the Midwest and Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest -- are states in which college-educated voters, who've fared relatively well in the post-crisis economy, have shifted to the Democratic Party at least since the Clinton presidency. These are in a sense the Obama voters who don't present much of a puzzle -- relatively insulated from the weak economy, they're more likely to vote on the basis of their socially liberal values. Less affluent voters in these states, meanwhile, disproportionately benefit from the aid programs championed by the president and his allies. Opinion: Harsh realities for Democrats . Earlier this summer, John Hudak, a political scientist based at the Brookings Institution, shed light on this underlying dynamic by considering how Democratic and Republican officials at the state level have responded to Obama's health care reform, the Affordable Care Act. So while Democratic elected officials rely more heavily on the support of voters who are far more likely to be uninsured, e.g., black Americans (22% of whom are uninsured) and Latino Americans (32% of whom are uninsured). Republican elected officials, meanwhile, reply more heavily on white voters, only 14% of whom are uninsured. There are a number of contested states in the 8% to 10% unemployment range, including Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado and Arizona. Florida, Colorado and Arizona are all states in which a surging Latino population has given the Democrats a foothold. North Carolina has a large and politically engaged black population as well as a growing population of college-educated social liberals, the combination of which has made the state more politically competitive than neighboring South Carolina. Michigan, which is still considered a swing state despite having voted for Democratic presidential candidates since 1992, is quite distinctive. It has a black population slightly larger than the national average and a high concentration of union members, many of whom are clustered in the politically important automotive industry. The Obama administration has frequently touted its support for the auto industry, the cost of which continues to climb. As recently as last year, former auto czar Steve Rattner claimed that the ultimate cost to taxpayers of the $82 billion of government funds invested in the GM and Chrysler bailouts would be $14 billion. Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that it would eventually cost the federal government $25.1 billion. Michigan voters have good reason to believe that an Obama administration would be more likely than a Romney administration to offer domestic automobile manufacturers future cash infusions. Many states with unemployment levels between 6% and 8% are solidly in the Republican camp; for example, Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and West Virginia. These are states that have done reasonably well during the Obama years but nevertheless oppose his re-election. The states in this tier that back the president include states with large numbers of affluent college-educated voters and large minority populations, such as Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts and Delaware, and also states with very distinctive demographic profiles, such as heavily Asian Hawaii, heavily Latino New Mexico and Maine, a state that is both very white and very poor. The swing states in this tier -- Wisconsin, Ohio and Missouri -- are states in which Mitt Romney will have to win over large numbers of employed white voters. And that is also true of New Hampshire, Virginia and Iowa, swing states in which the unemployment rate is between 4% and 6%. New Hampshire is heavily white and socially liberal, and its economy has fared well in recent years. Romney will thus have to make an ideological appeal to tax-sensitive voters concerned about deficits and debt. A similar dynamic applies to Iowa as well. Virginia has a large minority population that is supportive of Obama, but it also contains a large number of tax-sensitive suburbanites who might be amenable to Romney's conservative message. Romney has oil-and-gas-oriented low unemployment states such as South Dakota, Wyoming and Oklahoma locked up. But the incumbent is comfortably ahead in Minnesota and Vermont. At a state-by-state level, at least, there doesn't appear to be a straight line between high unemployment levels and opposition to Obama. High unemployment does matter -- but judging by the state of the race right now, it seems to matter more because employed voters, including many who've fared relatively well in recent years, see it as a sign of economic failure than because unemployed voters will turn out against the president in droves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam.","There's a widespread view that unemployment levels are hurting Obama's re-election chances .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on Monday condemned a deadly attack hours earlier against soldiers at an army checkpoint at the Rafah border crossing in Sinai, vowing ""to capture those who conducted this traitorous attack on our sons."" At least 15 Egyptian soldiers were killed and nine others wounded Sunday when masked assailants carried out the attack as the men were breaking their Ramadan fast at sunset, officials said. The Israel Defense Forces blamed terrorists associated with the Global Jihad group for the violence. ""Terrorists in the Sinai region captured an Egyptian military post ... killed over 10 Egyptian soldiers and took over two armored personnel carriers,"" IDF said in a statement. One of the carriers exploded at the border, while the other was attacked as it was entering Israeli territory, it said. A gunbattle between the attackers and armed forces ensued, and the Rafah border crossing has been closed indefinitely, North Sinai security official Ahmed Bakr said. More military forces have been deployed to assist. ""Our forces will impose a full control on these areas,"" Morsy said in an address to the nation. ""Sinai is safe and fully under control -- those who did this will pay a high price."" Morsy called on the military council to hold an emergency meeting, state TV in Egypt reported. Hamas condemned the attack, calling it an ""ugly crime.""

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamist rebels in Mali have taken over a town in the middle of the country, a rebel leader and a resident said Saturday. Douentza is in central Mali, about 110 miles (175 kilometers) from the key town of Sevare, which is in a buffer zone between the rebel-occupied north and the south. Chaos has rocked Mali since a military ruler overthrew the democratically elected president in March, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. Two Islamist groups, MUJAO and the al Qaeda-linked Ansar Dine, now control Douentza, according to Ansar Dine military leader Omar Hamaha. He said Ansar Dine had allowed the Ganda Izo militia to set up base in the town so they could join Ansar Dine, but the Ganda Izo people had ""betrayed"" them. ""We have become aware that there are intelligence offers and security agents of the Malian army among them,"" Hamaha said. ""It's why we have decided to take over Douentza and disarm the so-called Ganda Izo militiamen."" A resident of Douentza, Adama Guindo, said the Islamists disarmed the militia without shooting. He described groups of Islamist fighters riding in vehicles mounted with heavy weapons inside the town. The coup leader who overthrew the democratically elected president stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government, but ethnic Tuareg rebels and other Islamist militants have taken advantage of the uncertainty to seize control of the northern part of the country, including Timbuktu. Members of the Malian army are currently based in Sevare for training and possible military intervention in the north.","Chaos has rocked Mali since a military ruler overthrew the president in March .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Three top allies of Ivory Coast's former president, Laurent Gbagbo, have been arrested in less than a week, raising political tension in the West African nation, where the nation's army has been hit by weeks of attacks. Laurent Akoun, general secretary of the Front Populaire Ivoirien, Ivory Coast's former ruling party, was arrested on Sunday in Adzope, 100 kilometers east of Abidjan, the nation's economic capital and most populous city, party officials said. Akoun was arrested for having defamed President Alassane Ouattara during a recent meeting with some of the party's members and supporters in an Abidjan cafe, said Sylvain Miaka Oureto, the party's leader. He also is accused of harming state security because of what he said during the meeting, Oureto said. He said Akoun was still in custody Monday evening. Akoun, the current deputy chief of the party, was heading to a party rally when the nation's gendarmerie -- a paramilitary force -- arrested him and transferred him to Abidjan, said Augustin Guehoun, the head of communication for the party. His arrest follows that of two former Gbagbo Cabinet ministers, one of them in Ghana, where he had sought refuge. Oureto said the series of arrests against the party's high-ranking officials is intended to ""behead the Front Populaire Ivoirien."" He said the government is ""man hunting"" against the leaders of the party. At least seven attacks have been carried out since August 5 by unidentified gunmen against the Forces Republicaines de CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ivory Coast's national army. At least 17 people were killed in the attacks, including 10 Ivorian soldiers. In the latest raid, carried out Saturday, four people died when an army's checkpoint was attacked by four armed men at Irobo, about 100 kilometers west of Abidjan, said Paul Koffi Koffi, minister delegate to defense. One civilian, one soldier and two attackers were killed, he said. Ivory Coast's authorities say Gbagbo's supporters are behind the attacks, intended to destabilize the West African country, which is recovering from a five-month post-election crisis that killed more than 3,000 people last year. Oureto denied the party is connected to any of the violence that has hit the country in the past month. He said the reasons for the recent attacks have to be investigated in light of the failing process of disarmament and reassimilation of former fighters. The political standoff was sparked last year when Gbagbo refused to acknowledge his defeat in a November 2010 presidential election and hand over power to Ouattara. Gbagbo was arrested in April 2011, after 10 days of war, in Abidjan. Ouattara addressed the recent attacks Sunday, saying he condemned those ""reprehensible acts,"" and adding that ""this violence is the arm of desperate persons."" An extraordinary security meeting is to held Tuesday to assess the security situation in the country, he said. The Front Populaire Ivoirien's headquarters in Abidjan also were attacked on August 18, and the party has accused the government of staging that incident. Laurent Akoun is the third Gbagbo's top ally to be arrested in less than a week by Ivory Coast's authorities. Alphonse Douati, a senior member of the party and former Cabinet minister in Gbagbo's administration, was arrested last Tuesday and has been charged with harming state security. He is accused of financing the recent attacks. Justin Kone Katinan, a spokesman for Gbagbo during last year's standoff and the ex-budget minister, was arrested on August 24 in neighboring Ghana, where he sought refuge after the collapse of Gbagbo's administration in April 2011. Ivory Coast's government issued international arrest warrants last year against two dozen military and political officials loyal to Gbagbo, including Katinan, who is accused of economic crimes. Ghana's authorities said Monday they are studying a possible extradition of Katinan.","Laurent Akoun is the third supporter of the former president arrested in a week .

"(CNN) -- World No. 3 Rafael Nadal has been forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open due to an ongoing knee complaint, the Spanish tennis star announced on Wednesday. The French Open champion has a history of knee problems, and has not played since a surprise second-round defeat at Wimbledon in June. The former world number one was unable to defend his Olympic title in London, and the the 26-year-old had to pull out of last week's tournament in Toronto as well as this week's event in Cincinnati. ""I am very sad to announce that I am still not ready to play and have to withdraw from this year's U.S. Open in NYC,"" Nadal told the U.S. Open website ahead of the season's final grand slam, which runs from August 27-September 9. ""I am sorry since I always found great crowds and great support, but I have to continue with my recuperation and preparation to be ready to play in the right conditions."" Nadal, who was beaten in last year's final by Novak Djokovic, missed large spells of the 2007 season due to knee problems and had to withdraw from the 2008 end-of-season championship plus the Davis Cup final due to similar troubles. In 2009, Nadal was unable to defend his Wimbledon title after he was diagnosed with tendinitis in both knees, and he has occasionally missed tournaments since to try to manage the problem. In March this year, he was forced to withdraw before his semifinal at the Miami Masters tournament due to the injury. However, he managed to play a full clay-court season, winning three titles before clinching a record seventh French Open at Roland Garros. Nadal then lost in the quarterfinals of the Halle grass event in Germany, and was beaten at Wimbledon by 100th-ranked Czech Lukas Rosol.","Last year's runner-up Rafael Nadal withdraws from the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- As the car industry suffers declining sales and excess production, luxury brand Mercedes-Benz is making a billion dollar bet on a niche slice of the market. Mercedes-Benz, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler, is increasing its production of premium compact cars by investing in a state-of-the-art plant in Hungary. Mercedes-Benz is battling its luxury brand competitors, BMW and Audi, for market share of the chic, small, car market -- a style which appeals to a younger demographic. The company's Kecskemet plant, an hour from Budapest, has been rolling out production of its B-Class compact car since March. Frank Klein, the plant manager in Kecskemet, said the move was a reaction to a change in the customer base: ""It has become younger and they want more sporty, more attractive cars,"" he said. ""With this model I think we can meet all the demands that the customer expects from a premium brand."" Mercedes-Benz set up in Hungary after looking at locations where it could increase its capacity but keep costs down. ""There was a long evaluation process at the beginning of this project phase,"" Klein said. ""We had 15 different sites to select from and there were a lot of different criteria, including the logistics costs and the availability of a qualified workforce."" Mercedes-Benz follows Volkswagen's Audi unit, which opened its first car plant in Hungary in 1994. The country's appeal lies in its skilled labor and low costs. Research from Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, head of the Centre Automotive Research Unit at the University of Duisburg-Essen, shows car plant workers in Hungary are paid a fifth of their German neighbors. Hungary also has cheaper taxes and less regulation than its neighbor, according to Dudenhoffer. He estimates the cost of making a Mercedes-Benz B-Class in Hungary is around $2500 cheaper than making it in Germany. According to Daimler, these savings per car could be even higher, with Klein estimating overall production costs at 30% less in the Hungarian plant. Michael Tyndall, an auto analyst and director of research at Barclays Capital, is unsurprised at Mercedez-Benz's move. ""The main failing of the European industry is it hasn't really adjusted its production footprint to the underlying financial or economics of the industry,"" he said. ""Consumers are getting cars cheaper in real terms and getting cars with more content, but at the same time labor costs and raw materials are going up, so somewhere something has to be squeezed -- and at the moment that is the bottom line for the car makers,"" he added. Daimler's hope is that the plant will reduce production costs but also -- given new innovations and technologies -- improve productivity and efficiency. Michael Tyndall believes it's a good strategy for saving on production costs, ""but the actual success of it is contingent on the success of the cars,"" he said. ""It's about what the consumer wants, and the consumer wants smaller premium cars, so in that sense Mercedes is definitely doing the right thing.""

"(CNN) -- American Venus Williams was the biggest name to head out of the Olympics tennis tournament in Wednesday's third round, losing 6-7, 6-7 to German Angelique Kerber. Venus, the gold medal winner at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, struggled to cope with the intelligent play of Kerber. The 24-year-old is enjoying the best year of her career, seeing her ranking rise to seven, and never looked in trouble against the seven time slam winning American. Serena Williams, Venus' younger sister, didn't encounter the same problems as she swatted aside 2008 silver medal winner Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-0. The recent Wimbledon champion looked in imperious form, hitting 32 winners to her opponents three. ""I think I played better today and even in my second round than any match I played at Wimbledon,"" Williams said. ""I was just playing unbelievable. I felt good. I was relaxed. I felt like, you know what, I'm here to have fun, I have nothing to lose. No pressure on myself."" In the men's tournament, Roger Federer continued his quest to claim the only major title to elude him with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. The Uzbek player threatened Federer at 5-5 in the first set, but the world number one snuffed out the threat relatively easy. From there on, the most successful tennis player of all time looked comfortable. ""I was happy with the way that I was able to turn it around,"" said Federer. ""Denis, I thought, played a very good first set; I didn't play poorly to let him back into the match. In the second set I guess I learned from the first set and was able to bring it home, so I'm very happy."" Federer will play the John Isner in the quarter finals after the big-serving American beat Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic 7-5, 7-6. Not everything went Federer's way though, as later in the day he and Stanislas Wawrinka relinquished their Olympic doubles title to the Israeli pairing of Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich. Elsewhere in the doubles, Brazilian team Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares won an epic encounter with Thomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic. The final set finished 24-22 in 191 minutes making it the longest set in an Olympic men's doubles match, and the match the longest three-set Olympic men's doubles match ever. Federer's main rivals for Olympic gold both endured a difficult day at Wimbledon. Novak Djokovic met former world number one Lleyton Hewitt in a gruelling encounter that ended 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in the Serbian's favor. Djokovic will face the dangerous Jo-Wilfired Tsonga in the next round after the powerful Frenchman beat Feliciano Lopez 7-6, 6-4. Lopez is only in the singles competition after Spanish number one Rafael Nadal had to withdraw from the competition due to injury. Local favorite Andy Murray also has hopes of winning a medal, having lost in the final at the recent Wimbledon Championships. He met the talented Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in front of a raucous home crowd, producing a nervous 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 win. ""I was pretty unsure of myself at the beginning of the match, I didn't feel comfortable on the court,"" Murray told the Wimbledon website. ""Then I managed to settle myself down and move my feet better to get in better position in the second set. I played some good tennis after that."" Murray plays Spain's Nicolas Almagro in the quarter finals after the Spanish clay court specialist beat Steve Darcis 7-5, 6-3. Former U.S. Open champion Juan-Martin Del Potro progressed to the quarter finals after recovering from an early scare against Giles Simon of France. Simon, renowned for an unrelenting game, looked to be struggling to match Del Potro's power when he lost the first set 6-1, but he recovered to take the second 6-4. The Argentinian Del Potro recovered his composure to seal the final set 6-3. In the final men's match of the day, Japan's Kei Nishikori shocked number four seed David Ferrer of Spain with a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 defeat. The match began on a packed court 14, but was moved under the Centre Court roof to ensure match was completed on Wednesday. French Open champion Maria Sharapova faced a difficult test in her third round match, dropping the first set to German Sabine Lisicki. The Russian, who has won all four slams in a hugely successful career, eventually pulled off a 6-7(8), 6-4, 6-3 win. Sharapova, who carried the Russian flag at the opening ceremony, will now face former world number one Kim Clijsters in the quarter finals after the Belgian ground out a 6-3, 6-4 win over Serbia's Ana Ivanovic. Clijsters, who is retiring at the end of this season, hit less winners than her Serbian rival, but forced 41 errors from her.. ""The conditions were not easy today but it was a fun court to play on. Most of the TV courts are huge and there's a lot of room around them but here you can really feel the impact of the crowd and it was very enjoyable,"" Clijsters said. ""I feel like I've been playing some really good tennis in the first three matches here, it's just a matter of trying to keep that up and before every match I need to refocus and stay on target. ""There was lots of Belgian support and Serbian too, it was fun."" Victoria Azarenka also progressed to the quarter finals after she comfortably beat Russian Nadia Petrova 7-6, 6-4. The world number one has enjoyed a comfortable route to the quarters, but now faces Venus Williams' conqueror Angelique Kerber. Caroline Wozniacki completes the women's quarter final lineup. The Danish player looked to be rediscovering the form that made her number one in the rankings as she beat Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova 6-4, 6-2.","Venus Williams suffers surprise defeat to German Angelique Kerber .

"(CNN) -- A Virgin Islands jury has found a veteran Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives special agent not guilty of using excessive force when he intervened and fatally shot a man during a domestic argument in 2008. ATF Special Agent William G. Clark was cleared of charges Thursday in a case that enraged many federal law enforcement officers who said Clark was heroically coming to the defense of a battered woman. ""ATF has been steadfast in its support of Special Agent Clark and wholeheartedly agrees with the jury's verdict,"" said Thomas Brandon, ATF deputy director, in a written statement. ATF officials said Clark was confronted by Marcus Sukow on September 7, 2008, and ""took immediate action to defend himself and others by discharging his firearm to stop the attack."" The incident occurred outside a St. Thomas condominium where all of the main participants were neighbors. While the broad outline of the shooting is undisputed, two government investigations came to starkly different conclusions. A federal government multiple-agency investigation of the incident unanimously concluded the shooting was justified. The ATF even returned Clark's gun and badge and put him back to work. But a Virgin Islands Police Department investigation prompted prosecutors to charge Clark with second degree murder. Local prosecutors evidently were heavily influenced by two points: First, the dead man was armed only with a flashlight; second, Clark shot him five times. According to a police affidavit, Clark was leaving his condo when he encountered Sukow and his girlfriend. They had been drinking and were having a ""disagreement."" Federal authorities were so incensed by the Virgin Island's prosecution of Clark -- and so concerned other federal agents could similarly be prosecuted -- that they removed all ATF agents from the Virgin Islands in 2008, a policy that continues today, the agency said.

Aydin Tufan Tekin appeared on local Lebanese TV shortly after he was released to the country's Interior Ministry. He looked healthy and said he was heading to his hometown. The businessman's kidnapping was a high-profile example of how the Syrian conflict has been seeping into Lebanon, sparking concern across the nation and in other countries.

"(CNN) -- The hard-nosed stance taken by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the Chicago teachers' strike dovetails with the education goals of his former boss, President Barack Obama, but observers disagreed Monday over how well it serves the city's schoolchildren. Critics such as Fordham University professor Mark Naison say Emanuel is slavishly following the Obama administration's educational policies to the detriment of children and teachers. ""It makes teachers look at students as their adversaries,"" said Naison, who works with public school teachers as part of the Bronx African American History Project and is a professor of African American Studies and History at the university. ""It makes teachers hate their jobs and it makes students not want to go to schools, because all you do is study for bubble tests,"" he said, referring to computer-scored standardized tests. But the mayor's supporters see teachers desperately trying to hold on to their jobs amid a challenging environment that mixes rising calls for accountability with falling budgets. ""The only negative consequence, if you think about it as negative, is that some people are going to lose their jobs. And maybe rightly so,"" said Juan Rangel, CEO of United Neighborhood Organization, a nonprofit that manages 13 largely Latino charter schools in Chicago. Chicago's 30,000 school teachers were in the second day of a strike Tuesday after 10 months of negotiations failed to reach a deal. Emanuel came out swinging in his fight with the union -- typically a reliable part of the Democratic base -- saying Monday that educators had opted for what he called an unnecessary strike that could endanger the futures of 350,000 children. The former Obama chief of staff backs Chicago Public Schools administrators who want to evaluate teachers in large part based on student performance on standardized tests and maintain the authority of local principals to hire anyone they choose for job openings. The question of changing how teachers are evaluated -- for the first time in decades in Chicago, according to Emanuel -- has emerged as the central issue of the strike. And Emanuel's position is straight out of the Obama's administration playbook, said Naison, who is critical of the mayor's stance. ""Rahm Emanuel is very faithfully following the strategy for urban school systems outlined in the Obama administration's signature education policy, which is his race-to-the-top initiative,"" he said. Key issues behind the strike . The idea is that by rating teachers on student test scores and closing failing schools, bad teachers will be weeded out and students will get a better education, he said. The Obama initiative attempts to apply a business model to public education, according to Naison. ""They're trying to see if by putting pressure on teachers to raise student test scores, they can reduce the performance gap between schools in poor neighborhoods and schools in more affluent neighborhoods,"" he said. But the results have brought unintended consequences that may be worse than the putative reforms, Naison said. Schools in danger of closing have cut recess, gym, arts and music, he said, and the atmosphere at many schools has been poisoned. ""Basically, all kids do is study for the test all day, which is the only way you have any chance of teachers keeping their jobs and administrators keeping schools open,"" Naison said. ""What the Chicago teachers have done is say enough is enough,"" he said. Voices of the Chicago Public Schools strike . Rangel, the United Neighborhood Organization CEO, said Emanuel has ""done an outstanding job in putting forth a reform agenda for education. ""When you have change, it's going to inconvenience people,"" he said. Rangel, whose organization manages the UNO Charter School Network, dismissed Naison's criticism that schools end up doing little but ""teaching to the test."" ""The reality is this,"" he said. ""At some point, we have to be able to assess the progress of children, and we do that through testing."" Those opposed to the plan ""just don't want to be held accountable to standards,"" he said. ""The only negative consequence, if you think about it as negative, is that some people are going to lose their jobs. And maybe rightly so."" The conflict underscores the Democratic Party's new openness to changes, such as charter schools and teacher accountability, that labor historically has not supported, said Timothy Knowles, director of the University of Chicago's Urban Education Institute. ""You've got three factors -- labor, new Democrats, and you've got no money -- and that, it turns out, is combustible."" Naison said the policies favored by Obama and Emanuel have gained traction among Democrats because they appear to be a low-risk way to bring in campaign donations from the corporate world. Romney, Obama spar over strike . ""It makes perfect sense that Emanuel pushes this, because this policy makes money for the Democratic Party,"" he said. ""The big funders love it. Teachers hate it, but teachers don't have anywhere else to go, right? They're not going to go Republican."" ""So, if you look at this fairly cynically, you can beat on teachers without undermining the Democratic Party base that much and bring in much-needed financing from the corporate sector. Emanuel is at the forefront of both,"" he said. He called teachers ""collateral damage to the Democratic Party's fundraising strategy."" Still, Naison accused Emanuel of hubris for thinking he could impose his plan on teachers. ""When the teachers balked, I'm sure he figured, 'I'm an incredibly popular mayor; teachers are pretty unpopular now; they'll cave.' Well guess what? They didn't."" Emanuel also has faced criticism that he is stretched too thin. He recently stepped down as a co-chair of Obama's re-election campaign to take on a key role raising money for the campaign through the Priorities USA Action super PAC. Rangel said the criticisms are off the mark. ""He certainly knows how to multitask,"" Rangel said. ""I think he can do this -- and more."" In a statement, Emanuel spokesman Thomas C. Bowen implied -- but did not state explicitly -- that his boss was shifting away from his role as a fundraiser for the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action. ""The Mayor's first priority is the residents of the City of Chicago,"" Bowen said in the statement. ""He is committed to reelecting the President, but he must focus on his job as Mayor right now."" Emanuel himself addressed the issue Monday. ""Don't worry about the test of my leadership; that gets tested every day,"" he told reporters in Chicago. ""The only test that matters to me is the test these kids take on whether, when you've got a kid going into first grade, do they know the letters? By third grade, can they read? By fourth grade, can they do the basic math? That's the test that matters here."" The battle is being watched closely around the country, Knowles said. ""Mayors want to know if a hard-charging, reform-oriented stance toward labor will prevail,"" he said. ""And, likewise, labor wants to know whether a dig-in-our-heels-and-fight-and-be-willing-to-go-to-the-streets-and-take-job action will prevail.""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An Indian cartoonist charged with sedition over images critical of the government has been released on bail, his lawyer said Wednesday. Aseem Trivedi had originally refused to seek bail and wanted the charges dropped, but changed his mind after receiving assurances from authorities that they would be reviewed, Vijay Hiremath said. In comments after his release, televised from outside the jailhouse, the satirist vowed to continue his campaign against the country's colonial-era law on sedition. ""This fight will continue until 124A is repealed,"" he said, holding a microphone. Arrest of 'toilet' cartoonist triggers free speech debate in India . He was referring to section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which was introduced by the British colonial government in 1860. The law prohibits ""words either spoken or written, or by signs or visible representation"" that attempts to cause ""hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection,"" toward the government. Trivedi then thanked his supporters for rallying around him after his arrest triggered a debate over free speech in the world's largest democracy. The case against the cartoonist hinges on a complaint about drawings published during anti-corruption protests last year. Trivedi's cartoons attacked perceived corruption in India's political system, with one of them depicting three lions in India's national emblem as wolves and another showing parliament as a toilet, Hiremath said. But Trivedi insisted his cartoons were in fact inspired by patriotism. ""I didn't commit crime,"" he told reporters. ""The government has to answer why I was charged with sedition."" But a Mumbai court granted Trivedi bail after someone else filed a public-interest petition seeking his release, Hiremath said. The cartoonist is also facing a charge of insulting national honor and authorities have blocked his website, which carried the cartoons, Hiremath added. If convicted, he could be jailed for life -- a situation that has incensed many in India. ""These charges are nonsense. They are stupid. They are just (there) because of the intolerance of some people. They should be dismissed as frivolous,"" said Markandey Katju, the chief of the Press Council of India. Human Rights Watch has urged Indian authorities to immediately drop the charges and repeal the sedition law, which it alleged was being used to ""silence peaceful dissent."" In 1962, India's Supreme Court ruled that the section 124A was constitutionally valid, but said that its application should be limited to acts ""involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence."" ""Indian authorities have unlawfully charged individuals with sedition on repeated occasions for peaceful political purposes contrary to explicit directives of the Supreme Court,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly of HRW. ""The obvious abuse of the sedition law to silence Trivedi should be the case that prompts the abolition of this law."" In its editorial Tuesday, one of India's most respected dailies, The Hindu, also criticized the law. ""The latest victim of this anachronistic colonial-era law, for which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment, is a young cartoonist, arrested for no more than lampooning the corrupt and venal state of affairs in the country,"" it said. ""...the sedition clause not only remains on the statute book but is used periodically against human rights activists, journalists and intellectuals.""

"(CNN) -- Federal civil rights investigators have found ""reasonable cause"" to believe that police in Portland, Oregon, use ""unnecessary or unreasonable force"" with persons who have mental illness, the U.S. Justice Department said. The department's civil rights division and U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon issued a letter to Portland Mayor Sam Adams stating that local and federal authorities will ""continue our collaborative relationship to craft sustainable remedies."" In the 42-page letter, federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct. Investigators found cause to believe that the Portland Police Bureau engages in ""a pattern or practice of using excessive force in encounters involving people with actual or perceived mental illness."" ""We found instances that support a pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and who could not, as a result of their mental illness, comply with officers' commands,"" said the letter, which was signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez and U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall. ""We also found that PPB employs practices that escalate the use of force where there were clear earlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or minimized."" One incident in December 2010 involved several officers who used ""repeated closed-fist punches and repeated shocking of a subject who was to be placed on a mental health hold,"" the letter said. Adams, in a posting on his web page, vowed that the city and its Police Bureau would improve quickly, and listed a series of changes: . -- The city will revise its use-of-force policies -- particularly those regarding the use of stun guns -- ""to ensure that officers have necessary guidance when encountering someone with mental illness or perceived to have mental illness."" -- The police will expand their Mobile Crisis Unit -- composed of an officer and a mental health worker -- ""to ensure availability at all times and enhance non-law enforcement capacity to respond to persons in crisis that do not pose a public safety threat."" -- The city will establish a mental health desk at its 911 calling center to ensure calls are properly dispatched. -- The city will lead efforts to boost community mental health treatment options, such as establishing a 24-hour secure drop-off and walk-in center, ""that will provide police officers more options when assisting persons experiencing a mental health crisis."" -- The city will use an early intervention system to identify officers, supervisors and units ""for non-punitive corrective action, and to assess gaps in policy, training, supervision and accountability."" -- The city will move to speed investigations of complaints about possible officer misconduct. -- A community body composed of representatives of a variety of groups will assess how well the agreement is being implemented, offer recommendations on additional steps, and advise the police chief and Adams on how to improve community relations.","Civil rights investigators say Portland Police engage in a pattern of excessive force .

"(CNN) -- This Saturday, Aiden O'Brien's unbeaten colt Camelot will be aiming to add the Irish Derby to his Epsom Derby victory from earlier this month. It's a neat double, achieved by only 15 horses before him. But his trainer has his eye on another prize. Camelot has already captured the English 2,000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby. Assuming everything goes to plan this weekend, his next target will be the St. Ledger Stakes at Doncaster in September -- and racing immortality. For Camelot stands on the brink of that rarest of achievements, the English ""Triple Crown"" of thoroughbred racing. Royal regulations for Ascot's fashionistas . Only 15 horses have ever done the treble in the century and a half in which the 2,000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Ledger Stakes have been run. Three of those, wartime winners Pommern, Gay Crusader and Gainsborough will forever have an asterisk next to their names as racing was considered too disrupted in that period for their achievements to stand, making the ""official"" figure as low as 12. The last Triple Crown winner was the great Nijinsky, way back in 1970 (although the brilliant filly Oh So Sharp did win the ""Fillies' Triple Crown"" -- the 1,000 Guineas, the Epsom Oaks and the St. Ledger -- in 1985). Few horses these days even attempt the full set. Since Nijinsky (who, incidentally, also won the Irish Derby en route to his treble), only two other horses have won both the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby, and both of those -- Nashwan (1989) and Sea The Stars (2009) -- opted for a tilt at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe instead of the St. Ledger. For many years it was considered so unlikely that a horse would ever win the Triple Crown again that the soubriquet itself fell into disuse. It is now more commonly associated with American racing, so it is perhaps fitting that -- in the year that the U.S. came so close to ending its 34-year Triple Crown drought with I'll Have Another only for the colt to be scratched before the starter's bell had even sounded for the Belmont Stakes -- England could yet be celebrating a Triple Crown of its own. First, of course, Camelot must get through the Irish Derby unscathed. He spearheads a three-strong O'Brien challenge that also includes Astrology and Imperial Monarch. He will be ridden, as in all his starts to date, by his trainer's son Joseph O'Brien. At six foot, Joseph cuts a distinctive figure in the paddock. Just 19 years old, the precociously talented rider has already won more Classic races than most jockeys will in their entire careers. He rode his first winner for his father at 16 and bagged his first Classic a year later on Roderic O'Connor in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. Last year he became the youngest jockey to ride a winner in the Breeders' Cup on St. Nicholas Abbey. But the lanky teenager is surely riding on borrowed time as far as his flat racing career is concerned, lending Camelot's tilt at the treble even greater poignancy. The O'Briens' Ballydoyle operation has already won this year's 2,000 Guineas, 1,000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Oaks, making their domination of the English Classics complete. Last week they notched up another important win at Royal Ascot when New Zealand-bred So You Think -- the horse with arguably the biggest carbon footprint in racing due to his worldwide travels -- captured the Prince of Wales Stakes. But even in such distinguished company, the bay with the irregular white blaze stands out. Reared in the same Highclere paddock as his vanquished Epsom Derby rival Bonfire, Camelot was sent to the sales as a yearling, where he was snapped up for 525,000 guineas ($875,000). His earnings from his four races to date now exceed $1.5 million. Camelot's impressive performances in the 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby this season have raised hopes that the son of Montjeu will have sufficient staying power to land the St. Ledger Stakes, run over the longer distance of one mile and six furlongs. If successful, there will be more than a hint of a sense of destiny being fulfilled: the last horse to win the Triple Crown, the legendary Nijinsky, was trained by the great Vincent O'Brien. Although not related, Aiden O'Brien now trains out of the same Ballydoyle stables where Vincent O'Brien trained Nijinsky. The great colt's life-sized statue now watches over the gallops where Camelot does his daily workouts. The stage seems to be set for a fairytale ending. In Camelot, English racing may have found its own Arthurian legend.","Camelot is aiming to become only the 16th horse to win Irish and Epsom Derbies .

"(CNN) -- Over the centuries, British monarchs have listed their preferred tradesmen and brands, stamping them with a seal of approval known as the Royal Warrant. The warrant -- covering products such as cereals, soaps, sauces, chocolates, cars and clothing -- can only be granted by three members of the family: The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales. It is now held by 850 brands, and allows the businesses to advertise that they supply goods or services to the royal household. New research from Brand Finance estimates the system injects an extra Â£4 billion to the UK economy. Further, those companies which hold the warrant together enjoy a reputational boost worth around Â£400 million, according to the Brand Finance research. Well-established brands like Jaguar, Weetabix, Heinz, or Carphone Warehouse may reap largely reputational benefits, while smaller brands can enjoy a significant financial boost from the recognition. ""It certainly helps people have confidence in the company without a doubt, especially with our traditional markets, state insignias and stuff like that,"" said Fiona Toye, CEO of Toye Kenning & Spencer, a family business which has been making military trimmings for more than 300 years, and was given the warrant in 1956. She added: ""They look at the Royal Warrant and say 'yes, what is good enough for the queen is good enough for us.' ""I think there is enormous respect for the British crown and queen all over the world and some of that rubs off on those companies that have the mark of approval from the crown. It's a worldwide mark of quality."" Toye Kenning & Spencer is making around 200,000 medals for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, a huge order which has boosted the company even as it struggles with a 30% decline in core business over the last decade. The company has suffered as traditional clients such as defence ministries tighten their budgets, while societies and clubs face declining memberships.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Hells Angels are going to court, protesting a federal policy barring the motorcycle club's foreign members from visiting the United States. In a complaint filed in federal court in Washington, the Hells Angels Motorcycle Corporation, as the group calls itself, said its designation as a ""known criminal organization"" by the departments of Homeland Security and State violates immigration law and the group's constitutional rights. Lawyers for the Los Angeles-area-based group describe its membership as composed of loosely associated charters, ""made up of motorcycle enthusiasts who have joined to ride motorcycles together, organize social events, fundraisers, parties and motorcycle rallies."" Canadian rides 186 mph . Founded in 1948 in southern California, Hells Angels claim charters in 35 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, the United States and Wales. The group is asking for a temporary injunction, allowing foreign members to be granted visas to travel to the United States. In its lawsuit, the group claims the government routinely denies visas ""to all aliens based solely on their membership in a Hells Angels charter without further analysis into whether or not that individual seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in unlawful activity."" The motorcycle group also seeks to have its ""criminal organization"" designation removed. Singer's husband loses leg in bike crash . The Obama administration is expected to respond to the lawsuit in coming weeks, when a federal judge would decide the injunction request, and later, the larger legal questions raised. There was no immediate response to the lawsuit from government officials. A number of federal and state prosecutors and law enforcement organizations have called the Hells Angels a criminal motorcycle gang, along with their alleged rivals the Bandidos, Outlaws, and Pagans. Some of its members have been prosecuted for committing felonies including drug dealing, extortion, and other violent crimes. The Hells Angels as a group has said any crimes committed by its members have been done as individual acts, and are not representative of the club as a whole.

"(RollingStone.com) -- After years of speculation and anticipation, the cast and crew of ""Arrested Development"" are finally at work on new episodes. In the interim, David Cross wasn't waiting by the phone covered in blue paint, like Tobias Funke: he released his third comedy album in 2010, created and starred in ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret ""on IFC and guest-starred on ""Modern Family."" Cross took the time to talk to Rolling Stone about the return of the cult favorite. It's been almost ten years since the show started. I never really thought of it that way. I don't know of any project that's had a shelf life [like this]. It was about a four-and-a-half year window of people thinking, ""OK, it might be any month now that it starts."" You know, ""Next month? Next year. Next year? Next two months. Tomorrow? Three years."" And that process was four years, so it seems very present. That whole part was longer than actually shooting. How does it feel to be back in the cutoffs? Well, the cutoffs themselves are great, because that first day of shooting we were in Burbank, and it was 102 degrees. It was a treat to be in the cutoffs. It's great, and it's a little surreal. I would say about half of the crew is back, the same crew from six years ago. We're all older and people are married, have kids now. There's no good way to do it. You're not gonna sit around on set and shoot the s*** for three hours and catch up. You just get there at 6:30 in the morning and go. And you know, an hour-and-a-half later you're in front of the camera doing your first scene. 'America's Got Talent' Recap: The Wild-Card Round . Is a 10-episode season still the plan? I think it's going to be 13 episodes, not 10. There's too much story. Some characters will have two-parters. Everybody sort of participates, sometimes in a bigger way and sometimes in a tiny little thread that goes through everybody else's stories. Is the new season going to be more serialized, like some of the later episodes? I'm not gonna divulge anything, but I know what the stories are and what Mitch [Hurwitz] is doing, and it's so layered. It's really audacious and amazing. I think a lot of people will miss the work that is involved, the story, the Venn diagrams that are being created, the domino effect that characters have with each other in their various episodes. I know what he's doing, and this has never been done on a TV show like this. This makes ""Lost"" look like a Spaulding Grey monologue. You'll have to watch each episode more than once.

Or, not currently, but it wouldn't have gotten canceled. Just one year! It took them a while to figure out what everybody else already knew, which is that people aren't watching the show the night it airs. The new episodes are going to be released on Netflix. What's it like working with them compared to a network? Netflix is great. They don't meddle at all. They know what they want. They're happy to have it.

"(CNN) -- The United States moved to increase embassy security around the world after the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three staffers. ""I have directed my administration to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in Libya, and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement issued Wednesday morning in response to the attack. The United States deployed a group of Marines called a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team to Libya to help secure U.S. facilities, two U.S. officials said Wednesday. Such units are specially trained to retake or guard diplomatic installations and other U.S. facilities in troubled regions. About 50 Marines were headed to Tripoli and could deploy elsewhere in Libya after their arrival, U.S. officials said. Six things to know about the attack . Other U.S. troops and units abroad have been notified they could be ordered to move to embassy installations around the world to provide additional security, a senior U.S. military official said. The official added that the Pentagon is involved in intensive discussions with the State Department and White House on how to implement Obama's order to step up diplomatic security. ""We are looking at the requirements, what we need and identifying what assets could have to move,"" the official said, adding that could include troops, aircraft, ships and other equipment if needed. Two U.S. Navy warships were moving toward the Libyan coast Wednesday, two U.S. officials said. Both are equipped with Tomahawk missiles that could be used if a strike was ordered, which ""will give the administration flexibility"" if action is ordered against targets in the country, a senior official said. The moves come a day after the attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens amid protests at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Heavily armed protesters assaulted the consulate, said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Demonstrators also attacked the U.S. Embassy in Cairo on Tuesday. Protesters in both countries were apparently angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam. On Wednesday, the State Department urged Americans to avoid the area around the embassy in Kharthoum, Sudan, due to ""anti-U.S. protests outside."" There was no immediate word of violence. ""There's a lot of skittish people at the State Department right now,"" CNN foreign affairs reporter Elise Labott said. Protesters attack U.S. diplomatic compounds in Egypt, Libya . It is unclear whether Stevens' death resulted from the broader anti-American protests or a separate, local plot against the ambassador, former State Department official James Rubin said. ""Until you are able to answer that question, it's kind of hard to assign the significance of this,"" said Rubin, who was State Department spokesman during President Bill Clinton's administration. Mohammed Al-Megaryef, head of Libya's ruling party, told reporters Wednesday that ""the transitional government has done all that it could in order to protect the embassies, the consulates and the foreign companies in Libya."" Secretary of State Clinton said she had spoken to the Libyan president seeking additional protection for American interests in the country. She said the U.S. government is also working with countries to ""protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide."" 4 hours or fire and chaos . ""There is no higher priority than protecting our men and women, wherever they serve,"" Clinton said. Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib said the government would increase security Wednesday in response to the attacks. Security outside embassies is the responsibility of the host country, and it's ""entirely possible"" that U.S. officials asked for but didn't receive help to push back the attackers that ultimately killed Stevens and the other staffers, said Fred Burton, a Stratfor analyst and former State Department counterterrorism agent. ""The question will be, once the dominoes fell in Cairo and protests started to occur, what was requested and what was done,"" he said. No U.S. Marines were guarding the consulate at the time of the attack, according to U.S. officials. But that is not necessarily unusual, Burton said. ""Having the Marines can be viewed as politically sensitive at times,"" Burton said. It can also raise the profile of an installation and invite unwanted attention or attacks, he said. Townsend: Libya has been suffering 'fragile security' Diplomats in unstable regions typically travel in convoys of heavily armed guards, and it's likely that Stevens was well-guarded, said Christopher Hill, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq. ""I can assure you, I can absolutely assure you, that security was paramount on the minds of the embassy and the ambassador,"" Hill said. But he said it's just not possible to surround diplomats in a bubble of impenetrable protection. ""It's never a matter of getting rid of risk. It's a matter of managing risk, and that is a very tough thing to do,"" he said. Stevens' death, however, will spark a thorough review of security practices and could result in changes to how diplomats are protected, Burton said. Something similar happened after the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, sparked new construction and security standards for embassies, Burton said. ""My gut tells me that this will cause that to happen,"" he said. Pro-al Qaeda group seen behind deadly Benghazi attack . Are you witnessing protests in Egypt or Libya?

"(CNN) -- NASA released the first color images of the surface of Mars from its new rover Curiosity on Tuesday, showing a dusty, tan desert dominated by the rim of the crater where the craft landed. The image -- shot at an angle by a camera on Curiosity's still-stowed robotic arm -- shows the sandy plain ahead of the rover and the northern rim of Gale Crater, where the rover touched down early Monday. The image was shot through a retractable, transparent dust shield over the lens, making it ""kind of murky,"" said Ken Edgett, a senior scientist for the camera's builder, Malin Space Science Systems. Controllers wanted to make sure the camera still functioned after Curiosity's 352-million-mile voyage and harrowing landing early Monday, Edgett told reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Read more on the Mars Rover: Is all this necessary? ""This was basically a focus test,"" he said, adding, ""It works. It's awesome. We can't wait to open it and see what else we can see."" The crater rim seen in the photo is more than 20 km (12.5 miles) from the rover, Edgett said. Other images beamed back in the first day and a half since the landing include 297 low-resolution color images of the final minutes of its descent. The pictures, posted on the space agency's website, show some of the gyrations Curiosity went through beneath its parachute and the dust kicked up as it touched down. The $2.6 billion rover made its dramatic arrival on Martian terrain in a spectacle popularly known as the ""seven minutes of terror."" The landing involve a sky crane and the world's largest supersonic parachute, which allowed the spacecraft carrying Curiosity to target the landing area that scientists had meticulously chosen. The probe was in ""great shape"" 36 hours after landing as NASA starts to activate the rover's systems, mission manager Michael Watkins said Tuesday afternoon. But he noted that adjustments need to be made to at least two systems. Read more: Curiosity opening Martian frontier? Controllers plan to spend Curiosity's next day raising the mast that holds many of its remote sensors and tweak the high-bandwidth antenna that connects the rover to Earth. ""The antenna mechanism is in fine shape, but it was not quite pointed accurately enough at the Earth for us to get the telecom signal that we wanted,"" Watkins said. And the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station ""did not work correctly"" the second time the team tried to test its sensors, leading the researchers behind that project to go back and re-check the unit's data files. ""I would say that it does not appear to be significant at this time,"" Watkins said. ""But these guys are off working it, and it's their baby. Let's let them think about it for a while."" The unit, known as the REMS, monitors ground and air temperatures, humidity, atmospheric pressure and ultraviolet light. Despite the glitches, Watkins said controllers remain in high spirits. ""These are the days that people worked five and 10 years for, going on right now,"" he said. Take our Mars quiz . Curiosity is essentially a car-sized mobile science laboratory, packing 17 cameras, a laser that can survey the composition of rocks from a distance and instruments that can analyze samples from soil or rocks. The aim is to determine whether Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting life. Its prime target is the 18,000-foot (5,500-meter) peak at the center of Gale Crater, Mount Sharp. The stratified composition of the mountain could give scientists a layer-by-layer look at the history of the planet. Curiosity's landing site is about 12 km (7.5 miles) from the foot of the mountain, NASA project scientist Sara Milkovich said. The rover is supposed to last for two years on Mars, but it may operate longer -- after all, Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived on Mars in 2004, were each only supposed to last 90 Martian days. Spirit stopped communicating with NASA in 2010 after getting stuck in sand, and Opportunity is still going.","NEW: Controllers to tweak antenna, work on sensor glitch, mission manager says .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is hoping to fulfill a longtime dream by winning the only major tennis title that still eludes him -- Olympic singles gold. The world No. 1 moved into the third round of the London 2012 competition by beating France's Julien Benneteau on Monday in a rematch of their Wimbledon clash last month. Federer came from 2-0 down to win that match in five sets before going on to equal Pete Sampras' record of seven titles at the grass-court event, but this time had no such troubles as he cruised to a 6-2 6-2 victory at the same venue. The 17-time grand slam champion, who won gold in the doubles four years ago, next faces world No. 34 Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan. Federer, whose best singles performance was fourth place at Sydney 2000, said he is inspired to emulate Swiss compatriot Marc Rosset's 1992 gold. Why Federer's friend flew the flag for Switzerland . ""(It would be a) dream come true, I would say, because I definitely get inspired by the 1992 victory by Marc Rosset. That was huge news in Switzerland. I definitely felt like I was inspired by that on an Olympic level,"" he said. ""So when I got the call in 2000 to be part of the Sydney Olympics 12 years ago, I got there, I stayed in the village. I was there for over two weeks. I had the best time following sports, being there with the athletes, playing so well. I almost overachieved in that tournament.

"(CNN) -- The Chicago teachers strike has forced into the open a debate about school reform that has simmered for several years. On one side are ""reformers"" such as Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who have been pushing for the expansion of charter schools, the use of test scores to evaluate teachers, the replacement of veteran teachers with those who are alternatively certified through programs such as Teach for America and the closure of ""failing schools."" The mayor claims these changes will improve public education, although there's been scant evidence to support his proposals. On the other side is the Chicago Teachers Union, which has been clear about what it opposes: Closing schools, expanding charters, for example, but less clear about what should be done to improve schools. On Friday, both sides reached a tentative deal, but the strike is not over until union reps vote, which is expected this weekend. Let's be straight: Chicago's public schools desperately need to change. They have some of the highest dropout rates in the nation, and many schools are chronically unsafe and ineffective. But the district has been undergoing reforms for several years now. Before Emanuel, the chief architect for change was U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, CEO of Chicago Public Schools from 2001 to 2009. In fact, many of the reforms now embraced by Emanuel -- expanding charter schools, replacing failing schools with new schools -- started under Duncan (and former Mayor Richard M. Daley). The question we should be asking is: Why haven't they worked? Clearly something is still not right in Chicago given that only 44.6% of Chicago Public School students meet or exceed the Illinois Learning Standards; and in 2011-12 of the 598 schools in the system, 443 did not achieve ""adequate yearly progress"" for two consecutive years; and 523 schools had an overall rating in 2011 of ""no,"" indicating that they did not make AYP. In an exhaustive study of many of the reforms carried out during the Duncan years, Tony Bryk and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the following elements are essential to sustained school reform: effective leadership, parent-community ties, professional capacity (teacher effectiveness) and a student-centered learning environment. They also found that in the schools where poverty was most heavily concentrated, the reforms failed to generate sustainable improvements because the schools were overwhelmed by poverty's effect on the lives of children. It is important to note that the researchers did not conclude that poverty itself was a learning disability. Rather, the study found that if the effects of poverty -- poor nutrition and health, housing instability, violence, neglect, etc. -- were not addressed, student achievement and school performance suffered. Unlike the mayor, the teachers union has acknowledged this problem and called for more social workers and social services at high poverty schools. In a city where more than 80% of school age children are poor, this is a good start but it doesn't go far enough. Struggling schools in Chicago also need to be able to attract and retain good teachers, and the union has opposed replacing teachers at the failing schools. Unlike the union, the mayor has emphasized the need for urgency in improving the school system since his election. The union must acknowledge that the system needs an effective way to evaluate teachers and an expedited process for removing those who are ineffective. If the union rejects using test scores as a basis for evaluation -- and the research shows that using test scores in this way is both prone to inaccuracies and could create disincentives for teachers to work with the neediest children -- then it must put forward another model that is workable. ""No"" is not an answer. The problems created by ineffective teachers are real and cannot be ignored. The real losers in this strike are the children of Chicago, and not just because they have been left out of school for a few days but because they will be forced to return to too many inadequate schools when the strike is resolved. Emanuel must stop his bullying tactics, and the union must put forward its own proposals for change. Both parties must begin working together to create the schools that the children of Chicago deserve. This must include comprehensive plans for addressing the effects of poverty, but it must also include plans for improving the quality of teaching and the performance of schools. Chicago would do well to learn from the example of Boston, which also has been under mayoral control for several years and has been a leader in reform despite the presence of a strong union. Several of its pilot schools, which function as in-district charters, are top performing schools, and it has also succeeded in turning around struggling schools such as Orchard Gardens. The big difference is that reforms in Boston have been carried out with teachers and not on them. Today, Boston is also one of the top performing urban school districts in the nation, and the union just agreed to a contract that includes rigorous evaluation and uses student test scores in the formula. It's amazing what can be accomplished when the adults work together in the interest of children. It would be a good idea if educational leaders in Chicago spent more time working together for change and improvement and less time pointing fingers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pedro Noguera.","Pedro Noguera: Whatever outcome of teachers strike, it's clear schools need change .
He says they face high dropouts, low ratings, poor student progress, high poverty .
Sides must deal: Union must see need for good teachers; mayor must stop bullying .
Noguera: Even with deal, students will return to substandard schools ."
"(CNN) -- Until the rerun of the Greek elections scheduled for June 17, we will witness an unprecedented game of brinkmanship. The game will be played along the following lines. European political leaders will state unequivocally to the Greek electorate that it is time for them to make a stark choice: Vote for parties that will continue with the agreed reforms (the dreaded austerity) and stay within the European family or vote for parties opposed to the austerity measures and leave the euro and perhaps the European Union. Fear and confusion rule as Greece faces uncertain future . This clear and concise message was recently voiced by Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter. She declared that if Greece does not stick to the terms of its bailout program, it will not receive further aid from the EU or the International Monetary Fund. ""One cannot exit from the eurozone, one can only exit from the EU,"" she said. She also noted that Greece would have to reapply for EU membership, with no guarantee of readmission. CNNMoney: Greek banks strain for cash . Greek politicians, particularly Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras, will probably respond to that message with a different one, which he will transmit back to Brussels, Paris, Berlin and Frankfurt (home of the European Central Bank): Europe cannot afford to let Greece fail and therefore, in the name of solidarity, Europe must continue to do whatever it takes to support Greece. But this time it should not require Greece to take such painful measures. Oh, and Europe will need to give Greece additional funds (in the name of ""growth"") no matter what combination of political parties enters parliament and forms a new government. The trillion dollar question: Will Greece exit the euro? Sounding like a blackmailer, Tsipras has said, ""The eurozone is not in danger because of Greek resistance, but because of the bankrupt policies of the memorandum, of yesterday's political system""; ""if the disease of austerity destroys Greece, it will spread to the rest of Europe""; and ""the European leadership and especially Mrs. Merkel need to stop playing poker with the lives of people."" Perhaps it is fitting that a great test of democracy is taking place in democracy's birthplace. So, who blinks first? In the past three days, we have seen two actors blink immediately: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek and Spanish bank depositors. The consummate political tactician, Merkel understood that with French President Francois Hollande's electoral victory on Sunday, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's continued public pressure and her party's recent electoral loss to the social democrats in the largest German state, the political winds were shifting at home and abroad on growth. This week, Merkel confessed that she was in fact in favor of identifying additional growth measures when she said she was in a ""high level of agreement"" with Hollande. She noted that for ""stimulus to be pursued for growth in the euro zone, which we could pursue in the interest of Greece, we're open for this. Germany is open for this."" Of course, details and date of delivery of said growth remain a mystery. Greek and Spanish depositors were the second actor to blink when they removed approximately â‚¬700 million (about $890 million U.S.) from Greek banks and â‚¬1 billion (about $1.26 billion U.S.) from Spain's third-largest and recently nationalized bank, Bankia. Their actions were indicative of the fear that the game of chicken is getting out of hand. This sentiment was strengthened by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's decision to cut off certain Greek banks from receiving ECB funds and the IMF's announcement, earlier Friday, that it would freeze contacts with Greece until the June 17 election. The ultimate answer to ""who blinks first"" lies in understanding how this crisis has played out over the past two years. Diplomatic marathon: G8 focusing on Greece; NATO, on Afghanistan . The Greek bailout package has already been renegotiated twice, most recently in March of this year, to address deteriorating economic fundamentals and to force private bondholders to take losses. There have been no less than 17 European summits to ""resolve"" the crisis only to return to crisis shortly thereafter. Three bailout packages (Greece, Ireland and Portugal); â‚¬1.3 trillion ($1.65 trillion U.S.) in cheap, three-year loans to European banks; and a change in government in 10 out of the 17 eurozone countries -- the art of the European muddle-through strategy has been perfected. It is clear from Tuesday's meeting between Merkel and Hollande that Europe will continue to actively pursue this muddle-through strategy until it is no longer able to pursue it. The treaties, the summitry and the political volatility that define Europe are completely ill-equipped to handle the crisis as it enters a new and potentially determinate end state. Most important, the collateral damage that comes with muddling through for the past two years is taking a significant social and economic toll: Spanish unemployment is at almost 25%; Greek youth unemployment is at 51.5% and a third of the French electorate in the first round of its presidential elections voted for either an extreme left or right party. Is Europe willing to be home to a lost generation in the name of European solidarity? No one knows how this brinkmanship will come to an end, or even if it will come to an end at all. And certainly no one knows whether it will result in economic Armageddon or a small blip on a trader's computer screen. Actions or statements by either side are likely not to be conclusive. It is more likely that a sudden, unanticipated shock created by either the markets or political actors before June 17 causes an unstoppable chain reaction. Should this be this outcome, in some way it may come as a relief as it is far easier to blame an event than to accept responsibility for Europe's actions over the past two years. This game of chicken is not unique to Europe. Washington had its own bout of brinkmanship last summer regarding the increase in America's debt ceiling, and is likely to have it again in a few months. Europe has just upped the level of play. What does it mean to be Greek right now? Share your story with us on iReport! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Heather A.

"(CNN) -- World No. 6 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga entered the record books on Tuesday by winning the longest tennis match in Olympic history. The Frenchman's second-round clash with Canada's Milos Raonic took three hours 58 minutes to complete, with the final set ending 25-23. Tsonga drew first blood, comfortably taking the opening set 6-3. But Raonic, who is ranked 23rd in the world game, notched up the reverse score line in the second set and was increasingly looking like the man to beat. Three match points came and went for the fifth seed before he finally found a volley at 40-15 in game 66 of the match,which was met with a desperate, failing lunge by Raonic. It ensured the encounter beat the previous record of 48 games in one match between Chile's Fernando Gonzalez and American Taylor Dent in the Athens Olympics of 2004. A men's match at the 1920 Olympics lasted 76 games, but that was played over five sets. It also claimed the record for the longest third set played at an Olympic match. Officials at Wimbledon have become used to rewriting the history books of late. The tennis venue was also the home of the longest game in all competitions when another Frenchman, Nicholas Mahut was beaten by American John Isner in a match lasting 183 games over three days in 2010. Tsonga admitted this was one of the rare chances he had to shine in the tough world of men's tennis. ""It's good because this is the only way to write my name in history for the moment. With Rafa, Roger and Novak, even Andy (Murray), it's tough to go through big tournaments. So I'm really happy. I hope I will have some more,"" he told reporters. Meanwhile, Australian wildcard entry Lleyton Hewitt pulled off the shock result of the day in the second round. The former world No. 1, now ranked 159th, beat Croatia's No. 13 Maran Cilic, 6-4 7-5 to set up a last-16 clash with Serbian second seed Novak Djokovic. Djokovic ensured there was no such giantkilling for veteran American Andy Roddick, beating his fellow former world No. 1 6-2 6-1. British hopes in the competition remain in the hands of Wimbledon finalist Andy Murray, who beat 43rd-ranked Jarkko Niemenen from Finland 6-2 6-4. Third seed Murray will next face Cypriot Marcus Baghdatis, who beat French 16th seed Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-4. Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer also went through, and will play Japan's Kei Nishikori in round three. But no more Brits remain in the ladies' singles, as third seed Maria Sharapova edged closer to her first Olympic medal by overcoming Britain's former junior Wimbledon winner Laura Robson 7-6 (7-5) 6-3. The English teenager admitted being outplayed by the French Open champion, but also had some less than kind words about the state of the hallowed turf on Center Court. ""At 5-5 she (Sharapova) hit a serve that bounced a bit funny so I was already a bit gone with that one. Then I hit a pretty solid serve and her return just died. But it happens on grass courts, especially when they're really worn, like Center is at the moment,"" she told the UK Press Association news agency. Sharapova, who was the first woman to carry Russia's flag at the opening ceremony, faces a rematch with German 15th seed Sabine Lisicki -- who beat her in the fourth round at Wimbledon. Heather Watson lost 6-3 6-2 to another Russian, 14th seed Maria Kirilenko, to complete a bad day for the women in Team GB. Kirilenko earned a third-round clash with Germany's Julia Gorges, who upset Poland's Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska in the opening round. World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka strolled into round three with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of Spain's Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez, earning a match with Russia's Vera Zvonareva. Venus Williams joined younger sister Serena in the last 16 as the Sydney 2000 singles champion progressed with a 6-1 6-3 win over Canada's Aleksandra Wozniak. The American will next play German seventh seed Angelique Kerber, who thrashed Hungary's Timea Babos 6-1 6-1.","Jo-Wilfried Tsonga wins longest match in Olympic history, breaking two records .

"(CNN) -- It has been three days since Chris Stevens and three other Americans lost their lives in Benghazi, Libya. I lived and worked for four years in Libya, leaving hurriedly last year in an evacuation as the civil war began. I sit safely now in my new home in Qatar, and those who shared my Libyan experiences -- and who knew Chris -- are now spread out around the world. I know from their e-mails that, like me, they are also unspeakably sad. Every life on this good earth is precious, and all four Americans who lost their lives at the U.S. Consulate were in Benghazi to help the Libyan efforts. They will be very, very much missed. Because I knew and worked with Chris, I understand firsthand that the world has lost a true hero, and we seem to have precious few of those. Chris was smart, supportive, kind, approachable, very passionate about reestablishing a relationship between the United States and Libya and improving the lives of the Libyan people. He was a perfect candidate for his new role as ambassador. When someone like that is taken away, you don't just mourn the loss of a colleague or friend, you mourn the greater loss for our planet. We were both originally from northern California, but Chris and I first met in Libya, arriving around the same time in 2007. I was there as the new director of the fledgling American School of Tripoli and Chris had just been appointed U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission. The United States and Libya had reestablished diplomatic relations in 2004, but the U.S. Liaison Office had just been upgraded to a full embassy in 2006. Because no ambassador had yet been named, as deputy chief, Chris served as acting ambassador until the arrival of Ambassador Gene Cretz in January 2009. Working in Libya at that time was challenging. The infrastructure that the West left behind had long disappeared during the 30 years of sanctions, and we were all scrambling to develop our institutions and businesses from the ground up. Chris built a team of embassy personnel, negotiated with a quixotic Libyan government, helped the returning U.S. companies and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the American School. He loved the school and in an e-mail earlier this year shared how much he was looking forward to witness its eventual reopening. During the two years we worked together, I watched Chris serve with aplomb, patience, and an easy smile. If you sat and talked with him, it was clear that he was well-read and a deep thinker, but he was always humble. He was also extremely comfortable whether he was speaking with VIPs or Libyan farmers. I had the good fortune to sit with him on the Fulbright Scholarship Committee that helped Libyans further their education in America, one of the many tangible ways he demonstrated his dedication to the Libyan people. He traveled across the sparsely populated country savoring the rich archaeological sites, and broke bread with Berbers in their cave homes. Always gracious, he hosted receptions for Libyan ministers and businessmen and, just as often, was in khakis and a T-shirt, holding informal embassy gatherings on the roof of his villa, smiling and making sure that everyone was included. What really made Chris exceptional to me, however, was his ability to distance himself. Not the aloof kind of distancing that you might expect from someone in his position, but the kind where one puts emotion and ego aside in order to truly listen, to understand, and then to find a way to build bridges. It is extremely rare to find someone who can do that, consistently rising above the fray, and that's what makes his death so especially painful. Of course I feel anger at those horribly misguided people who are responsible for this tragedy, but I am also trying to rise above it, like Chris would. For those who find this yet another reason to vilify Muslims, I point to other examples of seemingly senseless violence like the Aurora movie theater shootings or the attack on Gabrielle Giffords, neither of which had anything to do with Islam. We live in a world where frustration and anger override the sanctity of life. We live in a world where it's easier to get our hands on weapons than to give each other a helping hand. We live in a world where too many people use religion as a vehicle for hatred, rather than love. I was extremely fortunate for a few years to have lived and worked under the light of Chris' grace and vision. I know he touched all who knew him. As I continue to watch the Libyans, who have only known oppression, try to dig out of the void left behind in the wake of Moammar Gadhafi's fall, I will always remember Chris and the legacy he has left them. We are all better for having known Chris. My hope is hope that Libya will flourish for its people and that we, each in our own way, will make him proud.

"(CNN) -- Humanity's curiosity about Mars has led to an exciting event: the dramatic landing of an SUV-sized rover, set for 1:31 a.m. ET Monday. NASA's $2.6 billion rover, Curiosity, will make its dramatic entrance into Martian territory in a spectacle popularly known as the ""seven minutes of terror."" This jaw-dropping landing process, involving a sky crane and the world's largest supersonic parachute, allows the spacecraft carrying Curiosity to target the landing area that scientists have meticulously chosen. The spacecraft is ""healthy and right on course,"" according to the latest update from NASA. Curiosity has been traveling away from Earth since November 26. The vehicle, which will be controlled from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has a full suite of sophisticated tools for exploring Mars. They include 17 cameras, a laser that can survey the composition of rocks from a distance and instruments that can analyze samples from soil or rocks. Meet a rover driver: His car is on Mars . If all goes according to plan, Curiosity's first stop will be Gale Crater, which may have once contained a lake. After at least a year, the rover will arrive at Mount Sharp, in the center of the crater. The rover will drive up the mountain examining layers of sediment. This process is like looking at a historical record because each layer represents an era of the planet's history, scientists say. The phenomenon of sedimentary layers is remarkably similar to what is seen on Earth, in California's Death Valley or in Montana's Glacier National Park, says John Grotzinger, chief scientist of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. Rocks and minerals found on Earth are different than on Mars, but the idea of a mountain made of layers is familiar to scientists. Unlike on Earth, however, Mars has no plate tectonics, so the Martian layers are flat and not disrupted as they would be on Earth. That also means that Mount Sharp was formed in a different way than how mountains are created on Earth -- no one knows how. Images: Exploring Mars . In these layers, scientists are looking for organic molecules, which are necessary to create life. But even if Curiosity finds them, that's not proof that life existed -- after all, these molecules are found in bus exhaust and meteorites, too, says Steve Squyres, part of the Mars Science Laboratory science team. If there aren't any organics, that may suggest there's something on the planet destroying these molecules, says James Wray, assistant professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology and collaborator on the Curiosity science team. But if Curiosity detects them, Wray said, that might help scientists move from asking, ""Was Mars ever habitable?"" to ""Did Mars actually host life?"" ""A successful landing will grant a huge breath of relief to the entire Mars science community tonight,"" Wray said in an e-mail. ""And it will certainly keep NASA at the forefront of Mars exploration for at least the next few years."" Liquid water is not something scientists expect to be apparent on Mars because the planet is so cold and dry, Squyres said. If the planet does harbor liquid water today, it would have to be deep below the surface, perhaps peeking out in a few special places, but not likely to be seen by Curiosity, Squyres said. Rover to search for clues to life on Mars . It's hard to know how long ago liquid water would have been there because there's no mechanism to date the rocks that rovers find on Mars, Squyres said. Evidence from the spacecraft NASA has sent to Mars so far suggests that the ""warm and wet"" period on Mars lasted for the first billion years of the planet's history. ""In order to create life, you need both the right environmental conditions -- which includes liquid water -- and you need the building blocks from which life is built, which includes organics,"" Squyres said. The Mars Science Laboratory is a precursor mission to sharper technology that could do life detection, Grotzinger said. There aren't specific molecules that scientists are looking for with Curiosity. The attitude is: ""Let's go to an interesting place with good tools and find out what's there,"" Squyres said. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was swarming with media this past week as scientists and journalists prepared for signs of the rover's landing. Squyres and a colleague told each other Thursday they were both feeling ""full of hope and optimism."" The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's confirmed list of ""VIP"" guests included celebrities Alex Trebek, Chuck Lorre, Wil Wheaton, Nichelle Nichols, Bill Prady and June Lockhart. But the excitement spread far beyond NASA locations: Parties in honor of the Mars rover landing were scheduled around the world. About 300 people passed through the Atlanta Science Tavern landing party at Georgia Institute of Technology, organizer Marc Merlin said. The event included several presentations about planetary science, during which several attendees had to sit on the floor or stand in order to fit in the lecture room. The event switched to ""party"" mode around midnight, giving way to loud chatter about space exploration among science enthusiasts and researchers. Wray delivered a presentation about the history of Mars exploration. Before Curiosity, humans have landed spacecraft on the equivalent of parking lots -- relatively safe, flat places on Mars, he said. By comparison, ""tonight we're landing in the Grand Canyon,"" he said. Interest was so great in the event that Merlin stopped promoting it a few days before. The possibility of life elsewhere reaches beyond people interested in science, he said, and Curiosity points towards a potential revolution. ""That's why people are here tonight: They want to be part of history,"" Merlin said. What do you think about the Mars mission? Go to iReport . Although a lot of science went into this landing process, superstition on landing night can't hurt. It's traditional to open up cans of peanuts and pass them around to the team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory responsible for overseeing the landing of the rover, said David Oh, lead flight director for the mission, earlier this week. ""It's always been a lucky charm for us, and missions have always seemed to work out better when we had the peanuts there,"" Oh said. ""For landing this, I'll take all the great engineering we have, and all the luck you can give us, too."" Sunday also happens to be the 82nd birthday of former NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong. It's hoped the birthday will be auspicious for the landing, NASA's John Grunsfeld said in a news conference. Curiosity is supposed to last for two years on Mars, but it may operate longer -- after all, Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived on Mars in 2004, were each only supposed to last 90 Martian days. Spirit stopped communicating with NASA in 2010 after getting stuck in sand, and Opportunity is still going. ""You take what Mars gives you,"" said Squyres, also the lead scientist on the Mars Exploration Rover Mission, which includes Spirit and Opportunity. ""If we knew what we were going to find, it wouldn't be this much fun.""","The dramatic landing of the SUV-sized rover is set for 1:31 a.m. ET Monday .

"London (CNN) -- Seven athletes from Cameroon's delegation to the London Olympics have gone missing, the country's head of mission said Tuesday. The missing athletes include five male boxers, a female footballer and a male swimmer, Paul Ekane Edingue, said David Ojong, Cameroon's head of mission to London 2012. Ojong said the missing boxers, named as Thomas Essomba, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, Yhyacinthe Abdon Mewoli, Serge Ambomo and Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, had not been seen since Monday. Footballer Drusille Ngako, who was one of the team's reserve players, went missing on July 26, he said. The Cameroonian delegation approached the London Games organizers, LOCOG, and the High Commission of Cameroon in London as soon as they became aware of the missing athletes, Ojong said. Nothing has been heard from the athletes since they went missing, he said, but their compatriots ""hope and believe"" the athletes will rejoin the group before they return to Cameroon. UK authorities say athletes visiting the United Kingdom for the Games are free to come and go as they please from the Olympic village, where visiting delegations are housed. Athletes and team officials have been allowed to seek permission to enter and remain in the United Kingdom without a visa from March 30 to November 8. Their right to be in the country ends on November 8. The UK Home Office, which is responsible for border security, declined to comment on the missing athletes. The director of protocol at the Cameroonian Ministry for External Relations in Yaounde also declined to comment. Cameroon, a west African nation of more than 20 million people, sent more than 30 athletes to the London Games but has yet to win a medal.

"(CNN) -- Google says the Nexus 7, its hotly anticipated new tablet computer, is shipping to customers who preordered it this week, amid reports of heavy demand. In an e-mail to customers, the company said some versions of the 7-inch tablet are in the mail and others would be on the way to customers by Thursday evening. ""We've had incredible demand for the new tablet and are shipping them as quickly as possible,"" read the message. ""If you placed your order by July 11, it will ship this week, and we've upgraded to overnight shipping so it arrives sooner. Orders placed after July 11 will ship next week with overnight shipping."" At its online Help Center, Google says 8 GB versions of the Nexus 7 have already been shipped in the United States. All 16 GB versions that were ordered before July 11 should be shipped by the end of the day Thursday. Orders in the UK and Australia will be shipped later this month. Retailers have been reporting that they've already sold out of all of the Nexus 7s they've ordered. Photos surface of a large, early-2000s iPad prototype . CNET reported this week that GameStop, Staples, Sam's Club and Office Depot already had sold out of the tablet. GameStop told the blog they expected another shipment on August 7. A quick check of several websites Thursday, including Fry's and Best Buy, didn't turn up any that say they have the Nexus 7 in stock. There have been scattered reports online of people who say they've already received a Nexus 7 or found one in stores. But, in an unusual move, Google has not announced an official date they'll go on sale in retail stores. While all signs point to big sales, Google also remains mum on how many tablets have been ordered or shipped to retailers. In the past, some electronics companies have been suspected of intentionally limiting the supply of new products to create the appearance of strong demand. Last month, Google announced it would be releasing its own, 7-inch tablet. It's a move that comes in the wake of the relative success Amazon has had with its smaller, less expensive iPad competitor, the Kindle Fire. Analysts say the Kindle Fire sold roughly 16 million of the devices last year. That's as good as any tablet has done other than the Apple's iPad. Apple is expected to sell 55 million by the end of this year. The arrival of the Nexus 7 and a possible smaller iPad, however, have many wondering whether it will keep its momentum. Like the Fire, which also has a 7-inch screen, the 8 GB Nexus 7 will sell for $199. A 16 GB version sells for $249. Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. Wired magazine called it ""the best Android tablet yet."" ""The Nexus 7, the first tablet to wear Google's Nexus brand, sets a new standard for smaller slates, proving that just because it isn't as big as Apple's iPad doesn't mean it can't be just as useful, as fast, or as fun,"" Nathan Olivarez-Giles wrote for Wired, a CNN content partner. The Kindle Fire has been the most successful tablet so far running Google's Android operating system (actually a modified version). A new version, possibly adding a camera and higher-definition display, is anticipated later this year. Review: Nexus 7 is best Android tablet yet .","Google's Nexus 7 tablets are on their way .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Fifty rebel lawmakers resigned Monday from Japan's governing party, weakening the majority of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda as he pushes a controversial increase in the sales tax through parliament. Led by the influential Ichiro Ozawa, 40 members of the lower house and 12 members of the upper house have left the Democratic Party of Japan, said Kenji Yamaoka, a senior lawmaker allied with Ozawa. However, two of the lower house lawmakers on the list announced by Yamaoka -- Megumu Tsuji and Takeshi Shina -- subsequently said they were not leaving the party, their offices said. The exodus is in protest over Noda's plan to double the sales tax from 5% to 10% to try to tackle Japan's huge public debt, Yamaoka said. The lower house passed the measure last week despite opposition from the group led by Ozawa, a former party leader known for his political power-broking. The departures Monday whittle down Noda's majority in the lower house, leaving the Democratic Party of Japan with 251 out of 480 seats. In the upper house, which is still to vote on the sales tax legislation, the party now holds 92 out of 242 seats. Noda, who took office in September, is the latest in a string of politically fragile Japanese leaders. He is the sixth prime minister in the six years since the departure of Junichiro Koizumi, who was in power for more than five years. The Ozawa-led exodus has fueled speculation about a possible vote of no confidence being introduced against Noda. But Ozawa has so far failed to lure away enough Democratic Party of Japan members to threaten Noda immediately. If a vote of no confidence were to be called and Noda lost, he would have to step down or call a snap election. Ozawa said last week that he expected a general election could be called ""in the near future.""","NEW: Two of the Japanese lawmakers on the list of those leaving say they are staying .

"(CNN) -- It was a ""million to one odds"" that the Olympic women's triathlon race would end in a photo finish, but the outcome is again in doubt following Sweden's decision to appeal the result in sport's last-resort court. The Swedish Olympic Committee (NOC) has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport following its failure to have Lisa Norden awarded the gold medal following last Saturday's event. Switzerland's Nicola Spirig was adjudged to have crossed the line first after both women finished in one hour 59.43 seconds and was awarded victory despite protests from the Swedes. Both the NOC and the Swedish Triathlon Federation failed to have the decision overturned after filing an official complaint to the International Triathlon Union (ITU). Norden's fate now rests in the hands of the CAS, which will make a decision on Saturday in London. The ITU told CNN it could not comment on the case until after the verdict. Brownlee brothers take triathlon by storm . It was time an Olympic triathlon has been settled in such a manner, and former Australian triathlete Bridie O'Donnell was astonished by the close finish. ""It was a million to one odds,"" she told CNN. ""Perhaps it's a bit remiss of coaches not to work on the finishing styles of their athletes as one of the girls dipped her head and the other went with her chest. ""I just think that nobody ever expected such a close finish because you would expect after two hours of competition that there would be a bigger gap. I've never seen anything like it in all my time of watching triathlon."" O'Donnell said that Saturday's decision will have a huge impact on the winner. ""It's a shame that it has gone to CAS because the race has gone and the medal ceremony cannot be brought back, but you cannot underestimate how much that gold medal means because it can change somebody's life,"" she said. ""To normal people watching they just think about the race and some people will say that they should get on with it. ""But that gold could mean â‚¬100,000 ($123,000) to somebody and that's why the Swedish team are possibly appealing. I'm sure the Swiss would have done the same if it had been the other way around."" Now based in Colorado, O'Donnell has taken time out of her medical career to compete on the Pro-cycling circuit. A qualified doctor and a seven-time national rowing champion, she has competed in several triathlons and Ironman competitions. ""I love triathlon and I thought that the Olympic race was gripping,"" O'Donnell said. ""I was watching it with a lot of people who weren't fans of triathlon and now they absolutely love it.

"(CNN)  -- As many as 12,000 Puerto Rican schoolchildren, teachers and school administrators are believed to be victims of an identity-theft ring that sold stolen personal documents to illegal immigrants in the mainland United States, according to the FBI. A federal grand jury this week indicted eight people on charges of identity theft, aggravated identity theft and Social Security fraud. ""In search warrants, we found over 5,000 different types of identification documents -- originals and copies, Social Security cards and birth certificates,"" FBI spokesman Harry Rodriguez said in a telephone interview Tuesday from San Juan. ""They were selling them as a set; an original birth certificate and Social Security card sold for $150 or more. Copies sold for $40 or more,"" he said. Rodriguez called it the biggest case of identity theft in his 15 years with the FBI in Puerto Rico. The investigation began after a string of school burglaries swept the island in 2007, said Lymarie Llovet-Ayala, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. Authorities believe the suspects broke into about 50 public schools and stole personal files belonging to students, teachers and school administrators. In Puerto Rico, students must provide an original or a copy of their birth certificate to be registered in a school. ""They are children; they don't have credit cards or property so it is much harder to detect identity theft,"" Llovet-Ayala said. ""We are in the process of identifying all the victims."" Llovet-Ayala said authorities have been able to identify buyers of stolen identification materials in Texas, Alaska and California, where ring members mailed documents to different contacts. The seven men and one woman indicted Monday -- some from Puerto Rico and some from the Dominican Republic -- face up to 15 years in a federal prison, with fines up to $250,000 if they are convicted, she said. The suspects had their first hearing Tuesday and are being held in a federal prison in Puerto Rico. Authorities are searching for another suspect, she said.

"East Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A device attached to the body of a bank manager who was forced to help rob her own bank looked like a bomb but was not one, California law officers said Wednesday night. Authorities were searching for two men who robbed the bank of ""substantial"" money earlier in the day. Both wore masks and one reportedly brandished a handgun. The bank employee told police she was accosted by the men outside her residence in Huntington Park as she was leaving for work Wednesday morning, said Lt. Neal Mongan of the Huntington Park Police Department. The unidentified employee allegedly was told to drive to the bank in nearby East Los Angeles. ""The employee said she was told it was a bomb and she believed it to be a bomb,"" Mongan told reporters. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department initially said the Bank of America branch manager was held captive overnight. The manager entered the bank vault with the device strapped to her body, according to Sheriff's Department spokesman Capt. Mike Parker. The manager threw the money out the back door where the two men were waiting. The two robbers fled the scene, police said. Deputies evacuated the bank and kept the employee calm while bomb squad technicians rushed to the scene. Technicians trained in the procedure ""very carefully removed that device from her body,"" said Parker. ""That is a very rare occurrence to actually remove a device directly from a person."" A robot later disabled the item. Parker declined to describe the device, but said it was not explosive. Mongan said police are looking into why the bank manager was targeted. She was not injured and was still being interviewed later Wednesday. Asked whether the manager might be an accomplice, Parker replied, ""Everything is investigated, but at this time there is no indication of that."" The FBI is assisting in the investigation of the abduction and bank robbery. The elaborate plot evoked a Hollywood movie script.

"(CNN) -- Two weeks since his last public appearance, presumptive Chinese leader Xi Jinping was pictured attending an event Saturday in Beijing, state media reported. The state-run Xinhua news agency, on both its English- and Chinese-language websites, published a one-line story stating that Xi had arrived Saturday morning at China Agricultural University for activities tied to the nation's annual National Science Popularization Day. An accompanying photo showed him wearing a coat and surrounded by other men as he strolled on the grounds of the Beijing university. Absence fuels intrigue before power transition . The 59-year-old vice president had not been seen in public since September 1, when he was reported to have given a speech to the Central Party School in Beijing. Images published by major news websites after the date showed Xi smartly dressed in a dark suit and purple tie. Since then, the cancellation of a number of meetings with high-profile foreign dignitaries has created a storm of speculation as rumor and hearsay fill the void of official information. For a number of days, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei has declined to answer queries on Xi at the ministry's daily press briefings. When Xi's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton was abruptly canceled September 5, American officials said their Chinese counterparts had blamed a ""scheduling conflict."" No official reasons were given following the cancellation of other appointments, including a meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The lack of comment has fueled unsubstantiated rumors, including wild plot lines ranging from a car crash, to an assassination attempt. Others say Xi has been sidelined by a suspected heart attack or stroke, neither of which have been denied or confirmed. Xi has been mentioned as a possible successor to Chinese President Hu Jintao. In a matter of weeks, more than 2,000 delegates are expected to meet in Beijing for the Communist Party's 18th National Congress. During their event, China's political elite are expected to announce the results of months of political maneuvering, and the names of the five to seven new entrants to Politburo Standing Committee.

"(CNN) -- It was as busy day of dealings Friday as football clubs around Europe decided who to buy and which players to sell before the close season transfer window closed. Premier League champions Manchester City signed Brazil's right-back Maicon from Inter Milan for an undisclosed fee and late on snared Spain international midfielder Javi Garcia. City boss Roberto Mancini has also brought in Scott Sinclair from Swansea City for an undisclosed fee and Fiorentina defender Matija Nastasic. Blues' Montenegro international Stefan Savic and Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong headed to Italy to join Fiorentina and AC Milan respectively. De Jong has signed a contract with the seven-time European champions which will keep him at the San Siro until 2015. Also on his way to Serie A was Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner who joined Juventus on a one-year loan deal. The 24-year-old Danish striker took to Twitter to voice his approval saying: ""I want to fulfil my potential here and show the fans my absolute best as that is yet to come. I am sure I will."" Meanwhile on the red side of Manchester, striker Dimitar Berbatov has finally chosen a new English suitor. After flirting with offers from Italy -- notably Fiorentina and Juventus -- the 31-year-old Bulgarian international moved to Fulham on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee. ""I'm impressed with the set up here and the people have made me feel welcome. There is a close and personal feel around the Club and I can't wait to get started,"" Berbatov told the west London club's official website. The Bulgarian international will be joined by another former United player, Kieran Richardson. The 27-year-old joins from fellow English Premier League side Sunderland. Rafael van der Vaart is on his way back to the Bundesliga after Tottenham Hotspur and Hamburg agreed a deal thought to be worth nearly $16 million. The 29-year-old Dutch international, who played three seasons for the German club before joining Real Madrid in 2008, has signed a three-year deal, concluding a successful two-season spell with the north London club. Tottenham used the proceeds from this sale and the earlier transfer of Luca Modric to Real Madrid to sign United States international striker Clint Dempsey, who had been a Liverpool target, from Fulha, . They also secured the signature of French international goalkeeper Hugo Lloris from Lyon, both deals completed late Friday night. Swansea City have signed Valencia winger Pablo Hernandez for a club record fee of nearly $9 million. ""I want to thank the club and (Swansea City manager) Michael Laudrup for making me feel like a very important player. Now I want to repay that faith on the football field,"" the 27-year-old said on the club's official website. After offloading striker Andy Carroll to West Ham United on loan on Thursday, Liverpool announced Friday that they were permanently dispensing with the services of Scottish international Charlie Adam. The 26-year-old midfielder has moved to Stoke City for a reported $6 million fee after spending just 13 months at the Merseyside club.","English Premier League champions Manchester City sign Maicon from Inter Milan .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. citizen injured in a 1997 suicide bombing in Jerusalem is claiming money from the Warwick New York Hotel, which will host Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the upcoming annual U.N. assembly, the man's lawyer says. Stuart Hersh was in a mall when the Hamas terrorist organization carried out the attack. In 2003, a U.S. District Court awarded Hersh $12 million from the Iranian government, ruling it was responsible for supplying and training the suicide bombers. Hersh says he never received money from Iran. ""We want to be entitled to the money of Ahmadinejad and his delegations,"" Hersh's lawyer, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, told CNN. ""We believe it belongs to us as a judgment holder."" Hersh has filed a claim against the Warwick hoping to either collect the money that the Iranian government will pay the hotel for the Iranian president's stay, or be granted use of the rooms that Ahmadinejad and his entourage would use. ""If he needs a place to stay, let him sleep in the subways"" Hersh told CNN. He also added a restraining order restricting Ahmadinejad and his group from using the hotel rooms until the court reaches a decision, Darshan-Leitner said. ""He owes me $12 million,"" Hersh said. ""He's spending money that should be mine."" The Iranian government will be spending between $10,000 and $15,000 a night on accommodations at the Warwick, which could result in $75,000 to $100,000 for Hersh, Darshan-Leitner said. Hersh and his wife now live in Israel and say they will not move back to the United States until they feel justice has been served. Originally from Fresh Meadows in the Queens borough of New York City, Hersh said he cannot afford to travel to his home state but would make the trip if he were awarded the rooms. He said he would ""invite other terror victims to join him and max out room service on Iran's credit card."" Hersh says he has withstood a heart attack, a perforated colon, colon cancer and diabetes, all of which he attributes to post traumatic stress disorder resulting from looking the terrorists in the face before they blew themselves up in 1997. At 63, he still suffers chest pains and hearing loss from the attack. ""All I want is the money that's due to us and we don't want the American people to pay for it,"" Hersh said. ""I don't want them paying disability to me, I want the money from Iran."" He holds Ahmadinejad accountable for withholding the money, and the American government accountable for letting him get away without paying it. ""This is not sane,"" Hersh said. ""That a man can come into the U.S. and enjoy American luxury and not have to pay for his crimes."" Since 2003, Hersh has laid claim to Iranian money in lawsuits throughout the United States and Europe, he said. A few years after being awarded the $12 million, Hersh won the rights to a house that the shah of Iran had bought for his son in Lubbock, Texas, and sold the house for around half a million dollars, according to Darshan-Leitner. Hersh also filed lawsuits in Chicago and Boston, claiming the rights to Iranian artifacts lent to the University of Chicago and Harvard University. Darshan-Leitner said each of those lawsuits is currently before a court of appeal. The Warwick did not respond to inquiries about the legal papers that Darshan-Leitner said were delivered to the hotel Thursday. Family of Marine imprisoned in Iran pleads for his release .

"(CNN) -- This week, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan leveled the ultimate insult at President Barack Obama. He said: ""The Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now."" In the modern political era, comparing any Democratic (or Republican) president to Jimmy Carter is just about as nasty as a politician can get. The characterization of Carter might not be fair -- as many historians have started to look again at the accomplishments of his term, such as his initiatives on energy and his role in the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt -- but the poor state of the economy on his watch and trouble in Iran and Afghanistan left the Georgian as a symbol of incompetence and failed presidential leadership. A different way to think about Ryan's statement is to ask a question, one that is equally relevant to Ryan and his future: What is the condition of the Republican Party compared with where it stood in 1980? On this front, the comparison might not be so kind to the GOP. After all, when Carter's presidency ended, the Republicans had a number of up-and-coming political stars who would soon remake the political landscape, ranging from Newt Gingrich to Ronald Reagan, both in their prime. Today, even with the promise of candidates such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and U.S. Rep. Ryan, it is unclear whether Republicans have the same kind of farm team ready to take over Washington. Reagan expressed conservative ideas in a way that was appealing to a broad spectrum of the country and made the ideas of the right seem like a bridge to the future. Reagan displayed the kind of electoral savvy that was needed to hold together a diverse coalition even when there were significant differences over policy among Republicans. He could deflect attacks from his opponents with a turn of the phrase or even a quick smile. Certainly, presidential candidate Mitt Romney has revealed the limits of his talent on the campaign trail and his difficulty articulating the same kind of compelling ideological agenda as his predecessors in 1980. Another way in which Republicans are not doing as well is, ironically, a result of their success. After holding significant power in the White House or Congress for over three decades, Republicans can no longer claim the same kind of outsider status as they did when Reagan won office. Since 1980, they are a party with a sizable record of their own -- a record that includes high levels of government spending, pork barrel politics, flawed military operations, corruption and unsuccessful economic policies. When Republicans talk about the problems with Washington, they must talk about the problems with themselves, not just Democrats. They even have a controversial president of their own, George W. Bush, who has come to symbolize failures of conservative leadership. Finally, according to numerous analysts, demographics are no longer working in favor of Republicans. While in 1980 Republicans were riding the wave of a booming Sunbelt, Democrats can now look forward to the expanding minority vote, namely Hispanics, and the movement of highly educated voters into blue states. So Ryan might be right that voters can feel a little of 1980 in 2012, given that the economic stagnation of today is reminiscent of the malaise in the late 1970s. But the GOP needs to be careful because their party is not in quite the same shape as it once was. and as a result, it might have a harder time repeating Reagan's success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Paul Ryan has ""insulted"" Obama by comparing his presidency to Carter's .
He has better question: Is GOP in anything like the position it held in 1980 with Reagan?

"(CNN) -- Defending Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic and six-time winner Roger Federer will meet in the last four after both came through quarterfinal matches with comfortable straight sets victories Wednesday. Federer was at his imperious best as he crushed Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-1 6-2 6-2 with Djokovic later joining him in the semifinals after dispatching Germany's Florian Mayer 6-4 6-1 6-4. ""Roger has been on the top of the men's game for so long. This is where he won six titles. He definitely wants to prove himself and to everybody else that he can win it once again,"" said Djokovic, who will lose the top ranking if Federer can win a record-extending 17th grand slam title on Sunday. ""Today he won incredibly fast, in straight sets, so we'll see. I'm playing well, I believe. We both have to play at our best in order to get a win. I really have nothing to lose. I'm going to try to win."" Britain's home hope Andy Murray will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in the other semifinal after both later won four-set matches. World number one Djokovic had reached this stage of a grand slam for the ninth successive time, with only Federer, Rod Laver and Ivan Lendl surpassing that record. He recovered from a slow start, dropping his opening service game, to overpower Mayer, helped by a 20-minute rain delay out on Court One. When he returned he broke for a second time to take the opening set and two further breaks saw him with a two set lead. The third set followed a similar pattern as the 25-year-old Serbian produced a string of winners and he took a 5-4 lead before serving out for victory. Djokovic has beaten Federer in their last three meetings, but the Swiss maestro was even more impressive in seeing off Youzhny on Centre Court, never allowing his opponent the chance to get a foothold in the match. ""It is interesting that this is our first grass-court match. I'm looking forward to it,"" the 30-year-old Federer said of what will be a record 32nd grand slam semifinal appearance, surpassing Jimmy Connors' total. ""It's been a good tournament so far for me. I'm happy I'm feeling good again. It gives me confidence going into a big match against Novak."" Djokovic is fully aware of the challenge posed by Federer, who is one week short of Pete Sampras' career record of 286 at the top of the world rankings. ""He is a great champion and has been so dominant and consistent at the grand slams. He is the ultimate challenge on grass courts."" Djokovic is bidding to become the first man since Federer in 2007 to retain the Wimbledon title, and also add to his Australian Open success earlier this year. World No. 4 Murray kept fans on Centre Court on tenterhooks for nearly four hours before he got past Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer. Ferrer took a set lead and was a break up in the second before his Scottish opponent established a toehold in the match. He trailed 5-2 in the second set tiebreaker before hitting back to level and moved ahead when he took the third set. A brief rain delay halted play at 5-5 in the fourth set before fourth seed Murray returned to win the match 6-7 7-6 6-4 7-6. It will be his fourth Wimbledon straight semifinal, bidding to become the first British player to win a grand slam since Fred Perry in 1936. Tsonga will provide stiff opposition but he was extended by German Philipp Kohlschreiber in their clash on Court One. After dropping the second set, Tsonga, who beat Federer in the quarterfinals last year, emerged a 7-6 4-6 7-6 6-2 winner.","Novak Djokovic to play Roger Federer in the Wimbledon semifinals .

"Washington (CNN) -- After a five-week summer recess, Congress returns to a long list of unfinished business, but with 57 left days before Election Day, it's likely it will tackle only the bare minimum in its short fall session. The one must-pass measure -- a short-term continuing resolution to fund federal agencies -- will avoid any pre-election talk of a government shutdown, with which neither party wants to be tagged. Republican and Democratic leaders struck a deal this summer on a six-month bill, but both chambers still need to pass the legislation before government funding expires at the end of this month. The House is expected vote on the bill Thursday, and two GOP leadership aides predict it will get a sizable bipartisan majority. A senior Senate Democratic aide tells CNN the Senate is expected to approve the measure next week. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-ranking GOP leader in the House, did not directly answer whether a majority of House Republicans would vote for the stopgap spending bill, but said, ""I expect that bill to be a bipartisan vote, and I expect the Senate to pass it as well and not add anything to it."" What could move . -- It's possible that GOP and Democratic leaders could work out a deal on a farm bill to reform agriculture programs and provide some relief to drought-stricken states -- or at least agree to another short-term extension of the current law, according to multiple congressional aides. If they can't reconcile differences between the two varying approaches taken by the House and Senate, some money for drought assistance, plus some money for states affected by recent natural disasters, could be tacked onto the spending bill. McCarthy, who represents some agricultural interests in his California district, told reporters Monday he's still pressing to pass a bill before the election. He acknowledged to reporters on Capitol Hill that ""the time frame is tough,"" but ""it's our intent to get it done."" Long, hot summer sends food prices soaring . -- The Senate will return and work on a veterans jobs bill this week. Senate Democrats are also considering action this month on a housing bill that President Barack Obama included on his congressional ""to do"" list earlier this summer, but House Republicans haven't expressed any desire to act on it. -- Some key provisions of the federal wiretapping bill known as FISA that was created after the 9/11 terror attacks under President George W. Bush are due to expire at the end of the year, and Congress is expected to pass an extension of the current law. House Republicans have slated a vote this week to renew the current law for another five years. Likely to be punted . The roughly eight-week sprint to Election Day means several major measures that lawmakers have failed to make any progress on over the summer will continue to languish on Capitol Hill. These include some issues that both parties say they want to address but will have little motivation to compromise on: The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, a bill providing new cybersecurity protections and legislation to reform the postal service, which recently defaulted on payments to the Treasury Department for employee health plans. In each case, the proposal favored by the GOP-led House is at odds with the bills in the Democrat-controlled Senate. A divided Congress means these issues will be punted into the lame duck session after the election, or even postponed until next year. Less legislating and more campaign messaging . While there won't be much legislating, congressional aides say the messages from leaders and rank-and-file members on Capitol Hill will echo the campaign themes of Obama and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, particularly when it comes to the economy and jobs. On his first post-convention stop in New Hampshire on Friday, Obama prodded voters to urge Congress to pass his jobs legislation. ""If the Republicans are serious about being concerned about joblessness, we could create a million new jobs right now if Congress would pass the jobs plan that I sent to them a year ago -- jobs for teachers, jobs for construction workers, jobs for folks who have been looking for work for a long time. We can do that,"" Obama said. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, emphasized that the House GOP has already approved legislation aimed at helping the economy. ""The House has done its job. We've passed more than 30 jobs bills."" CNNMoney: August jobs report comes in weak . Noting that House Republicans have also passed a bill to undo the automatic spending cuts scheduled to go into effect in January and extend all the current tax rates, Smith added, ""We are ready to act on all of those measures if the president and Senate Democrats would show some courage to work with on those things with us."" Romney continues to highlight the Obama administration's failed loan to the now-bankrupt energy company Solyndra. House Republicans will keep the issue out front with a vote this week on a bill to eliminate the federal loan guarantee program that funded several energy start-ups. Dubbed the ""No more Solyndras Act,"" the GOP bill is expected to pass mostly along party lines, but won't move in the Senate. One open question is whether GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin will return to the Capitol for any part of the September session. Under Wisconsin law, Ryan is allowed to also run for his House seat, so he may feel pressure to take a break from barnstorming battleground states to vote on the bipartisan deal to keep the government funded. McCarthy told reporters Monday that Ryan would be back in Washington on Thursday to vote on the continuing resolution, and a Romney campaign official confirmed that. The six-month spending bill keeps the government funded at the level agreed to in last summer's debt deal -- $1.047 trillion. But after criticism from a bloc of conservative House Republicans that the deal didn't cut spending fast enough, Ryan introduced a budget that moved the overall spending level about $20 billion lower to $1.028 trillion. That budget passed the House, but was immediately rejected by Senate Democrats as violating the bipartisan debt deal. Asked how Ryan would vote this week on the funding bill, McCarthy initially told reporters he expected Ryan to support it, but when pressed about the spending level, he said he had indications his GOP colleague would vote for it, but he couldn't speak for other members. An aide to Ryan did not respond when asked by CNN whether the congressman planned to vote for the six-month spending bill. What won't get done -- a deal to avoid the 'fiscal cliff' Congress faces a ""fiscal cliff"" at the end of this year -- the combination of the deep automatic cuts to federal agencies scheduled to go into effect in January that were part of last summer's debt deal and the expiration of the ""Bush era"" tax cuts at the end of December. Economists and budget experts warn that a failure by the divided Congress to come to some agreement on significant deficit reduction and tax policy before the end of the year could trigger another recession. But neither side expects anything more than symbolic action on those issues until after the election. New Woodward book goes in depth on debt battle . On Friday, the White House missed a deadline to submit a report to Congress that details which government programs would face cuts as part of the sequestration in January, but White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters the report would go to the Hill this week. House Republicans passed a plan earlier this year without any Democratic support that shielded the Defense Department from any cuts and replaced the across-the-board reductions prescribed in the debt deal with other mandatory spending cuts to food stamp and other domestic programs. Although the majority of House Republicans voted for these spending cuts that were included in last summer's compromise to raise the debt ceiling, there has been a GOP push in recent months to blame the Obama administration and paint Democrats as responsible for any impact the cuts would have on the military. Over the weekend, Romney criticized Obama for proposing the cuts as a mechanism to broker the debt deal, saying ""it was a mistake for Republicans to go along with it."" Romney explains why he thinks GOP made mistake . To reinforce that they now oppose the massive cuts to the military that sequestration would set in motion, the House GOP is scheduling another vote on the issue next week. The new bill would replace the mandatory cuts with their alternate set of reductions and again calls for the White House to explain how it will implement spending reductions. Perhaps what promises to be the only truly bipartisan moment in Congress this fall is this Tuesday's ceremony to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. As has become custom each year on the date, House and Senate leaders from both parties will assemble on the Capitol steps to sing ""God Bless America."" That 9/11 ceremony, along with two others awarding Congressional Gold Medals to golf great Arnold Palmer and Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi, will be rare breaks from the heated campaign rhetoric on Capitol Hill that's aimed at influencing voters' choices in November.","Congress returns from five-week recess with just 57 days until election .

"Chicago (CNN) -- The FBI said Saturday it has arrested an 18-year-old American man who allegedly tried to blow up a car bomb in front of a downtown Chicago bar. Adel Daoud, of the Chicago suburb of Hillside, was taken into custody Friday night after a ""rigorous"" undercover operation, the FBI said. He made an initial appearance Saturday before a U.S. magistrate judge and has a preliminary hearing Monday afternoon. ""The explosives that Daoud allegedly attempted to detonate posed no threat to the public. They were inert and had been supplied by undercover law enforcement personnel,"" said Gary Shapiro, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Daoud, a U.S. citizen, was charged Saturday with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, namely explosives, and one count of attempting to damage and destroy a building by means of an explosive, the FBI said. If convicted, he faces a maximum of life in prison for the first charge and 20 years for the second. CNN could not determine Saturday whether Daoud had an attorney. According to the FBI, Daoud began sending e-mails in October of last year that regarded violent jihad and the killing of Americans. In May, undercover agents contacted Daoud, who ""confirmed his belief in the propriety of killing Americans in a terrorist attack,"" either in the United States or overseas, and started seeking online resources for an attack, the FBI said. Another undercover agent who said he was an operational terrorist started dealing with Daoud, who drafted a list of approximately 29 potential targets, including military recruiting centers, bars, malls, and other tourist attractions in the Chicago area, according to the affidavit filed Saturday in federal court. He then selected, researched and surveilled a target for attack with an explosive device supplied by the undercover agent, the FBI said. Daoud and the undercover agent met Friday night and drove to downtown Chicago with plans to blow up a car bomb in front of a bar. During the drive, Daoud led the undercover agent in a prayer that the pair -- Daoud and the agent -- succeed in their attack, kill many people, and cause destruction, the FBI said. They drove up to a Jeep containing the purported explosive device, the FBI said, and Daoud then parked it in front of the downtown bar. According to the affidavit, Daoud walked to a nearby alley and, in the presence of the undercover agent, attempted to detonate the device. He was then arrested.","The man allegedly tried to detonate a car bomb at a Chicago bar .

"(Financial Times) -- Barclays will take the axe to its controversial tax structuring unit, as the UK lender seeks to clean up its image in the wake of a succession of scandals. The business, which at its peak may have generated as much as three-quarters of profits at Barclays' investment banking operation, will be shrunk dramatically as part of the bank's Project Transform under new chief executive, Antony Jenkins. Barclays' actions comes as global banks from Goldman Sachs to Deutsche Bank are reviewing their business models in response to new regulations and government enforcement efforts. ""We have to take a fresh look to see if there are products and services in which ... we no longer deem it appropriate to do business, regardless of financial return,"" Rich Ricci, Barclays investment banking chief, said in an address to investors on Monday night. ""For example, elements of our tax advisory business have generated negative media and political attention."" Mr Ricci also signalled a likely withdrawal from selling derivatives products to consumers and small business customers, following an industry-wide scandal over the mis-selling of interest rate hedging contracts to SMEs. Mr Jenkins reaffirmed Barclays' commitment to its investment bank more broadly, silencing predictions he would significantly reduce its size. But the new chief executive, formerly head of the group's retail banking operation, was clear that ethical behaviour would become a priority in future. All activities would in future be ""screened for reputational impact"" as well as profitability, Mr Jenkins said. ""Our ability to build a franchise over time depends on our reputation,"" he added, admitting the bank had made some ""serious mistakes"" in recent years. This summer Barclays was fined £290m by global regulators over the attempted rigging of Libor benchmark borrowing rates, triggering the abrupt resignation of chairman Marcus Agius and chief executive Bob Diamond. The tax business -- known as the ""structured capital markets"" unit -- has attracted unwelcome attention for at least three years. Though legal, the avoidance strategies it used on behalf of its clients were politically controversial. Barclays' own group tax affairs were thrown into the spotlight twice in recent months, first over the use of a tax loophole that the Treasury retrospectively closed, then over a ""tax equalisation"" payment to Mr Diamond of about £6m. Speaking to analysts and investors, Mr Jenkins also repeated an earlier promise to report back on his strategic plan -- including details of which businesses would be shrunk -- by the first quarter of next year. But he added: ""You should not expect me to announce the break-up of the bank or an exit from whole business lines."" Barclays' board last month drafted in City grandee Sir David Walker as the bank's new chairman and elevated Mr Jenkins to chief executive three weeks later, in an effort to stabilise the group following Mr Agius and Mr Diamond's resignations. There had been a widespread expectation that Mr Jenkins would shift Barclays' focus away from investment banking, which has traditionally generated two-thirds to three-quarters of group profits. However, bankers believe more of the rebalancing will come from the projected revival of the group's corporate banking unit and its troubled retail banking operations outside the UK. In a question-and-answer session with analysts, Mr Jenkins would not be drawn on the extent of any change of direction, but he did talk about the group being more ""balanced"" with ""lower risk"". © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Barclays will take the axe to its controversial tax structuring unit .

"(CNN) -- The United States women's soccer team remains on course to defend its Olympic title after reaching the semifinals on Friday, while rivals Brazil and Great Britain crashed out. The U.S. beat New Zealand 2-0 to set a Monday clash with North American rival Canada, which defeated host Britain 2-0. In the other semifinal, World Cup champion Japan will play first-time Olympic qualifier France. Veteran striker Abby Wambach gave the U.S. a 27th-minute lead as she turned home a cross from fellow forward Alex Morgan at the far post, making up for the duo's earlier misses. It was her fourth goal in four games so far in the tournament, and eighth in all Olympic appearances. ""Everything she does on and off the field, she leads this team. If you look at this game today, she scored a huge goal,"" coach Pia Sundhage said of the 32-year-old Wambach, whose 142 international goals from 186 games is second only behind former teammate Mia Hamm in the scoring stakes. Morgan had three more second-half chances but the Americans could not make the game safe until the 87th minute when her replacement Sydney Leroux scored. ""We thought that we needed a little bit of a spark,"" Sundhage said. ""This bench will win games for us. The fact that Syd Leroux comes in and changes the game a little bit is huge for us and for her."" Canada, which will host the next World Cup in 2015, ended GB's hopes of a medal in the team's first Olympic appearance as Jonelle Filigno and Christine Sinclair scored in the first half. Britain had beaten Brazil to qualify top of its group, but could not find the net despite constant second-half pressure and a strong shout for a penalty kick. Young striker Filigno netted the first in the 11th minute and Sinclair bent in a free-kick five minutes before halftime with her 140th international goal. The Canadians finished eighth four years ago in their debut appearance, and will be seeking to end U.S. hopes of a third successive title and fourth overall since the tournament's inception at Atlanta '96. Japan defeated Beijing 2008 runner-up Brazil 2-0, with Yuki Ogimi and Shinobu Ohno scoring in each half. France defeated Sweden 2-1 to earn revenge for a defeat in the third-place playoff at the 2011 World Cup.

"Washington (CNN) -- The presidential campaigns are smashing fundraising records but, with less than two months before Election Day, the size of their already bloated coffers will become less important than how that money is spent. Strategists and fundraisers from both parties agree the Obama and Romney campaigns will have plenty of cash to see them through what Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala calls ""the most important stretch of the election."" The Obama campaign has raised approximately $755 million so far and the Romney camp has totaled more than $710 million, according to Federal Election Commission records and figures released by the campaigns. President Barack Obama, who just announced a massive television buy in the key battleground state of Florida, is close to matching his historic in 2008 fundraising, while Mitt Romney has nearly doubled what Sen. John McCain raised in a losing effort. ""[Neither] side is going to have a significant financial advantage over the other,"" said Keith Appell, a Republican strategist and senior vice president at CRC Public Relations adding that the money issue is overblown at this point. Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe said the same thing. ""Both sides are going to have the sufficient funds to get their message out,"" said McAuliffe. How will they do it? Appell suggests that not only will television fundraising be important, but online advertising will play an important role in the election, more so than in 2008. ""That's where you have a bit of a difference, more of an opportunity than you had in the past elections,"" said Appell. Obama campaign prepared to unleash huge Florida ad buy . Obama's Facebook page shows 28.4 million ""likes,"" while Romney's page has a little more than 6.7 million. However, the number of people ""talking about"" the candidates is about equal at 3 million. When it comes to social media, the reach is broad, Appell says and it's anyone's game. ""It's really more up for grabs than anybody thinks,"" said Appell. ""This could make a difference especially when you're adept at reaching out online through social media in the individual states."" Romney hits harder as poll shows Obama bounce . And it also costs less. ""Money spent online is a fraction of what you spend on television,"" said Appell. Still, the campaigns are hitting the battleground states hard with television ad buys. Just after the Democratic National Convention ended in Charlotte, the Romney campaign announced an ad buy that targets the same eight battleground states that the Obama campaign targeted with their $77 million buy in early August. Those states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia -- are all toss-ups on CNN's Electoral Map. It is in TV advertising that some political strategists suggest Romney could outspend and silence the Obama campaign in October. Ryan going up with House re-election ads in Wisconsin . Rahm Emanuel changing roles . The Obama Campaign released fundraising numbers this week that showed it outraised the Romney camp by $3 million this month - $114 million to $111 million. Although the two campaigns are neck-in-neck, their spending puts them behind in cash-on-hand at the end of July according to FEC filings. The Romney campaign revealed it has $165.8 million cash-on-hand earlier this week, but the Obama campaign is not expected to release its numbers until right before the federal filing deadline in late September. When it comes to Super PAC dollars, Democrats trail the Republicans by a wide margin. Super PACs are independent groups that raise money from businesses, labor groups and individuals and have no spending limits. But they must operate independently of the campaigns, meaning they cannot coordinate their ad buys. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's former chief of staff who orchestrated the 2006 Democratic takeover of the House in 2006, recently announced that he was moving to Priorities USA, the Democrats' largest Super PAC. Emanuel talked about his decision on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" last week: . ""The question is would I be more helpful to the president's reelection as co-chair of the campaign or helping Priorities,"" Emanuel told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week. ""And not his campaign, but his efforts. And so I am going to try to help him."" Emanuel's move, to some, signaled weakness in Democratic Super PACs, which were slow to attract donations after Obama dismissed them last year and called them a ""threat to our democracy."" His campaign reversed its decision with a campaign official saying in February: ""We will not unilaterally disarm."" ""[Rahm's move] is not a sign [Democrats are in trouble with their fundraising]; it is a DefCon1 catastrophe,"" said Mary Matalin, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. But McAuliffe said not to read too much into Emanuel's move. Dems get boost as both parties seek to leverage conventions . ""They want to raise sufficient funds to block what they're bragging about on the other side and he has the ability to go out and raise large checks, he did it,"" said McAuliffe, referring to the 2006 mid-term election. Democratic fundraisers insist they are not concerned going forward. ""We've known from the beginning that Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers and other right-wing special interests would outspend us,"" Begala said, referencing the billionaire brothers who have written large checks to Republican Super PACs. ""But we have to be competitive."" Democratic strategists say that they have the money they need to win in November. ""If you look at, we're playing in a basket of eight to ten states, that's it,"" McAuliffe said. ""This money is going to go a long way in eight to ten states."" And coming off of a successful convention with a bump in the polls, McAuliffe is confident that Democrats are poised again to take the White House even without the money. ""I would much rather be President Obama today than Governor Romney,"" said McAuliffe.","Obama, Romney campaigns smashing fundraising records .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Todd Vaught has been skateboarding since he was 10 years old, yet he was caught off-guard by a question from the much younger salesman at his local skateboard shop. ""Are you going to skate this thing or hang it?"" the salesman asked him. ""It sort of struck me as funny,"" said Vaught, 40, who works as a designer in Atlanta. ""I asked the guy what he meant. The guy told me, 'Are you going to skate it or hang it on your wall? A lot of you old guys hang these up as artwork.' "" The conversation gave Vaught an idea: to create an art exhibit featuring more than 200 skateboard ""decks"" -- the board where the artwork is applied -- from eight artists. ""It is a study of the evolution of skateboard art through the actual art itself and the technology used to apply the art on the skateboard,"" he said. Visitors to the Skate it or Hang It exhibit at the Museum of Design Atlanta can see how skateboard art has gone from simple line ""tattoo"" art to high-end illustrations and actual photography, and how the process is completed. Vaught said the crowds coming to see the exhibit are from ""all different walks of life,"" a reflection of the inclusive nature of the sport. ""Skateboarding is not white kids or black kids or Hispanic kids. It is everybody. ... Everybody can do it,"" he said. ""You can go to a skate park and run into a guy 10 years older than me or 25 years younger, and that's what I love about it."" American brings skateboarding diplomacy to Cuba .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- In a period of about three weeks she went from being a virtually unknown 14-year-old Pakistani girl to making headlines around the world as a Christian teen facing a life sentence for allegedly burning pages of the Quran. In her first-ever public interview since being released on bail, Rimsha Masih said she's happy to be back with her family but still fears for her life. ""I'm scared,"" she told CNN by phone. ""I'm afraid of anyone who might kill us."" Rimsha spoke in short sentences -- often answering ""yes"" or ""no"" in a shy and nervous voice. She wouldn't reveal where she was because she was speaking from her hideout. Judge grants bail to 'blasphemy teen' In Pakistan, suspects accused of blasphemy often face vigilante justice, with some cases even resulting in murder. When we asked Masih how she was doing, she said she was good. We asked her if she ever burned pages of the Quran. ""No, no,"" she replied instantly. Were you falsely accused? ""Yes,"" she said. However, Rimsha wouldn't answer questions about what exactly happened on August 16 this year. Pakistani investigators said Rimsha's neighbor accused her of burning pages of the Quran to use as cooking fuel. The young man accused the teenager of blasphemy, shouted in protest, and attracted an angry mob, police said. But Rimsha's lawyers denied she desecrated the Muslim holy book in this way. They said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with Rimsha because the two didn't get along. The lawyers told CNN this may have been because he liked her but she didn't like him back. Within minutes hundreds of residents from this poor Islamabad neighborhood surrounded the terrified girl, witnesses said. There are conflicting accounts about what happened next. Some neighbors said Rimsha was beaten, while others claimed she frantically raced back home and locked herself inside. The police eventually arrived and took Rimsha into custody . Her case made international headlines and sparked outrage among rights groups who have long accused the Pakistani government of allowing the country's controversial blasphemy laws to be used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities. According to rights groups such as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Human Rights Watch, most innocent victims of Pakistan's blasphemy laws belong to minority Muslim sects like the Ahamadis, who are often viewed as non-believers by Pakistan's majority Sunnis. Rimsha's father -- a Christian house painter who earns a few dollars a day -- said no one in his family would dare dishonor the Quran. ""We respect the Quran just like we respect the Bible,"" said Mizrak Mashi. ""We couldn't imagine committing blasphemy let alone doing it. Our children would never do this either."" Last week, under growing pressure from rights groups who were outraged that a juvenile had spent more than three weeks in jail, a judge finally approved Rimsha's request to be released on bail. Her case is still pending but she seemed to gain fresh support earlier this month when police arrested a Muslim cleric and accused him of planting torn pages of the Quran in Rimsha's bag in an apparent attempt to bolster evidence against her. Meanwhile, a family spokesman said aid groups from the U.S., Italy and Canada have already offered to give Rimsha and her family a home outside Pakistan. But Rimsha said, for now, she doesn't want to go anywhere other than back to life as she knew it, away from the spotlight. ""I love Pakistan,"" Masih said. ""I won't ever leave my country.""

"(CNN) -- A ""tricky"" Amy Winehouse, disgruntled crowds and torrents of mud washing away tents, Rob da Bank has had to deal with them all. The British DJ turned festival impresario is the man behind the Bestival music festival and despite the challenges of putting on the annual event, his love of festivals remains undiminished. Bestival was ""a happy accident"" says Rob (real name Robert Gorham). He explains that he fell into first putting on the event in 2004 as his weekly club night in a pub in South London grew in popularity and requests for bigger and longer events increased. Bestival now attracts 50,000 people and top acts -- this year The Cure are the headline band -- and is one of the most popular events in the musical calendar. For three days each year the invasion of the sleepy Isle of Wight off the south coast of England by bands, fans and leftfield festival attractions increases the island's population by over 30 percent. A desire to get back to the ""boutique"" feel of its earlier days lead to the birth of Bestival's little sister, Camp Bestival, in 2008. It's a much smaller and more family-friendly affair, but at the heart of both events is Rob's desire to put on ""a good fun party with a top musical line-up."" CNN talked to Rob da Bank about his best and worst festival moments. What was your first festival experience? ""Glastonbury about 20 years ago, in 1991, I think. I was 18. It wasn't like I grew up in the back of a tee-pee or was a hippie child taken around festivals. I was a student and it was when Glastonbury was really exploding. It really changed my life, which sounds like a cliché, but it opened my eyes to a completely different kind of life. I knew I always wanted to go to festivals and it's a total part of our lives now."" What's your favorite festival memory? ""There are so many things; from getting engaged at Glastonbury to opening the gates at the first Bestival to Kraftwerk headlining a few years ago. Sorry, that's three and not one."" What's your worst festival moment? ""It wasn't awful, but the most tricky and stressful was the wet year (in 2008), when we had ten inches of rain in a day, the most rain the Isle of Wight had for 100 years. It was a struggle and we kept it open and everyone seemed to get through it just about. Those things test you and you come out stronger."" What's been you favorite act? ""In terms of at Bestival, as well as Kraftwerk, Beastie Boys put on an amazing show a few years ago. They were incredible. They actually played two shows and were there all weekend. I love it when acts stick around and actually become part of the festival."" Who was the most difficult performer you've had to deal with? ""Amy Winehouse was tricky; she was right in the thick of all her troubles and she was very late getting on site and there was a lot of tension in the crowd as to whether she would turn up or not. She had to be shuttled off the island in a blanket with two security guards. There was a lot of cloak and dagger stuff and it was just funny hi-jinx."" What do you always take to a festival? ""A wife is a good way of keeping a lid on things, because I get over-excited at festivals and run riot from the moment I get there. Festivals now start on the Thursday or Friday, so if I'm not tethered I'll peak on the Thursday lunchtime and miss the weekend. So Josie da Bank is an essential. ""Apart from that a bin bag; it can be a sun shade, a water-proof, something to take your rubbish home in or something to sit on in the mud."" Do you have any favorite non-music festivals or ones you'd like to go to? ""I've been to the Hay-on-Wye festival, literary festivals and umpteen carnivals and village things in France and Spain. I'd love to go to the tomato festival in Spain or some of the more non-music crazy offerings. I'm going to KaZentip in Ukraine... it sounds fairly off the hook so I'm looking forward to that.""","Rob da Bank is a DJ and organizer of Bestival and Camp Bestival festivals .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- New Yorker Marsha Sharpe, 31, travels constantly for her corporate music business SongDivision -- logging trips to Turkey, South Africa and across America. But she's no longer flying business class. ""Economy has become the new black,"" says Sharpe. Fortunately, even as cash-strapped airlines raise fees and cut services, there's a countervailing trend that has gone largely unnoticed by disgruntled travelers: economy class is getting better. Some airlines are introducing amenities and getting creative with seat design to lure budget-minded travelers like Sharpe. Where once business class was the primary revenue engine, it's increasingly important that every cabin and every seat is both profitable and comfortable. This change started in the early 1990s, when safety certification changes forced airlines to tweak their seats across the craft, explains Vern Alg of Aircraft Interiors Expo. New materials like aluminums and titaniums have brought about new design possibilities, he says, and due to the rising price of fuel, ""there's pressure on airlines to have seats that are lighter and more comfortable."" Travel + Leisure: World's best hotels 2011 . Leave it to the Germans to engineer a simple-yet-brilliant upgrade to economy-class seating. Lufthansa embraced seat manufacturer Recaro's pioneering design, purchasing 32,000 new seats across the fleet. The seats themselves have been thinned down (without compromising comfort) and the magazine pouch shifted from knee height to behind the tray table to increase legroom. There's no better catalyst for change than competition, lately in the form of new models: the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787. As airline companies snap up these new planes, they have a chance to reimagine the economy-class cabin in hopes of placating both profit-seeking shareholders and comfort-craving passengers. Japan's ANA, for instance, is outfitting its new 787 fleet with gender-segregated bathrooms that have windows and bidet-toilets (""Washlets"") that offer warm, pressurized water jets for a fresher clean than one-ply paper. Of course, not all creative ideas take flight. The semi-standing Skyrider seat that would offer just 23"" of legroom -- an experience compared to riding horseback -- was widely shunned last year. But travelers have (literally) embraced a revolutionary loveseat-like arrangement for couples that Air New Zealand has nicknamed ""Cuddle Class."" It's an economy-class row of three seats that converts to a bed with the touch of a button. Now if only they could come up with a seat that prevents jet lag. LAN Chile . Economy-class innovation: Breathe-easy cabins. LAN Chile will soon be using brand-new 787s, which have a hidden plus for cramped, germ-riddled economy cabins: a state-of-the-art air filter and cooling system. It strips ozone from outside air, and uses a HEPA filter to blitz bacteria and viruses, and then a gas filter to take out any nasty smells. The result: cleaner, fresher air throughout an entire flight. Although LAN Chile will be one of the first to help passengers breathe more easily, it's not the only carrier: JAL, Air India, Royal Air Maroc, and Continental/United will also be flying Boeing Dreamliners outfitted with this filter and cooling system. Travel + Leisure: Ode to the never-ending packing list . Delta Air Lines . Economy-class innovation: Premium Economy without a big price hike. Many airlines now have some kind of upgraded economy option, but usually for a hefty premium. Delta is bravely trying to buck the trend with its new Economy Comfort class, available on 160 aircraft beginning in summer 2011. Free for Platinum and Diamond SkyMiles regulars, and otherwise offered at a scaling fee (nominal for Gold and Silver SkyMiles), this new section has plenty to recommend it: priority boarding; 50 percent more recline; four extra inches of legroom; adjustable headrest and, on some carriers, footrest; and free drinks throughout the flight. Cheers! Singapore Airlines . Economy-class innovation: Improved in-seat entertainment. It may share a name with one of the Kardashian clan, but Singapore's KrisWorld entertainment system delivers more than just reality stars. It's like a hybrid of Netflix and Spotify with 80 on-demand movies, 180 TV programs, a dozen radio channels with hundreds of songs and Dolby headphones for everyone. On almost every aircraft, the airline is rolling out international Wi-Fi with OnAir for a small fee. And even in economy there are USB ports for charging -- or for preparing presentations using a thumb drive and the built-in office software. Travel + Leisure: Most complained-about airlines . Air New Zealand . Economy-class innovation: A bed at your fingertips. Imagine if an economy row of three seats could convert to a bed with the touch of a button. Well, AirNZ's Skycouch does exactly that: arms retract, the seat base extends, and the seatbelts lengthen to buckle up when reclining. Two passengers can snuggle horizontally, leaning against the wall or lying flat. And the price is a steal: pay a standard fare for each seat, and the third shared berth is half price -- or a 25 percent per-person premium. By the end of 2012, every flight to America will offer this ""cuddle class."" Until then, AirNZ has a last-minute trick to help economy passengers sleep soundly on all its long-haul flights. If available, an empty neighboring seat can be purchased for a bargain price at check-in (often less than $60 one way). South African Airways . Economy-class innovation: Gourmet treats and a toiletry kit. Forget packing a sandwich at home or worrying about running low on snacks onboard SAA's long-haul flights to Africa. The airline now offers passengers many of the delicious gimmicks usually restricted to the pricier cabins: grab-and-go juice or water bottles always available at the galley, two full meals and a snack with three different options and a full, gratis bar stocked with South African wines and unusual treats like Amarula, the local answer to Baileys. Even better, every passenger enjoys not just a blanket and pillow, but an amenity kit with after-dinner toothpaste and eye masks. Lufthansa . Economy-class innovation: Slimmed-down seats for extra legroom. Trust German engineering -- whether it's BMW or Recaro, the aviation industry's answer to a sports car. This seat manufacturer has just pioneered a simple-yet-brilliant upgrade to economy seating that creates more legroom. Lufthansa has embraced the design, purchasing 32,000 new seats across the fleet for $175 million. The seats themselves have been thinned down (without compromising comfort) and the magazine pouch shifted from knee height to behind the tray table. The result? Stretching your legs a few more inches without stretching your wallet. Qantas . Economy-class innovation: More comfortable seats. Qantas deeded all its design needs to industrial icon Marc Newson -- and he hasn't forgotten about economy passengers or the little details that can make a big difference. On the A380, seats have movable bases that recline as the back does, making for a smoother nap. But his canniest tweak is a new riff on the footrest. Newson strung a net from the seat like a foot hammock. It's surprisingly comfy and a great prophylactic against deep vein thrombosis as it keeps circulation flowing. Jetstar . Economy-class innovation: iPad brackets. The Pinnacle seat by B/E Aerospace is an industry-wide, economy standard -- more than 200 million have been produced. But the Aussie budget carrier Jetstar has snapped up a new version with an ingenious tweak: an integrated bracket so that an iPad can be snapped onto the back of the seat in front, creating a TV-like screen. Passengers who don't have their own iPads needn't miss out: Jetstar will soon offer an in-flight rental service for $8.40. ANA . Economy-class innovation: Luxury toilets. Japan's ANA is the first airline to launch Boeing's much-delayed and much-anticipated 787, nicknamed the Dreamliner; the first delivery is expected by the end of September 2011. And in all classes, ANA is introducing select women-only bathrooms and outfitting all bathrooms with windows and the Japanese-style bidet-toilets known as Washlets, which offer warm, pressurized water jets for a fresher clean than one-ply paper. They're common in Japan (60 percent of households use them) and will surely make a splash internationally. Airline To-Be-Determined . Economy-class innovation: Automated flight attendants. Developed in Germany, this reinvented trolley leaves the rest looking as outdated as a VCR. Via a touchscreen, the Skytender uses syrups, water and a carbonation pellet to produce almost three dozen different drinks, among them hot coffee, tea, juice, sodas and even beer or mixed drinks. (All that, plus a major eco-boost since fewer bottles and cans will be discarded.) It's currently undergoing a few final design tweaks before its onboard test in the fall; expect the Skytender to surface in flight by spring 2012.

"(RollingStone.com) -- It's instructive to note what a killer actor Richard Gere can be when a movie rises to his level. ""Arbitrage"" is such a movie, a sinfully entertaining look at the sins committed in the name of money. For proof that we're in financial hell, look around. True, this territory has been covered from Wall Street to last year's ""Margin Call."" But Gere and first-time director Nicholas Jarecki put a tantalizing spin on what goes on in the head of a fraudulent hedge-fund manager when he decides to stick it to the rest of us, including his own family. Gere's Robert Miller is the picture of unflappable elegance. Good job on that, since he's just lost $400 million in a bad copper-mine investment, and if he can't cover it up and unload his company on a major bank, his career will go kaput along with his fortune. Fraud puts pressure on Robert's skill at deceiving wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), French mistress Julie (Laetitia Casta) and chief accountant Brooke (Brit Marling), who also happens to be his daughter. But Robert keeps his cool until the sudden death of one of these women has him dodging a possible murder rap with the grudging help of Jimmy Grant (a terrific Nate Parker), the son of the family chauffeur and the only black man in Robert's circle of white privilege. That's when NYPD detective Michael Bryer (Tim Roth) smells a rat and Robert's world begins to unravel. There's enough plot here to stuff a miniseries or three, yet ""Arbitrage"" never descends to bland and predictable. Credit Jarecki, whose combustible directing debut gives ""Arbitrage"" the charge of a thriller and the provocation of a moral fable. Jarecki has an eye for the telling detail, not surprising given his start with the 2005 documentary ""The Outsider"" (about rogue director James Toback). Docs run in the Jarecki family, with half brothers Andrew (""Capturing the Friedmans"") and Eugene (""Why We Fight"") making notable contributions to the genre. As the son of two commodities traders, Jarecki has Wall Street in his DNA. And it resonates in his exceptional screenplay, which potently captures the gleaming seduction of Robert's world and the fear that festers underneath. Jarecki knows the territory. And Gere knows the man, inside and out. His rapt, watchful performance is a thing of toxic beauty. Gere digs so deep into this flawed tycoon that we come to understand Robert's actions without for a minute forgiving them. Wearing the trappings of wealth like a second skin, Gere invites us to see what Robert sees. And the glamour in his field of vision -- cheers to cinematographer Yorick Le Saux (I Am Love) for the sheen and composer Cliff Martinez (Drive) for the seductive mood -- is tempting enough to make us all complicit. Like the best movies, ""Arbitrage"" persuades us to ask tough questions about ourselves. And Gere nails every nuance in a role that holds up a dark mirror to the way we live now. Despite his box-office success in crowd-pleasers such as ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Chicago,"" Gere has long been underrated. No Academy love, not even for his sinister brilliance in ""Internal Affairs,"" ""American Gigolo"" and ""The Hoax,"" or for the battered heart he brought to the cheated-on husband in ""Unfaithful."" Gere's performance in ""Arbitrage"" is too good to ignore. At 62, he is at the peak of his powers. Watch him in the scene when Sarandon -- in full, feisty flower -- hits Robert with a lifetime of resentments. She can't rock his composure. But Gere gives us a window into the soul of a man who finally realizes that even money will no longer help him lie to himself. It's an implosive tour de force. See full story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- When Nucky Thompson shot Jimmy Darmody point blank in the head in last season's finale of ""Boardwalk Empire,"" viewers were shocked: How could a father figure kill his surrogate son? But this is the land of gangsters and bootleggers, and blood isn't the currency here -- it's alcohol. That episode, ""To The Lost,"" nabbed an Emmy nomination for director Tim Van Patten (amongst its many other nods, including best drama and best actor for Steve Buscemi), but it also signified a tonal shift in how the characters on this Prohibition-era drama would operate in the next season, which kicks off Sunday, September 16 on HBO: no more Mr. Nice Guy. As the show jumps ahead to New Year's Eve in 1922, ""the stakes are higher,"" said showrunner Terence Winter. ""The '20s had really started to roar, so it's when radio was everywhere, music made the charts, and the flapper as we know her started to come out,"" Winter said. ""The economy had started to boom, which lead to young people buying cars and traveling more from home. And while a lot of people had stockpiled alcohol, by 1923, they were running out, so there was a lot more competition (in bootlegging) and it became a lot more violent. It's the era of the Tommy-gun."" So while Nucky survived an attempted coup on his market share last season, in order to stay on top, he has to try new strategies, which includes streamlining -- instead of selling to multiple buyers, he wants to sell to only one -- and those cut out of the supply line are none too pleased, including a hot-tempered new antagonist named Gyp Rosetti, played by Bobby Cannavale. ""A guy like that, he's got such a hair trigger, you could end up dead over something you said that you didn't even know was taken as an insult,"" Winter said. ""There's an upcoming line where Nucky says, 'Gyp Rosetti can find an insult in a bouquet of roses.' "" The audience's introduction to Rosetti comes when he has car trouble, and he requires assistance to fix his tire from a helpful stranger who is out walking his dog to fix his tire. The pooch plays a role in what follows and it's the type of touch that may give audiences some pretty good insight into Rosetti's character. ""It's a very funny idea,"" Cannavale said. ""You get to see guys like Nucky who are more professional in the way they go about their work, and this guy, it seems like he might be in the wrong profession, you know? He's got a lot of zingers, which is good, because that's how I'm like in real life. My favorite line is when I call Steve (Buscemi) 'a breadstick with a bow tie.' "" Nucky takes that one in stride, for now -- but he's not too keen on taking any guff from his wife Margaret anymore, as he's not about to forgive her actions last season, when she signed over a tract of land he bought between Atlantic City and Philadelphia to the Catholic Church shortly after their wedding ceremony. Their union is now a shaky one, and Margaret finds herself in a tricky position. ""I'm just delighted that she's not passive anymore,"" said Kelly Macdonald, who plays Margaret. ""She knows how to look after herself, and she's becoming stronger. She's very complex. You never quite know where she's going to go next."" Married or not, Nucky shares his bed with new flapper/showgirl Billy Kent, played by Meg Steele. ""She's a fun girl,"" Steele said of her character. ""The flappers weren't feminists, but they were enjoying the new-found feminism. So she's living life to the fullest, and she has her own apartment, her own life. She's not as needy as (Nucky's former mistress) Lucy was."" Speaking of Lucy, Winter said it's ""a long shot"" that we'll see her again, even if her child is now being raised by Michael Shannon's character. The disgraced Prohibition agent Nelson Van Alden is now living under an assumed name as a door-to-door salesman in Cicero, Illinois, which puts him in proximity with Al Capone's power base. ""I don't have a gun, and I don't make whiskey in my bathtub, so I don't identify with these people much!"" Shannon laughed. ""But Van Alden is still in hiding."" ""He's constantly dealing with the fact that he could be caught, arrested, and sent to jail for the rest of his life,"" the actor added. ""He's got a family to take care of. And he lost a pretty good job, so now he's faced with a pretty harsh economic reality, because it's a hard time to make a living and support yourself. I don't think he can really see himself as a lawman anymore."" Like Cannavale's character, Van Alden is now in a position that's ripe for both tragedy and comedy, particularly when he accidentally walks into a turf war between Capone and Dean O'Banion, a real-life adversary of Capone's who also worked as a florist. ""Even if the storyline is dark or something bad happens, it doesn't mean it's not fun to do it,"" Shannon said. ""But Van Alden is never going to have an easy time on this show. That's not why he's on the show. He's a tragic character, and the tragedy is going to unfold."" Still reeling from their own personal tragedy, in the aftermath of the deaths of both Jimmy and Angela Darmody, Gillian Darmody and Richard Harrow are raising Tommy Darmody together. This is not without some tension, since Gillian wants to be considered Tommy's mother, not his grandmother, while Richard tries to help the boy remember Angela. ""I've become the surrogate au pair, for a lot of it,"" said Jack Huston, who plays Harrow. ""I would think Angela would want Tommy to be very far away from Gillian and the kind of opportunities of what that show is about,"" laughed Aleksa Palladino, who played Angela. ""Richard is the better parent for Tommy."" But Gillian being Gillian, has always got a scheme up her sleeve. ""For her, it's about power,"" said Gretchen Moll. ""It's really fun, because that's not where I love. I'm not really an angry person. But she's trying to figure out her next move. It comes out as the season unfolds."" Could that mean a revenge plot against Nucky for killing Jimmy and leaving his son an orphan? An alliance between Van Alden and Al Capone? Who will be in power and who will die? The cast won't reveal trade secrets, but they all hint the new season will be more explosive than the last. ""It's an amazing time for TV drama,"" showrunner Winter said. ""It's daunting to even think we're competing against ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Homeland,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" and ""Mad Men"" in any category, let alone best drama. It's thrilling, and I don't even mean to sound humble."" ""Was I disappointed about Michael? Winter said, referring to Michael Pitt, who didn't get nominated for his portrayal of Jimmy Darmody. Yes, because he was terrific, but who knows how this works? And we have an amazing supportive cast -- Michael K. Williams, Michael Shannon, Michael Stuhlbarg, any other Michael on the show. And you don't have to be named Michael to be on the show anymore. You can be named Bobby.""","""Boardwalk Empire"" returns on Sunday on HBO .

"(CNN) -- NASA says bad weather has forced it to put off the piggyback flight of the space shuttle Endeavour to California, where the now-retired spacecraft will be put on display. The space agency announced Sunday that it has pushed back the start of the multi-day flight until Tuesday, a day later than planned. Storms forecast over the Southeast prompted the delay, NASA said in a statement announcing the postponement. NASA still hopes to deliver Endeavour, the baby of the shuttle fleet, to Los Angeles by Thursday, the agency said. The spacecraft and its Boeing 747 carrier are slated to make several stops and low-level flyovers along the route, with overnight stops in Houston -- home to the mission control center for the U.S. manned space program -- and at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in southern California. Dryden is located at Edwards Air Force Base, the landing site for the first shuttle missions. The jet-shuttle combo will make low-altitude passes over NASA's Stennis Space Center on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the agency's Michoud Assembly plant near New Orleans, where the shuttles' external fuel tanks were built; over the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, a last-resort landing site where shuttle pilots trained; and over San Francisco, Sacramento and other northern California sites. Endeavor is scheduled to be on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles by late October. Built as a replacement for the ill-fated shuttle Challenger, it made 25 flights into space between 1992 and 2011. The other two surviving orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, are also being put on display at museums. Atlantis will be at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida; Discovery at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum annex in Virginia.","Forecasts storms push Endeavour's final flight back a day .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Spain are through to the 2012 Davis Cup final after a 3-1 defeat of the United States. Spanish world No. 5 David Ferrer beat John Isner 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4 6-2 in Sunday's decisive singles match in Gijon, after brothers Bob and Mike Bryan had kept U.S. hopes alive with victory in Saturday's doubles match. Spain will appear in the final for the sixth time in the last 10 years as they bid for a sixth Davis Cup triumph. The win extends Ferrer's perfect record in clay-court Davis Cup singles rubbers. The 30-year-old has won all 16 of his matches on the surface. ""I'm very happy, this is a dream for me,"" Ferrer told the tournament's official website. ""Another Davis Cup final, we won here at home in Gijon. ""I won the last match against John Isner, who is a very good player, and this tie was never easy. ""The atmosphere was unbelievable. They supported me all the time in the match. I want to enjoy this moment, I'm really happy."" Injury robbed Spain of 11-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal, who is struggling with a knee problem. The final will be a repeat of the 2009 showpiece after Tomas Berdych's straight-sets win against Carlos Berlocq saw the Czech Republic seal a 3-1 victory over 2011 runners-up Argentina. World No. 45 Berlocq was drafted in for the singles match after Argentina's No. 1 Juan Martin del Porto was forced to withdraw from the tie through injury on Saturday. Berdych, a semifinalist at the recent U.S. Open, was rarely troubled by Berlocq and sealed a straight-forward 6-3 6-3 6-4 win, much to the disappointment of the Buenos Aires crowd.

"(CNN) -- A new species of catfish discovered in a river deep in a South American jungle has an ingenious way to avoid being a snack for giant piranhas. Instead of camouflage, its body is covered with bony spines to deter potential predators. Nicknamed the ""armored catfish,"" it is just one of 46 species researchers believe could be new to the scientific community, according to a new report from Conservation International. During a three project in 2010, scientists were joined by indigenous people from villages in southwest Surinam to documented nearly 1,300 species along the Kutari and Sipaliwini Rivers that lie in one of the most inaccessible forests in the world. As well as the armored catfish (that was saved from being lunch for one of the scientists' guides), a large tree-frog, eight freshwater fish and dozens of new insects were identified. Other species were seen that are thought to be unique to the area, including the ""Great Horned Beetle,""a blue dung beetle the size of a tangerine, and the ""Pac-Man Frog"" that has a mouth as wide as its body. ""The area was paradise for the entomologists with spectacular and unique insects everywhere,"" said Dr. Leeanne Alonso, of Global Wildlife Conservation, who was part of the research team. ""I didn't even have to look for ants because they jumped out at me. Other scientists were equally impressed with the amazing diversity of birds and mammals of the region. You can really get up close to wildlife here -- a camera trap recorded a jaguar about one hundred yards from our camp."" The research was part of Conservation International Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) that aims to record biodiversity and promote conservation across the world. Dr. Trond Larsen, director of RAP said: ""As a scientist, it is thrilling to study these remote forests where countless new discoveries await, especially since we believe that protecting these landscapes while they remain pristine provides perhaps the greatest opportunity for maintaining globally important biodiversity and the ecosystems people depend upon for generations to come.""","Scientists believe 46 new species found in southwest Suriname .

"(CNN) -- Italian football champions Juventus plan to appeal against the 10-month ban that coach Antonio Conte has received after failing to report match-fixing when he managed Serie B side Siena. Conte and his Juve assistant Angelo Alessio, who was also at Siena, were suspended by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) following a police investigation over allegations of ""sporting fraud and fraudulent association"" in relation to a league fixture against Novara in April 2011. While earlier charges of direct involvement in match-fixing have been dropped, the FIGC maintain Conte was aware of the corruption taking place during his tenure at Siena. Last season Juventus won the Serie A title for the first time since being stripped of two scudettos and relegated in 2006 after another match-fixing scandal. ""The club underlines its full support for Antonio Conte and Angelo Alessio, in the hope that their innocence will emerge during the appeals process,"" said a Juventus statement. The gambling game: Soccer's battle with betting . Conte submitted a plea bargain earlier in August, in which he would have had to pay a â‚¬200,000 ($245,000) fine and serve a three-month suspension, but the FICG rejected a more lenient sanction. The former Juventus captain, 43, led his side to back into the Champions League after managing them through an entire season without suffering a defeat, but came under official investigation in June after his first season at the helm of the Serie A giants. ""He is not being accused of match-fixing himself, and with appeal the sentence may be reduced to five months. It's enormous scandal, and it goes way beyond Conte,"" John Foot, author of ""Calcio: A History of Italian Football,"" told CNN. In total, 13 clubs and 44 members of Italian League football are alleged to have been involved in the betting scandal investigation including Siena, which accepted a six-point deduction last week as part of a plea bargain. Serie B sides Lecce and Grosseto have been excluded from Italy's second division for the 2012-13 season, and their former presidents Giovanni Semeraro and Piero Camilli face five-year suspensions. Six other players -- Leonardo Bonucci, Simone Pepe, Marco di Vaio, Salvatore Masiello, Daniele Padelli and Giuseppe Vives --have been acquitted of the charges against them. South East Asia betting . In May, Italian police descended on the national team's Euro 2012 training base to speak to defender Domenico Criscito as part of a wide-ranging investigation into match fixing. The 25-year-old, formerly of Genoa but now at Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg, was questioned by officials probing gambling markets linked to fixing results of matches in the Italian top flight. A total of 19 people were arrested in the ongoing investigation by magistrates in Cremona, 11 of them players in Italy's top division. ""The top people are still there and no-one has resigned,"" said Foot, Professor of Modern Italian History at University College London. ""The authorities have come close to uncovering the networks a few times in recent years, but they've really got it now. They have found a network that goes to Singapore and China -- it's an international network."" Football's world governing body FIFA is waiting for the FIGC to report on the scandal. ""FIFA is currently waiting to receive all relevant documents from the Italian FA (FIGC) pertaining to the case and will then evaluate the next steps,"" it said. ""This includes the potential extension of sanctions to have worldwide effect, in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code."" Long-running saga . Since February, FIFA has extended 39 domestic sanctions in Turkey, Finland, Korean Republic and Croatia in an attempt to preserve the integrity of the sport. It said that South East Asia is ""widely considered as a center of legal and illegal betting."" FIFA said it has invested â‚¬20 million ($24.5 million) as part of a global initiative to clamp down on corruption within football. The scheme targets illegal and irregular betting and match-fixing, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year in Asia alone. How can football tackle match fixing? Friday's announcement of FIGC's punishments are the latest in a long-running saga that has cast a shadow over Italian football. Seventeen people were arrested in a similar swoop last year, the most high-profile of which was Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni. He was subsequently banned from the game for three years.","Juventus coach Antonio Conte banned from football for 10 months.

"(CNN) -- In the run-up to the party conventions, new attention has been focused on women's issues in the political sphere. It has been accompanied by claims that the Republican Party is somehow unfriendly to women -- which will be a surprise to the thousands of women attending the convention in Tampa, Florida. The assertion is baseless. Having served 19 years in the Senate, and as a lifelong Republican, I have some perspective. Much of the recent debate has focused on a narrow slice of what constitutes women's issues and how gender should direct women's views. But this is overly simplistic. Women make up half of the most diverse country in the world. We are represented ethnically, socially, racially, economically, religiously and ideologically across the spectrum. To say that there is a set of concerns that can be labeled ""women's issues"" is absolutely true. To assume that we all feel the same way about them -- or that we must feel the same way about them to represent our gender legitimately -- is inherently sexist. My experiences as a woman certainly inform my perspective, but they do not wholly define my political views. I am also guided by the values my family instilled and the educational opportunities I had growing up. That we employ different methods and points of view does not mean that one or the other party is the natural place for women. Opinion: Wake up: It's not just Akin . Women are, in fact, more than our gender. We are entrepreneurs and executives who are concerned about a faltering economy and business-unfriendly regulation. We are homemakers and heads of households who worry what tax hikes will do to our family budgets. We are parents who want the best education possible for our children. We are recent graduates, entering the bleakest job market in decades. We are retirees, worried about the shaky finances of Medicare and Social Security. I am a Republican because I believe that the best opportunities for women -- and men, and children -- come from a thriving economy that encourages entrepreneurship and promotes business development to create jobs and financial security. In the dismal fiscal state we're in, I think that is what is most important to women, and I consider the economy to be a women's issue. But even if we look to the more traditional women's issues, as a Republican, I have worked on them my entire career. None of it could have been achieved without the support of my party. In 1975, when I was serving in the Texas Legislature, I authored legislation that guaranteed the most far-reaching protections for rape victims in the country, including limiting invasive personal questions that had been part of a ""blame the victim"" culture and redefining consent. That bill became the model for strengthened victim-protection laws throughout the country. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, and I sponsored the Homemaker IRA, allowing spouses who do not work outside the home -- the vast majority of them women -- to defer taxes in individual retirement accounts. Mikulski and I worked together again to co-sponsor the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. More recently, all the female senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- joined together in opposing the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation that women under 50 forgo breast cancer screening. Opinion: Why Paul Ryan is not 'bad' for women . During this year's debate on reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, I offered an amendment to enact harsher penalties for violent sexual offenses and to address the backlog of some 400,000 untested sexual-assault kits. Although the amendment was not approved, the final reauthorization -- again, supported unanimously by the female senators -- included new anti-cyber-stalking legislation that I worked on with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota. The debate over the Violence Against Women Act was a reminder that, though we may disagree on policy particulars, the female senators find ways to solve problems when it matters most. But my definition of women's issues extends further. As the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, for instance, I believe the STEM disciplines -- science, technology, engineering and medicine -- must be encouraged for our girls. Getting more women into these professions reflects both my will to advance women and my Republican ethos: These areas are vital to America's economic success, and I believe ignoring 50% of the talent pool is detrimental to that goal. Americans have thoughts, opinions and ideas spanning the political spectrum, about which reasonable people can respectfully disagree. But it is both unreasonable and disrespectful to demand that half of them hold identical views simply because of their gender. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kay Bailey Hutchison.","Some people claim the GOP is unfriendly to women, says Kay Bailey Hutchison .
As a U.S. senator for 19 years and a lifelong Republican, she disagrees .
The best opportunities for women come from a thriving economy, she says .
Hutchison says she has worked on traditional women's issues her entire career ."
"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Roger Federer has paid tribute to his ""wonderful friend"" Ivan Ljubicic after the Croat announced on Wednesday he will end his 14-year playing career next month. Ljubicic will retire from tennis after April's Monte Carlos Masters, bringing the curtain down on a career which has seen him hit No. 3 in the world rankings, win the Davis Cup with Croatia in 2005 and collect 10 ATP Tour titles. Sixteen-time grand slam winner Federer hailed Ljubicic, who won a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, as a fearsome opponent, but said the time was right for the 32-year-old to hang up his racket. ""I have a very good friendship with Ljubicic,"" Federer told the ATP Tour's website. ""It's been sad seeing him retiring really since I've known about it for quite some time. ""He's one of the most feared players on tour...

""We've talked at length at times about it, but I think it comes at the right time for him and he's in a perfect spot with his family. He's just had a second daughter. He's had a wonderful career."" Federer has played Ljubicic, who reached the semifinals of the French Open in 2006, on 16 occasions over 10 years between 2000 and 2010, losing three of those matches. ""It's never an easy decision for any professional athlete to retire,"" said Ljubicic, whose most recent title came at Indian Wells in March 2010, an event which three-time champion Federer will play in next week.

"(CNN) -- You've probably seen the new Apple TV ads with actor John Malkovich having what looks like the most charming chat of his life with Siri, the voice-activated ""personal assistant"" on the iPhone 4S. ""That's pretty spectacular advice, actually,"" Malkovich says after Siri tells him to avoid fat, read good books, take walks and ""live together in peace and harmony"" with everyone. ""I enjoyed this chat immensely,"" he continues in his familiar soothing-creepy voice. ""You are very eloquent."" To many other iPhone 4S owners, however, Siri isn't such a scintillating conversationalist. She oftens fails to understand what's spoken to her, and many of her responses are little more than lists of Google search results. Disappointed iPhone users have even filed a class-action suit against Apple, claiming that Siri doesn't work as well as advertised. Fortune: Siri's father comes to her defense . That may be about to change, however. In the eight months since she debuted in October, Siri has been ""studying up and learning a lot more,"" Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall said during a presentation Monday at Apple's annual developers' conference. Forstall then previewed some advancements to Siri that will come this fall as part of iOS 6, the company's next mobile operating system. Apple is equipping Siri with new databases of knowledge, including the ability to retrieve sports scores. She'll also be able to open an app for you, search movie showtimes, post Facebook updates, make restaurant reservations and provide turn-by-turn navigation to drivers with Apple's new maps application. But based on the glimpses we saw Monday, the most interesting improvement to Siri may be the language she uses in her answers, which already sound more natural and conversational. For example, Forstall demoed Siri onstage by asking, ""Who is taller: LeBron or Kobe?"" (For the NBA stars, no last names were required, apparently.) Instead of directing him to a Web search or maybe pulling up info on Japanese beef, Siri answered without hesitation: ""LeBron James appears to be slightly taller."" Jason Gilbert, writing for the Huffington Post, called this exchange ""the most important thing that was said on stage"" over the course of Apple's 90-minute event. ""What the question really demonstrated, however, is that Apple's strongest, most dazzling weapon in the war to differentiate its iPhone from All Those Other Smartphones just received a fresh stockpile of ammunition,"" Gilbert wrote. He argues that a refined Siri may be a bigger boost to future iPhones and iPads than the other new features Apple announced Monday, most of which already exist on rival devices. ""It was Siri flawlessly and quickly answering a mundane question about basketball that Apple should be most excited about: LeBron is taller, Siri is smarter, and the bewitching Apple advertising juggernaut shall parade forward,"" Gilbert added. Apple did not respond Tuesday to a request for more details about the next-generation Siri, which will probably come standard on the next iPhone this fall. But it's clear from CEO Tim Cook's recent comments that Apple sees Siri as a big part of its mobile future. ""Siri is one of the most popular features of iPhone 4S,"" Cook said at last month's D10 conference. ""But there's more that it can do, and we have a lot of people working on this. And I think you will be really pleased with some of the things you're going to see over the coming months. We have some cool ideas about what Siri can do. We have a lot going on on this. ... Sure, it can be broader, and so forth, but we see unbelievable potential here. We're doubling down on it."" We'll probably find out by late October whether a new Siri is better company than the current one. Maybe by then, people will stop mocking the John Malkovich ads.","Despite ads showing John Malkovich yukking it up, some users aren't happy with Siri .

"(Mashable) -- There's a lot riding on the Nokia Lumia 900. While Windows Phones until now have generally been capable if not outstanding devices, the Lumia 900 brings Microsoft's mobile platform to a new level. Not only does it add a super-fast LTE connection from AT&T, but it'll also serve as a flagship device for Nokia and Microsoft, at least until Windows Phone 8 devices come later in the year. I've been using the Lumia 900 for the past week, and it's a great smartphone. It's also an excellent example of just how far the Windows Phone platform has come since its debut a year and a half ago. Good Windows Phone apps used to be in extremely short supply, but I was pleasantly surprised to see many of the same apps that I use regularly on iOS in the Windows Phone Marketplace. Foursquare? Check. eBay? Check. Spotify? It's there. Readability? Yep. Kindle? Got it. Pulse? Totally. There's even Foodspotting, yo. Still, there's no Instagram, Pinterest, Flipboard or Hulu Plus. So the Marketplace -- recently clocked at 65,000 apps to the iPhone's 600,000 -- certainly has some catching up to do. But if you're not already locked into another platform, it's reassuring to know Windows Phone has the essentials covered. Metro stretches out . Most of those apps look gorgeous on the Lumia 900â€²s 4.3-inch OLED screen. Indeed, the increasing sizes on today's smartphones are perfect for Windows Phone's Metro interface. Its design favors big fonts and splash layouts that stretch to the screen's edges and beyond. Windows Phone works best when it's got lots of real estate to work with. For example, Foursquare makes the multiple menus in the app feel like one giant poster. My friends, activity and checkins are all partitioned into pretty columns. The iOS and Android versions look claustrophobic by comparison (see below). The seamless Metro-inspired design isn't automatic, however, and your mileage will vary from app to app. Most apps from indie developers are pretty blah. The design occasionally trips itself up. Metro presents its iconography as if it were as familiar as street signs, showing symbols with no labels. It's pretty easy to pick the wrong function, especially if it's your first time launching the app. When navigating, you should proceed with caution, especially in social apps. Shares and check-ins can happen before you know what you're doing. Begging to be touched . Pretty design is one thing, but usability is another. Windows Phone begs to be touched, swiped and pinched, even more than iOS or Android. The big layouts practically beg you to see what's on the next screen. Here's where the Lumia 900â€²s 1.4GHz Qualcomm processor shines. It's only a single-core design (Microsoft doesn't yet allow multi-core chips on Windows Phones), but it was more than enough to keep up as I pushed and pulled menus with my fingers. The whole interface feels alive as you touch it. Besides the great UI, Nokia offers up some special apps to Lumia owners. Probably most useful is Nokia Drive, a free turn-by-turn navigation service that works with Nokia Maps (not Bing Maps, which are also pretty). Nokia has also created dynamic Metro apps for CNN and ESPN that look fantastic, especially when it comes to video.The CNN app highlights one of Windows Phone's differentiators: live tiles. The photo from the most recent top story in the app is highlighted on the app's icon on your home screen. That's great, but there's no headline or even a slug to help guide the user. What, for example, is this picture of Barack Obama supposed to signify? Nuts & bolts . Back to the hardware. This is a really well-made phone; even though the screen is 0.8 inches larger than an iPhone's, it doesn't feel large in your hand. That's partly thanks to the polycarbonate casing, which is smooth but provides an excellent grip. Nokia offers bumpers that can better protect it, but it's pretty durable. I don't know why you'd want to cover it up. The camera is 8 megapixels, and to my eye the quality is on par with the iPhone 4S, though it records at ""only"" 720p resolution. The Lumia 900â€²s screen shows off AMOLED's strengths -- bright colors and true blacks that make icons and artwork pop. The screen also uses anti-reflection optics to reduce its reflectance. The upshot: a screen that's much easier to see in bright sunlight. You can see just how much in the gallery below. Finally, there's that LTE connection. I managed to get download speeds up to 28.4 megabits per second here in the Flatiron district of New York City. That's pretty amazing, especially when you consider our office Wi-Fi typically got about 9 Mbps. Puttering along at AT&T's ""4G"" HSPA+ speeds, my iPhone 4S maxed out at 1.9 Mbps. Lumia rises . The Nokia Lumia 900, which will be in stores April 8 for the tidy sum of $99.99 (with contract), is by far the best Windows Phone ever made. Not only does it have a great screen for Metro apps, it has the hardware to really deliver on the experience they promise. This is the device that Microsoft needs to show off how good Windows Phone can be. Sure, you don't get Instagram (yet), but the world of possibility it opens is unlike anything else out there.

"(CNN) -- The comedian Rodney Dangerfield used to complain, ""I don't get no respect."" Sometimes, it feels like those words ought to be printed on the presidential seal. Last week, Barack Obama was interrupted by Daily Caller journalist Neil Munro while making a statement on immigration. Munro shouted questions at him until the president was forced to stop and demand silence. Many media outlets, particularly those with a liberal bent, were outraged. The UK Guardian called it ""a breach of etiquette so severe it managed to shock even the notoriously unfastidious journalistic profession."" An MSNBC panel acknowledged that news conferences under Clinton and Bush could get awkward, but concluded that Obama gets even rougher treatment because of the color of his skin. The fact that Munro was shouting questions about immigration only added to the impression that the president's conservative persecutors are motivated by race. The problem is that this theory only holds up if Obama is being treated with a historically unique degree of hostility. He's not. Relations between presidents and press have always been fraught. President Theodore Roosevelt was the first POTUS to try to cultivate journalists: He assigned them a room in the White House. But journalists who put out reports without Teddy's consent (so-called ""Muckrakers"") were cut out of the loop, denied access to any federal department. Incidentally, Roosevelt's relations with ordinary voters were just as prickly. In 1912, he was shot while giving a speech on the campaign trail. With admirable sangfroid, Teddy calculated from the lack of blood that the bullet had not penetrated any organs and finished his oration, before being rushed to the nearest hospital. It puts Obama being told ""You lie!"" into perspective. Opinion: What's behind dissing of the president? It was Woodrow Wilson who started the formal press conference, and quickly regretted it. When reporters printed romantic rumors about his daughter, Margaret, Wilson harangued the press corps. ""This must stop!"" he shouted. ""On the next offense, I shall do what any other indignant father would do. I will punch the man who prints it on the nose."" Franklin D. Roosevelt turned the press conference into the question and answer session we know today and mastered it. But poor Dwight Eisenhower, who was used to getting 100% respect as a soldier, found the experience as a citizen rather trying. At his first conference after he had declared his candidacy for the presidency in 1952, he was shocked when, in the middle of a speech about the defenses of Europe, a journalist interrupted to ask, ""What's the matter with your eye?"" The general explained that he had an infection. At a later date, he was asked his opinion of his rival Robert Taft and said, ""He's a goddam isolationist."" Eisenhower was genuinely surprised when the remark was printed. Things only got worse in the 1970s, when Richard Nixon's combative approach to the press turned Watergate-era press conferences into a battleground. At a press conference on October 26, 1973, Nixon complained, ""I have never seen or heard such outrageous, vicious, gutter reporting in 27 years of public life."" Addressing one reporter, he added, ""Yet, don't get the impression that you rouse my anger. You see, one can only be angry with those he respects."" Watergate changed everything: After that, presidents would shield themselves from the press and try to manage their public appearances better. This wiped clean the popular memory of fiery exchanges, interruptions and acid put downs that had defined the previous century. A new dynamic occurred, whereby there would be long periods of managed relations between press and president that gave the false impression of obeyed protocol and mutual respect. But then, in the midst of a crisis, all the bottled-up emotions would get released at once. For example, while Lyndon Johnson held 135 solitary press conferences during his time in office, Ronald Reagan held only 46. The result was that when Reagan did take questions, the journalists often let him have it. The most notorious occasion was November 25, 1986, when Reagan held a press conference with Attorney General Ed Meese to discuss the Iran-Contra scandal. The president was interrupted by several reporters in the room â€” and reporters were still shouting questions as he walked away from the microphone. A large part of Obama's problem is that he has followed the Reagan example -- testing the patience of the press by prioritizing stage managed events (he gave 408 interviews in his first three years, compared with George W. Bush's 136) over question and answer sessions. According to political science professor Martha Kumar, Obama has held fewer press conferences for the White House press corps (17) than Bill Clinton (31), George H.W. Bush (56), and even Ronald Reagan (21) in the first three years. (George W. Bush, however, held only 11). Indeed, it's notable that after his confrontation with Neil Munro, Obama did not take questions. He was there to make a statement â€” it was not a news conference -- and it is understandable that some in the press might find that frustrating. The bigger, more sensitive issue is the degree to which liberal supporters of the president are conflating disrespect and racism -- and so actually poisoning the political atmosphere even further. Munro's interruption was rude and he deserved all the criticism he got. But times are tough in America right now and when things get rough, people inevitably turn on their leaders. Obama's announcement that the administration would grant effective amnesty to 800,000 children of illegal immigrants was bound to provoke an impassioned response. A classier person than Munro might have found a better way to voice anxieties. But invoking ""racism"" as the only way to understand the righteous fury of the right sounds like an attempt to gag the opposition. The fact is that Obama is a controversial president during a difficult time in American history. It's surprising that he hasn't been interrupted more rudely and more often. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: Obama's recent interruption by Daily Caller reporter portrayed as rude .

"(CNN) -- If you're traveling abroad, your laptop could be attacked. That much, is certain, according to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which warned this week that hackers are ""targeting travelers abroad through pop-up windows while establishing an internet connection in their hotel rooms."" The warning comes from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, or the IC3. But it lacks so many key details that security experts wonder if it's of any use. It doesn't say where these attacks have occurred, how prevalent they are, or how exactly they work. Graham Cluely, a blogger with antivirus vendor Sophos, found the lack of details peculiar. ""What's fascinating about the advisory is what it doesn't say,"" he wrote on his blog Thursday. ""And without more information it's hard to know how computer users are supposed to take meaningful action to protect themselves."" Bloomberg reported late last year of a widespread hacking effort that hit ISPs, including at least one hotel network service provider. Networks were hit in ""more than a dozen countries, including Canada, Switzerland, Bangladesh, Venezuela and Russia,"" Bloomberg said. The IC3 report comes months after the Bloomberg story, but then the FBI isn't exactly known for being ahead of the curve when it comes to security warnings. Here's the key passage: . Recently, there have been instances of travelers' laptops being infected with malicious software while using hotel internet connections. In these instances, the traveler was attempting to setup the hotel room internet connection and was presented with a pop-up window notifying the user to update a widely-used software product. If the user clicked to accept and install the update, malicious software was installed on the laptop. The pop-up window appeared to be offering a routine update to a legitimate software product for which updates are frequently available. But pop-up windows that instruct users to do bad things -- installing adware or fake antivirus products or malicious Trojan horse programs, for example -- have been around for years. They happen everywhere in the internet, not just in untrustworthy hotel and public Wi-Fi networks. ""Nobody has cited evidence specifically tying this to hotel rooms,"" says Robert Graham, CEO of security consultancy Errata Security. ""My advice for travelers is that there is nothing you need to do for traveling that you shouldn't already be doing anyway."" Reached Thursday, FBI spokeswoman Jenny Shearer couldn't cite any public reports detailing these attacks. ""We don't' have much more guidance to offer the public beyond what was shared in the alert,"" she said. Security experts generally acknowledge that hotel networks â€” especially open Wi-Fi networks â€” are untrustworthy minefields. Jonathan Kine, a technology consultant based in Jakarta, says he's seen this type of attack described in the IC3 report in hotel and public Wi-Fi networks in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. ""The user gets a pop up or a browser window that states in order to login please allow us to update your browser, then they download the payload and are infected,"" he says. In some cases, the update looks like it's from Adobe Systems, Kine says. It isn't. For corporate users, or those who are technically savvy, a virtual private network is often the best way to boost security. Another option: use your mobile carrier's network. That's what Searl Tate did recently on a trip to Las Vegas. Instead of paying for a hotel network, he simply grabbed his iPad and connected to his carrier's 4G network. ""There are other performance reasons too,"" he says, ""but security drives a portion of my concern."" For Graham, that means full disk encryption, to make your laptop unreadable in case it gets stolen. He also says that travelers should be up-to-date with their software patches and use secure SSL connections whenever they're on the Web. ""And stop clicking on Trojans,"" he adds ""If you don't do this already, then there's really no hope for you anyway. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(AOL Autos) -- Law enforcement officials in six states can now give you a ticket for talking on your cell phone while driving, so that hands-free device you should be using for your cell phone is going to become your best friend. Only 23 percent of respondents refrain from talking or texting when driving, a survey showed. The reason you may need to start wearing that dorky Bluetooth-integrated ear piece is actually quite startling and sobering. Distracted drivers cause 80 percent of all road accidents, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. In fact, a recent study by the Public Policy Institute of California shows hands-free laws have the potential of saving 300 lives in California each year and perhaps thousands if similar laws were enacted in all states. ""I wouldn't be surprised if more states enact laws much like California's new law,"" said Elliot Darvick, Celebrity Car Parade editor for MyRide.com, whose recent survey results show 70 percent of people agree that driving and cell phones don't mix. However, only 23 percent of respondents say they refrain from talking or texting when driving. To date, six states have enacted statewide hands-free laws and 20 states have active hands-free law legislation on the books. ""I certainly don't want to see people on the road texting or talking,"" Darvick said. ""I'd rather they have their hands on the wheel."" AOL Autos: Safest cars . Hands-free laws by state . On July 1, hands-free laws became effective in both California and Washington, making a total of six states (and the district of Washington DC) with enforceable hands-free laws. In addition, many states have enacted similar laws in some districts and some states have active hands-free legislation. Here's how it breaks down by state: . States with enacted laws are California, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Utah, Washington D.C. and Washington. States with enacted laws by jurisdiction (most of these states also have active state-wide legislation) are Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Pennsylvania. States with active legislation are Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. Coming to a state near you? Though the guidelines below relate specifically to the new California laws, this could be a preview of things to come for other states. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) has issued a ""Wireless Telephone Laws FAQs,"" outlining what drivers need to know about complying with hands-free driving laws in California. AOL Autos: Best car deals of the month . Here's what you need to know: . 1) The law prohibits drivers from talking on handheld wireless (cell) phones while operating an automobile. However, you can make an emergency call to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department or other emergency services agency. 2) Oddly enough, you may dial your cell phone while driving, but you cannot hold your cell phone and talk. 3) You can get a fine for texting if the officer believes you have become distracted and are not driving safely. 4) If you are using a Bluetooth or other earpiece when driving, you cannot cover both ears. AOL Autos: Top 5 most popular cars . 5) Drivers under 18 years old may not use any wireless device of any kind while driving, even hands-free devices such as earpieces. However, teen drivers can use a wireless device in case of emergency. 6) If convicted of talking while driving, the first offense fine is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. 7) You will NOT receive a point on your driver's license if convicted, but the violation will appear on your driving record. 8) Passengers cannot get ticketed for talking on their phone. 9) Push-to-talk features can only be used by commercial motor truck or tractor operators. How to comply . So, how do you comply? There are several options, from buying a new car with factory-installed Bluetooth technology to installing aftermarket wireless products to wearing a wireless headset to abstaining altogether from using a cell phone while driving. AOL Autos: 10 cars to keep you young . Here's a breakdown of what you can do to become a hands-free driver: . Spend nothing -- Either abstain from talking while driving altogether or use your cell phone's speakerphone. However, most of these tiny speakers don't deliver enough volume to mask car and road noises, leaving drivers holding their phone up to their ear. According to hands-free laws, this is illegal. Also, some drivers are turning to the wired headset that most manufacturers include with your cell phone. AOL Autos: Used luxury cars . Best buys in ear wear -- Although some people find ear pieces uncomfortable or way too geeky, a Bluetooth-enabled ear piece is one of the best ways to drive and talk. Plantronics makes some of the most affordable ear pieces with good sound quality like the sleek new Discovery 925 ($149.95), the modestly-priced Voyager 520 ($99.95) and the military grade Explorer 370 ($79.95). For those into designer wear, the Jawbone ($129.99) looks like a work of art and works as good as it looks. Don't want an earpiece? -- Wireless speakerphones and aftermarket-installed voice recognition systems have come of age. Paris-based Parrot started making these systems years ago when most of Europe enacted hands-free laws. Parrot's MINIKIT ($89) clips to your visor and is basically a mobile speakerphone while Parrot's pluggable PMK5800 kit ($119.99) sticks out from your car's cigarette lighter and has some voice recognition capabilities. Parrot also has a host of other Bluetooth-integrated products that are installed by professionals and do what factory-installed systems can do like automatically turn down your car's audio volume when you get a call. Bluetooth basics -- As with any new technology, there's a ramp-up time to feeling comfortable with using wireless technology and its by-products. Don't get too frustrated when you can't figure out how to sync your cell phone and that new ear piece. When you need help, calling tech support is sometimes better than reading the manual. Also, many older cells phones aren't integrated with Bluetooth, nor do they have the software inside to upload important data like your address book. So, you may want to think about upgrading your cell phone before you buy your new mobile wireless device. iPhone users beware: Bluetooth doesn't seem to be super compatible, although you can perform basic functions with ease. Ford's answer: Sync . It used to be that only luxury cars like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar had built-in voice recognition systems. Now with Ford's SYNC system, most consumers can afford the $395 price tag for this hi-tech option. Powered by Microsoft, SYNC is a voice-activated communication and entertainment system. Rated in 2007 as Popular Mechanic's No. 4 ""Most Brilliant Gadgets,"" Ford's SYNC also offers one of the best hands-free calling options to date. The system is rather easy to use and lets drivers bring their digital media players, MP3 players and Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones into the vehicle and operate these devices via voice commands or through buttons on the steering wheel and radio controls. So, does SYNC really work? We recently tested the first generation SYNC on a 2008 Ford Focus as well as SYNC's second generation on Ford's super cool new Flex CUV. We discovered SYNC does have its drawbacks as only certain MP3 players and mobile phones are completely compatible with SYNC's software. On the 2008 Ford Focus, for example, we could make calls from a Palm Treo or an Apple iPhone, but the system did not automatically upload contacts or music files. And, it did take some time getting used to the voice command system. In the Ford Flex, which looks like a limo-sized MINI Cooper and drives like a dream, we found the next generation SYNC to be much more user-friendly with its pleasing digital display and easy-to-use voice commands. If you have a compatible mobile phone, SYNC can even translate and send your text messages via the system's electronic voice! Ford has been the first car manufacturer to implement SYNC, although its exclusive contract with Microsoft ends this year. This means perhaps more auto manufacturers will adopt SYNC-like software systems after the 2009 model year. GM's solution is to offer hands-free calling via its OnStar subscription system. The company says about one million 2009 model year GM vehicles will be equipped with voice-activated Bluetooth integration, which uses the vehicle's speaker system. Now that you know the laws and have options to comply, are you still confused? Well, just like we've been warned for decades about drinking and driving, it now seems that it is time to change your habits and stop talking while behind the wheel.","Police in six states can now give you a ticket for talking on your cell phone .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the controversial founder and ""messiah"" of the Unification Church, was laid to rest Saturday in an elaborate ceremony attended by tens of thousands. The 92-year-old religious icon, who claimed that Jesus Christ had asked him to finish his work on earth, died on September 3 after pneumonia complications. The Unification Church believes that Jesus was divine, but that he is not God, a stance that puts it outside the bounds of traditional Christianity. The church follows Moon as its messiah. Over a dozen pallbearers donning white military-style uniforms with gold details and white caps carried his red casket to the sound of classical music through the church in a slow, unison stride. The men marched Moon's body up red carpeted stairs, through landscaped flowing flower arrangements to an elevated altar, where they set down the coffin beneath a larger-than-life painting of the reverend. They saluted him before exiting the stage. The pallbearers were church members, who had no military affiliation, and acquired their uniforms for the ceremony, a church spokesman said. About 35,000 followers and dignitaries attended the funeral in Gapyeong, South Korea, the church said. The ascension observance -- or ""Seonghwa"" - is the normal term for a funeral in the Unification Church, the spokesman said. The funeral featured video highlights of Moon's lifetime achievements. His seventh and youngest son, Rev. Hyung Jin Moon, who is also his successor, fought back tears as he held the eulogy. ""We have gathered here today to send off in holy ascension the messiah that God has sent to this world to save corrupt humanity,"" Moon's son said. The ceremony marked the end of nearly two weeks of mourning, in which over 200,000 visitors attended wakes at shrines set up by the church across the country, according to a Unification Church news release. Opinion: Moon's death marks end of an era . Moon's ""holy body"" was taken after the ceremony for interment to Mount Cheonseong, the church's ""holy land."" Media had no access to the burial. Moon had been a high-profile international evangelist for decades. He said Jesus Christ came to him in the 1930s and ""told him to finish (Jesus') mission,"" according to James Beverley, a professor at the Tyndale University College and Seminary in Toronto. His church officially started in the 1950s, with missionaries being dispatched around the world by the end of that decade. His was one of several religious movements that emerged after World War II and the Korean War in South Korea and Japan, drawing from ""a tremendous pool of people ... looking for answers as to why the world had turned (against them),"" said Virginia Commonwealth University professor David Bromley. Moon was imprisoned in North Korea during the Korean War before being freed by the allies, an experience that turned him ""virulently anti-communist,"" according to Eileen Barker, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Globally, the church's reach may have peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s, as hundreds of thousands joined the singular religious movement, Beverley said. Critics have said the controversial Moon led a cult, whose followers were colloquially known as Moonies. In his role as church leader, Moon became famous for conducting mass weddings, including one in 1982 at New York City's Madison Square Garden and one in 1995 in South Korea uniting 360,000 couples. He also gained influence in other ways as well -- growing a massive, diverse business empire that included holdings in industries such as chemicals, arms manufacturing, mining and pharmaceuticals. Moon helped create news publications, including The Washington Times, as well as universities, religious institutions and other groups. Some such organizations that Moon founded stress interfaith dialogue and peace, like the Universal Peace Federation, which advocates ""building a world of peace in which everyone can live in freedom, harmony, cooperation and prosperity."" But Moon also fell afoul of the law, serving a federal prison term in the United States for tax evasion. From 2003 to 2005, Britain's government also prohibited him from traveling to that country, according to a U.S. State Department report. A video from 2004, posted on the website of what was then known as the Interreligious and International Federation for World Peace, showed a ceremony taking place in a U.S. Senate office building. During the ceremony, Moon declares himself the messiah and says he'd spoken to the spirits of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, both of whom he said found strength in his teachings and mended their ways. Moon was traditionally a strong supporter of Republican politicians, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, Barker said. See more religion news on CNN's Belief Blog .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican vice-presidential hopeful and conservative star Paul Ryan kicks back with locally brewed beers while listening to '90s-era grunge music. He's the first member of Generation X to be named to a major party ticket. Ryan's up-by-your-bootstraps personality doesn't exactly match the ennui expressed by the grunge bands of his youth -- he was voted ""biggest brown-noser"" in high school, after all. But his economic and political perspectives, like those of many of his generation, were formed in part by the fiscally conservative Reaganomics principles of his childhood and the stark realities of entering a post-college job market during the 1990s recession and dot-com boom and bust. ""Gen Xers were supposed to be the lost generation. (That label) shaped him because he went back to the principles of hard work to get ahead,"" said Dylan Glenn, a former Bush administration economic policy analyst who has been friends with Ryan for nearly 20 years. In his pairing with baby boomer Mitt Romney, the 42-year-old Ryan brings a conservative Gen Xer's fiscal approach to the ticket, political experts say. For example, Ryan's controversial ""Path to Prosperity"" entitlement reform plan, which proposes a partially privatized Medicare program for future seniors, takes a cue from Gen X and Gen Y concerns that these programs will run out of funds long before Xers and Yers will be able to participate. ""There are plenty of young people who do not believe Medicare and Social Security are going to be there, and that's part of the logic why Paul Ryan is trying to reform these things and make sure they are available for future generations,"" said Soren Dayton, communications director for the Young Republican National Federation. Ryan's conservative stance extends beyond fiscal policy . It is a proposal that Romney has not fully embraced. His campaign told surrogates in a talking points memo obtained by CNN on Saturday: ""Gov. Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget, and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance."" Still, Ryan's history-making ascension to the ticket does suggest that the GOP is turning a page in leadership. ""This is a young generation of leadership coming forward,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta who has studied post-civil rights era politicians. Passing the torch requires that both generations of the party's leadership agree to disagree on social policy, she said. ""A lot of young Republicans don't agree with the party on a lot of social issues so they emphasize the fiscal stuff,"" Gillespie said. Ryan opposes same-sex marriage and, as a devout Roman Catholic, once described himself as ""pro-life as a person gets."" However, in 2007, he voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. A Pew Research Poll conducted last month of nearly 3,000 adults found that support for allowing same-sex marriage has increased among Generation X from 44% in 2008 to 52% this year. ""Paul Ryan is a bridge between, generationally speaking,"" said Amy Holmes, anchor of GBTV's ""Real News"" at the Blaze, a conservative news site owned by Glenn Beck. Ryan ""voted for banning workplace discrimination based on sexual discrimination. That's a reflection in part of the Gen X sensibility. We've grown up with gay men and women being out of the closet. ... It's not as shocking as it is for boomers."" Ryan's college years . Ryan's tepid support for environmental programs also seems to dovetail with Gen Xers' views on the matter. According to a recent University of Michigan Institute for Social Research survey of 3,000 adults, just 5% of Gen Xers said they are ""alarmed"" and 18% said they are ""concerned"" about climate change. Most of the group surveyed last year, or 66%, said they're unsure if global warming is happening, and 10% said they don't believe it's occurring. Those generational differences could help sway voters turned off by the GOP's messaging on social issues such as abortion, but who are open to Republican stances on necessary budget cuts. Then there's the visual appeal of Ryan, who is the same age as one of Romney's sons. When Ryan stands on stage, flanked by his young children and wife, next to the Romneys, the older man looks warmer and more paternal, Gillespie said. ""Mitt Romney is extremely stiff ... because he still has this persona where it hard for him to feel relatable. To have someone who is young and dynamic helps soften Romney up and attracts that 'it' factor and 'wow' factor,"" Gillespie said. ""Paul Ryan would seem to be cooler. Even talking about the fact that he listens to Led Zeppelin and grunge. ... The fact that he says he likes hard rock makes him seem cooler. ... That charisma is born in youth."" What do you think of Romney naming Ryan as his running mate? Let us know on CNN iReport.","Paul Ryan is the first member of Gen X named to top of a major party ticket .
He came of age during an economic recession and the dot-com boom and bust .

"(CNN) -- If you sat down with an accomplished self-portrait photographer, the last thing you might expect to hear is ""I'm a bit uneasy in my skin right now."" But that's what Jen Davis tells me as she eyes the voice recorder I've set between us on her living room couch. She tucks her legs beneath her. ""In fact,"" she says, ""I have to admit I'm a little freaked out."" Davis's inhibitions are understandable. She spent ten years creating striking, seductive images of her own 269-pound frame, and now, suddenly—with the top portion of her stomach cinched by a silicone Lap-Band and the extra weight melting away—her subject is disappearing before her eyes. As we chat about her past and her work, Davis laughs easily, and before responding to a question, she wrinkles her forehead so you can practically see her thinking. She's beautiful, with bright blue eyes and the kind of straight blonde hair the rest of us have to fake. But because she's been obese most of her life, Davis is racked with insecurities. Since she was a teenager, she has preferred to interact with the world from a distance, through the lens of a camera. During her high school years, she was constantly snapping photos of kids in the hallways and the cafeteria as a photographer for the yearbook. ""I used the camera to gain access, to communicate,"" she says. Oprah.Com: What inspires the most creative people we know . But the pictures she took outside school—abandoned cars on a nearby reservation; the teenage boys she pined for as they jammed with their garage bands—reflected her growing sense of isolation. Over time she began to focus on capturing the loneliness in others. ""It was like I was taking self-portraits,"" she says, ""except I wasn't in them."" When Davis was 23, her work took a turn: Reading through her old journals, she was struck by the fact that her grievances—being overweight, missing out on romantic love—had been the same for years. Maybe, she thought, if I turn the camera on myself, I might shake loose whatever is holding me back. In the first self-portrait she ever snapped, Davis sits on a bamboo mat on the sand, on spring break in Myrtle Beach, her one-piece bathing suit concealed by a green cover-up and black shorts; the friends around her are slender in their bikinis and swim trunks, and the uneasiness on her face is palpable. So began a decade-long project, during which Davis shot hundreds of images of her body. ""A lot of artists use self-portraits to transform into other identities. But my intention was to understand myself better. To articulate myself through the lens."" Oprah.com: 7 steps to creating the life you really want . The photos are arresting. In one, Davis is fresh out of the shower, wrapped in a maroon towel, water droplets dotting her pale shoulders. In another, she is floating on her back in a concrete water tank, her limbs spread like starfish rays. Some shots convey her anxieties more directly: her fingers trying to button a too-small pair of pants; her eyes doleful as she lies awake in the toned arms of a sleeping man. Davis never imagined an audience when she began the project. Had she envisioned her photos hanging in museums and galleries, she wouldn't have been as bold, she says. But it wasn't long before the powerfully raw images generated buzz in the photography world. Davis was accepted to the Yale University School of Art's Master of Fine Arts program. Galleries in France, Spain, and Italy exhibited her work. The New York Times Magazine published her photos. She won awards and grants, and colleges and museums invited her to lecture on her portrayals of beauty and sexuality. And then, in the spring of 2011, during a photography residency in Syracuse, New York, while Davis was reviewing her portfolio—dozens of portraits blown up and hung on the wall—she was struck with the same feeling of horror she'd felt reading through her journals when she was 23. ""In ten years, my body hadn't really changed, and I hadn't changed, either,"" she says. ""The problem was that I was making myself vulnerable only for the camera. What I really wanted was to be vulnerable for another person."" Oprah.com: Emotional eating: Get your feelings out of the fridge . That summer Davis underwent Lap-Band surgery, and after ten months, as this issue goes to press, she has lost 95 pounds—bringing her weight down to 174. Despite the very real physical limitations created by a Lap-Band, patients who undergo the procedure must commit to eating healthily for long-term success. The failure rate, says Michael Hill, MD, of Adirondack Surgical Group, who has performed hundreds of these operations, is between 40 and 50 percent. Davis has not only adjusted to a new lifestyle but dedicated herself utterly to it. She has revamped her diet—eating mindfully (without distractions like the computer), avoiding simple carbohydrates, enjoying the feeling of filling up on nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables. She also hits the gym twice a week for cardio and weights, and does Pilates twice a week at home. Davis had always assumed she'd die young when she was obese and a heavy smoker, and on some level, she was okay with that. Now she shudders to recall that feeling of indifference. There's so much to live for—including the thrill of going on first dates. ""I'm 34, and I've never had a boyfriend,"" she says with a wistful smile. ""I have a lot to learn."" Oprah.com: 7 foolproof rules for changing your diet . But with all the changes, Davis has struggled artistically over the past year. She found herself craving a break from photographing her body as it began to slim down; she felt more beautiful and more desirable than ever before—but also more exposed, without all the extra weight to shield her from the world. It wasn't until this spring that she finally aimed the camera at herself again. ""I thought the self-portraits might help me process my new life,"" Davis says. ""I was ready to go back under my microscope."" She is surprised and excited by what she's discovering in her recent images: ""My sexuality feels tangible for the first time. There's a change in tone. Where I once saw an overpowering sadness, I now see confidence."" It's in her gestures, and the way she holds herself. In Davis's favorite portrait so far, she is looking at her reflection in the mirror. ""You can tell from my expression that I'm not being critical,"" she says. ""You can almost see the realization on my face: I am open to myself."" Oprah.com: 17 quotes to help you follow your dreams . Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The newly appointed Japanese ambassador to China has died after taking ill and collapsing in Tokyo late last week. In a brief statement, the Japanese Foreign Ministry confirmed Shinichi Nishimiya, 60, died on Sunday after spending the weekend in hospital because of his ""health condition."" He collapsed just two days after being appointed to the job. The ministry did not disclose any further details about what had happened. Panasonic closes China plants after protests . Previously a deputy minister for foreign affairs, Nishimiya was due to replace the current Japanese envoy in Beijing, 72-year-old Uichiro Niwa, in the coming weeks amid heightened tensions between Japan and China. The Japanese government's recent purchase of a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea from a private owner has angered Beijing, which has called the acquisition ""illegal and invalid."" Asian islands dispute: Who claims what? On Friday China sent six surveillance vessels to carry out patrols around the remote islands, which Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu, in an effort to underscore its claim to sovereignty. The ships briefly entered Japanese territorial waters despite warnings not to do so, the Japanese Coast Guard said. The dispute also hit a nerve with many ordinary Chinese, as tens of thousands took to the streets at the weekend to protest against Japan's stance. In Beijing, Japan's embassy was attacked with eggs and bottles, while angry mobs in other cities across China ransacked Japanese businesses and burned Japanese-made cars. iReport: Caught in anti-Japan protest . Though Japanese officials have sought to play down the significance of the deal to buy the islands, the dispute has come to represent what many Chinese people see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s. China says its claim goes back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.

"(CNN) -- Camelot is real. The name synonymous with King Arthur's mythical kingdom of round tables, opulence and heroism has arrived. But hold your horses. This 'Camelot' is no fantastical castle in a medieval woodland. This is a three-year-old colt with designs on a very different fairytale crown. Trainer Aiden O'Brien is not normally prone to lack of self-belief. Yet even the taciturn Irishman admits that the bid by his star colt Camelot to become the first horse since Nijinsky to win the Triple Crown -- the 2,000 Guineas, the Epsom Derby and the St Leger Stakes -- is ""pushing the boat out."" The horse with the mythical name has so far lived up to his billing, having swept aside all comers in a fairytale three-year-old campaign that has already seen him capture the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby, scooping up the Irish Derby on the way. But in Doncaster he will face the biggest test of his career when he steps up to the one-and-three-quarter mile distance for the first time. ""It will really expose the horse,"" O'Brien admits. ""We know he has speed and stamina and courage but this is asking for that extra stamina."" If Camelot can handle the extra distance he will join an elite group of just 15 horses who have claimed the world's oldest continuous sporting competition. The last of those, Nijinsky, was back in 1970. His predecessor, Bahram, won his treble 35 years before that. Nowadays, very few horses even attempt the hat-trick -- the extreme versatility required to win races ranging from a mile to one-and-three-quarter miles is simply beyond the repertoire of most three-year-olds. ""Very few have the capacity to do it,"" agrees O'Brien. ""For a horse to win the Guineas over a mile and then go to the Derby, if you get the Derby trip [1Â½ miles] you're very lucky. Now we're asking him to go that little bit further."" A victory in the St Leger would be the crowning glory of a sensational season for O'Brien, which has seen his Ballydoyle operation make a clean sweep of all the English Classics so far -- the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and their fillies' equivalents, the 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks. Tucked away behind wrought-iron gates in a quiet corner of Ireland, on a misty morning Ballydoyle captures something of the air of the original Camelot legend -- King Arthur's symbolic seat and emblem of the Arthurian world. If Aiden O'Brien represents King Arthur, then his son, 19-year-old Joseph, is the trusty Galahad. He has ridden the colt in all of his starts to date and will play a decisive role in masterminding his race on Sunday. It's a working relationship that demands implicit trust between father and son. As far as tactics for the race are concerned. ""That'll be left to Joseph. I presume he'll take his time on him, he usually does. That's the way he rides every race, he rides it by feel and takes it as it comes."" At just 19, Joseph has already ridden more Classic winners than most jockeys will in a lifetime. But at nearly six-feet tall, the lanky teenager is surely riding on borrowed time as far as a sustained career as a flat jockey is concerned. ""I try not to think about it too much,"" says Joseph. ""However long I last, I last."" A victory in the Triple Crown in what may be one of his final seasons on the flat would lend added poignancy to what has already been an omen-laden endeavour; the last horse to win the Triple Crown, Nijinsky, was trained at the very same Ballydoyle stables that Aiden O'Brien now occupies by a different O'Brien, legendary trainer Vincent. Although the two O'Brien clans are not related, it is a further example of how normative determinism has played a fateful role in the colt's career to date. Camelot's owners -- Messrs. Derrick Smith and Michael Tabor and Mrs John Magnier -- had eagerly awaited a horse to come into their possession who was worthy of the name. In the handsome bay with the interrupted white blaze, they found the perfect specimen. Purchased out of the sales ring as a yearling for 252,000 guineas ($426,018), he quickly asserted himself as one of the leading two-year-olds of his generation. In a sport where early promise is not necessarily a guarantee of future staying power, Camelot has not put a foot wrong, amassing more than $2.5 million in prize money over his two seasons on the track, in which he has remained undefeated in all five of his races. Camelot was sired by the great Montjeu, who was also responsible for fellow Derby winners Motivator, Authorized and Pour Moi. Tellingly, he also sired St Leger winners Scorpion and Masked Marvel (the 2011 champion). Montjeu passed away earlier this year after suffering complications from septicaemia, meaning that a career at stud is now a certainty for Camelot. The St Leger, therefore, will likely be the swansong of his meteoric career. The blood that flows through Camelot's veins is now simply too valuable to risk in further outings on the track. Despite that, Camelot is roundly quoted as the favorite for next month's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France, Europe's most prestigious race. Victory at Longchamp would see Camelot finally step out of the shadow of Nijinsky, who finished second in the Arc following his Triple Crown. Could Camelot's owners be tempted to give their colt one final shot at posterity? It seems unlikely. Montjeu's stable at nearby Coolmore -- the nerve centre of the Magniers' Irish breeding operation -- still has his name above the door, having not been given to another stallion. There seems only one likely occupant in the near future. But before he can begin to contemplate a future servicing mares, first there is the small matter of the St Leger. Camelot's main challenger will be the John Gosden-trained Thought Worthy, who represents his trainer's best chance of landing a treble of his own in the form of three consecutive St Leger victories. O'Brien is realistic about his chances: ""Everybody knows the Triple Crown is very difficult to win. ""I can't tell you how hard it is to win any of those big races. We do our very best every day and sometimes it's good enough and sometimes it's not. ""So many things have to happen to get the horse right, get everybody together and for the thing to happen on the day. It's just something that I couldn't even dream about."" One suspects that O'Brien is dreaming, however; dreaming of English racing's Holy Grail.","Camelot aiming for triple crown at St Leger Stakes, winning the Epsom Derby and 2,000 Guineas .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Novak Djokovic retained his Rogers Cup title in Toronto by defeating French 14th seed Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-2. The Serb, who lost his position at the top of the world rankings following Roger Federer's Wimbledon triumph, did not drop a set during the defense of the championship he won during his dominant 2011 season. The five-time major winner took advantage of all three break points he earned during the match to wrap up victory in just over an hour. Djokovic was pleased to have bounced back after a disappointing loss to Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro in the recent bronze medal match at the London 2012 Olympic Games. ""It's a big tournament, one of the biggest we have in tennis,"" Djokovic told the ATP Tour's official website after securing his 31st career title. ""I'm very happy to be in this position. ""I truly did not expect myself to win this tournament after the emotional losses in the Olympic Games. I really took it hard. I tried to bounce back and recover; I've done great, I have to say."" Federer considering Rio Olympic bid . Having also won the Rogers Cup title in 2007, Djokovic became only the third Open era player to win the event at least three times, following in the footsteps of Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi. ""I'm not one of the biggest servers in the game, that's for sure, but I always try to focus on the second shot after the serve,"" said the 25-year-old Serb, who has won seven of the eight matches he has played against Gasquet. ""I've been working on the efficiency of my first and second serve, but also trying to be aggressive in the first ball. It's been working exceptionally well throughout the whole week."" Azarenka and Sharapova both in doubt for start of U.S. Open .

""This is tennis. You have to put the ball over the net and back in the court. It looks easy, but sometimes it can be hard to do. ""When I was 5-1 down, I thought if I shot hard four in a row, I'd lose the match. So I had to change a little bit. I was just trying to take it point by point.

"(CNN) -- It's been a year since the Occupy Wall Street movement sprang up. Since then, it has fizzled, but this does not mean that the underlying issues that gave rise to the protests have gone away. Until last year, mainstream political discourse did not include nearly as much emphasis on such populist concerns as rising income inequality, tax policies that favor the rich, growing influence by large corporate interests in elections and the reckless deregulation of financial institutions that resulted in the 2008 crisis. It is hard to miss them now. These concerns still impact 99% of Americans. Even if Occupy protests have petered out, the movement has affected the political narrative in our country. Meet the original 'Occupiers' We can see Occupy's impact in the current presidential campaign. Whereas Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election strategy focused on the idea of ""triangulation"" -- taking centrist positions on key economic issues to isolate his Republican opponent on the right -- President Barack Obama has taken on much more of a populist stance, mobilizing his Democratic base and economically stressed independents against an opponent whom his campaign is depicting as the quintessential representative of the 1%. Occupy activists justifiably express skepticism over how much to trust the president's left-leaning rhetoric when his actual economic policies have been decidedly centrist. Still, the fact that Obama's re-election campaign recognizes the advantage of decrying unfair tax laws and similar policies that affect middle class Americans is indicative of how the tone has shifted. Unfortunately, much of the decline of the Occupy movement can also be attributed to the distraction from this year's election campaigns. Despite the Democrats' mixed record, the unions and many other potential allies necessary in building a real movement have felt obliged to focus their energy on re-electing Obama and helping other Democratic candidates. Some police repression and serious violations of civil liberties by city authorities certainly crippled the Occupy protests as well, as did the media's tendency to focus too much on its more violent or flaky elements. But, this does not mean that all is lost. What was the point of the Occupy movement? Share your view with CNN iReport . The Egyptian Revolution and other unarmed civil insurrections that have swept the world recently did not start and end during a few dramatic weeks or months when millions of people were on the streets. They were the culmination of many years of struggle, often initiated by young radicals engaging in small but creative demonstrations. The Occupy protesters, even at their greatest numbers, were never able to do what successful movements must do in terms of developing a well-thought-out strategy, clearly articulated political demands, a logical sequencing of tactics and well-trained and disciplined activists who don't vandalize property or fight cops. Indeed, the Occupy protesters never developed enough of the structural elements necessary to truly be considered a ""movement."" Most importantly, those involved never recognized that colorful protests are no substitute for door-to-door organizing among real people. A look back: Meet the 99% . The United States has a long history of popular social and economic struggles, from the abolitionists to the Populists to the suffragists to the civil rights movement and, throughout much of that history, the trade unions. As Thomas Jefferson once beckoned his fellow Americans: ""crush... the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our government to trial and bid defiance to the laws of our country."" If the pressing concerns of the 99% are not addressed, don't be surprised if new incarnations of the Occupy movement emerge in the near future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Zunes.","It's been a year since the Occupy Wall Street movement sprang up .

The search was suspended at times because the disaster site was deemed unstable, emergency officials said. ""It's an ongoing situation,"" Bill Macpherson of the Regional District of Central Kootenay Emergency Operations Center told CNN. Four people remained unaccounted for Friday for after three homes were destroyed and several others damaged in Johnsons Landing in the Kootenays, Macpherson said.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Paul Ryan struggled to explain a budget-balancing timeline under Mitt Romney, he highlighted the difficulty of trying to run a substantive campaign without being too specific. While Ryan's interview Tuesday with Fox News' Brit Hume was no Sarah Palin-Katie Couric moment, the Republican vice presidential candidate's discomfort in answering when Romney's proposal would balance the budget was evident. Ryan, a seven-term congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he was unsure when Romney's proposals would balance the federal budget. Romney's plans say he would ""put the federal government on a course toward a balanced budget"" but does not say when. Mitt Romney's 5-point plan for the economy . Hume repeatedly pressed Ryan on the question of ""when"" Romney's budget would balance. Hume: ""The budget plan you're now supporting would get to balance when?"" Ryan: ""Well, there are different -- the budget plan that Mitt Romney is supporting gets us down to 20% of GDP (gross domestic product) government spending by 2016. That means get the size of government back to where it historically has been. What President Obama has done is he brought the size of government to as high as it hasn't been since World War II. We want to reduce the size of government to have more economic freedom."" Hume: ""I get that. What about balance?"" Ryan: ""I don't know exactly what the balance is. I don't want to get wonky on you, but we haven't run the numbers on that specific plan. The plan we offer in the House balances the budget. I'd put a contrast. President Obama, never once, ever, has offered a plan to ever balance the budget. The United States Senate, they haven't even balanced, they haven't passed a budget in three years."" Hume: ""I understand that. But your own budget, that you -- . Ryan: ""You are talking about the House budget?"" Hume: ""I'm talking about the House budget. Your budget will be a political issue in this campaign."" Ryan: ""The House budget doesn't balance until the 2030s under the current measurement of the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) baseline."" The Romney campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment on a budget balancing timeline. Ryan's plan, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says would bring the federal budget ""nearly in balance in 2050,"" has overshadowed Romney's more vague proposals since the younger man was named to the ticket. As a result, Ryan, one of the GOP's leading numbers guys, has had the unenviable task of underscoring that the Republican ticket has a plan -- albeit a fuzzy one -- while steering clear of outshining his would-be boss on budget matters. ""It has put him in an awkward position. He has answered the questions provided, but he can't go into too much detail because they would come off as the position of the campaign,"" said Mark Jones, chairman of Rice University's political science department. There are definite differences in the level of detail in Ryan's and Romney's plans. Under Ryan's proposal, the deficit ""would be around 1% of gross domestic product in the 2020s and would decline further after 2030"" -- ultimately showing a surplus by 2040. Romney's economic plan proposes capping federal spending at 20% of GDP in 2016, while calculations based on the CBO scoring of Ryan's budget show spending on all federal programs -- including entitlements, mandatory and discretionary spending -- would be about 17.25% of GDP in 2030. The report did not include calculations for 2016. Romney's plan, released in September 2011, does not say when he would bring the federal budget into balance, and in March the candidate said his plans ""can't be scored"" because key details are omitted, such as how he would change deductions and exemption in the tax code. Asked in his Tuesday interview what loopholes and deductions the Romney-Ryan administration would eliminate, Ryan deferred. Ryan's discomfort in elaborating further on the ticket's budget proposal is also because the conservative congressman's plan ""is better understood as a long-term initiative to roll back the role of federal government in society,"" said CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein. And even Romney has acknowledged that he and his running mate aren't fully simpatico when it comes to budget matters. Shortly after Ryan was named to the ticket, the Romney campaign circulated a talking points memo to surrogates that urged them to stress that ""Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget, and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance."" As recently as Monday, Romney again made clear there are some differences between the two men's approach to the budget. ""I'm sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we're on the same page as I said before,"" Romney said on the trail Monday. ""We'll look at the differences. Well, the items we agree on I think outweigh any differences there may be. We haven't gone through piece by piece. ... I can't imagine any two people even in the same party who have exactly the same positions on all issues."" Some conservatives, who cheered when Romney picked Ryan, worry that in some ways the guy at the top of the ticket may be hanging his would-be second in command out to dry. ""I'm sure there are differences between the two, but to his credit, Paul Ryan has a plan; neither Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney for that matter really have a plan with the specificity,"" conservative commentator and CNN contributor Erick Erickson said Tuesday on CNN's ""Early Start."" ""Paul Ryan has a 90-page outline of what he wants to do in actual legislative language. ... Now should there be differences between them? I guess, but when you bring Paul Ryan on the ticket, a guy who the Democrats in 2011 were already running commercials with a Paul Ryan look-alike shoving a grandmother off a cliff, you can't really distance yourself from that."" But there does appear to be some distancing, which could provide President Obama's re-election campaign plenty of room to fill in the blanks when it comes to the Romney-Ryan ticket's budget plans, Jones said. ""It's on the Romney campaign to provide (Ryan) more areas of leeway where he can go into detail,"" Jones said. ""They need to come up with greater specifics with the area of budgeting; if they don't, the Obama campaign will define them. They also need to define which areas of (the) Ryan plan (Romney will adopt)."" CNN's Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","Paul Ryan, a top GOP numbers guy, struggles to explain Mitt Romney's fuzzy budget details .

"(CNN) -- A new teaser trailer for ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 2"" reveals important details about the setting and gameplay options for the latest title in the blockbuster ""Call of Duty"" series. The clip was posted online Tuesday night and has already attracted 1.4 million views on YouTube. It features a near-future scenario in which the U.S. military has developed technology that puts unmanned vehicles and robots on the front lines of battle. An enemy gains access to that technology and turns it against cities all over the world. Developed by Treyarch and published by Activision, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 2"" will be released November 18. Its predecessor, 2010's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" is the best-selling video game ever in the United States, according to some estimates. Mark Lamia, Treyarch studio head, said his developers did a lot of research to set the game in a plausible future. He said for its single-player campaign, the game will feature multiple plotlines and nonlinear gameplay in which a player's actions affect how the story unfolds. Gameplay in the video shows a bombed-out Los Angeles, urban combat through city streets and ... horseback chases through the desert. It appears to mix futuristic, sci-fi themes with present-day elements. Lamia also confirmed that zombies are returning to the game. ""Our biggest, most ambitious zombies ever,"" he said.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A suicide bombing at a police station in Istanbul killed at least one police officer and left at least four wounded, police in Turkey said Tuesday. The attacker first threw a hand grenade and then detonated his suicide bomb, Istanbul police chief Huseyin Capkin said in a news conference. Capkin said police had ""more or less"" determined the identity of the attacker, a male aged about 25 years old, but were not releasing it. The police chief did not link the attacker to any organization. He said there was some uncertainty about the number of wounded. Earlier reports put the number at eight. The blast appears to have taken place at the entrance to the police station in the Sultangazi neighborhood. Ambulances rushed to the scene, according to Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency. CNN's Yesim Comert and CNN Turk's Hande Kolcak Kostendil contributed to this report.","NEW: The blast was caused by a suicide bomber, police say .

"(CNN) -- Sad face of the day: Adulthood is just an endless string of irritating to-dos. They hang over your right shoulder in an angry gray cloud, extending in billowy tendrils into your consciousness whenever you begin to think about sinking into a lawn chair in the backyard or inviting some neighbors over for a themed poker night. ""You should be productiiiiiive,"" they nag you in a sibilant whisper. ""You have ressssponsibilitiesss."" To be fair, technology has done a decent job of cutting down on said inconveniences. At one point, you had to use your own two feet or hitch up a carriage to go into town and pick up some edibles. Then: the car! And now: FreshDirect, which has made us so immobile we actually roll our eyes when we have to get up to let the delivery boy inside. So he can deliver our groceries directly to our kitchens. Still, there are plenty of bothersome tasks that technology hasn't yet eliminated. It's done its best, though, to at least make the odious tasks less so. With that in mind, we give you: three major drags, and the apps that'll make them ... well ... if not fun, a bit less miserable. The drag: Losing those last 10 pounds . ... Or the first 10 pounds, as the case may be (and probably is). Lucky for you, some new-ish gadgets and tools stoke your competitive streak to get you out of that permanent, butt-shaped indentation you've left on your Lay-Z-Boy. Witness UP by Jawbone, a bare-bones bracelet (OK fine, insecure men, ""wristband"") that tracks your activity levels and sleep by sensing movement and lets you sign up for organized challenges (e.g., ""Get 49 hours of sleep per week."") The FitBit, a little chapstick-sized clip, has almost identical claims, plus it awards you Foursquare-like badges for hitting fitness milestones (15,000 steps in a day ... yahoo!). Both gizmos are $100 and encourage you to compare your totals with other users, though there probably aren't really enough people in the communities yet to compete with anyone you know. If you're thinking, ""One hundred clams for a fancy-pants pedometer?! What am I, a sultan?!"" -- you are probably a miser, in which case, have we got the app for you: GymPact asks you to predict how many times you'll make it to the gym in a week. Check in appropriately, and you'll earn cash. Fail miserably, and you owe the site money. Hey, it's only annoying if you remain glued to that recliner, butterball. The drag: Saving up for a trip/surgery/down payment on that Uglydoll Swarovski watch . Yes, you could spend your tax return on a wild spree at the mall, spittle collecting in frothy flecks on the corners of your mouth as you breathlessly vault from store to store. But there's that hissing conscience again, urging you to sock away the funds instead. Look, 9 times out of 10, not spending is way less fun than spending. But free personal finance site Mint.com makes saving -- if not enjoyable -- at least candy-colored and pleasant-looking. Use the ""goals"" function to map your progress in a bar graph and you might even be likelier to hit the target, according to research from the McIntire School of Commerce. When people were more than 60% to their goal and could see the progress visually, they were more motivated than those who just saw the growing dollar amount. The drag: Going to the dentist . The thing you have to bite on to take X-rays will hurt, your gums will bleed when the dental hygienist goes to town with that little metal weapon, and the dentist will absolutely give you a look when you lie through your filmy, yellow teeth about how often you actually floss. These things we cannot change. But we can encourage you to at least find a hot dentist -- a little eye candy to deliver that message about how you need to cut back on the sweet stuff.

"(EW.com) -- Just a year or so ago, girls behaving ''badly'' — really raunchy, really messed up on drugs, really promiscuous and narcissistic — seemed to be a revolutionary flavor in movie comedy. To see how quickly it's become the new normal, check out two current high-profile indie comedies. ""Bachelorette"" follows a bride-to-be and her three friends over the course of one endless, drunken, hapless bachelorette party. The movie would like to be ""Bridesmaids"" meets ""Superbad"" meets a very special episode of ""Snooki & JWoww."" ""For a Good Time, Call..."" tells the tender tale of two roommates who team up to launch a phone-sex line. Whatever their virtues or flaws, each of these movies makes the dirtiest episode of ""Sex and the City"" look like Doris Day fluff. ""Bachelorette,"" a sloshed-night-before-the-wedding comedy, is a movie that's every bit as caustic and high-strung as its damaged-princess heroines. It opens in L.A., where the sweet plus-size Becky (Rebel Wilson, who was Kristen Wiig's Cockney freak of a roommate in Bridesmaids) informs her best friend, the platinum-blond ice queen Regan (Kirsten Dunst), that she's engaged, an announcement that Regan greets by just about choking on her salad with jealousy. That's what a petty vixen she is. Most of ""Bachelorette"" takes place six months later, in Manhattan, on the eve of Becky's nuptials, the perfect occasion for a bachelorette party that spins out of control. But this isn't a daffy clockwork farce like the Hangover films. It's a revved-up pageant of naked feminine dysfunction, a comedy of values about young women who don't have any. Toronto: Watching stars watch 'Looper' Regan, the maid of honor, is joined by Becky's two other childhood friends: Gena (Lizzy Caplan), a gothy motormouthed train wreck, and Katie (Isla Fisher), a terminally insecure ditz. These two spend the movie snorting enough cocaine to give an elephant a heart attack. As for Regan, she doesn't need drugs — she gets high on hating others, and on hating herself, too. The entire movie is an overdose of wrecked party-girl masochism. The three bridesmaids end up tearing Becky's humongous wedding dress asunder, and so they go out on the town, dragging the increasingly sorry garment around with them, trying to find a way to repair it even as it's assaulted by various bodily fluids. ""Bachelorette"" is expertly shot and paced, with a script that's as cutting as a serrated knife. It was written by its director, Leslye Headland (who based it on her Off Broadway play), and her dialogue has a nasty misanthropic zing that ups the ante on ""Mean Girls"" and ""Heathers."" Each of the trio has a guy she's passively pursuing (they're played by James Marsden, Kyle Bornheimer, and the always droll Adam Scott), and the encounters with them are funny in a merciless, this-is-a-woman's-brain-on-drugs sort of way. There's a rush in seeing actresses this charming take on characters who are this disagreeable. Yet if ""Bachelorette"" takes the form of a romantic ensemble comedy, it's purged of any true romantic feeling. You'll laugh, maybe a lot, but you won't feel great about it in the morning. 'Breaking Dawn 2': Watch VMAs trailer . Where the characters in ""Bachelorette"" seem to be pining for an innocence they never had, the two heroines of ""For a Good Time, Call..."" manage to outdo them in raunch and still come off as sweetly ingenuous. The movie, directed by Jamie Travis, is crudely shot and about as thin as a mediocre sitcom, yet its central situation is disarmingly funny — and, after a while, oddly winning. Lauren (Lauren Miller), laid off from her publishing job, moves in with Katie (Ari Graynor), a distant acquaintance she has despised since college (the feeling is mutual). Neither one of them can really afford to live in New York City on her own. Katie, like the Lena Dunham character on HBO's ""Girls,"" calls herself a ''writer,'' but she pays the rent by working for a phone-sex service, and that's something she's got a gift for. It's Lauren who gets the idea of starting their own dirty-talk line. This is basically the kickoff for a high-concept farce, but it's not just the matter-of-fact explicitness that's funny. It's the way that talking like lusty ''tramps'' on the phone liberates these two. Lauren Miller (who co-wrote the script) has a demure sneakiness, but it's Ari Graynor's movie — she's like Kate Hudson possessed by the spirit of Bette Midler. And all the better off for it.

"London (CNN) -- England soccer captain John Terry will be charged with racially abusing another player, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service said Wednesday. The incident concerns comments the Chelsea footballer allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in a recent English Premier League match. ""I have today advised the Metropolitan Police Service that John Terry should be prosecuted for a racially aggravated public order offense following comments allegedly made during a Premier League football match between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea on 23 October 2011,"" said Alison Saunders, Chief Crown Prosecutor for London. ""I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute this case."" Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it ... Terry will appear before magistrates in west London on February 1, 2012, she added. The maximum penalty for the offense is Â£2,500 ($3,900). In August, the Chelsea defender was reported in the UK's Daily Telegraph to have signed a new deal with the club worth Â£150,000 ($235,000) a week. The London-born defender denied the allegations. ""I am disappointed with the decision to charge me and hope to be given the chance to clear my name as quickly as possible,"" Terry said in a statement issued through the Press Association. ""I have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my closest friends. ""I will fight tooth and nail to prove my innocence. I have campaigned against racism and believe there is no place for it in society."" Profile: Chelsea's iconic leader . Chelsea Football Club also gave its support for Terry: ""John has made it clear he denies the charge and is determined to do all he can to prove his innocence,"" the club said in a statement. ""Chelsea FC has always been fully supportive of John in this matter and there is no question that we will continue to be so. ""The club finds all forms of discrimination abhorrent and we are proud of the work we undertake campaigning on this important issue. Chelsea will not be commenting further on the subject while the legal process runs its course."" Terry's position as England captain has come under scrutiny since the allegations were made, and the court case will come before the team's next match at home to the Netherlands on February 29. The English Football Association declined to comment on Wednesday, but its former chief executive David Davies said the ruling body might take action later if Terry is found guilty. ""The FA would most certainly go down that road,"" Davies told CNN. ""England is the country which first embraced the idea of using the power of football to face racism back in the 1990s. England has not, unlike many other countries, swept this issue under the carpet. ""He can most certainly still play for England, as things stand. You always start with the premise of innocence until proven guilty. He will, to be sure, fight these charges with a vehemence."" The prosecutor's decision to charge Terry came one day after the FA found Liverpool striker Luis Suarez guilty of racially abusing Manchester United player Patrice Evra in October. The Uruguay international was suspended for eight matches and fined Â£40,000 ($63,000) after a seven-day hearing by an independent regulatory commission. He has 14 days to appeal the punishment, the FA said. The commission found that Suarez ""used insulting words towards Mr. Evra"" and that those words ""included a reference to Mr. Evra's color,"" the FA statement said. Liverpool FC issued a statement saying it was ""very surprised and disappointed"" with the decision. ""We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no one else on the field of play -- including Evra's own Manchester United teammates and all the match officials -- heard the alleged conversation between the two players,"" the club said. ""We will study the details reasons of the commission once they become available, but reserve our right to appeal or take any other course of action we feel appropriate with regards to this situation."" Suarez did not specify what he said, but had previously said it wasn't offensive.","England soccer captain John Terry charged with racially abusing another player .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Europe's top human rights watchdog has urged Germany to stop offering sexual offenders the option of surgical castration. The Council of Europe's anti-torture committee said in a report issued Wednesday that the practice, which aims to help convicted sex criminals rein in their sex drives and lower their risk of reoffending, could easily be regarded as ""degrading treatment."" According to Germany's 1969 Law on Voluntary Castration, a person over the age of 25 may be subjected to surgical castration if he ""displays an abnormal sex drive, which ... gives reason to suspect that he will commit one or more criminal offenses."" The controversial procedure is not mandatory and a consensual offender can only have the operation after being informed of all the implications of the decision and after medical approval has been obtained, Germany said in its response, adding that it would consider reviewing the issue. But Berlin also cited the treatment's effectiveness, saying that of the 104 people who underwent the procedure in the 1970s, only three people committed sexual crimes again. Nearly half of the 53 others who refused or were denied treatment eventually reoffended. Voluntary castration is still very rare in Germany, with fewer than five cases per year in the last decade. The only other country in the 47-nation bloc of the Council of Europe that offers the process is the Czech Republic, which has also been the subject of criticism in recent years for allowing sex offenders to opt for castration, a procedure it uses far more frequently than Germany.","The Council of Europe says surgical castration may qualify as ""degrading treatment""

"(EW.com) -- Chances are, you weren't at the movies this weekend. Not a single film at the box office reached $10 million. Call it the curse of ""The Oogieloves."" The Top 12 films grossed a depressingly low $51.9 million — the worst Top 12 total since Sept. 5-7, 2008, when Nicolas Cage flop Bangkok Dangerous led the chart with $7.7 million and the Top 12 films earned $50.3 million. Even more distressingly, this weekend marked the lowest cumulative ticket sales in over a decade. The last frame to notch worse overall ticket sales was Sept. 21-23, 2001 — two weekends after the 9/11 attacks — when only one new wide release entered theaters: Mariah Carey's infamous bomb Glitter. (Keep in mind, as final weekend results come in on Monday, things could change. Stay tuned.) Ahead of the Curve: Weekly pop culture calendar . Lionsgate's $14 million horror entry The Possession once again topped the chart with $9.5 million. The film, which earned a ""B"" CinemaScore grade last week, enjoyed a better than expected hold (it dropped 46 percent) — especially since its debut results were inflated by it bowing on a holiday weekend. After ten days, The Possession has earned $33.3 million, and by the end of its run, it may possess close to $50 million total. If you're not a fan of demonic tales like The Possession, prepare yourself to keep seeing them for a long while at the box office. The ""Based on a True Story"" conceit, which was effectively used in marketing for The Possession (and similar titles like The Devil Inside), still hasn't worn out its welcome with American audiences, and horror tales are so cheap to make that they don't need gargantuan grosses to provide solid financial returns for their studios. In second place, The Weinstein Company's moonshine-drenched crime drama Lawless dropped 40 percent and took in an additional $6 million in its second weekend. The period piece, which stars Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, and Jessica Chastain, has garnered $23.5 million after 12 days. Weinstein has yet to confirm a budget for the film. CBS Films' The Words, the generically titled writing drama that's garnered attention for being the meeting place of the are-they-or-aren't-they? couple Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana, started its run in third place with just $5 million from 2,801 theaters. Even by CBS Films standards, that is very low. The fledgling studio, which began releasing films in 2010, only has one real hit to its name: The Woman in Black, which grossed $54.3 million earlier this year. Every other one of their releases — their repertoire includes titles like Extraordinary Measures ($12.1 million total), Beastly ($27.9 million), and The Back-Up Plan ($37.5 million) — has been a relative misfire. But The Words' $5 million bow is the lowest ever for a wide release from the studio, as is its cold $1,767 per theater average. Fortunately, the film wasn't expensive. The drama was shot for $6 million, and after a run at Sundance, CBS Films picked it up for $2 million. Audiences, which were 58 percent female and 78 percent above the age of 25, issued the title a ""B"" CinemaScore grade. Fall TV premiere dates. What airs when? For People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive Bradley Cooper, who has found huge success in The Hangover films as well as last year's thriller Limitless, The Words marks his second straight box office stinker following last month's critically panned comedy Hit and Run, which opened to just $4.7 million. Unfortunately for Cooper, one of his new movies that premiered at Toronto, The Place Beyond the Pines, wasn't exactly well received by EW's Lisa Schwarzbaum. (On the other hand, his other film at the festival, director David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook, appears to be winning some considerable early praise.) Two holdovers rounded out the Top 5. In fourth, Lionsgate's The Expendables 2 dipped 47 percent to $4.7 million, giving the action flick $75.4 million after four weekends. In fifth, Universal's The Bourne Legacy dropped 44 percent to $4 million, lifting the film's total past the $100 million mark to $103.7 million. At this point, it's clear that the $125 million sequel/reboot won't be able to match the total of the original Bourne Identity, which found $121 million in 2002. 1. The Possession -- $9.5 million . 2. Lawless -- $6.0 million . 3. The Words -- $5.0 million . 4. The Expendables 2 -- $4.7 million . 5. The Bourne Legacy -- $4.0 million . Elsewhere on the chart Summit's new wide release The Cold Light of Day opened in 13th place with a truly dismal $1.8 million from 1,511 theaters. The $25 million film, which Summit co-financed with Intrepid Pictures, has been on the shelf for a while, but the studio had to dump it somewhere — and they chose a weekend when its failure would not likely draw much attention. Audiences issued the thriller a ""D+"" CinemaScore grade. Here's hoping the film's star, Henry Cavill, fares better as Superman in 2013′s Man of Steel. The Cold Light of Day finished just a bit ahead of Paramount's one-week-only re-release Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the Lost Ark: The IMAX Experience, which whipped up $1.7 million from 267 IMAX theaters — good for a $6,461 location average. In limited release, Weinstein's much buzzed-about comedy Bachelorette, which stars Kirsten Dunst, Lizzy Caplan, and Isla Fisher as naughty party girls, fizzled with only $191,000 from 47 theaters — enough for a per theater average of $4,064. That figure doesn't merit major expansions in the weeks to come. Bachelorette's under-performance is somewhat surprising given its strong VOD performance in August. And finally, in milestone news, after a $3.3 million weekend, conservative documentary 2016: Obama's America became the second highest grossing political documentary of all time. The film, which has taken in $26.1 million so far, still trails Fahrenheit 9/11 ($119.2 million) by a huge margin, but it passed both An Inconvenient Truth ($24.1 million) and Sicko ($24.5 million) this weekend. Its total is remarkable for a documentary. Next week, Sony will put Resident Evil: Retribution into about 2,850 theaters, while Disney will re-release Finding Nemo (in 3-D) into 2,950 locations.

"(CNN) -- Italian Serie A team Roma surrendered a two-goal lead at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday as Zdenek Zeman's team were beaten 3-2 by Bologna. The home team looked to be cruising towards a second win of Zeman's second spell in charge of the club as Alessandro Florenzi and Erik Lamella put Roma 2-0 up with just 16 minutes played. But Bologna, looking for their first point of the campaign, fought back and Italian 2006 World Cup winner Alberto Gilardino pulled a goal back with 18 minutes to go. Italian international Alessandro Diamanti drew Bologna level before Gilardino scored a dramatic winner in the 90th minute. The defeat means Roma are sixth in the table with four points from three games. Defending champions Juventus maintained their 100% record at the top of the table with a battling 3-1 win over Genoa. After falling behind to Ciro Immobile's goal on 18 minutes, Juve hit back on the hour mark through forward Emanuele Giaccherini. A penalty from Montenegro's Mirko Vucinic put Juve ahead for the first time in the match with 12 minutes left to play, before Kwadwo Asamoah of Ghana completed the scoring. Napoli and Lazio are second and third respectively after both teams made it three wins from three league matches. Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani got Napoli off to the perfect start in their match with Parma by scoring a penalty with just three minutes on the clock. Macedonian Goran Pandev made it 2-0 six minutes before half time, but Marco Parolo hit back for Parma as the opening period drew to a close. Italy's Lorenzo Insigne sealed a 3-1 win for Napoli after 77 minutes. Earlier in the day Lazio secured a 3-1 victory of their own away at Chievo. Two goals from Brazilian midfielder Hernanes, on five and 74 minutes, either side of a strike from Germany striker Miroslav Klose ensured an impressive win for Vladimir Petkovic's team.","Roma surrender a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at home against Bologna .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cubans are used to the mundane inconvenience of brief, localized power outages that regularly hit the country's aging electricity grid, but the large blackout that plunged the western part of the Caribbean island into darkness Sunday night was unusual. More than 2 million residents of the capital, Havana, lost electricity, except for those at hospitals and other places with generators, a government spokesman, who was not identified per government policy, said late Sunday. Residents elsewhere in the socialist-ruled nation, including in Ciego de Avila in central Cuba, also said they didn't have any power, except for a few pockets of light. By early Monday, power began to return to homes in Havana and elsewhere after several hours of outage. The website of the state-run newspaper Trabajadores reported an outage on a 220,000-volt transmission line between Ciego de Avila and Santa Clara that affected service from Pinar del Rio -- the area on the western tip of the long, slender island -- as far east as Camaguey. The brief report late Sunday said that the incident was under investigation and that workers were trying to restore power. The streets of Havana lost electricity around 8 p.m. Residents of the capital took the outage in stride, congregating on the stoops of buildings in search of cooler air on a warm, humid night. The dark streets were quiet early Monday, save for the hum of loud generators every few blocks. Massive outages on this scale are rare in Cuba, unless a big storm passes over the island. Weather reports for Havana indicated partly cloudy conditions on Sunday night with temperatures in the high 70s. Temperatures were forecast to hover around 90 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday.","NEW: Power begins to return to Havana and other areas early Monday .

"(CNN) -- When a website that claims more than a half-billion monthly visitors gets hacked, users pay attention. So when we wrote Thursday about hackers who published login information for more than 450,000 Yahoo users, readers had plenty to say about it. Dozens of your comments hovered around a central theme: Who still uses Yahoo anyway? Selendis said: ""hmmm, I may be on that list. except that it would be so old, the email and password wouldn't get you anywhere. have not logged into a yahoo account in years. don't even remember what email address it would have had."" Maekju80: ""I'm surprised that many people still use Yahoo. Wonder if those same users still have 8-Track tapes too?"" prelude066: ""Who still has a yahoo account? Over 50 year old white guys who haven't checked it in 6 years... "" Yahoo may not have the digital sex appeal it did back in the glory days of the '90s dotcom boom. And, to be sure, recent months have been tough on the venerable Web giant. The company cut 2,000 jobs in April as part of an overhaul by then-CEO Scott Thompson. Then, less than a month later, Thompson himself was out after the discovery that he had padded his resume with a phony college degree. But having been perhaps the Web's first major portal, Yahoo holds onto a massive worldwide base of users. Its e-mail service is the world's second-most popular, behind Microsoft's Hotmail, although Google's Gmail has been gaining big chunks of ground in recent years. Many of you blamed Yahoo for not having taken tougher security measures: . Sixnard: ""What's annoying is that there are companies who do this right, but so many other companies who aren't paying attention. Amazon, for example, assumes that their systems will be broken into despite all precautions, and it stores personal information encrypted and on separate servers so multiple break-ins and extensive correlation would be needed to obtain useful information."" They also report break-ins when they occur with full details, so anyone else who's interested can take steps to prevent further exploits. People know how to do this, they just chose not to. In a written statement Thursday, Yahoo said they were fixing the exploit the hackers used and changing the passwords of users who were hit. They said that less than 5% of the breached e-mail accounts had their active passwords attached to them. Some readers felt like the story was overblown and that hacks like this are, unfortunately, part of online life: . garyguy: ""Seems only the biggies get headlines. Actually there were new reports today that an Android forum and an Nvidia forum were also hacked. It's getting to the point where you'll need a password to use your password.""

"(CNN) -- Every remake is subjected to side-by-side comparisons and the criticism that comes along with them, but ""Sparkle"" is something of a special case. After its release in 1976, the film became revered in some African-American households and beloved by audiences. The movie centered on the characters of Sister, Sparkle and Delores, three Harlemites in the late 1950s who find the road to stardom is not at all paved in gold. Written by Joel Schumacher from a story conceived by Howard Rosenman, and directed by Sam O'Steen, to say it has achieved cult status isn't an understatement. The three sisters, each spirited in their own way, formed a singing group with help from two friends of theirs from the neighborhood and church choir: Stix, the aspiring songwriter who also had an insatiable love for Sparkle, and Levi, an up-and-coming hustler. The sisters' ascent, however, has devastating ripple effects. Screenwriter Mara Brock Akil, who penned the script for the 2012 remake and is also a co-producer, believes ""Sparkle"" owes its longevity to the heft of its story and the filmmakers' attention to detail. ""When you look at the original, especially in the context of when it was released and even throughout the years, the approach to these characters' stories, they took them seriously,"" Brock Akil said. ""They took their problems, their angst, their dreams, their hopes, their desires, their failures, seriously. They didn't have to tell jokes through it. That translates to the audience."" So when the film's director, Salim Akil, who is also her husband, pitched her the opportunity to revive ""Sparkle's"" tale, Brock Akil admits she was a bit fearful of the wrath she might incur for tweaks made to the story's original characterizations. But, she added, ""It was the fear that led me to do it."" ""I think anything that makes me feel that challenge, that's exactly where I want to be,"" Brock Akil said. ""It did give me pause, and Salim and I both were like, oh, heck no, we're not doing this. But we were driving around talking about 'What if.' ... And it was like we were already hooked and wanting to take on that challenge."" Take it on they did. For starters, Brock Akil said, she and Akil wanted to give the three sisters at the heart of the story more power. ""[Salim] wanted the women to be empowered. He thought in the original that they were a little victimized. That's one of the core changes that he wanted to make, and if that was the case, then he wanted to have me write it because I'd been writing about women in my work -- our empowerment, our vulnerabilities, our humanity and all those sorts of things, and he thought I'd do a good job with that,"" Brock Akil said. Once she moved past her initial trepidation, ""The Game"" and ""Girlfriends"" creator was excited by the possibilities. The story is now set in Detroit in 1968, and rather than do a spin on the ""rags-to-riches"" concept the original explored, the family is now a part of a thriving black middle class. Brock Akil said she and her husband, who led the charge for the new vision, re-imagined the film's mother character as an entrepreneur rather than the housekeeper named Effie who actress Mary Alice played in '76. In a role filled by the late Whitney Houston, the new ""Sparkle's"" mother, Emma, is a former R&B singer whose mistakes and trials in the music industry led her to turn away from that world and embrace the church. Emma, now a dressmaker, also has the means to ""provide a certain life, an aspirational American dream life,"" Brock Akil said, something Detroit has exemplified. ""It was hard being there knowing what a great city this was, "" Brock Akil added, ""a great American city that was thriving because of the car industry, because of Motown. It wasn't foreign for a black person to live that. ... It was very important for us [to show that]."" Although this is a period film, Brock Akil knew that this also needed to be a story for the modern woman. Instead of simply being a singer, Sparkle is now a singer/songwriter who can draw comparisons to legend Smokey Robinson. The third sister, Delores, who in the original often gave voice to the racial injustices of the time, is now focused on a future in medicine. ""The Dee character, I'm very proud of this character and the changes I've made. She got the best out of [her mother] Emma,"" Brock Akil said. ""I think that Dee is now an aspiring doctor, and music is just something fun to do."" In addition to creating more empowered female characters and setting the story in a period filled with the hope for societal changes to come, it was also important to director Akil to re-cast the movie's villain, Satin. Played by Tony King in the original, the character was a violent yet alluring high-living hustler who had no qualms about physically assaulting or verbally debasing women. Portrayed by Mike Epps in the remake, the role of Satin is now ""a bit of a commentary on how much do you sell yourself out to entertain,"" Brock Akil said. ""We made sure the Satin character got all his riches making jokes off the black community and selling it to the white community, and he's living a really wonderful life, but inside, he's torn up, he's insecure. And that energy has to come out somewhere, and unfortunately it comes out on Sister in a domestic violence way."" What of Sister, the tough-talking scene-stealer who in the original had a persistent thirst for the riches in life? ""People love Sister; you can't mess with Sister too much,"" Brock Akil said with a laugh. ""I certainly tried to answer what was motivating her, and what she was trying to do."" Adding in these details, she added, ""was a lot of fun for me, and I hope it translates to the audience. ""","Mara Brock Akil wrote the script for the remake of ""Sparkle""
She says she feared backlash from fans who loved the original .
There are some slight tweaks to the characters in the 2012 version ."

"(CNN) -- A Ugandan marathoner who won the nation's first Olympics gold medal in 40 years returned home to a hero's welcome and a check for $80,000. Stephen Kiprotich, 23, was virtually unknown in Uganda before he stunned his Kenyan challengers, who were heavily favored to win the marathon during the London Olympics. His unexpected win sparked excitement in the East African nation that won its last gold medal in the Munich Games in 1972. Throngs flooded the airport to honor Kiprotich, whose win sparked fierce pride as the nation celebrates 50 years of independence. ""I need to salute Kiprotich and those people who helped him to train,"" said President Yoweri Museveni, who had breakfast with him Wednesday at state house in Entebbe. ""This gives us morale boost to organize ourselves better."" Museveni also presented Kiprotich with a check of Ugandan shillings 200 million ($80,000), according to a statement from the president's office. He ordered the money be deposited on his account before the close of business and pledged to build a three-bedroom house for his parents in eastern Uganda. ""This medal is from God particularly now that Uganda is celebrating 50 years of independence,"" the president said. The president also pledged to provide more support to Ugandan athletes and build a high altitude training facility for future runners. Kiprotich moved to Kenya's high altitude Eldoret region to train because of lack of training facilities in his nation. The Ugandan Olympian started off the marathon by trailing behind the Kenyan duo that won silver and bronze, but finished with a big lead. After he crossed the finish line, he dropped to his knees and bowed, draped in a Ugandan flag. ""I have been dreaming, 'Can I be like John Akii-Bua?',"" Kiprotich said after winning. "" I think today I joined the champions, so I am happy."" The late Akii-Bua won Uganda's first Olympic gold four decades ago in the 400-meter hurdles.","Ugandan Stephen Kiprotich stunned Kenyan challengers, who were heavily favored to win .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador has granted Julian Assange asylum out of concern the Wikileaks founder will be politically persecuted if extradited. The decision is a victory for Assange, who is trying to avoid being extradited to Sweden and has been holed up inside Ecuador's embassy in London for nearly two months. But the bad news for Assange is that British police have refused to grant him safe passage out of the country. The British government has pledged to send Assange to Sweden to face questioning on sex crimes charges, but Ecuador's foreign minister says if Assange is sent to Sweden, he could then be extradited to the United States to face charges of espionage or treason. More: Ecuador grants Assange asylum . Assange and his supporters say a U.S. grand jury is weighing charges against him. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that the Justice Department has an ""active, ongoing criminal investigation"" into the WikiLeaks disclosure of classified U.S. diplomatic documents. CNN spoke to Paul Whiteway, an ex-British diplomat of more than 30 years and now director of the Independent Diplomat advisory group in London, about where the Assange situation is heading. CNN: Can Assange leave London? Paul Whiteway: The fact Ecuador has granted political asylum to Assange doesn't actually make any real difference. Clearly he is not in Ecuador, he is in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and for the time being he is able to remain there without being arrested. But he can't get to Ecuador without leaving the embassy without being arrested, so in a sense, it's a standoff. CNN: Could Assange escape by car or by plane? Whiteway: It's very unlikely. The embassy only occupies a part of the building, and is not a compound embassy, which has a car park inside it. Vehicles belonging to the embassy enjoy a degree of immunity, so if it was a compound embassy, he could get into the car, which could in theory take him out of the building. But at some point it would have to stop, and he would have to get out of the car and into an airplane, whereupon he would be arrested. But Ecuador's is not a compound embassy, so as soon as he steps out the door he is liable to be arrested. More: Of all countries, why choose Ecuador? Immunity would in theory apply to an Ecuadorian airplane, but that plane would have to have permission to land that the British government would not give. It's really hard to see how that could work. Also, that sort of subterfuge would be regarded as such a blatant disregarding of the convention on diplomatic relations that the bilateral relationship between Britain and Ecuador would mean even further damage to Ecuador's interests in the UK. More: Timeline of Assange's extradition battle . CNN: Is there anything British police can do? Whiteway: All they can do is wait and watch. In theory the foreign secretary could make use of a 1987 act of Parliament to end to the inviolability of the Ecuadorian embassy, but this would take authorities into a gray area. Theoretically, this legislation is to be invoked in cases connected to public safety, national security, or town and country planning. Clearly Assange fits into none of those categories, and it's unlikely the British police will be going into the embassy anytime soon. CNN: Is there a precedent for marching into another country's embassy? Whiteway: While authorities could theoretically test the 1987 law, I can't think of any instance in this country where a government entered the premises of a mission (embassy) without permission from the head of the mission. The reasons for that are clear: Britain doesn't want to have itself in a situation where foreign governments can just march into its embassies overseas and arrest people. Diplomatic relations are established on the basis of reciprocity, and that is very important. CNN: How have Britain and Ecuador handled the Assange issue? Whiteway: In Britain, I suspect that in the Foreign Office there may be a slight sense of regret that they included a paragraph in their letter (to Ecuador) about the 1987 law (informing officials they had the legal wherewithal to enter the embassy and take Assange), because clearly it stung the Ecuadorians in a way. More: Why Assange's own country won't intervene . But I think it was always going to be a long haul to get this issue resolved, given that President Rafael Correa is quite sympathetic to what Julian Assange stands for; given that he had already been on the record publicly saying he was in favour of granting Assange asylum. It was always going to be difficult for him to walk away from that without losing face. CNN: Can Assange stay in the embassy forever? Whiteway: I don't think Mr. Assange is going to be going anywhere, let alone Ecuador, for the time being. There was the case in Hungary of the bishop who sought refuge in the U.S. embassy for 15 years, so some cases can take literally years to resolve. CNN: What will the atmosphere be like in the embassy? Whiteway: I'm sure they will have made him as comfortable as possible in the circumstances as they possible can. But it's a big distraction from their day job, and it's awkward having someone who's not on the diplomatic staff actually inside your embassy for any length of time, let alone for periods of months, so there is a price to pay from the embassy's point of view.

"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korean officials will meet with football's world governing body, FIFA, Thursday amid speculation that they will lobby for a player stripped of his Olympic bronze medal for displaying a politically-charged banner. The Korean Football Association (KFA) said Park Jongwoo did not receive his medal after his team's win over Japan during the London Games at the request of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which prohibits political statements by competitors. The message backed Seoul in its sovereignty dispute with Japan over an island chain known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese. South Korean singer swims into island dispute . The KFA declined to comment on the details and purpose of Thursday's meeting in Zurich, but South Korean media are reporting that the association's general secretary, Kim Joo-sung, is meeting with FIFA officials to discuss Park's case. FIFA has taken over the investigation into the incident at the request of the IOC, an official from the KFA told CNN. He declined to be named. The official said it was still unclear whether Park would receive his medal, though he insisted the player's actions were unintentional. ""As you can see from photos, a fan was holding the sign during the match and Park got it from the fan,"" he said. Many in South Korea have criticized the decision, with the English-language paper The Korea Times asking whether the IOC had overreacted. The country's sports minister even revealed Park would be exempted from compulsory military service -- a benefit usually accorded to Olympic medal winners in South Korea. ""Our military law... says those who win third place or above at the Olympic Games will be exempted from the service, and it never mentions an actual medal,"" Choe Kwang-Shik said in an interview with TV Chosun channel, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse (AFP). ""He won the third place in Olympics football... as part of a team,"" Choe added. The Park incident comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and South Korea over the islands. Last week, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited the tiny islands in the Sea of Japan, while Japan recalled its ambassador to South Korea and threatened to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice. Dokdo /Takeshima is one of several of disputed island chains in the region and fears are emerging that competing territorial claims in the South China Sea further south could create a new Cold War in Asia. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have claims in the area and tensions have risen in recent months. CNN's Katie Hunt contributed to this report.","South Korean officials will meet with football's governing body, FIFA, Thursday in Zurich .

"(Mashable) -- Facebook will launch its long-awaited iPad app at Apple's iPhone 5 launch event on October 4, Mashable has learned. In addition to the iPad app, Facebook is also expected to release a revamped version of its iPhone app and may unveil an HTML5-based mobile app marketplace. The Facebook iPad app, which leaked earlier this year, has been in limbo at Facebook for the past few months. That much was made clear in a blog post Monday by former Facebook engineer Jeff Verkoeyen. In that post, he revealed that he left the company (for Google) partially because Facebook has been sitting on the completed app since May. The problem, according to two sources familiar with the situation, has been a combination of timing and a strained relationship with Apple. It's no secret that the two companies have been at odds over various issues during the past two years. For example, the social network pulled the plug on Facebook Connect in Ping because Apple didn't give Facebook any warning about the feature, which would have eaten a great deal of bandwidth on Facebook's side. We've also heard rumors that Facebook was supposed to be integrated into iOS. This was meant to happen years ago, but disagreements on both sides eventually led to Apple integrating Twitter into iOS 5. The relationship between the two technology giants is warming up, however, thanks to the shared goal of beating Google -- and the simple fact that Facebook and Apple may need each other. The former doesn't have a mobile platform while Apple doesn't have a social platform. The culmination of this renewed friendship: the launch of Facebook for iPad at Apple's iPhone 5 media event. At this event, our sources also expect Facebook to unveil a new version of Facebook for the iPhone, with design and speed improvements that mimic the iPad app. Facebook has also been working on a project to bring the Facebook Platform to mobile devices. The project, labeled ""Project Spartan"" by some (a name not used internally at Facebook, according to one of our sources), is designed to be a platform where developers can bring their Facebook apps to mobile devices via an HTML5 platform. What we're hearing is that Apple is actually working with Facebook on perfecting the HTML5 platform. This could also launch at Apple's upcoming iPhone event, though our sources wouldn't commit to a specific launch date for the platform. Facebook decided not to launch it at f8, as it didn't want to water down the announcement of the new Facebook Open Graph and Timeline. When we said last week that Facebook would be profoundly changed, we weren't just referring to the new Facebook Open Graph and the ""frictionless sharing"" touted by Mark Zuckerberg. We were also talking about its secretive effort to become a mobile platform for the social web. And thanks to Apple, it looks like that effort is about to come to fruition. We've reached out to Apple and Facebook for comment. Mashable's Jennifer Van Grove contributed to this report. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"Oceanside, New York (CNN) -- Deployed to a volatile outpost in southern Afghanistan where U.S. Marines routinely face a mix of skirmishes and hidden explosives, Greg Buckley Jr. sensed that an attack was imminent. And he knew that it would come from within. The 21-year-old Marine was posted to Garmsir in Helmand Province, where he was training local security forces as part of NATO's planned withdrawal in 2014. It was during a static-filled phone call to his father over the summer that the Long Island native mentioned a run-in he had with an Afghan trainee while on guard duty. NATO releases details of brazen raid on base in Afghanistan . The encounter was the first in which the Buckley family's eldest son seemed to sense something was wrong, according to what he told his family in phone conversations and a letter. ""The guy turned around and said to Greg, 'We don't want you here. We don't need you here,'"" his dad said. ""Greg turned around again and said, 'Why would you say that?'"" according to Greg Buckley Sr. But the trainee apparently wouldn't relent, repeating the phrases for hours over the course of a night in which the young Marine was on guard watch. ""Greg said, 'I thought I was going to lose my mind,'"" his father said. ""Pitch black out, and all he kept saying over and over again is, 'We don't want you. We don't need you. We don't want you.'"" ""It was just tormenting for him."" The two men then finally confronted each other, yelling until a group of officers separated them, he told his father. ""One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy,"" said the elder Buckley. The 21-year-old agreed and extended his hand, but the man refused. About a month later, Greg phoned his father again. ""He told me if I have to stay here until November... I'm not going to come home."" Greg also asked his father to prepare to tell his mother and his two younger brothers that he'd be killed. ""I don't understand,"" his father said. ""Out in the field?' ""No, in our base,"" Greg replied. 4 NATO troops killed in 'insider' attack in Afghanistan . On August 10, 2012, Greg Buckley Jr. was gunned down by the very forces he had been training, just days after learning that he was to head home early. ""It was only two days he had left there in Afghanistan,"" his father told CNN. The phenomenon is known as ""green-on-blue,"" due to a color-coding system used by NATO. It has become disturbingly more frequent in Afghanistan, with more than 50 NATO troops killed this year by local forces, the first time that's happened in a single year in the U.S.-led war. Last year, 35 people died in such insider attacks, and even less the year before, according to NATO figures. The killings have prompted suspensions of training new recruits while eroding the trust between NATO and its Afghan allies. The gunman involved in Greg's death attacked from inside his outpost and killed two other fellow Marines, his dad said. But Greg Sr. said his son had informed his superior officers that ""one day they are going turn around and turn those weapons on us."" CNN cannot independently confirm that Greg informed superior officers. Calls and emails to NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan were not immediately returned. More than a decade after the war began, the Buckley family is now struggling to cope with the loss of its eldest son. More than 2,000 other U.S. service members have been killed in Operation Enduring Freedom. ""It's not really day-by-day,"" said Greg's mother, Marina Buckley. ""It's more minute-by-minute."" Back in Oceanside, the Buckley family on Friday attended the town's first home football game, where their fallen son had intended to watch his youngest brother play varsity for the first time. ""Greg was supposed to be home for this game,"" said Justin, 17, who wore the number 30 on his back, Greg's old basketball number. ""I would tell him I love him and I miss him."" The senior running back, who donned a camouflage jersey along with his team, broke to the outside on Friday for a 25-yard score that helped cement the Sailors' improbable second-half comeback against top-ranked East Meadow. After crossing into the end zone, Justin raised his hand to salute -- honoring his fallen brother.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland Wednesday after the recurrence of a bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said. The 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh first suffered the problem in June. He has been admitted for ""investigation and treatment"" and is likely to remain in hospital for the next few days, the palace said. The Duke of Edinburgh was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, the palace said earlier. He was staying at the royal residence in Balmoral, Scotland, where the queen traditionally spends part of the summer, UK media reports said. Prince Philip's life in pictures . Prince Philip has suffered a couple of health scares in the past year. Prior to the bladder infection, which Prince Philip contracted in early June, during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery. However, he appeared in good form earlier this week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. The queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also gave a garden party at Balmoral Castle last week. Philip's next scheduled public appearance is alongside the queen as she opens the London 2012 Paralympic Games on August 29. He also appeared by her side at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games at the end of July and accompanied her on a visit to the Olympic Park as the events got under way. It has been a particularly busy year for the queen and Duke Of Edinburgh because of the many events held to celebrate her diamond jubilee. Prince Philip: The man behind the queen . Addressing parliament in March, the queen paid tribute to her husband as ""a constant strength and guide"" throughout her long reign. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 in Westminster Abbey. Born the prince of Greece and Denmark on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921, Philip left Greece with his family when he was 18 months old after King Constantine was forced to abdicate the throne following a revolution. The family moved to Paris and then to England in 1928. Philip also went to school in Germany. Philip renounced his Greek title when he became a naturalized British subject in 1947.

"(CNN) -- America has not resolved how to deal with Iran's nuclear program. As foreign policy issues soar in the next presidential race, it is time to search for substantive answers. U.S. policies to contain Iran's nuclear program suffer from wishful thinking. Tightened sanctions and an open war option against Iran have failed to alter its behavior. They fail to grasp how fierce Iran is. Iran's revolutionaries see sanctions as a blessing in disguise. Oddly, sanctions build a degree of political unity in Iran. Its political factions agree on retaining nuclear enrichment capacity despite other highly divisive political disagreements. Under sanctions, Iran is more self-dependent. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Iran is increasing enriching uranium to 20 percent grade levels. If true, and the fuel is produced in abundance, it has potential military dimensions. Sanctions have made Iran more enterprising too. The Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has deployed quite a few tactics to circumvent sanctions. Sanctions validate Iran's embattled mindset. Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei says he will not shun war if it is the price to pay to reject the U.S. The average beleaguered Iranian is content enough knowing life goes on in war times. After all, Iran lived through one of the longest wars in the 20th Century, fighting Iraq in the 1980s. The war threats have also made Iran clear about its objectives. IRGC says it will not differentiate between Israeli and U.S. targets if Iran were attacked by either. It believes Iranian troops will have a far better chance of combat survival in a vast regional battle ground which they get to define. War threats have also made Iran deceptively good at demoralizing the enemy. Iran does not believe it will be attacked because American forces are war-weary after Iraq and Afghanistan. Israel will likely not strike as long as it is surrounded by hostile Islamist forces in Gaza, Egypt, Jordan and Syria. In the rest of the Arab world, it is hard to find sympathy for Israel's cause of killing the Iranian nuclear program while it retains a military nuclear strategy. Clearly, Iran's Islamic revolution frequently fails to grasp the depth of troubles it faces by being so defiant. It likes to hedge that regional events will work in its favor as other Islamist forces rise to challenge Israel and the U.S. It also hedges that its indefinite tolerance for suffering, the result of the Persian Shia belief system, will work in its favor when it faces impatient demands by the U.S. to change course. The U.S. is also hedging like Iran, but with a different set of tools. It hedges that sanctions and war threats will contain Iran. And when it seems otherwise, it calls for time for sanctions to take effect while postponing the war option. Washington believes a deal with Iran could be made, but it is confused how. It believes in engaging Iran by using a stick, admits Iran's big trade partners Russia and China do not support sanctions, then urges staunch Iranian allies like the Lebanese government to respect sanctions. Hedging leads to self-deception. It deceived Iran into accelerating a controversial nuclear program believing that it is a price worth paying. It deceived Washington to overstate the imminence of Israeli military action against Iran, and Iran's hostile intents towards Israel. Numerous Israeli officials speak against attacking Iran, and provocative Iranian statements are calculated risks to keep Israel on its toes. Whether in an Obama or a Romney administration, Washington must cease hedging and stick to the basics. The road begins by admitting that if Iran acquires know-how to build a nuclear bomb, it won't be the first time the U.S. failed to prevent a developing country from becoming a nuclear state. A nuclear Iran, even if it acquired weapons capability, should not define the end-game. Washington should avoid missing the forest for the trees. It should recognize that convincing Iran not to build a bomb might be easier by engaging it. Iran's current strategic military doctrine rejects the use of weapons of mass destruction. By the end of the road, Washington should set a mutually agreed deadline with Iran to arrive at a win-win solution. It should also assure Israel that its safety is guaranteed. This can be done by engaging Israel and Iran's Arab neighbors in a region-wide initiative on the future of non-proliferation in the Middle East while talks with Iran carry on. Sanctions should roll back, with Israel and Arab state endorsements, if Iran makes tangible progress in talks. Washington should demand that Iran's leaders silence revolutionary pessimists and special interest groups that do not think a thaw in Iranian-U.S. ties is possible or warranted. U.S. leadership to engage with Iran is crucial now more than ever. Good leadership requires clear vision and achievable objectives. Then soon enough, the Iranians will do quick math. If being friendly with the U.S. is more lucrative than being hostile, they will choose the former over the latter.","Keynoush: Both U.S. and Iran are missing opportunities to benefit from nuclear talks .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Apple halted sales of its iPhone 4S in Beijing and Shanghai on Friday after scuffles broke out over a delayed launch of the device, sending a shopper hurling eggs at one of its stores in the capital. Hundreds of devout fans -- along with scalpers -- braved subfreezing temperatures and camped out overnight, awaiting the phone's debut near the trendy Sanlitun Village shopping mall in Beijing. As dawn broke Friday, the mood turned sour when the store's doors remained shut beyond 7 a.m., when the sale was scheduled to start. ""Open! Open!"" people chanted and booed at the employees inside. After the scuffle, the bad news came via a megaphone that the phone would be unavailable at this Apple Store on its first day of sale. A large contingent of police officers arrived and put yellow tape around the plaza. Dozens of police and guards slowly pushed people out of the perimeter, dragging away those who resisted, despite their screaming protests. The tech giant -- based in Cupertino, California -- said it is halting sales in Beijing and Shanghai for customers' safety. It launched the iPhone 4S in mainland China on Friday. ""The demand for iPhone 4S has been incredible, and our stores in China have already sold out,"" the company said in a statement. ""Unfortunately we were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd, and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, iPhone will not be available in our retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai for the time being."" Apple has seen phenomenal sales growth in mainland China and opened Asia's largest Apple Store in Shanghai in September. The company announced in July that its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, reached $8.8 billion for the first three quarters of the fiscal year, a more than sixfold increase compared with the same period in the previous year. While many in the crowd criticized Apple for not opening the store when it said it would, others turned nationalistic, blasting the United States in general. The plaza was soon cleared, leaving iPhone fans standing outside the police tape as a giant screen teased them with Apple commercials.","An Apple store in a trendy Beijing district fails to open amid unruly crowds .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese court adjourned the public trial Tuesday of a police chief who triggered one of China's biggest political scandals in decades by famously seeking refuge in a U.S. consulate in February. The verdict will be announced at a later date along with sentencing, court officials told reporters after the trial. Court proceedings ended after five hours of public hearing Tuesday, following a one-day trial held in secret Monday due to the confidential nature of the information, officials said. Wang, 52, is facing four charges of defection, bribe-taking, abuse of power and ""bending the law for selfish ends."" Wang didn't contest the charges, court officials said. Until February, Wang was considered the right-hand man of disgraced politician Bo Xilai, once considered among Communist royalty and a fast-rising star within the party destined for the highest office of the country. Read more: The downfall of Bo Xilai . After being suddenly dismissed as police chief, Wang spectacularly sought refuge for one day inside the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information against his boss. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, poisoned and killed Neil Heywood, a British businessman and Bo family friend, last November amid a financial dispute. She was convicted of murder in August and given a suspended death sentence. According to the state-run news agency Xinhua Tuesday, prosecutors said Wang knew ""perfectly well"" that Gu was suspected of murder, but deliberately covered up for her so she would not be held legally responsible for Heywood's death. Four high-ranking police officers who once worked under Wang were convicted of covering up the Heywood murder and received prison sentences ranging from five to 11 years. Another former top deputy of Wang was recently arrested and accused of taking bribes. A court official told reporters Tuesday that Wang's defense team argued that he provided useful evidence in securing Gu's conviction. They also pointed out that he left the U.S. consulate voluntarily and on those grounds appealed for leniency in his sentencing. According to Xinhua, prosecutors also accused Wang of using ""technical reconnaissance measures"" against ""many people on multiple occasions, either without the approval of authorities or by forging approval documents."" They alleged his acts ""severely undermined the socialist rule of law"" and ""infringed citizens' legitimate rights and interests."" Prosecutors also alleged Wang took advantage of his position as police chief to accept bribes and property worth more than 3.05 million yuan (U.S. $484,127) in return for ""securing benefits"" for other people, though Xinhua did not report what those benefits were. On the defection charge, prosecutors said Wang, as a holder of state secrets, ""left his position without authorization and defected to another country's consulate while he was performing his official duty."" Wang's decision to flee to the U.S. consulate in February threw the Communist Party into crisis mode by threatening to expose ructions within the leading Party just months away from a once-in-a-decade leadership change. Read more: Disgraced Party chief looms large over leadership . Censors moved into overdrive to silence public speculation about why Wang had fled and what it had to do with Bo, then a popular politician and contender for China's Politburo Standing Committee, the nine-member team that effectively rules the country. In April, two months after Wang fled, the government announced that Bo was being stripped of his leadership positions for ""serious breach of party discipline."" He has not been seen publicly since. Wang headed the police department of Chongqing, a sprawling southwestern metropolis with more than 30 million residents, during most of the period when Bo was the local party chief from late 2007 to early this year. Wang's indictment quoted by Xinhua did not mention Bo, but prosecutors alleged that the former police official ""illegally used technical surveillance measures."" Analysts say the accusation may reflect rumors that Wang had bugged other senior officials to benefit Bo politically. Bo, 63, a charismatic albeit controversial politician, launched a ""smashing black, singing red"" campaign in Chongqing that promoted Communist ideology as zealously as it cracked down on organized crime. His economic programs, which included millions spent on social welfare, made him a popular leader in Chongqing. But analysts say his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform-oriented faction that dominated the current party leadership. Bo and Wang were known to have worked closely on Bo's signature crime-fighting program in 2009. In just 10 months, Chongqing police arrested almost 5,000 people and executed more than a dozen. Wang was taken into custody once he left the consulate for entering the diplomatic post without authorization. Analysts say his gambit forced China to deal with the scandal with an unprecedented level of transparency, prodded along by social media. It is now rumored that the 18th Communist Party Congress, a meeting where a new generation of leaders is expected to be unveiled, will be held in the middle of next month. The current leadership under President Hu Jintao is trying to resolve the Bo affair before its once-in-a-decade power transition, according to Joseph Fewsmith, an international relations professor at Boston University and a longtime China watcher. ""There was a desire on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to get this case settled,"" he said. ""It's not yet, but it is out of the party and into the hands of criminal courts -- well before the 18th Party Congress."" The conviction rate for criminal trials in China stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report quoted the Chinese Supreme People's Court as saying.","NEW: Trial ends for former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun .

"(CNN) -- An undocumented immigrant who was shackled during labor will be allowed to seek legal status under a special visa that can be conferred to crime victims, a federal judge ruled this week. Juana Villegas, who previously won $200,000 in a lawsuit against the Tennessee sheriff's office involved in the incident, was also awarded $1.1 million in lawyers' fees and other expenses. ""It's a big victory for Mrs. Villegas,"" said Elliott Ozment, her attorney, about the Thursday ruling from U.S. District Judge William Haynes Jr. Ozment said his client -- a Mexican national -- will pursue a U-visa, a status that can be given to victims of crimes who are in the country illegally. The final decision rests with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Karen West, a spokeswoman for the Davidson County Sheriff's Office stressed the ruling may not be the last word. ""We disagree that she (Villegas) was a victim and the certification is not a resolution of the case, which is still being appealed,"" she said. Villegas' story began on July 3, 2008, when she was nine months pregnant and driving home with her other children from a doctor's appointment in metro Nashville, Tennessee. A police officer pulled her over and, according to Villegas' complaint, decided to arrest her for driving without a license because the officer suspected she was in the country illegally. The decision to arrest her was influenced by a controversial agreement between the police department and the federal government that allowed local officers to help enforce immigration laws, known as section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. She was transported to a detention center, where two days later, she went into labor. According to court documents, Villegas was taken to Nashville General Hospital where she was placed on a gurney with her hands and feet shackled. Once in her hospital room, two Davidson County sheriff's deputies refused to leave the room while she changed into her hospital gown, and unplugged her phone so she couldn't alert her husband about her labor, court documents say. Afterwards, one of the deputies shackled her left foot and right hand to the hospital bed, something that the medical staff called a ""barbaric"" violation of medical standards, court records state. The shackles were removed before she delivered the baby. After she had delivered the baby, and against doctor's orders, a third deputy shackled her to the bed again, according to the court documents. The sheriff's department's policies that led the deputies to shackle her throughout the ordeal were a violation of the U.S. and Tennessee constitutions, her lawyers argued. The sheriff's office said its deputies followed established procedures and accepted practices. Early last year, Judge Haynes ruled in favor of Villegas, and after a three-day trial in August, the jury set the $200,000 award. Villegas had once been deported from San Diego and returned illegally to the United States, and had lived here for years, her lawyer said. At the time of her arrest, her eldest son was 14, and he had been born in the United States. Villegas is married with five children. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","A judge rules that Juana Villegas can seek a U-visa .

"(CNN) -- Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade says he felt numb as a child when he watched his mother inject herself with heroin. ""My mom didn't know I had seen her shoot up,"" he said. Jolinda Wade managed to overcome her addiction. But her son's new book, ""A Father First: How My Life Became Bigger Than Basketball,"" offers his perspective on her drug use for the first time. His mother says that seeing the story through her son's eyes was emotional for her. ""My precious boy saw me with the needle in my arm,"" she said from Chicago. ""There were a lot of things that we had not talked about that they had seen."" The book jumps from Wade's tumultuous childhood with his sister on the south side of Chicago to his more recent past, when the 30-year-old NBA star was awarded joint custody of his two sons after a bitter court battle with his ex-wife. He credits his older sister, Tragil, with helping shield him from the trauma of his mother's addiction. She took 10-year-old Dwyane to live with his father, Dwyane Wade Sr., in Robbins, Illinois, away from the drug deals and police raids he had grown accustomed to. ""My father stepped up,"" Wade said. ""I'm successful today because my father stepped up."" A whole new ball game: Wade's soccer admission . Wade's talent also helped him emerge from his turbulent early life to become one of professional basketball's most prominent players. After leading the Marquette University Golden Eagles to the Final Four, he entered the NBA as the No. 5 draft pick in 2003. Now a guard for the Miami Heat, he has helped his team win two NBA championships. But his mother's transformation is arguably more remarkable than her son's. Jolinda Wade, 57, is now a pastor in Chicago -- and drug-free. She runs the church New Creation Binding and Loosing Ministries and the community center Barrier Breakdown Transformed, which caters to people in need. The community center serves as a safe haven for children affected by Chicago's teacher strike. ""I'm able to give people hope,"" she said. One of the most poignant parts of her son's book comes when he tells his mother that she's still his favorite girl -- even when she is in the throes of her addiction. Now, Wade said, ""We have a great relationship."" She has eight grandchildren ranging in age from 1 to 21, including Wade's sons, Zaire, 10, and Zion, 5. That mom appeal is helping diversify Wade's fan base. At a recent book signing at the public library in downtown Atlanta, there was a strong contingent of women amid a sea of young men and boys clad in Miami Heat jerseys. Alice Doanes, who just celebrated her 71st birthday in August, was one of them. She is a mother, a grandmother, a retired teacher and an ardent Wade fan. She stood in the line that wrapped around the block, clutching her copy of ""A Father First,"" hoping to get her picture taken with the NBA star. ""I always admired him, because he looked like a clean-cut guy."" She had a long wait ahead of her: Fans said they had been standing in line for several hours. Wade can count his favorite girl among the book's fans. Even with its candid account of his childhood, Jolinda Wade said, ""I love the book.""","Basketball star Dwyane Wade's new book addresses his mother's drug addiction .

"(CNN) -- September 12 is always the day that reminds us that the war may never end. September 11, each year, is the day for somber commemoration and prayers for those who were lost.  September 11 is the date that lives in history. But as each September 12 dawns -- this year on Sunday -- we realize anew that the uncertain slog continues, that the year ahead will be one in which unseen and hazily defined enemies continue to wish ill on a United States that, in 2001, dedicated itself to a war on terror. Most wars eventually come to a close. This one, by its very nature, will not. One evening in the weeks after September 11, 2001, I was having dinner with John Glenn.  There is no American who has had the life that Glenn has: a World War II Marine fighter pilot who flew 59 combat missions, and who then returned to the skies in the Korean War to fly 90 more; the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth and the greatest national hero of his era; a United States senator for 24 years; at age 77 the oldest man ever to leave the Earth's bounds as he returned to space aboard the shuttle Discovery. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, with an injured and angry country hungry for retaliation and victory, Glenn, who had turned 80, was realizing something before most people did. ""All the other wars we had,"" he said, ""the object was to win the battlefield. Use tanks, use planes, take their capital, and declare victory. War's over. ""But this. . .this is like the wind. This is like fighting the wind. . . .You can hit them, but they'll pop up somewhere else.  This doesn't seem to be the kind of war where you can look forward to them signing a surrender on the battleship Missouri."" He was referring to the end of World War II. America's involvement in that war began on December 7, 1941, and ended less than four years later on the September day in 1945 when Japan signed its surrender aboard the Missouri in Tokyo Bay.  By the ninth anniversary of the beginning of World War II, the victory had long since been won; the surviving soldiers were home and raising families; the terrible times were all past tense. Nine years after the war on terror began, though, there is no end in sight, and even if there was, who exactly could sign a surrender?  In the first days of the war on terror, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, perhaps inadvertently, put his finger on it.  Speaking to reporters, he said: . ""I've therefore characterized this conflict, this campaign, this so-called war, as being notably different from others."" This so-called war. Nine years ago the country went into what we were told was wartime footing. But unless you were a member of a family with a son or daughter, a father or mother, a brother or sister serving in the military, here at home it wasn't always easy to figure out precisely what that entailed. Nine years ago, the National Guard moved into U.S. airports when the terminals finally reopened to passengers; the Guard's saturation presence ended soon enough. Curbside baggage check-in was done away with because federal officials believed it provided an opportunity for terrorists; that decision, too, was soon reversed as the airlines complained that it was hurting their business.  The nation seemed uncertain of the appropriate rules in this new kind of war. It is largely forgotten now, but there were serious suggestions that salad bars be shut down because they were convenient targets for terrorists wanting to poison the citizenry. For a while a phrase from World War II -- ""for the duration"" -- re-entered the language, but that, too, soon disappeared when it became evident that the duration would most likely have no endpoint. Life went on even as the war went on. Last week, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey reported that 67 percent of Americans now believe that it is unlikely that the United States will ever capture or kill Osama bin Laden.  The subject of his capture, once a part of daily civilian conversations, seems to have been increasingly pushed aside. And so as another September 12 arrives we enter the tenth year of a war like no other.  Few among us would be optimistic enough -- or foolish enough -- to declare that placid times are just around the corner on this planet we all share. The anger in the world, especially during weeks like the one just past, does not feel as if it has cooled.  When the rhetorical heat becomes especially fervid,  I think of something else that John Glenn told me during that dinner. He was remembering the day in 1962 when he had looked out the window of a capsule hurtling through blackness and took in a sight that no American eyes had ever seen: the Earth, from the vantage point of space orbit. He recalled his thoughts with a combination of wonder and sadness. ""You look down,"" Glenn said, ""and you think about all the borders you fly over.  You fly by those borders so quickly, and you think of all the things that people do to each other because of those borders."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","After commemorating 9/11, we realize war against terror never ends, says Bob Greene .

"(EW.com) -- Tonight, Discovery counts down Shark Week's 25 Best Bites (10 p.m. ET), and Emmy-winning wildlife cameraman and apex predator expert Andy Casagrande, who's worked on 13 Shark Week specials, will have been involved in at least two of them. Here, he tells us how he's able to free-dive with great whites, what we should do if we find ourselves swimming with a curious one (swim toward it?!), and the story of why he was once chased to the surface by a 10-footer. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: You're known for getting outside the cage with great whites so you can capture angles TV audiences haven't seen a million times before. How do you tell if sharks, in general, aren't in the mood to be filmed? ANDY CASAGRANDE: The smaller sharks will arch their back, drop their fins, and swim in weird postures. If you don't have experience with sharks, you might not read those signs. They'll get close to you, dart away, and then come back — mock charges where they're essentially trying to scare you or let you know, hey, I'm pissed off, and if you keep swimming at me with your camera, I'm gonna bite you or whatever I can bite. It's relatively obvious. Great whites are easy. They're built like pit bulls on steroids. They can bend their fins here and there, but their way of showing they're angry is they open and close their mouth. So they just show you the jaws sign. They swim right at you and gape. EW: So a great white is swimming at you opening and closing its mouth. What do you do? Casagrande: You can't swim away immediately because then you're acting like prey and they're like, oh, cool. That's something I'm gonna eat. The best thing that I've found to do sounds counterintuitive, but you swim right at them. You always keep eye contact, and you swim directly at the shark, and that seems to trigger a defense mechanism. Now they're like, wait a second, everything in the ocean swims away from me aside from orcas, which are known to occasionally kill white sharks. Everyone says punch a shark in the nose: the problem with that is that water refracts and magnifies things, so if you go to punch a shark in the nose and you think its nose is right here, it's not, it's back here, and as you follow through, your hand goes straight into its mouth. Their eyes and their gills are the most sensitive things. But the reality is, if you don't act like prey, they won't treat you like prey. You don't want to swim away while they're watching you. As they swim away, you swim away, and try to get back on the boat, open up a Red Bull, say, 'Oh, that was fun,' and downplay it. EW: Your website has a shot of a great white face-to-face with you, with just your camera separating you. How often does that happen? Casagrande: Whether it's the electronics in the camera or the fact that they're just really inquisitive, they almost always swim straight up to the camera and either bump it with their snout, or, the more investigative ones, decide to bite it. I've said before it's like you're eating a bowl of spaghetti and you accidentally bite down on your fork. Most sane people don't try to continue to bite through that fork and swallow it. They immediately let go and realize wow, that's something that's not natural for me to eat, so they don't eat it. EW: What's the most dangerous situation you've found yourself in over the years. Casagrande: I try not to tell it. I had one situation [filming 2010's Into the Shark Bite] where I was essentially running out of air, and I had to go to the surface, and I was out of the cage with great whites. Like I said, if you swim away from them, they pursue you. I was breaking my own rule of don't act like prey or they'll treat you like prey. I had one relatively curious juvenile great white, and the juveniles are like puppy dogs. They want to swim up and put their paws on everything. The bigger ones, they've been around. They know what boats are. They know what people are. They're cautious, and that's the reason why they've gotten so big. They're mature enough to understand that they're not the only dangerous thing out there. But this little shark, it didn't really want to come and play with me either — it seemed like it wanted to bite me. I was interacting with it on the bottom, and it kept coming up doing the mock charging and bumping into the camera, and I'd bump it, and it'd swim away and come back. Well, I bumped it one last time, and I started to swim up. It was swimmin' away, but it knew that I was swimming up, so it immediately turned around. It was the first time I actually witnessed a great white stalking and then attempting an ambush vertical approach from underwater. I saw this little shark — little as in, like, a 10-footer — coming up at me, and I saw its little white chin wagging. It was accelerating toward me. I'm like... uh, holy s—. I just relied on my standard instinct of using the camera, keeping the camera between me and the shark. The shark came up with its mouth open, and as I finned back, it sort of went past me and I hit it on the side on its gills. That time, when I hit its gills, it seemed to finally respond like, s—, that thing is dangerous. So it swam down. I kept an eye on it and kept finning, and I saw it circling back again. They're just like teenagers. They don't really know any better, and they're really curious. But when a great white shark is curious, it can be catastrophic. Luckily, I was able to get back to the boat, drink my Red Bull, and everything was cool. That is one thing that happens: When you get really caught up when you're filming and you're getting amazing stuff, especially on the bottom, you can forget about your air supply. Once again, it wasn't really the shark that put me in danger, it was myself. I was running out of air and created this predator-prey relationship where I became the prey and the shark just gave chase. If I didn't run out of air, I could have slowly ascended. The shark would have come up, circled around me, bumped some more. If you do things slowly and methodically, they respond that way as well. If you have to kick up because you're running out of air and you're freaked out now because he's coming after you... EW: I now want to see that footage. Casagrande: I was filming. On my camera, it's not as impressive as if someone was filming what was happening. Underwater, you don't zoom a lot, because when you zoom, it flattens the image and it doesn't look good. So when you're with great whites, you're always really wide because they're massive animals and they come right up to the lens all the time. EW: Did you have another diver with you that day? Casagrande: I did have Mark Addison [an expert on South Africa's shark diving sites] with me. There was another situation that happened with Mark, just before this. Mark saw the shark f—ing with me, and Mark swam over and was trying to tell the shark, like, chill out. But Mark is scuba diving. He doesn't have a camera, he's got nothing in his hands. I might have this shot somewhere: The shark swims up at Mark. Mark swims at the shark like I was saying you do. But instead of backing down, the shark just keeps swimming. The shark is opening his mouth and all Mark can do is [makes motion like you're pressing yourself flat against a wall] as the shark goes by. If he would have put his hands out, the shark would have bit his hands. So I did have Mark, but Mark is a crazy f—ing person. I'm a bit of a dare-devil, but I don't want to win a Darwin Award. Like if my family can read my obituary and laugh because it's embarrassing, that's not a good thing.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican military has detained a suspected leader of a notorious drug-trafficking family in connection with the July slayings of two U.S. citizens. Benjamin LeBaron is buried in Galeana, Mexico, in July. Jose Rodolfo Escajeda, known as El Rikin, was taken into custody Friday in Nuevo Casa Grandes, in Chihuahua state, according to a military statement. Escajeda is an alleged ringleader of a drug-trafficking family that runs a 120-mile smuggling corridor on Mexico's border with Texas, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.  He has been indicted by the U.S. government, DEA said. U.S. citizens Benjamin LeBaron and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home in the town of Galeana, Mexico. Local media reported in July that a note found on LeBaron indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town.

"(CNN) -- When she was about 8, Frida Sepulveda developed dark folds of skin around her neck. It's a well-known warning sign of type 2 diabetes. Blanca Sepulveda, right, was ""devastated"" when her daughter Frida began showing signs of type 2 diabetes. Frida's mother, Blanca Sepulveda, who has watched other family members struggle with diabetes and obesity, was ""devastated"" to see her daughter experience similar health problems. Now at age 11, Frida is about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs around 180 pounds, her mother said. Despite a high body weight for her age and height, Frida does not seem to have additional symptoms of diabetes -- or any other major health concerns -- but her parents are trying to reverse the weight problem Frida has had since infancy. The San Diego, California, family is among a disproportionately high number of Latino-American families with overweight and obese children. According to the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, 16.6 percent of Latino high school students were obese and 18.1 percent were overweight. The corresponding national averages for high school students were 13.3 percent obese and 15.8 percent overweight. It's an epidemic that shocked and saddened Lorena Garcia, a chef who appears on Univision and Telemundo. ""I travel all over the country to the major Hispanic festivals and I realized that 90 to 95 percent of the kids that I saw at the festivals were overweight,"" said Garcia, who established the Big Chef Little Chef program to teach Latino youth healthy cooking and eating habits.  Watch Garcia interact with her fans » . The problem is caused by a wide range of cultural, social, economic, environmental and possibly genetic factors. Experts agree it is an uphill battle to solve. ""You can't just try to change someone's behavior necessarily without trying to change their environment,"" said Dr. Michael Goran, director of the University of Southern California's Childhood Obesity Research Center. How can childhood obesity be reduced? Blanca Sepulveda, 38, believes her own upbringing in Mexico before coming to the United States in junior high school ultimately contributed to her daughter's weight problem. ""The way I was raised ... you don't [leave] the dinner table until you're done with all your food. That's instilled in you,"" Sepulveda said. Back in Mexico, she said, the food was healthier and fresher, and she didn't drink soda. But she still applied that mentality to her own children, who were born and raised in the United States, where sugar-laden and fattening foods are widely available. The Sepulveda family's story is similar to that of other immigrants who are healthier than their American-born children: Those born outside the United States are less likely to be obese than native-born children, said Luisa Franzini, Ph.D., of the University of Texas School of Public Health. Despite the trends, more study is necessary to determine whether American acculturation is entirely to blame for poor diets among Latinos, an expert says. Rafael Pérez-Escamilla, a nutrition and public health professor with the University of Connecticut, wrote in the June 2009 issue of Journal of the American Diabetic Association that adaptation to U.S. society may explain, to some degree, ""deterioration of dietary quality"" and the risks of diabetes and other chronic diseases. However, he wrote, it's still not completely clear. Healthy food harder to come by . Economic factors play a major role for many Latinos in their weight struggles. Angelica Delgado is trying to overcome the obstacle with the Healthy Latino Families initiative, a culturally tailored nutrition and exercise program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As the Community Research Supervisor for the United Community Center, Delgado is trying to get healthy school lunches in the Bruce-Guadalupe Community School, with which she's working on Healthy Latino Families. About 80 percent of Bruce Guadalupe's student body, which is 97 percent Latino, come from low-income households and therefore are eligible for reduced-price or free lunch. Without money coming in to support the lunch program, it's difficult to fund better quality food and equipment to ensure that it's freshly cooked, Delgado said. For now, she hopes the fun, bilingual setting of Healthy Latino Families will teach children to make smart food choices. The lack of availability of inexpensive, fresh, healthy food is a common for low-income populations in general, Franzini said. Research suggests that more affluent neighborhoods have a higher availability of healthy food, she said, adding that the cost of healthy food is lower in more advantaged communities. The community factor . Exercise also poses tricky problems for Latino children struggling with weight, as many live in disadvantaged areas may make it tough for them to play outside or walk to school. From a physical point of view -- in terms of sidewalks and litter -- those areas tend to be in worse shape than an average neighborhood, Franzini said. But her research also suggests that the social component of a neighborhood affects children's physical activity levels. ""It's not sufficient to just clean up the neighborhood -- pick up the trash and build sidewalks,"" said Franzini, whose study on the impact of neighborhoods' social characteristics was published earlier this year in the American Journal of Public Health. ""It also needs to be a neighborhood where people feel safe and they feel that they can go out and walk and run and exercise and do whatever they want to do."" To that end, Franzini's research indicates that those Latinos living in tight-knit communities often get more exercise than those in more mixed neighborhoods. ""Having a neighborhood which is more connected, where people feel safe -- I think it's all a matter of feeling empowered in a way. And so those who feel that they have this stronger neighborhood from a social point of view, they are also more likely to be physically active,"" Franzini said. Finding solutions . Researchers and community advocates are attempting to combat the Latino youth obesity problem. But the multitude of factors makes the issue a moving target and results of interventions are mixed. For example, about a year after a previous phase of Healthy Latino Families in Milwaukee wrapped up, children reportedly ate better and watched less television per day. Delgado said they are awaiting results from the current program, but she has seen some success already. USC's Goran worked with Latino teenagers over 16 weeks to improve their diets, promoting fiber-rich tortillas and altering recipes of aqua fresca so it would have less sugar. But at the end of the four months, he saw ""no significant improvement in the outcomes."" ""We have to do those studies over longer time periods than we have previously done to kind of give these things a chance to work and kick in,"" Goran said. ""We're ... taking it one step at a time."" And Frida's mom, Blanca Sepulveda, said she is focusing on modifying her own behavior to help her entire family. ""It's a retraining of the mind,"" Sepulveda said. ""It gets hard because you have to be an example.""","A disproportionately high number of Latino-American families struggle with obesity .
Programs designed specifically for Latino children have had mixed results .

"(CNN) -- And now the saga of the Chilean miners -- at least a part of it -- may be about to make a detour to Graceland. Which may not be as bizarre a notion as it sounds. One of the 33 miners who endured more than two months trapped underground, and who was pulled to safety last week, is a devoted fan of the late Elvis Presley. Edison Pena, 34, speaks little English, according to his father. But there is an exception; he knows all the words to most of Presley's biggest hits. It was reported that Pena led Presley singalongs down below, to lift the miners' spirits and to help pass the long and lonely hours. His dad, waiting for all those weeks near the San Jose mine in Chile, fashioned a placard promising his son that, when he emerged from the ground, he would be ""bigger than Elvis."" So it is that Pena, when he feels up to it, may be embarking on a journey to Memphis, Tennessee, to set foot in the house where Presley lived. The people who run Presley's Graceland mansion have invited the miner to Presley's home. If he goes, he's likely to love it -- take the word of someone who has been a serial visitor to Graceland over the years. I can tell Mr. Pena that if he thought he needed sunglasses to protect his eyes from the light near the mine opening after those months in the dimness, he might do well to bring them along to Graceland with him, too. The place is a little garish. But it's pretty great. I highly recommend that he spend time standing at the entrance to the Jungle Room, the part of Graceland that best portrays Presley's playfulness. As the story goes, he purchased all of the room's eccentric furniture during one 30-minute shopping spree at a Memphis store called Donald's. He outfitted the room with chairs bearing the carved likenesses of animal faces; he had green shag carpeting nailed to the ceiling; he ordered a constantly dripping waterfall to be constructed on one wall -- in many ways the Jungle Room is the soul of Graceland. If Edison Pena pays close attention, there are all kinds of memories to take from that house. On visits over the years, I've jotted notations about Elvis' record collection (even Elvis had to listen to someone other than Elvis -- he had Dean Martin albums, a Peter, Paul and Mary LP, a copy of the once wildly popular ""First Family"" comedy album, featuring satires of the Kennedy family by impressionist Vaughn Meader); about his gas station credit card (from the Shell Oil Co., issued to ""Mr. Elvis Presley,"" his name typed onto stiff white paper in those pre-plastic credit card days); about the only portrait Presley ever commissioned of himself (by artist Ralph Wolfe Cowan, showing Elvis dressed all in white, standing in clouds against a gold sky background. The framed portrait is an almost exact copy of an old Johnny Mathis album cover. Elvis reportedly saw that album cover, which was also painted by Cowan, and liked it so much that he ordered the same thing for himself). But, after all those awful days and nights trapped in the mine, the main thing that Pena might be justified in taking away from a trip to Graceland is a sense of the grand possibilities that life can offer, and the unexpected joy that may be waiting around the next corner. Elvis Presley wasn't always the man in the mansion; a poor kid from Tupelo, Mississippi, he had no inkling that he would ever end up in the lavish home in Memphis' Whitehaven neighborhood. If Pena should scarcely be able to comprehend that he has made it to Graceland ... well, that is a feeling that the owner of the house understood very well. Presley's friend George Klein (they went to Humes High School in Memphis together) once told me that in the years before Elvis' life turned dark and unhappy, the two of them would arrive giddily back at the mansion after a Saturday night on the town: ""Often Elvis and I would be driving through the gates of Graceland, and he would say, 'God, George, do you believe this is real? Do you believe this has happened to me?' "" It's a universal feeling, for those who are lucky. And right now, Edison Pena and his 32 fellow miners have a right to consider themselves among the luckiest people alive. See more opinion articles on topics in the news . Which brings us to a message from another singer, who found himself in Memphis one night just as his own young career was on the ascendancy. This was Bruce Springsteen. There is a story that he told from the stage, letting his audiences know about what had happened that night in the 1970s. Springsteen said he had gone to the gates of Graceland, just to look. He had seen a light in a window, and, on an impulse, had climbed over the wall and tried to approach the house. A security guard had stopped him. The guard had said that Presley was out of town, and had escorted Springsteen back to the street. This is a transcript of what Springsteen told a concert audience one night: . ""Later on, I used to wonder what I would have said if I'd knocked on the door and if Elvis had come to the door, because it really wasn't Elvis I was goin' to see. But, it was like he came along, and whispered some dream in everybody's ear, and we all dreamed it. And maybe that's why we're here tonight, I don't know. ""I remember later, when a friend of mine called to tell me that he'd died. It was so hard to understand how somebody whose music came in and took away so many people's loneliness, and gave so many people a reason and a sense of the possibilities of living, could have, in the end, died so tragically. ""And I guess when you're alone, you ain't nothin' but alone."" Yet just when a person feels most alone, comfort can somehow come to him. Edison Pena, who speaks little English, is said to have found sustenance in that Chilean mine, for him and for his colleagues, through the music of a man from Memphis he had never met. And if Pena does make it to Graceland, I hope there will be echoes, not just for him but for all 33, of something else that Bruce Springsteen said on that long-ago stage. He was about to sing his own slowed-down rendition of Presley's ""Follow That Dream."" He said to the audience: . ""So, anyway, I'd like to do this song for you tonight, wishing you all the longest life, with the best of absolutely everything."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Edison Pena kept his fellow trapped miners going with Elvis singalongs .

"(CNN) -- The world changes, but I'm not sure it's supposed to change this much: . Fritz von Goering is on Facebook. ""Yeah,"" von Goering said the other day, ""I'm on it. People told me that's the way to connect with people."" Fritz von Goering on a social network ... something just seems wrong. He always seemed to be the most anti-social human being on the face of the Earth. At least he did from the vantage point of the third row on Saturday afternoons during the 1950s, which is where I always sat when I watched him work. I was 9, and my friend Kenny Stone and I would ride the bus to Old Memorial Hall in Franklin County, Ohio, where, for 50 cents, we purchased tickets to observe in person a weekly television broadcast called ""Lex's Live Wrestling."" Lex Mayers, a highly excitable local Chevrolet dealer, was the sponsor and host, and Fritz von Goering was the ultimate scowling villain. He did terrible things to his opponents. Just terrible. The hero of the telecasts was the blond, golden Buddy ""Nature Boy"" Rogers. In most of the country, he was promoted as a bad guy, but for whatever reason, in central Ohio, Rogers was as beloved as Woody Hayes. Nature Boy could do no wrong. ""Don't even say that name to me,"" von Goering told me the other day. He is 82 now, and we were talking over a telephone line, but I instantly obeyed. ""I hated Nature Boy's guts offstage as well as on,"" von Goering said. ""Don't bring him up again."" As it was, I could scarcely believe I was even talking to von Goering; it had been more than 50 years since those afternoons at Old Memorial Hall, with people screaming vile invective at him as he stepped between the ropes and into the ring, staring daggers at the audience and wearing a leather, military-type jacket. Out of curiosity this month I had decided to try to find out if he was still alive, and here he was, on the phone from his home in Northern California, sounding quite pleasant. So, Fritz ... why do you think people hated you so much? ""Fans never did like me from day one, and I never knew why,"" he said. ""I was a good-looking young kid when I was first getting started, and they put me in the ring against a bunch of ugly, hairy guys, and yet I was the one who got booed. The promoters said to me, 'You know, nobody likes you.' "" Biting the inside of my mouth, not knowing whether I should offer an opinion, I said: . ""Perhaps it had something to do with your name being Fritz von Goering?"" ""Yeah, I guess so,"" von Goering said. ""But I didn't give myself that name. A promoter in Minnesota did."" In the years after World War II, the most certain way to turn fans against a wrestler was to give him a German or Japanese name. Wartime wounds were still raw. ""I wasn't even of German heritage,"" von Goering said. ""I was born in Chicago to an Irish-American family."" (In case you're wondering what von Goering's name was as a boy: I asked him, and he said he didn't feel like discussing it. Do you want to be the one to tell von Goering to do something he doesn't feel like doing? Be my guest.) ""When I first started wrestling professionally, I was billed as Fritz von Ulm,"" he said. ""But I guess that didn't sound like a bad-enough villain. So they changed it to Fritz von Goering."" Made a certain sense, in the context of the times -- Hermann Goering, one of Adolf Hitler's henchmen, was not exactly a beloved figure in a 1950s United States filled with returning servicemen. ""They told me, 'You're Fritz von Goering now,' and my attitude was, 'Fine, if you say so.' "" He had never been outside the United States, but ring announcers from coast to coast proclaimed that he was ""from Berlin, Germany,"" or ""from Frankfurt, Germany,"" or ""from Nuremberg, Germany"" (they seemed to make it up as they went along), and thus he was able to make a pretty good living. Although it did have its downside. ""I was wrestling one night in Marion, Ohio,"" he said. ""Against Nature Boy Rogers. The fans found where I had parked my car on the street and smashed it to pieces. They knocked out all the windows, banged the fenders, cut the tires. I had no idea until after the match."" ""So what did you do?"" I asked. ""Lex Mayers had the car towed to his dealership, and he fixed it up, which was a nice thing for him to do seeing that he had a Chevy dealership and I drove an Oldsmobile."" There were no pensions for the professional wrestlers of his day, so when he got too old for the job he found work as a truck driver, and for a while, perhaps inspired by Mayers, he sold cars. (Although it is difficult to imagine how, after spending a career persuading people to despise him, he could beckon them to purchase an auto from ""your friendly neighborhood used-car dealer, Fritz von Goering."") He always seemed like a loner, but he told me that if there had been Facebook when he was competing, he would have accepted just about all of his fellow wrestlers, heroes or heels, as friends. Every name I threw at him -- all of the men who, when I was a boy, I witnessed sharing a ""Lex's Live Wrestling"" ring with him -- he said yes to. Buddy ""Killer"" Austin? ""Yes."" Oyama Kato? ""Yes."" Sweet Daddy Siki? ""Yes."" Frankie Talaber? ""Yes."" Handsome Johnny Barend? ""Yes."" The Magnificent Maurice? ""Yes."" I had to say it: . ""Buddy 'Nature Boy' Rogers?"" ""Absolutely not. Not in a million years."" In retirement and heading toward his 83rd birthday, von Goering said he does not miss the mayhem that once defined his life. And when he does find himself in the mood for unsuppressed anger, bellicose posturing and high-decibel insults, he knows where to turn. ""I watch cable news,"" he said. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says he found a wrestler he used to watch as a kid on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Scandanavian readers can view the topless photos of Britain's likely future queen, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, as magazines in in Denmark and Sweden have bought the controversial images, editors confirmed to CNN. Sweden's Se och Hoer magazine printed them over the weekend, while its sister publication in Denmark, Se Og Hor, will publish them Thursday, the editors said Wednesday. The photographs will be the same ones that appeared in the French magazine Closer last week and in the Italian magazine Chi on Monday, Se Og Hor editor Kim Henningsen said. ""It's a set of unique photos from an A-class celebrity. We are a leading gossip magazine in Denmark, and it is my job to publish them,"" Henningsen said. ""If the British royal family want to sue us, then it will happen then and we'll deal with it."" Se och Hoer editor Carina Loefkvist would not discuss the identity of the photographer, but she did say her magazine bought the images Friday. The criminal and civil legal battle over the photographs would not deter the magazine, she said. ""We don't treat royalties different to other celebrities, so we would have published the photos anyway,"" she said. ""We valued the news value."" A spokesman for the royal family declined to comment on the Danish and Swedish magazines' decisions ""save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review."" Closer was fined Tuesday for publishing the topless photographs, and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online. A French court ordered the magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling and to pay them 2,000 euros (about $2,600). The magazine must pay a further 10,000 euros a day if it is late in handing over the photos. An employee at the magazine refused to say Wednesday whether it had complied with the order. ""We don't communicate with the press,"" said the woman, who refused to give her name but identified herself as an assistant to the editor. A French prosecutor opened a preliminary criminal investigation into the incident, the Nanterre prosecutor's office said Tuesday. Wolf: The backward view of women's bodies . Catherine and her husband, Prince William, the second in line to the throne, ""welcome the injunction that's been granted. They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy,"" the palace said. French law provides for ""draconian sanctions"" to protect against invasions of privacy, British lawyer Charlotte Harris said, including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines. Separately, the board of a newspaper that published the topless photos is conducting an internal investigation. The board of the Irish Daily Star was considering shutting down the newspaper but decided to await the investigation results, which are expected in ""a few weeks."" After the Irish Daily Star published the photos Saturday, one of the newspaper's editors was suspended, pending the investigation. The royal family filed a criminal complaint seeking invasion of privacy charges against Closer and possibly the photographer, a palace spokeswoman said.

"(CNN) -- Some of Europe's leading clubs -- including Europa League and European Super Cup winners Atletico Madrid of Spain -- have had a taste of just seriously UEFA is taking the idea of Financial Fair Play after the European governing body temporarily withheld the payment of prize money to 23 clubs. UEFA Club Financial Control Body's investigatory chamber, chaired by former Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, handed out the punishment after identifying that the clubs owed money to either other teams, their employees or had failed to pay taxes. Atletico's fellow Spanish club Malaga, which is taking part in the Champions League for the first time this season, is another of the 23 clubs that has had the payment of prize withheld. Sporting Lisbon, Hajduk Split, CSKA Sofia, Rubin Kazan and Fenerbahce are some of the others major clubs to have been sanctioned. Atletico thrash Chelsea in Super Cup . ""I am still very worried about the current situation,"" Dehaene told the European Club Association's (ECA) general assembly. ""The Financial Fair Play Regulations are known for more than two years, but I have the impression that some clubs still need to do their homework."" ECA Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: ""It seems that quite a few clubs have not understood the message. Time has come to take the new rules seriously. ECA will continue to support Financial Fair Play."" UEFA said the measure would remain in place until the clubs had paid the money they owed and have asked the 23 teams to provide an update on their finances by the end of September. In a UEFA report published last year, it was estimated that about 50% of top European clubs were losing money and 20% were recording sizable deficits. UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules apply now but will come fully into force in 2014 and provide Europe's governing body with sweeping powers, including exclusion from the lucrative Champions League, if clubs fail to meet the regulations.

Current rules state that should clubs incur losses in excess of $60 million over a three-year period, they will be hit with sanctions as well as exclusion from the Champions League and Europa League.

"(RollingStone.com) -- At the outset of ""BAD 25"" -- the documentary film celebrating the 25th anniversary of Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" album -- director Spike Lee quickly dispenses with talk of the pop superstar's personal struggles, diving right into the artistic perfectionism that drove him to achieve his career milestones. ""Hopefully, that's what this documentary is about -- it's gonna have people return to focusing on the music, his art, which I feel is his legacy, in addition to his children,"" Lee, dressed in a white ""BAD 25"" T-shirt, told reporters at the Toronto International Film Festival. The movie had its North American premiere there over the weekend, after debuting in Venice 25 years to the day since ""Bad's"" release. To piece together the making of Jackson's landmark LP, Lee unearthed archival footage from studio sessions and music video shoots and conducted interviews with Jackson's many collaborators, including Quincy Jones, Martin Scorsese, Stevie Wonder and Sheryl Crow, and stars who were inspired by his music, from Kanye West and Mariah Carey to Questlove and Justin Bieber.

Then, abruptly, Lee shifts to Jackson's death in the summer of 2009, collecting reactions from his interview subjects, many of whom choke back tears and break down. ""Those were all real, raw emotions that were displayed,"" said Lee. One of the most impactful statements in the documentary comes from music journalist Danyel Smith. ""We should all be ashamed,"" she says. ""The way that I interpret that,"" said Lee, ""is that Michael should be with us. He should be here."" On Tuesday, Jackson's estate and Epic/Legacy Recordings will release a ""BAD 25"" CD/DVD deluxe package, with three discs' worth of remastered versions of the LP's original tracks plus bonus material, including previously unreleased songs (""Price of Fame,"" ""Song Groove (A/K/A Abortion Papers)""), the first release of Jackson's 1998 Wembley Stadium concert on DVD, and remixes by EDM artists Nero and Afrojack.

""How can you get privacy when you're the most recognizable person on the planet?"" ""Did you see the disguises he had?"" Lee added with a laugh, referring to a moment in the film that shows photographs of Jackson wearing intricate facial disguises. ""He had to do that. He couldn't go anywhere in the world without there being a riot. Man, I wouldn't wish that on anybody. He became a prisoner of his fame.

"(CNN) -- Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona have been crowned champions of Israel's Premier League for the first time in their history after a goalless draw at home to Hapoel Tel Aviv on Monday. It is a remarkable achievement for the tiny club from a small northern town (Kiryat Shmona) close to the border with Lebanon in a league traditionally dominated by the country's ""big four"" teams -- Maccabi Haifa, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Beitar Jerusalem. Monday night's result now gives them an unassailable 16-point lead in the league and caps a memorable season for a place which has regularly found itself caught in the crossfire of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In January this year, the team secured the Toto Cup -- a major domestic tournament -- beating Hapoel Tel Aviv in a penalty shoot-out. ""It's an incredible achievement,"" says James Montague, author of ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone,"" a book about football and politics in the Middle East. ""It's a tiny place right on the frontier of one of the Middle East's most enduring conflicts, not to mention the very edge of European football,"" he added.

The Japanese media showed images of huge crowds throwing bottles and eggs at the Japanese embassy in Beijing as they chanted nationalistic slogans. Television stations also carried lengthy reports from inside a Japanese-owned mall -- elsewhere in China -- which was slowly being surrounded by increasingly violent demonstrators. Though life has continued as normal across Japan, many Japanese people are increasingly troubled by the dispute. Background: How remote rock split China, Japan . ""I can understand that the Chinese are angry at the past, when the Japanese invaded them and did twisted things to them, but that's the past,"" said 65-year-old Kiyoshi Yamashita. ""Japan was also victim of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States, but we don't constantly reproach them for doing that. At that time, it was war."" Anti-Japanese protests in China are nothing new. In 2010, a collision near the disputed islands in the East China Sea between a Chinese fishing boat and a Japanese marine ship soured relations between the two countries after the captain of the Chinese vessel was briefly detained. But they have rarely gone on for so long and become so violent. Shota Saito, a 22-year-old college student, said that recent events have pushed him to reconsider plans to travel to China, and that the protests were ""frightening."" But Saito knows that not all Chinese people hate the Japanese because he lives in Yokohama, a city known for its large Chinatown and has Chinese friends of his own. ""I think only a handful of radicals are reacting excessively,"" Saito said. ""I think there are many people who like Japan, so it does not change my views about Chinese people."" Many people, such as 26-year-old Aya Fujimori, suspect that the lack of effective communication between the two countries is causing the rift. ""My sense is that we have come to this point because we did not talk enough between each other, and we each make our own conclusions,"" she said. Dangerous rocks: Can both sides back off peacefully? Though he believes the islands are Japanese because of ""historical written proof,"" Yamashita says the current dispute is ""absurd,"" and that the two countries need to have a serious heart-to-heart to settle things. The media has also come under fire for its reporting on the issue. ""It seems to me that the media only shows us the flashy stuff,"" Fujimori said. She also suspects that most employees of the damaged businesses in China are locals, and that they are not all anti-Japanese. ""I think there are people who oppose Japan and those who don't. I'd like to hear what the latter people have to say,"" she said. Ever since Takagi was surprised by her child's question, she says she has become more attentive to what is happening. ""I think many facts about the past are not being reported properly in China,"" she said, while suspecting the same thing in Japan. ""There may be some things that we do not know about the past between China and Japan. Maybe it's because records have not been set straight that we cannot understand each other."" As for the answer to her young son's question: ""I told him that Chinese people are not bad people, and that it would be great if we could all get along better."" Even though anti-Chinese protests in Japan have not been observed on the same scale as in China, there have been some tensions and a number of minor incidents reported. But this may change if the anti-Japanese backlash continues.

"New York (CNN) -- Lady Gaga met with me this week about the launch of her new fragrance, Fame, but as is often the case with this pop mega-star, it is hard to determine what is marketing, what is performance and what is her reality. ""Fame has a very interesting prospect with dangerous encounters around the corner.....Fame is ultimately about the cycles of desire and how to do away with them or manage them well,"" the 26-year-old superstar said. ""Vanity can create a very cruel space for you if you don't know how to manage it."" One thing you are sure of -- she is passionate. Unlike other celebrities who license their name to use on products other people make, Gaga was heavily involved in the entire process, she says, including the idea of making the actual liquid black -- a perfume first. At first, her collaborators tried to talk her out of the dark tint ""so you don't have to explain to everyone how it won't get on your clothing,"" she recalled. ""And I said, `I don't want to do it unless it's black'."" She is certainly someone who knows how to walk the fine line between shock value and mass appeal -- as when I asked about what she wanted from Fame's scent. ""I wanted it to smell slutty, to be totally honest,"" she said. ""I don't think that women need to smell interesting. I have an interesting mind but I want to smell like a slut ... I mean it in a lovely way like the way your husband makes you feel when you've had a really long day and he knows exactly what to say to you to make you feel sexy."" Does she think of herself as a businesswomen? ""Well, I guess we'll find out,"" she said. More: Before she was Gaga: The unseen photos . The young performer is certainly in the black: Forbes estimates Gaga earned $52 million between May 2011 and May 2012 -- a drop from the $90 million she earned the year before, the magazine reported. But Forbes expects that figure to balloon next year, as she launched her 2012-2013 ""Born This Way Ball"" world tour in late April with more than 100 concerts planned. Will that passion translate into commercial success for the perfume? Some fans are turned off when their favorite artists hawk products, but as Gaga quipped during our interview, ""I already am a product."" Prices for the Fame products range from $19 to $79 for a 100 milliliter bottle, and the line also include soap, shower gel and body lotion. She joins a long list of celebrities who have launched their own perfume or cologne lines, from Beyonce and Brittany Spears to Pavarotti and Michael Jordan. ""The most exciting thing about this fragrance is that is was collaboration between myself and two lifelong friends of mine, incredible photographers and creators,"" she said. ""Steve Klein shot the ad campaign the amazing images for the fragrance and Nick Knight designed the bottle with me. It's been an amazing time for me. I've been enjoying myself because I get to work with people I really love and respect and give something back to the fans. ""We really spent a lot of time creating this for you because we love you and we appreciate that you love the aesthetic that we created through our music and TV performances,"" she added. Gaga has dismissed the idea of a fashion line in the past, saying the Haus of Gaga, the creative team behind often controversial couture, ""was not a commodity, not something to be sold."" But that may be shifting. When I asked her if this experience has made her open to the idea of other products she coyly responded, ""Anything is possible."" As for the woman herself: She was punctual, polite, fabulously turned out but I can honestly say by the end I had no more insight on Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta the person, than I did at the start. And I suspect that is just how Lady Gaga likes it. She is in it for the long haul and very much in control of every aspect of her Fame.","Pop superstar Lady Gaga has launched worldwide a new perfume line, Fame .

"(CNN) -- A recent report from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides hard data that the first six months of 2012 were the hottest since records began being kept in 1895. According to NOAA: ""The January-June period was the warmest first half of any year on record for the contiguous United States. The national temperature of 52.9Â°F was 4.5Â°F above the 20th century average."" While those of us who work in the field of environmental policy and sustainability management believe that human-induced climate change is partially responsible for these trends, let's ignore for a moment the causes of this problem and start thinking about what to do about the impact of extreme weather events. Not only does NOAA report that we are experiencing more extreme weather events, but the UN's Internal Displacement Monitoring System reports that those events are having a greater impact than ever before. This is because the planet has more people than it used to. When I was growing up in the 1960s, we had about three billion people living on Earth. Today, we have more than seven billion. People are living in places they did not live in before, and some of the places that we live are quite vulnerable to destructive weather. Additionally, with over half the planet residing in cities, we are living under conditions of higher population density. This means that when floods, fires, winds and earthquakes hit, more people are in harm's way. Extreme weather: Expect to see more of it, scientists say . Even if the storms were not getting more intense, our growing population and patterns of development would guarantee that the costs of weather-related damage will continue to grow. We see the impact of new patterns of land use out West where wildfires have been raging for weeks. Many of the homes that have been lost recently are in places where people didn't live a century ago. In the beach community where I have a summer home on the south shore of Long Island, people are now building lavish homes close to the beach. In the old days, homes were built farther from the ocean to reduce the odds of damage from storms. We seem to think we are invulnerable to the forces of nature, at least until we learn the hard way that even modern buildings can be destroyed by storms, fires and earthquakes. Think it's hot? Imagine living here . The policy implications of these trends are obvious. We should pay more attention to natural processes when we decide where to build our homes, businesses and infrastructure. Here in New York, the parkways we built by streams and rivers flood and must be closed during many storms. (Commuters who drive on the Bronx River Parkway and the Saw Mill River Parkway know what I mean.) We need to devote more public resources to pay for emergency response and reconstruction from weather-related catastrophes. In fact, we should no longer deal with these events as if they are emergencies, but start to see them as routine events, requiring standard, programmed responses. This includes setting aside funds for fires and floods each year, just as Northern cities budget for blizzard clean-up. Extreme heat in your area? Share with us on CNN iReport . We will also need to require homeowners and businesses to purchase higher levels of insurance coverage for weather-related damage. In this era when people seek smaller government and lower taxes, private insurance will be needed to pay the costs of reconstruction. These proposals and analyses do not require you to agree with the compelling scientific evidence that human activity is producing climate change. It could simply be a coincidence that the past six months were the hottest months on record. On the other hand, even if you are not one of the more than 100 Ph.D. level climate scientists that work at Columbia University's Earth Institute and even if you do not understand the physics of climate change or the computer models predicting global warming, common sense alone might lead you to think that human beings and their machines are making the planet warmer. News: Wildfire victims face more than one tragedy . If you doubt me, come to midtown Manhattan during an August heat wave and feel the blast of hot air from vents on buildings and the street. Feel the heat generated by the engines of a truck or car traveling down Broadway, and just multiply it by a billion, which according to Ward's Auto, is the number of motor vehicles now on the roads of our planet. Do you really think all these machines have no impact on this planet's resilient but still fragile ecosphere? I do not want to turn off these machines. I like air conditioning, autos and digital media as much as anyone. But a prudent response to the extreme weather we are already experiencing would be to be to see it as a warning. We need to accelerate the transition to a sustainable, renewable economy. We need to build our communities' capacities to predict and respond to weather emergencies and to rebuild after they are over. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Cohen.","NOAA reports the past 12 months were the hottest since record-keeping began .
Steven Cohen says effects of extreme weather are indisputable, whatever the cause .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Georgia Pandermi is looking for her first job, and she's not having much luck. ""Even at bars or restaurants. I thought it would be easier to find something as long as I wasn't being very demanding,"" she told CNN. Pandermi, 18, is a recent high school graduate in the middle-class Athens neighborhood of Patissia. She has already asked at several shops and a supermarket but says that there are no jobs to be had. She's not alone. Dilemma for Greek youth: Fight or flee . The latest Greek employment data shows that more than half of people under the age of 25 are out of work. As of May 2012, 53.8% of young Greeks were unemployed, according to Eurostat, the statistics division of the European Commission. And things may be about to get even harder for Greece, which is relying on international funding to pay its debts. Media reports in Greece and abroad say creditors are demanding the government extend the working week to six days, as a condition for releasing more funds as part of the country's second bailout. A leaked letter reportedly sent to Greece's finance and labor ministries from the troika -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union -- is believed to order drastic labor market reforms to minimum wages and working hours. CNN has not seen the letter or its contents, but the rumor is enough to upset Greeks like Pandermi. ""I don't like the idea of changing the working hours,"" she said. ""The government has been making promises that it will protect us, and then it introduces more measures. If it now takes away employees' rights, who will protect us when we are asked to work longer hours for the same amount of money?"" she asked. ""Also, they want to cut all our benefits, and salaries have been cut by 30% in many cases. We can't live like that. Greece is an expensive country. The cost of living is not going down, but the money we make is getting less and we have to pay more for services."" Your guide to the euro crisis . Greece has already agreed to a harsh austerity program and labor market reforms, which have led to violent street demonstrations and crippling unemployment. Now the Greek government is seeking new ways to implement budget cuts of 11.5 billion euros ($14.49 billion) to ensure the country receives its next bailout installment in October. Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis says that the troika's diagnosis of the labor market is ""utterly erroneous"" and that the greatest challenge for employers is not a lack of cheap labor but a shortage of demand for their products. Varoufakis expects the message of the IMF to be welcomed by eurozone electorates. ""It resonates well with the average German voter, that the Greeks deserve a bit of a kicking ... and they've been having it too good for too long. So you have this confluence of false economic analysis and a stereotype in the north of Europe as to what the problem with Greece is,"" he told CNN. Last month, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to plead for more time to push through reforms to public finances. Members of the 17-nation currency bloc are waiting for the troika's report on Greece's troubled economy, due at the end of September, before making a decision. Until then, Greece is likely to take a back seat, as investors focus on whether the European Central Bank will intervene in the bond markets to help other ailing nations such as Spain and Italy. More: Why is unity so important to Europe? However, Varoufakis says a Greek exit from the eurozone is not likely soon. He said: ""They can't kick Greece out (of the euro) without jeopardizing the whole of the eurozone ... they would love to get rid of Greece, but they can't without ensuring the domino effect won't destroy the eurozone."" But he is concerned that if international and eurozone partners continue to make such severe demands, the debt-ridden nation will transform into a ""mafia-ridden"" protectorate. ""More cuts, more reductions in minimum wages, further incursions into the welfare state, an effective collapse of social security. The vicious cycle will leave nothing standing,"" he added. For Pandermi, the job seeker, the future seems bleak -- not just for her, ""but for future generations,"" she said: ""I am worried that as I grow older, there will be no free health care or good education for my children. Everything will be in private hands and we will have to pay a fortune for basic things. They should not be allowing this to happen in a democratic country.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government on Wednesday imposed its first fine on an international carrier for keeping passengers aboard a plane during an extended ground delay, slapping a $150,000 penalty on Pakistan International Airlines. The Transportation Department said the airline violated its time limit for overseas flights held on the tarmac for weather, mechanical or other problems. They must give passengers a chance to exit the aircraft after four hours in most cases. ""Passengers deserve to be treated with respect when they fly, and DOT's tarmac delay rules were put into place to ensure that they receive that respect,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. PIA Flight 711 was enroute to New York's John F. Kennedy airport from Manchester, England, when diverted to Washington's Dulles airport last October 29 due to inoperable instrument landing equipment in New York, which had been hit by a surprise snowstorm. The plane sat on the tarmac for nearly five hours, according to transportation officials, who alleged PIA made no effort to let passengers off or ask airport officials for help. The captain and first officer got off the plane and inspected the aircraft, the agency said. But passengers were not given the opportunity to leave because the airline thought the bad weather was too risky for them to exit via stairs. Compounding the airline's concerns were multiple passengers in wheel chairs and small children who were aboard. The surprise snowstorm stranded passengers throughout the Northeast on a number of domestic airlines, including several flights that tested federal ground delay rules. A consumer protection regulation established in 2010 under pressure from consumer advocates and Congress requires domestic airlines to give passengers a chance to deplane if a ground delay exceeds three hours. The rule was extended last year for international flights, imposing a four-hour limit. Airlines have dramatically cut lengthy ground delays since the rules were finalized as carriers will now cancel flights rather than risk fines. The rules allow exceptions for security or safety.","Transportation Department fine is first against international airline for long ground delay .

"Washington (CNN) -- Online travel company Orbitz was fined $50,000 Monday by the Department of Transportation for failing to properly disclose baggage fees on its website. In announcing the fine, the DOT said it had ordered Orbitz to immediately fix the problem to avoid further fines. The agency alleged that Orbitz failed to ""clearly and prominently"" inform travelers about potential baggage fees during the airline ticket purchasing process, and in doing so, violated a new rule intended to make airline fees more transparent. ""The Department adopted its rules on baggage fees to ensure that consumers have complete and accurate information about how much they will have to pay when they book a flight, and we will continue to take enforcement action when carriers and ticket agents fail to comply with our rules,"" Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood said in a statement. While admitting that Orbitz did, in fact, post the fees online, Lahood and the DOT took issue with where the notice was placed. The agency alleged that customers were forced to scroll to the bottom of the web page to see the cost of checking their baggage. Tim Enstice, Orbitz communications manager, told CNN: ""As the order acknowledges, we promptly corrected how we displayed airline baggage fee information to be consistent with DOT's preference. We are not aware of any consumer confusion, complaints or deception over this issue, but settled the case to avoid the costs of litigation."" The rule went into place in January and mandates carriers and ticket agents disclose up-front any baggage fees passengers may have to pay in addition to the ticket price. In June, the DOT fined Mexican airline Volaris $130,000 for violating the same rule. Go to CNN.com's Travel page for tips and armchair getaways .

"(CNN) -- Dick Sebion packed his carry-on bag and his golf clubs Wednesday morning and headed to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, excited about his trip to the Washington, D.C. area combining business with a little pleasure. His plane arrived a few minutes early at Reagan National Airport. But instead of rushing off the aircraft to retrieve his luggage at the carousel on the lower level, Sebion met his scheduled ride and headed to Alexandria for a meeting with the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, which hands out college scholarships to children of Marine and Navy Corpsmen killed in action. He left his golf clubs behind at the airport... on purpose. Sebion, 62, is taking part in a new service for passengers who travel on American Airlines. Luggage that doesn't fit into an overhead compartment or beneath a seat can be picked up after passengers land and delivered wherever they want for a fee. Alaska Airlines: Note on wing 'not the best approach' At a time when airlines are charging customers for seemingly everything from preferred seats to food, it was just a matter of time before the industry started a delivery service. Now luggage-checking passengers on American Airlines can do what the carry-on travelers do. They can get off a plane without stopping or trying to figure out which black suitcase is theirs in the baggage claim area. ""I thought I'd give it a try,"" said Sebion, who scheduled a noon tee time at the Army Navy Country Club in Virginia. ""It's ideal for my scenario. I have to go to a meeting. I don't want to lug the clubs with me."" Two hours later, Sebion was reunited with his golf clubs at the country club located about 10 miles away. The service, run by BAGS Inc., is offered at about 200 airports around the country. Other airlines are expected to follow. In addition to the normal baggage fees, it will cost a passenger $29.95 to have one bag delivered, $39.95 for two bags and $49.95 for three to 10 bags. Travelers have the option to purchase this service on AA.com up to two hours prior to the scheduled departure time. A special indicator will be printed on the bag tags to help the delivery representatives identify the luggage once it arrives at the destination airport. Airline amenities: 8 bright spots . American Airlines says it will deliver the luggage at a passenger's designated address within four hours and 40 miles of the airport. The airline will charge an extra $1 per mile for delivery locations between 41 to 100 miles away. Customers can waive a signature requirement so they don't have to be present when the bags are delivered. If a flight is canceled or diverted, the order will be canceled at no cost. Customers can cancel an order up to 24 hours in advance of arrival time but be subject to a $15 cancellation fee. The baggage delivery service is available for flights originating from U.S. domestic airports with some international exceptions. BAGS Inc. decided to start the new service after it noticed airlines were getting better at, well, not losing luggage. The company had already partnered with most of the major U.S. airlines to deliver luggage lost or sent to the wrong destination. BAGS Inc. developed the service as another source of revenue, according to Chief Operating Officer Scott Fasano. In the United States, reports of lost luggage have dropped by one-third over the last 10 years, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. CNN's Todd Sperry contributed to this report .","BAGS Inc. will deliver your luggage for a fee .

"(CNN) -- A North Dakota newspaper has reversed its policy against publishing same-sex wedding announcements after rejecting a couple's ad last week, stirring controversy in the community and beyond. The Forum of Fargo-Moorehead will accept for publication announcements of same-sex marriages, engagements and anniversaries if the marriage takes place in a state or country where it's legally recognized, editor Matt Von Pinnon announced over the weekend. The newspaper will not publish announcements for non-legally recognized marriages, such as civil unions and commitment ceremonies, he said. ""We inform the public, plain and simple,"" he said. ""We report on many, many things that we neither endorse nor condemn. That's the nature of news. Some people would like us to deny that gay marriage is legally recognized in several states and countries. To not recognize that fact is to deny or distort the truth, something we're not willing to do. ""We bring readers marriage announcements, engagement announcements and anniversary announcements because it informs them of what people around them are doing. We tried to set a reasonable standard for what constitutes news in this arena, and we think a legally recognized marriage fits that bill."" The old policy drew attention after the newspaper refused to publish an announcement from Fargo residents Allison Johnson, 31, and her fiancee, 27-year-old Kelsey Smith. Johnson received an e-mail from the ""celebrations editor"" on July 23 and shared it with friends. One of those friends, iReporter Gia Rassier, posted a screen shot of the e-mail on Twitter, CNN iReport and Facebook, where it ""spread like wildfire,"" Rassier said. The uproar prompted a review of the policy, said Von Pinnon, who met with the couple July 24. Amid the controversy, Johnson and Smith said they received messages of support from as far as Europe and Australia. The development comes just in time for their wedding on Wednesday in New York, where same-sex marriage is legal. The couple, who have been together since 2008, said their ad would run in the Forum on Sunday. ""We are very proud of our community and everyone who supported us and this cause! They are the reason for the policy change. They made their voices heard and change occurred because of it,"" Johnson said Monday after landing in New York. The paper heard from more than 600 people in the Fargo area and elsewhere, who appeared ""equally divided"" over the issue, Von Pinnon said in his column. The old policy stemmed from the marriage laws of both North Dakota and neighboring Minnesota, both of which do not recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states. ""We are thrilled with the Forum's decision to reform their policy,"" Johnson said. ""While it is a great step in the right direction we know there is still so much more to be done for true equality to be reached.""","Editor: Fargo Forum will publish notices of legally recognized same-sex marriages .

"(CNN) -- The PlayStation Vita is extending its reach into video and voice calling with the release of a Skype app for the mobile gaming device. The free app is expected to be available through the PlayStation store Tuesday in North America and Wednesday in Europe and Asia. It will work for both the Vita's 3G and Wi-Fi only models. The Skype app will use the Vita's front and rear cameras for video calling. The app will also run in ""background mode,"" so users can pause a game, and then take a call. There is no functionality at this time to continue playing a game while taking a call. Since it runs in ""background mode,"" Skype will also alert users to calls when the Vita is in sleep mode. No word yet on how it will affect the device's five to six hours of battery time. On the Skype blog, legendary gamer Fatal1ty (Johnathan Wendel) shows off the features of the new app. The PS Vita already has voice chat and text chat through its built-in Party application. However, developer Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, told CNN in February that there were restrictions to that voice chat by broadband providers (only one person can be on a 3G connection). ""The Vita isn't a phone,"" he said. It appears that the Skype app may be trying to change that. Do gamers really want to be bothered during a ""Unit 13"" gun battle by a call from a friend? Or is this a partial admission by Sony that a dedicated games-only device may not be what users want?","Skype will be available through the PlayStation store Tuesday in North America .

"(CNN) -- The future of video gaming is bright, according to four industry visionaries who spoke at a recent gaming event. Kellee Santiago, Ken Levine, Paul Barrett and Mark DeLoura were part of a panel discussion at the opening of a new Smithsonian exhibit, The Art of Video Games. Each has been successful in the gaming business and has great hope for what's to come. Barrett, the senior creative director for BioWare-Mythic, said people who are going to make games in the future are playing them right now. He describes this time in those gaming lives as their Golden Age. ""What's interesting about my Golden Age is it is where I learned my prejudices about what games I liked and I don't like,"" Barrett said. ""That period defined my understanding of games so that when I had the chance to make games, those are the kinds of game I wanted to make."" For the gamers of today, he said, ""The current Golden Age is pretty bloody good."" Others on the panel said they were also driven to create games that reflected or expressed something they wanted to share with others. For Levine, the creative director of the ""BioShock"" franchise, it is about creating worlds and telling stories that mean something in those worlds. He related a story about the creation of ""BioShock,"" where players can save or sacrifice young girls, known as Little Sisters, to gain power. In the beginning of the creative process, the little girls were sea slugs. ""In order for the story to be meaningful, we had to create empathy between the player and the thing they were making a decision about,"" Levine said. ""That took a while for that to come about. The actual choice became simple -- what do you want to do with this little girl?"" Santiago and DeLoura hope future game designers go beyond what games are about today and challenge themselves and the industry about what gaming could be. DeLoura, the vice president of technology at THQ, wants the constraints of today's design to seem archaic to those who are just getting started and hopes for more diversity. ""The games that break down (the conventional) mentality is what does it for me,"" he said. ""For us pioneers up here, one of the things I would like to challenge us to do is to reach out into communities you don't expect games to come from and really pull those out and get them shared with the broader community."" Santiago, co-founder and president of thatgamecompany, echoed that sentiment of opening up new ideas for games of the future. She is also a partner in IndieFund, which helps independent game developers reach and maintain financial independence. ""My biggest hope is that the people who will be making games, what those people look like, completely changes,"" she said. ""We're going to see new types of stories and new types of experiences. With greater technology and distribution channels, it has flipped a switch for people and they say, 'Oh, I could do that too!'"" Levine added that with additional venues for gaming like app stores and Kickstarter, future game designers don't have to be driven to find funding to produce games anymore. He said that without that financial pressure, creativity goes up. ""Games were my companion as a kid,"" Levine said. ""It didn't shut my world down. It opened my world up."" Barrett said there is a whole new wave of people who want to make games that are fearless, expect success and have wide ranging views. He said those future designers have one goal in mind. ""They don't want to make games that are art. They want to make games that are awesome.""","Paul Barnett says future game makers are playing them now .

"(CNN) -- The crack of the bat and a bellowed ""Play ball!"" are annual rites of spring. In the video game world, ""MLB12: The Show"" (Sony) and ""Major League Baseball 2K12"" (2K Games) have also both arrived in time for opening day, ready to crack the starting line-ups of gamers everywhere. Each franchise has been around for a while -- 8 years for ""2K12"" and 6 years for ""The Show."" And, unfortunately, one of them is starting to show its age. The way you take to the mound is a major difference between the two titles.

The artificial intelligence has been fine-tuned so that batters will remember pitches and adjust accordingly, thus ramping up the realism level a bit. ""The Show"" has added a pulse pitching mechanism that determines how accurate your pitches are within your target area. It's all about timing, but only utilizes one button as opposed to moving the joystick in a particular way. It saves a lot of wear and tear on the thumbs. Defense is straightforward. There are animation differences that I'll get into later, but fielders move and throw with good precision. Both titles use a scale to determine how accurate the throws get -- ""The Show"" uses a circle; ""2K12"" uses a bar. Push a button to the corresponding base and fire the ball. Holding down the button longer makes for a stronger, but possibly inaccurate throw. Zone batting is new for ""The Show."" That's where the right stick controller determines your stride and swing while the left allows you to move your ""sweet spot"" to the area where you think the ball will cross the plate. ""2K12"" already uses a similar style to determine how hard you are swinging -- and where. The feature also will gives you hits about the pitch as the ball is heading for the plate, much as a skilled batter would be able to recognize a curveball from a slider. ""The Show"" also has a simple button swing mechanic if that is more your speed. The animations and general look of ""The Show"" really make it shine above ""2K12"". Each player has a unique look and fluid movements in everything they do. Pitching, hitting, throwing and catching the ball all appear very realistic and natural. It is a visually appealing game and looks like you are really watching an Orioles vs. Yankees matchup on television. ""2K12"" looks less like a TV broadcast and more like ... well, a video game. There are hiccups and stutters in some of the animation. Most of the players don't look much different from each other. Balls hit near fielders will make sudden leaps into the glove or outfielders will jump slightly to one side before catching a fly ball. It isn't as well polished as its counterpart and looks old. And speaking of TV broadcasts, a tip of the cap to the announcing team of Gary Thorne, Steve Philips and John Kruk on ""2K12."" Their banter seemed fresh and timely, referencing the right things and never sounding boring. Matt Vasgersian, Dave Campbell and Eric Karros for ""The Show"" sounded stale and repetitive. Some of their phrases sounded exactly the same as last year, and there were a couple of games when I wondered if Karros had gone out for a pretzel and just never came back because he was heard so infrequently. ""Franchise mode"" is back for both games. You can also create your own player and work him up through the ranks. ""2K12"" offers an ""MLB Today"" mode that lets player play games at the same pace as their favorite Major League team. But that means you can only play one game a day in that mode, which doesn't allow you to play future games or make up ones from the past. The new ""Diamond Dynasty"" mode for ""The Show"" seems geared more for a fantasy baseball fan than someone who wants to play a game. There are baseball cards, budgets, and customizable team logos and colors. If you are a stats nut or someone who likes to micromanage, this might be right for you. The ""Perfect Game Challenge"" is back for ""2K12"" with a twist. In previous years, whoever pitched the first perfect game of the season using the title won $1 million. This year, the first eight perfect games will get the chance to head to New York City and compete in a live tournament for that top prize. ""The Show"" is compatible with Sony's motion-control Move system, bringing its capabilities to every aspect of the game. They've also tied the PlayStation 3 game with the new PS Vita handheld console. Games can be saved to the cloud on one console and downloaded to another for continued playing. For die-hard video baseball games, this means never having to stop, even when you are away from home (provided you have a Vita). The biggest drawback to ""The Show"" is that it is a PlayStation exclusive title. If you own anything other than a PS3 or Vita, you can only play ""Major League Baseball 2K12."" Fundamentally, it is a solid, enjoyable -- but visually underwhelming -- title. If you have a choice, ""The Show"" brings together realistic mechanics with outstanding animation to create an ""at the ballpark"" feel that outshines its competitor. All I need now is a hot dog and a frosty beverage to make the experience complete. ""MLB12: The Show"" is available now only on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. ""Major League Baseball 2K12"" is available now for the Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, Nintendo DS, PSP and Microsoft Windows. Both games are rated E for Everybody. This review was done playing both titles on the PS3 as well as playing ""MLB12 The Show"" on the Vita.","""MLB12: The Show"" and ""Major League Baseball 2K12"" arrive just in time for opening day .

"(CNN)  -- German champions Bayern Munich will go into Saturday's Champions League Final in Madrid with an economic advantage of almost €100 million ($124 million) over their Italian opponents Inter Milan, according to a leading sports business consultancy. In terms of success on the field this season, there is little to choose between the giants of Germany and Italy who are both seeking to add European glory to domestic dominance, having both clinched league-and-cup doubles in their home countries. But in terms of earnings power, Bayern are already clear winners with an annual turnover of €289.5 million ($358 million), says SPORT+MARKT Executive Director Hartmut Zastrow. By contrast, Inter's annual turnover comes to just €196.5 million. Bayern's advantage derives from additional income derived from commercial and marketing opportunities, with 54 percent of their total turnover -- €160 million -- gained commercially, according to SPORT+MARKT. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? By contrast, Inter remain heavily dependent on revenue earned from television rights, with the club collecting €115.7 million -- or 60 percent of its turnover -- in broadcasting income. Bayern's current TV earnings amount to just €69.6 million per a year. ""The Commercial Masters defy the Giants of TV rights. In terms of revenue, Bayern has already defeated Inter Milan: thanks to a great commercial strategy, the Bavarians have been able to earn almost €100 million more than their Italian rivals"" said Zastrow. The Bavarian side also outguns Inter when it comes to ticket sales and matchday revenue, despite having a stadium with more than 10,000 fewer seats than Milan's San Siro home. Bayern has sold out the 69,000-capacity Allianz Arena for every game since the stadium opened in 2006, bringing in more than €60 million a year. Inter's ageing Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, last renovated for the 1990 World Cup, holds more than 80,000 but the Serie A champions have averaged just 55,000 this season, bringing in less than €30 million annually. ""The revenue from the stadium ticketing is impressive for Bayern and represents 22 percent of the total, almost equal to broadcasting income"", said Zastrow. ""Bayern's figures are a dream for every club. Of course, a new stadium for Inter Milan would help reduce the gap and bring more fans to the matches, generating more cash for the club."" Both clubs have already earned euros 22.5 million by reaching Saturday's final at the Bernabeu with the winners set to collect an additional euros 9 million. Bayern were placed fifth, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal and Barcelona on last month's latest list of football's richest clubs, compiled by Forbe's magazine. Man United named world's richest club . Inter were 10th on the list, lower than Italian rivals AC Milan and Juventus. English clubs Liverpool and Chelsea made up the top 10.","Bayern Munich have annual turnover of €289.5 million ($358 million)

"(CNN) -- Mannequins hanging from nooses on two Las Vegas billboards Wednesday were part of an apparent publicity stunt that led to dozens of calls from drivers on their morning commute, the Nevada Highway Patrol said. The dummies were dressed in business suits and hung from signs reading ""Dying for work"" and ""Hope you're happy Wall St."" It wasn't immediately clear who was behind the stunt. See more photos of the dummies . One mannequin dangled above Interstate 15 near the intersection with U.S. 95 downtown, Trooper Jeremie Elliott of the Nevada Highway Patrol told CNN. The other hung from a billboard about a mile from the famed Las Vegas Strip, he said. July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises . Both highways are some of the most highly traveled roadways during commuter hours, he said. Elliott called it a ""clear case of vandalism"" and said the owners of the billboards had not sold the ad space to anyone. ""Somebody vandalized the sign to do that,"" Elliott said. Despite the flurry of calls from commuters, Elliott said the signs led to no accidents on the freeways. ""If there would have been, our involvement would be much deeper,"" he said. The first calls came in at 6:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET), Elliott said. Lamar Advertising, which owns one of the billboards, removed one of the mannequins a couple of hours later; code enforcement officials from Clark County removed the second one, Elliott said.

"(CNN) -- A South Carolina woman undergoing treatment for infection with a rare case of ""flesh-eating"" bacteria was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Greenville Memorial Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. Lana Kuykendall, 36, ""underwent her fifth debridement surgery to remove necrotic, or dead, tissue from her lower leg,"" said Sandy Dees, senior media relations coordinator for Greenville Hospital System University Medical Center, in a news release. Kuykendall was admitted and diagnosed last Friday with necrotizing fasciitis, the release said. A team of surgeons, critical-care physicians and infection disease specialists was monitoring her condition, which is typically managed by surgery, antibiotics and aggressive supportive care, it said. ""She remains very ill but stable,"" Dr. Bill Kelly, the hospital epidemiologist, said in the release. Kuykendall was healthy when she gave birth to twins on May 7 in Atlanta but went to the hospital near her home in South Carolina a few days later after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband, Darren, told CNN on Wednesday. Doctors there removed dead skin and tissue from her legs and she was put on a ventilator, he said. Kuykendall is a nurse and paramedic; her husband is a firefighter. The twins are healthy, he said. A two-hour drive south of Greenville, in Augusta, Georgia, 24-year-old Aimee Copeland was battling similarly aggressive bacteria on Thursday. Doctors have amputated one of her legs and surgically removed part of her abdomen. Her father, Andy Copeland, told CNN on Wednesday that her fingers, too, will have to be amputated. Still, ""Aimee continues to be in good spirits,"" said a blog posted on the website of the Psychology Department at the University of West Georgia, where Aimee Copeland is a graduate student. ""Two major medical developments today for Aimee,"" it said. ""Those will be announced later today once Andy has the opportunity to type them out. Stay tuned."" Copeland contracted the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila when she fell May 1 from a homemade zip line that broke and cut her leg. The gash required 22 staples. Days later, still in pain, she went to the Augusta hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis. The psychology student is on a ventilator and has undergone a tracheotomy. Flesh-eating bacteria explained . A number of bacteria can cause the condition, which attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria are common in the environment but rarely cause an infection; when they do, the body's immune system is almost always able to fight them off, according to experts. Occasionally, however, the bacteria find their way into the bloodstream -- either through a cut or an abrasion. In such cases, doctors move aggressively, excising even healthy tissue near the infection site to ensure none of the dangerous bacteria remain. Necrotizing fasciitis is rare. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimated in a telephone interview on Wednesday that fewer than 250 cases occur each year in the United States, though such estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report .","Lana Kuykendall has undergone five surgeries to remove dead flesh .

"(CNN) -- The flip-flop over the non-mention, and now inclusion, in the Democratic platform of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel reflects just how silly and sensitive matters can become in an election year. The Obama folks were clearly tone deaf on this one, giving the Republicans a gratuitous advantage to question (yet again) the president's commitment to Israel. After the discord over its omission, the president himself ordered that Jerusalem be included in the platform. But he has already reaped the worst of both worlds: Having too cleverly tried to steer clear of traditional election year pressures on Jerusalem, the party is now seen to be capitulating to them. First, let's get something straight. The Jerusalem issue defies logic and rationality when it comes to our presidential elections. Presidential candidates say all kinds of things in order to win elections, including repeated commitments to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And then, once in office, they turn around and seek ways to avoid doing it. Despite all of the campaign rhetoric, no administration has changed the bottom line U.S. position on the embassy, or for that matter the status of Jerusalem, since 1967. Its fate is to be determined in negotiations. And here's a news flash for you. Should Mitt Romney become president and serious negotiations start between the Israelis and Palestinians, his position would conform to that of his predecessors, and might even go further to allow for Palestinian sovereignty in east Jerusalem. Democrats update platform with reference to Jerusalem . Second, what's so curious about the flap is that the Jerusalem issue is less relevant today than ever. There are no prospects for reviving serious Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Taking positions on Jerusalem is a thought experiment now. And most smart politicians understand this. Neither the Israeli prime minister nor the president of the Palestinian Authority are prepared to pay the price for a deal, let alone reach common ground, on Jerusalem, the peace process' most explosive issue. To add to that, the region is in turmoil. Iran's nuclear program is likely to be the big issue in 2013, not resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Jerusalem is likely to remain dormant for some time. Perhaps that's partly why this year's GOP platform doesn't spell out much in detail on Jerusalem. It says only that ""We envision two democratic states -- Israel with Jerusalem as its capital and Palestine."" That differs from the platform in 2008, when the GOP actively called for moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. That year the Democrats refrained from mentioning moving the embassy, but did assert that Jerusalem ""is and will remain the capital of Israel."" In fact, looking at past Democratic platforms, the last time the ""moving the embassy"" language appeared was in 1984. Still, it hardly mattered. Under the past three Republican presidents -- Reagan, Bush 41 and Bush 43 -- nothing was done about it. And it hardly matters on the substantive side, either. What will determine the future of Jerusalem depends almost entirely on the Israelis and the Palestinians and perhaps, if there's ever a peace process, the Arab states that have equities there too. Not to mention the views of the Muslim and Christian world, assuming they'd ever agree on anything regarding their respective holy sites. But rest assured, whatever is contained in any American political party's platform won't be very significant. Indeed, if I were an Israeli or Palestinian, I wouldn't count on any American statement on this or any other issue made during a political campaign. Clearly, the Jerusalem issue continues to resonate politically in the United States, particularly during campaign season. Does the omission of any reference to Jerusalem really say anything at all about Barack Obama and his party's commitment to Israel or a sea change on the Jerusalem issue? It is, indeed, intriguing that the 2008 Democratic Party platform stated that Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel and the 2004 and 2000 platforms contained very similar language, but this year the Democrats had, at first, dared to drop the reference. Mitt Romney was quick to blast the Democrats for the omission, claiming that the entire party ""has embraced President Obama's shameful refusal to acknowledge that Jerusalem is Israel's capital."" The initial omission, combined with White House press spokesman Jay Carney's fumbling the question about Israel's capital several months ago, might have strengthened many people's belief that Obama is changing American policy. But since American policy, pursued under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has always been that the city's final status will be determined in negotiations, you have to wonder what precisely those critics mean. The president has taken positions on borders and security, but not on Jerusalem, although it's hard to believe that his view will not be close to those of Bill Clinton, who thinks that east Jerusalem should be the capital of a Palestinian state with special arrangements for certain neighborhoods and Jewish holy sites. More likely, the platform's drafters wanted to steer clear of Jerusalem entirely and hoped nobody would notice. But of course they did. What planet were the drafters who omitted Jerusalem living on? It's silly season, the campaign is on, the Republicans see a wedge on Israel, and it's Jerusalem. Need I say more? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller: For some reason, the Democratic platform omitted Jerusalem, then included it .
The omission gave Romney an opening for questioning Obama's commitment ot Israel, he says .
But Jerusalem is hardly relevant now, he says, with peace talks dead and Iran the main issue .
Miller: Platforms don't matter, and politicians know Jerusalem's fate is not in their hands ."
"Rustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- One of the world's largest platinum mines in back is operation after a strike, its owner announced Monday, following police violence last week that left 34 workers dead. But production levels are ""insignificant,"" Lonmin executive vice president Mark Munroe said at a news conference after the announcement. ""To all intents and purposes, we are not producing ore,"" he said, acknowledging that the company will not meet platinum production targets for the year. The mood at the mine was ""stable but tense"" Monday, police said, after a strike over pay that has been marked by terrible violence. About 3,000 drillers and assistant drillers at the mine in South Africa went on strike on August 10. The miners, who earn $300 to $500 a month, want their salaries raised to $1,500 a month. Lonmin, the world's third-largest producer of platinum, said no to the increase and called the strike illegal. Almost a third of the workers at the Lonmin mine came to work Monday, the company-imposed deadline for strikers to return to their jobs. Munroe, the company executive, said Lonmin believed that most of the workers who stayed away had been intimidated, not because they were on strike. The company withdrew a threat to fire workers who did not come to work Monday, it said, following meetings with union representatives, and gave the striking workers an extra day to return. Last week, police fired on striking miners, killing 34 workers and wounding 78. They also arrested 259 on various charges, including malicious damage to property, armed robbery, illegal gathering and possession of weapons. Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega has said police ""were forced to utilize maximum force to defend themselves."" An executive with the Solidarity union Monday blamed violent protests at the mine on ""opportunists"" exploiting the strike. ""The protestors' violent behavior, the brutal murders of innocent people and the use of witch doctors and traditional murder weapons rather indicate a political motivation and opportunistic positioning instead of an attempt to negotiate a solution,"" said Gideon du Plessis, deputy general secretary of Solidarity. The striking rock drill operators belong to another union called AMCU. Lonmin said Sunday it was telling nonstriking workers that ""police consider it safe to report for duty again"" Monday morning and was ordering strikers to go back to work or face possible dismissals. Facing the ultimatum, one South African drill operator told CNN that he and his co-workers should honor their slain colleagues and hold out for a pay increase. ""Otherwise, they will have died in vain,"" Cingisile Makhaba said Sunday. Cyril Ramaphosa, an African National Congress executive committee member who owns shares in the mine, is donating $250,000 to pay for the funerals of those killed last week. But Makhaba said the money is ""of no use now. It won't bring back the dead."" ""Where is this money coming from?"" he asked. ""They should have used it to increase our wages."" Makhaba lives with his two children in a compound of one-room shacks he shares with eight other families. ""We work hard, but we live like animals,"" he said. Over the weekend, thousands of people gathered outside the platinum mine in anger over the shooting. The situation was calm but tense as police stood near the protest Saturday and helicopters conducted surveillance. The tragedy began unfolding a week ago when miners went on strike demanding pay increases at the mine in Marikana, near Rustenburg, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg. ""When there is a rock fall, it is generally the drillers who are the victims,"" wrote journalist Greg Marinovich in the Daily Maverick newspaper. ""It is the most dangerous job in the business."" The violence is thought to have been sparked by a rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in South Africa. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. Tensions at Marikana had mounted throughout the week. The striking miners carried traditional panga machetes and gathered Thursday around a small hill. By then, at least 10 other people were dead from incidents that had occurred in the days before. Among them were two police officers who were hacked to death. Journalists who were at Marikana said police seemed to be fed up with the miners and determined to resolve the issue. ""Yesterday the police were clear that today we are going to disarm them and remove them from the hill because the gathering is illegal,"" Xolile Mngambi, a reporter for CNN affiliate ETV, said Friday. By Thursday afternoon, another round of negotiations among the striking miners, the unions and Lonmin had failed. A heavily armed police tactical response team moved in to disperse the miners. To hear Phiyega, the police commissioner, describe it, the police weighed all their options and decided to fence in the miners with barbed wire -- to compartmentalize them into more manageable groups. ""The armed protesters moved toward the police,"" she said. ""They were driven back with tear gas and rubber bullets. But when they fired, police used maximum force."" But journalists at the scene could not say whether the protesters fired first. ""We cannot say to you the police were provoked,"" Mngambi said. Then, police unleashed a barrage of gunfire. One witness said it went on for three minutes.","NEW: The Lonmin mine is not producing ore, an executive vice president says .

"Moscow (CNN) -- There is no basic human right to barge into a church to make a political statement, jump around near the altar, and shout obscenities. But there is most certainly the right not to lose your liberty for doing so, even if the act is offensive. But that is exactly what happened Friday. A court in Moscow sentenced the three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to two years in prison. In my two decades monitoring human rights in Russia I've never seen anything like the Pussy Riot case -- the media attention, the outpouring of public support, the celebrity statements for the detained and criminally charged punk band members. The image of three young women facing down an inexorable system of unfair justice and an oppressive state has crystallized for many in the West what is wrong with human rights in Russia. To be sure, it is deeply troubling. For me, even more shocking were the images of Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer, lying on the sidewalk with the back of his head blown off in 2009, or the body of tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 after he blew the whistle on a massive government extortion scheme. The Pussy Riot case shines a much needed, if highly disturbing, spotlight on the issue of freedom of expression in post-Soviet Russia . On February 21, four members of the group performed what they call a ""punk prayer"" in Moscow's Russian Orthodox Christ the Savior Cathedral. They danced around and shouted some words to their song, ""Virgin Mary, Get Putin Out."" The stunt lasted less than a minute before the women were forcibly removed. The same day, a video widely shared on social media showed a montage of the stunt with the song spliced in. The song criticizes the Russian Orthodox Church's alleged close relationship with the Kremlin and the personally close relationship of President Vladimir V. Putin with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Three of the band members were tried on criminal ""hooliganism"" charges. Their trial was theater of the absurd. In their closing statements, the women and their lawyers delivered devastating critiques of the state of justice and civic freedoms in Russia. During the Soviet era, the human rights landscape in Russia was stark. But since then the situation has been harder to figure out, often making it easier for outsiders simply to give the government a pass. But the devil is in the details. It has been incredibly difficult to pin down any involvement of officials in the beatings and murders of investigative journalists and human rights activists. And the government, while not silencing civil society groups outright, tries to marginalize, discredit, and humiliate them, and crush them with heavy-handed bureaucracy, trumped-up accusations, threats and the like. Whatever misdemeanor the three women incurred for their antics in the church should not have been transformed by the authorities into a criminal offense that in effect punishes them for their speech. It's typical, though, of how the authorities try to keep a lid on controversial issues. The Russian think tank SOVA has documented dozens of cases in recent years in which the authorities used the threat of extremism charges to silence critics. This also isn't the first time Russian authorities have misused criminal legislation to stifle critical artistic expression. In 2010 a Moscow district court found the co-organizers of a controversial art exhibit guilty of the vague charge of ""inciting religious hatred."" The art exhibit organizers were fined. By making the Pussy Riot band members await trial in jail for almost six months, the authorities made clear how they plan to set boundaries for political criticism. After a winter of unprecedented, peaceful opposition protests, a dozen demonstrators whom the authorities claim were involved in a scuffle with police during a mass demonstration in May have been arrested and are being charged with crimes grossly disproportionate to their alleged actions. Police have searched opposition leaders' homes. Laws rammed through Russia's parliament this summer sent more signals: criminal liability for leaders of nongovernmental organizations for ""serious breaches"" of new restrictive regulations; much tougher sanctions for violating rules on public assembly; and new restrictions on the Internet that could easily shut down big social networking sites. Critics of the Kremlin have been subject to vicious harassment, intimidation and grotesque public smear campaigns. For years Russian human rights defenders have tried to draw attention to the lack of independence of the courts. With the unprecedented attention to the Pussy Riot trial, the surreal state of justice when political interests are at stake is there for all to see. What we really should be wondering isn't why Pussy Riot is so distinctive, but whether it's just the tip of the iceberg. Too often, foreign governments have resorted to wishful thinking about the direction Russia is heading. Talking about human rights at a high level -- where all things in Russia are decided -- is unpleasant business. It might be hard, but Russia won't respect other governments if they shy away. If three women in the defendants' cage had the courage to speak out about where Russia is headed, surely members of the international community should too. They, at least, won't be thrown in jail. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Denber.","Rachel Denber: no on should lose liberty for dancing on an altar to make a political statement .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In case you hadn't noticed, Washington is in the midst of a revolution. A new president, an economic meltdown. President Obama needs to take another look at the rules on lobbyists, Gloria Borger says. And, in short order, the following solutions proposed and implemented: an extensive bank bailout, a huge plan to salvage the careening housing market, a gargantuan $787 billion economic stimulus package. Big news, bigger headlines. More quietly though, there's this side of the Obama revolution: a plan to rid Washington of the outsize influence of all lobbyists. Make sure they're not a part of that evil revolving door, running the government agencies they once lobbied. And also make sure that lobbyists left on the outside don't unduly influence the new folks running the place. Translated (à la campaign jargon) that means: The days of crony government are over. The insiders are no longer in charge. You are. Good for you -- except it's not. This side of the Obama revolution has fallen prey to the laws of unintended consequences: First, the administration is discovering it can't get itself up and running without calling on some people with much-needed expertise. (See also: vacancies in top levels of almost every department.) Next, there's a revolt brewing among lobbyists (including the so-called do-gooders) who say they're being denied both government jobs as well as the constitutional right to petition just because they have ""lobbied"" in the past. They're right. The insanity is that these rules are now dangerously close to creating a problem for effective governance. Here's the dirty little secret: Those who lobby on specific issues are often the most knowledgeable on those issues. And they're getting shut out, no matter which side they're on. That's why Dave Wenhold, the president of the American League of Lobbyists, sent out a call to arms to fellow lobbyists recently. Seems the president signed a memo that laid out restrictions on the contacts between lobbyists and government officials in connection with the stimulus package -- including restrictions on telephone calls and meetings about individual project proposals. The goal may be full transparency in government, but the result could be chaos. Sure, the president wants the stimulus money to go only to worthy projects, but why not be allowed to get some help in navigating the government bureaucracy? In the end, these groups say, the process could move slower, not faster. After all, why keep a mayor from turning to a lobbyist who knows the system for help? In a strange marriage, the American Civil Liberties Union has joined with the lobbyists to declare this all constitutionally unacceptable. As Wenhold writes, ""There is an emerging pattern of industry segregation, discrimination, and actions that skirt the boundaries of our constitutional right to simply 'do our jobs.' Enough is enough!?"" So the revolutionary president has a revolt on his hands. From Republicans and moderate Democrats, on policy -- and from the permanent citizens of Washington's bureaucracy, the lobbyists. Obama officials will tell you that it's what they expected; change is never easy, after all. And they stand firm, taking some solace in history: In 1981-82, the Reagan Revolution came and didn't turn the country around quickly. The GOP got crushed in the 1982 midterm elections, but the president won a landslide in 1984. And President Clinton overreached on health care in 1993, and his party was swept out of control of the House in 1994. But by 1996, he won re-election easily. Now comes Obama, who is rolling the dice, just as Clinton predicted during the campaign -- on everything. And now that his own revolution is in gear, it's caused even some of his most ardent supporters to revolt. Worse, yet, it's hurting the staffing of his own government. Sure, change is what Obama called for, and it's clearly needed. But even revolutions need to be recalibrated once in a while. How about now?","Gloria Borger: President Obama needs to rethink crackdown on lobbyists' influence .

"(CNN) -- The German Bundesliga has overtaken the English Premier League as the most profitable in the world, according to financial analysts Deloitte. Despite predicting that the Premier League's revenue will top $2.8 billion in the season just gone, Deloitte said clubs' profitability has more than halved between the 2007-08 season and the 2008-09 campaign. Deloitte's annual review of football finance also showed that the total European football market grew to a record $19.3 billion in 2008-09. According to Dan Jones, a partner in the firm's Sports Business Group, the reason the Bundesliga has leapfrogged the Premier League is due to its clubs' control of wages. ""The simplest measure to explain why the Bundesliga has overtaken the Premier League is that their clubs exercise more restraint over the wage bill,"" he told CNN. ""In the Premier League, the wages to revenue ratio is 67 percent, but it is just 51 percent in the Bundesliga. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the licensing of clubs is stricter in Germany in terms of the financial regulations they have to adhere to. ""Secondly, rather than being private enterprises under the control of an individual, like Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, clubs are under control of the fans. ""The clubs' fans are required to own 50 percent plus one of the shares -- with the exception of Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen, who are owned by corporations."" Are English clubs worth the investment? Jones said the Premier League should be ""streets ahead"" of its German counterpart in profitability, due to the huge television revenue it receives. But Deloitte's figures show that although Premier League clubs managed to increase their revenue by three percent in 2008-09, operating profits were reduced from $267 million in 2007-08 to $114 million in 2008-09. This is largely due to increased wage levels, with statistics revealing the $70 million increase in Premier League clubs' revenue was less than half the $190 million increase in wage costs. Deloitte believes that trend cannot continue, but predicts the Premier League's new broadcast contracts will drive revenue up to over $3 billion in 2010-11. Fans keep football afloat . So, why does football seem to be immune to the financial pressures being felt by many industries across the globe? ""Football has got an incredible amount of customer loyalty, which helps. A lot of clubs have been fairly good at freezing or cutting their prices,"" Jones said. ""It is a fairly accepted truth that live sports audiences are about as good as it gets for broadcasters. People will get together to watch it, it inspires those water-cooler moments. ""If you want live sports as a broadcaster then you're going to want the biggest sport in the world, and if you want the biggest league in the world then you want the Premier League."" 'Spectacular mismanagement' As for Portsmouth, who became the first club in Premier League history to sink into administration this season and were subsequently relegated, Jones thinks their situation was an anomaly. ""We see clubs get into difficulty because performance on the pitch is poor, with relegation and the like, but with Portsmouth actually performing well and winning an FA Cup, for them to be in this situation it has to be a fairly spectacular case of mismanagement."" Deloitte also warned that Premier League clubs would have make the necessary adjustments to their business plans to meet European governing body UEFA's target of becoming ""break even"" by 2013-14.","German Bundesliga overtakes the English Premier League as world's most profitable .
Deloitte say this is due to the German clubs' tighter control on wages .

"(CNN) -- Despite deep concerns about the economic impact of the looming fiscal cliff and months of talks leading up to this point, Democrats and Republicans are leaving town until after the November elections without making any significant progress resolving their main sticking points. Meanwhile, economists warn that left unresolved, the fiscal situation could push the country back into a recession. Lawmakers have said for months that no decisions on taxes, spending and entitlement reform can be made until after voters do their job on Election Day and decide who will control the levers of power at the White House and on Capitol Hill. ""Elections matter,"" said one top Senate aide involved in bipartisan efforts to come up with various contingency plans depending on the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections. Fiscal cliff spending cuts: How Americans would be hit . The enormity and complexity of the fiscal cliff -- which would happen at the end of the year when the Bush tax cuts expire, trillion dollars in automatic spending cuts are triggered and a handful of other thorny tax and spending issues need to be addressed -- are worsened by the partisan gridlock that led to it in the first place. Most of the policy choices are well known to the lawmakers who were involved in the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction commission, the so-called ""Gang of Six"" talks, the bipartisan super committee negotiations and other recent failed attempts to reach a grand bargain to reduce the debt. The real question is whether policymakers can return after the election and find a common path forward. If former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney wins the White House it is likely Congress will agree to avoid the fiscal cliff by extending current policies for several months to give the new president time to put his stamp on the outcome, several lawmakers and aides said. But if President Barack Obama wins and the makeup of Congress remains close to what it is now, negotiators could try to make headway during the post-election lame duck session. Whether they can cut a deal during the few weeks after the election and before the end of the year is uncertain. Fiscal cliff threatens small businesses . ""I haven't seen any real successes in a lame duck in a long time, so I don't expect any this time,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Finance Committee. ""There's a lot of polarization as we speak."" One of several moderate senators retiring at the end of this term said he didn't think a deal could be reached, either. ""I'm not optimistic that will happen because this is a kick-the-can-down-the-road Congress,"" said Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska. ""The best you're going to get is to kick it down the road one more time."" Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee and a leader of the Gang of Six, is pushing a plan that would have Congress agree in a lame duck session to ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in spending cuts and new taxes as a ""down payment"" on the work congressional committees would do next year to lower the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. He said GOP members of the Gang of Six support his proposal. Other senators have raised the idea of a down payment that would buy time for Congress to consider an overhaul of the tax code and replace the automatic spending cuts with more targeted cuts. ""I think there will be a Band-Aid solution to get us into the new Congress,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who is fighting defense cuts required by sequestration. ""I'm not a big fan of a lame duck Congress structurally reforming the entire nation."" Boehner 'not confident at all' on budget deal . Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he's never seen a lame duck session ""that's had any degree of success"" and said the only thing that could change that is ""if the markets start to react."" On that point, some Democratic aides have begun to argue that while the situation is very serious, people shouldn't panic immediately about the January deadline because the fiscal cliff may be more of a slope that will gradually take effect as expiring tax cuts are felt in paychecks and cuts to federal programs take hold. They argue it is not comparable to the financial crisis of 2008 that led to sharp drops on Wall Street and a controversial federal bailout of many banks. In the meantime, members of the Senate Finance Committee this week met with top officials from the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke as they continued to lay the groundwork for lame duck negotiations. On the House side, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Michigan, met with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to do the same. At a news conference Thursday two Senate Democratic leaders offered up both optimism that a deal would prevent the fiscal cliff and pessimism that hardened ideologies will stand in the way. ""I understand how we come together in times of crisis,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""I do not believe that we're gonna go over the fiscal cliff."" But Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, who co-chaired the super committee, raised questions about whether Republicans would ever agree to tax increases, something many Democrats insist must be part of a final deal. ""There is one solution to this and everyone knows it. We need to have both revenue and reductions on the page, and so far revenue has not been there because Republicans have refused to,"" she said.

"London (CNN) -- Where can you buy a large punk rock head complete with pink Mohawk haircut, Mary Poppins' coat and umbrella, and a pair of competition boxing gloves used by elite athletes? The answer is the London Olympic Games auction site where organizers are selling off everything from the discus and javelins thrown by competitors to props and costumes used in the opening ceremony. Although the Games closed Sunday with the Olympic flag being handed over to the 2016 host city of Rio de Janeiro, enthusiasm for the London Olympics appears to be as strong as during the last two weeks when competitors performed in front of packed stadia and to a global audience of millions. With only a few hours left in one sale, more than £3,000 ($4,709) has been bid for the basketball used in the men's final won by the U.S. in a close-fought game with Spain. It remains to be seen whether these bids are completed, but another enthusiast has offered double the basketball price for a limited edition of a 2012 Olympic torch signed by Bradley Wiggins -- the British cyclist who added the time trial gold medal to his victory in this year's Tour de France. Another bidder says they are prepared to pay £3,000 ($4,709) for a two-meter high sculpture of Wenlock -- one of the 2012 mascots -- and £456 ($716) is the current price for a set of goal posts used in the handball final. The London Olympics organizing committee, LOCOG, says the money raised so far has helped subsidize the costs of torches and torchbearers and also contributes towards hosting the giant sporting festival. Organizers say building the venues, improving infrastructure and staging the event cost in excess of £9 billion ($14 billion) with the cash coming from both public funds and through sponsorship, ticket sales, merchandizing and the sale of media rights. ""There has been a lot of interest on the site and it's great to see people want to own a piece of Olympic history,"" said a LOCOG spokesperson. ""We've had 1,735 different items put up for sale...and the biggest seller has been the torches."" Flags, balls, boxing headgear, athletes' signed photos -- even a farmer's sickle from the pastoral scene at the opening -- are still up for grabs. But you will need very deep pockets for some of the items. A bronze medal from the St. Louis Games in 1904 which is advertised on the site is currently attracting a bid of £20,000 ($31,404).","More than £3,000 ($4,709) has been bid for the basketball used in the men's Olympic final won by the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich continued their 100 per cent start to the Bundesliga season with an impressive 2-0 win over Schalke in Gelsenkirchen Saturday. The heavyweight clash before a capacity crowd at the Veltins Arena was expected to be a testing encounter for Jupp Heynckes team, but two goals just short of the hour mark from Tony Kroos and Thomas Mueller eased their passage. It left Bayern on a maximum 12 points after four games, heading Eintracht Frankfurt, 2-1 winners at Nuremberg Friday, on goal difference. Two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund lost ground with a 3-2 defeat at Hamburg to leave them five points adrift of the leading pair. Bayern had been the better side in the first half with the Royal Blues of Schalke unable to create a clear cut opening. German international pair Kroos and Mueller looked dangerous throughout and it was their combination that led to the 55th minute opener. Mueller played in Kroos to beat Lars Unnerstall with a low shot and three minutes later he was also on the score sheet with a fine individual goal. Mueller might have scored a second with a clever back heel, but his team were already guaranteed three points to follow on from their impressive 2-1 Champions Leauge win over Valencia in midweek. Meanwhile, Dortmund's 31-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end at struggling Hamburg, who had been without a win. South Korea's Son Heung-Min scored twice for the home side, including the clinching third. Ivo Ilicevic was also on target for the northerners while Croatia's Ivan Perisic twice equalized for Dortmund. Mainz also secured their first win of the season as they beat Augsburg 2-0, while in other matches Fortuna Duesseldorf and Freiburg were goalless and Felix Magath's Wolfsburg drew 1-1 with promoted Greuther Fuerth.","Bayern Munich win 2-0 at Schalke in Germany's Bundesliga .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For 8-year-old Ryan Mohar, an elevator isn't just an elevator. He spends hours pressing the buttons and riding up and down, preferring this to the slew of alternatives that his teachers offer -- even candy. Ryan Mohar, who has autism, gets treated with ABA approaches at the Marcus Autism Center. Ryan is one of many American children with autism, a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors or limited interests, and difficulties with communication and social interactions. At the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, Ryan and other children with communication and behavior difficulties get help through a rigorous empirical method called Applied Behavior Analysis. ""Decades of research has shown that that is the treatment of choice, and results in the best gains in terms of skill acquisition and behavior problem reduction for kids with autism and other developmental disabilities,"" said Alice Shillingsburg, program coordinator of the center's Language and Learning Clinic. The effectiveness and nature of ABA is particularly relevant as many parents fight for insurance companies to cover it and other autism treatments. The organization Autism Speaks has endorsed bills in 25 states that would require private health insurance policies to cover the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders for anyone under the age of 21. The legislation would specifically be targeted at ABA and other structured autism therapies. Only eight states have autism insurance reform, according to Autism Speaks. While ABA encompasses a broad range of practices of studying and changing behavior, the one usually associated with autism is called discrete trial instruction. A trial consists of a cue, the opportunity to respond and a reward.  Watch therapists using applied behavior analysis on Ryan » . For example, a therapist might try to teach a child who likes sweets to request candy. The trial gets repeated over and over so that the child learns that candy comes only as a result of the request. The clinicians at Marcus Autism Center carefully record how many trials the child successfully completes.  Learn more about autism » . ""If suddenly they can emit some vocal response, and suddenly when they do that, candy appears -- someone delivers candy to them -- that's a very powerful response for that child,"" said Nathan Call, director of Behavior Treatment Clinics at the Marcus Autism Center. Analysts examine progress based on such data at least once a day -- sometimes five or six times a day -- and will change the treatment plan if necessary. In Ryan's case, a trial begins when his clinical specialist takes him near the elevator and asks him to hand over a card -- his way of requesting access to the elevator. If Ryan gives the card, he gets to go to the elevator, and that is the end of one trial. If he does not, his helpers walk him away, and a new trial begins. Experts working with Ryan hope that teaching him to ask for the things he enjoys -- elevator rides, elevator buttons -- will help him stop running away, which he does even at home. In fact, Ryan wears a GPS-equipped ankle bracelet so that police can track him if he gets far from home. ABA is very effective, but the term ""cure"" is inaccurate, experts said. Autism describes a broad range of characteristics, not an underlying cause, Call said. ABA techniques can produce significant behavior changes, however. ""The goal is not necessarily for the child to have hit all of their developmental milestones, necessarily, but rather it's hopefully to get them to a point where they're able to take advantage of a more typical or less restrictive educational environment,"" he said. Studies have shown that 60 percent of high-functioning children can lose their diagnosis of autism by age 8 by using ABA, according to the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a leading center in autism research and treatment in Baltimore, Maryland. Not everyone is so enthusiastic about ABA, however. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, associate professor of pediatric neurology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, cautions that the treatment should fit the child, and ABA may not work as well for some children as other types of therapy. An alternative approach is play-based therapy, whereby the therapist takes cues from the child rather than the other way around. For example, if a child is bouncing a ball, the therapist would take that as an opportunity to encourage the child to bounce the ball back to him or her, Wiznitzer said. One of the pioneers of ABA is Ivar Lovaas, a child psychologist who in the 1960s began investigating how to help children who injured themselves. His research showed that components of ABA could reduce these behaviors. The therapy has evolved since then, however. In the beginning, the approach to ABA was more dogmatic and ""cookie-cutter,"" Wiznitzer said. A child who cooperated got a reward, but a child who did not cooperate got a punishment such as yelling or a squirt of water. ""ABA in a classic sense is a very restricted, very limited program that has issues with the ability to generalize the learned skill outside of the ABA environment,"" he said. A family once told him that their child showed great restaurant manners -- but only in the basement, he said. Today, many analysts who use ABA as a guide go more with the flow of the needs of the child, he said. ABA isn't just for children with autism -- the methods have been used for people of all ages, with and without disabilities. Staff members at Marcus Autism Center try to help children use the skills they learn outside of the artificial environment of the classroom. ""They're doing research here on finding the best way to create those moments where the child really needs information in order to complete a preferred task or to gain access to a preferred activity or a preferred outcome,"" Call said. Another criticism of ABA is that children become mechanical because they learn to have only one specific response for a given prompt in real life. Call's response is that variability is just another behavior that can be taught, but noted that there are trade-offs. Parents have input in the decision to focus more on teaching a lot of different skills, rather than to teach several responses in any one situation. ""Oftentimes, the goal is to focus more on giving as many functional skills as possible to that child, so they can have as fulfilling a life as they can,"" Call said. ABA is extremely costly, however. For the behavior clinics, therapy sessions at Marcus Autism Center begin at $60 per hour, and go higher in price depending on the expert who is providing the treatment -- a session with someone with a master's or doctorate may cost more. A person with autism costs society about $3.2 million over the course of his or her lifetime, according to a 2007 study in the journal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. Direct medical costs for the first five years are, on average, about $35,000, the study said. For children from non-English-speaking families, two staff members at Marcus Autism Center speak Spanish, and an outside translator can be brought in if necessary for other languages, said Chris Tullis, a clinical specialist. But the Association for Behavior Analysis International told CNN that it does not have any ""board-certified therapists"" in Atlanta who report speaking Spanish. As for Ryan, after only about two weeks at Marcus Autism Center, his screaming has come down from more than 200 times an hour to about 38, Call said. ""It looks promising, but we've got 10 more weeks to actually find out what's really going to work the best with Ryan,"" Tullis said.","Applied behavior analysis is a rigorous empirical method to teach behaviors .

"(CNN) -- Is a star player more important than team unity? England's cricketers will find out the answer to that question over the next five days as they battle to retain the No. 1 Test ranking without key batsman Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen, one of the most flamboyant and controversial players in the game, has been dropped for the showdown with South Africa -- the country of his birth -- after falling out with his teammates. England's preparations for the third and final Test of the series, which they must win to stop the Proteas taking top spot, have been dominated by a scandal over derogatory text messages, an ill-advised YouTube video and a parody Twitter account. All of which involved Pietersen in some form. The 32-year-old issued an apology on Wednesday for sending text messages to the South African players during the drawn second Test which apparently criticized England captain Andrew Strauss -- who celebrates his 100th appearance in the five-day game at Lord's this week. But it was too late to stop him being thrown out of the squad and now seemingly unlikely to be named on Saturday in England's team for the Twenty 20 World Cup in Sri Lanka starting next month. ""I did send what you might call provocative texts to my close friends in the SA team,"" said Pietersen. ""The texts were meant as banter between close friends. I need to rein myself in sometimes. I apologize to Straussy and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts. I truly didn't mean to cause upset or tension particularly with important games at stake."" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), however, has refused to say whether Pietersen will ever play for England again. ""We are in receipt of Kevin's apology, but further discussions need to take place to establish whether it is possible to regain the trust and mutual respect required to ensure all parties are able to focus on playing cricket and to maintain the unity of purpose that has served us so well in recent years,"" said ECB managing director Hugh Morris. ""Critically, those discussions should take place behind closed doors, rather than in the media spotlight. ""A successful conclusion to this process is in everyone's best interests and is required for Kevin Pietersen's potential selection in all forms of the game to be considered."" The South Africa series presents England's biggest challenge since regaining the number one ranking last year. Strauss' side lost the first Test and drew the second, with Pietersen scoring a defiant 149 before making an unexpected statement at the press conference casting doubt over his international future. ""It's tough for me in this dressing room,"" he said . Rumors of ""provocative"" text messages sent to some of the South African players increased the pressure on Pietersen. The South African camp, however, dismissed the texts and claimed that the ECB hadn't even asked them to see the messages before they dropped Pietersen. ""Text messages were sent, but it was banter,"" said team manager Mohammed Moosajee. ""The ECB has not made a formal approach to see the text messages as is currently being reported in the media."" Pietersen has always been a controversial figure, with England's management tolerating him due to his undeniable talent. He is one of a handful of England players to play in the lucrative Indian Premier League -- where he plays alongside several of the South African players -- and earlier this year retired from the national team's one-day and Twenty 20 teams, apparently so he could play more limited-overs cricket in India and Australia. In a remarkable turn of events on Saturday, Pietersen released a YouTube video in which he reversed his retirement, committed himself to English cricket and attempted to explain some of the recent controversy. Crucially, he failed to apologize for the text messages. ""I've had a change of heart because I love playing cricket for England, I love being part of a successful England team,"" said Pietersen. ""It would be sad for me to finish with the way things have been running through the media in the last three or four days -- it would be sad to end my career like this. ""So sitting down with my family, my advisers, my close friends, we've decided and I've decided it would be a lot better to finish my career on a positive note rather than one that's being developed at the moment."" The video didn't go far enough for the ECB, who instead called up promising youngster Jonny Bairstow. Pietersen is a regular on microblogging site Twitter, but was said to be furious when a parody account was set up -- called ""KP Genius"" -- and it was followed by several senior England players. The were suggestions that one of Pietersen's colleagues was responsible for the account, which had joked that Pietersen was motivated solely by money and thought he was better than the rest of the England squad. Eventually, a man called Richard Bailey, who describes himself as ""an England cricket fan,""admitted he set up the account. To further complicate matters Stuart Broad, captain of England's Twenty 20 side, is friends with Bailey. The ECB was forced to put out a statement on Broad's behalf on Tuesday, less than 36 hours before the crucial Test got under way, denying any involvement with the account. ""Following the statement by Mr. Richard Bailey that he was responsible for creating a parody Twitter account in Kevin Pietersen's name, I would like to confirm that I had no involvement in this whatsoever,"" said Broad. ""I met with the managing director of England cricket, Hugh Morris, and assured him that I did not play any role in the creation of this account or provide Mr. Bailey with any information regarding Kevin Pietersen or the England team. ""As has been widely reported Mr. Bailey is a friend of mine, but we had no conversations regarding this issue at all and I am pleased that he has now decided to close the parody account down."" South Africa captain Graeme Smith described the situation as ""amazing,"" and claimed that in the visitors' dressing room the matter has ""hardly been discussed."" ""From our perspective it's just been so overboard really. I can't believe it's still carrying on,"" he said. Smith, who is due to captain his country for a record-breaking 94th time at Lord's, described Pietersen as ""world class, and warned England that it would be ""wrong"" to say ""they're not going to miss him.""","England and South Africa are the top two ranked sides in world cricket .

"(CNN) -- Champions Spain began the defense of their World Cup title with a hard fought 1-0 win against Georgia in Tbilisi on Tuesday. Playing their first qualifier in Group I, the 2010 World Cup winners had to wait until the 86th minute before striker Roberto Soldado finally broke down a stubborn Georgian side. For much of the game, the home team, who hit the post early in the second half, defended with 10 men behind the ball against a side who retained their European Championship crown in July. Goalkeeper Giorgi Loria had proved an immovable barrier but after he was replaced due to injury late in the second half, substitute Cesc Fabregas teed up Soldado to sweep home. The win maintains Spain's two-year unbeaten run in competitive matches, which stretches back to their 1-0 loss against Switzerland in their opening game at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Spain are second in their group, three points behind 1998 champions France, who won their second match in four days when overcoming a second-half wobble to beat Belarus 3-1 in Paris, with goals from Etienne Capoue, Christophe Jallet and Franck Ribery. In London, England suffered a scare when trailing Ukraine for long periods before Frank Lampard scored a late penalty to earn a 1-1 draw, after Yevgen Konoplianka had curled home in the first half. England captain Steven Gerrard was sent off for a second yellow card shortly after Lampard's penalty, as a first competitive game at Wembley for coach Roy Hodgson lacked the feelgood factor that has accompanied local sportsmen in London in recent weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics. Hodgson's predecessor Fabio Capello enjoyed a more fruitful evening as his new Russian side won 4-0 in Israel while their next opponents -- and main Group F rivals Portugal -- needed late goals from Helder Postiga and Bruno Alves to add gloss to a labored 3-0 win over Azerbaijan in Braga. Italy, the runners-up at this year's Euro 2012, were another leading nation who struggled to overcome less fancied opponents, as a stoppage-time own goal helped the four time world champions to a 2-0 win over islanders Malta. One of Tuesday's more intriguing games took place in Lucerne, where hosts Switzerland beat Albania 2-0 to go top of Group E. Build-up to the game had been dominated by the issue of players with Kosovan heritage, with six starting the match for Albania and three more for Switzerland -- midfield trio Granit Xhaka, Valon Behrami and Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri. Born to ethnic Albanian parents from Kosovo, Shaqiri was constantly booed by the sizable away support until the Bayern Munich player silenced them when opening the scoring after 23 minutes. Elsewhere, big guns Germany maintained their 100% start in Group C when beating Austria 2-1 in Vienna, while Serbia stunned Group A rivals Wales with a 6-1 win in Novi Sad but the night's biggest winners were Montenegro, who won 6-0 in San Marino.","Spain win 1-0 in Georgia thanks to 86th minute strike from Roberto Soldado .

"(CNN) -- New Zealander Warren Gatland was appointed head coach of the British and Irish Lions Tuesday ahead of the rugby team's tour of Australia next year. The Wales coach, whose confirmation in the role was delayed after breaking both his heels in an accident in April, will start his role with immediate effect -- but has arranged to lead out the Welsh for two final matches against New Zealand and Australia in late 2012. The 2013 tour will mark the 125th anniversary of the Lions, who are a selection of the best players from the England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The tours only take place once every four years, with the destinations rotating between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The 48-year-old, who has spent over two decades working in British rugby, is only the second man from outside the United Kingdom to be appointed to lead the Lions -- following in the footsteps of compatriot Graham Henry, who led the team in 2001. ""I am really honored to have been asked to take the position of head coach for the 2013 British & Irish Lions Tour to Australia,"" Gatland told gathered reporters. ""A Lions tour is unique. It is the ultimate career pinnacle for coaches and players. I want to ensure that we get the tour environment right so that we are hugely competitive and that our fans are proud of their team."" Gatland worked as an assistant coach when the Lions last traveled, which ended with a 2-1 series defeat to South Africa in 2009. There will once again be three decisive games against Australia, taking place in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, but the tour will incorporate a total of ten matches in all -- taking in games against regional and clubs sides to warm up for the international tests. Australia, who have won the World Cup on two occasions (in 1991 and 1999), are currently ranked No.2 in the world behind the New Zealand ""All Blacks"", who won last year's World Cup on home soil. The Lions have lost their last three tours to Australia and New Zealand and were last successful there back in 1989. ""There is no question it will be one hell of a challenge,"" Gatland added. ""Playing in the southern hemisphere is one of rugby's hardest challenges."" After winning two Six Nations titles with Wales, as well as steering English club side Wasps to European glory, Gatland's potential role as Lions coach was thrown into doubt when breaking his heels after falling while cleaning windows at his beach house in New Zealand. He needed reconstructive surgery to repair his right leg, but Lions tour manager Andy Irvine is convinced he will be up to the arduous task. ""It has been no secret that after the initial selection process Warren was our preferred candidate,"" Irvine said. ""However, his unfortunate accident earlier this year in New Zealand during the selection process did delay the appointment. We naturally had to ensure he would be fit to take up the post. Those concerns have now been addressed.""

"(CNN) -- Taoufik Makhloufi stormed to gold in the 1500-meters, making the most of his reinstatement after initially being thrown out of the Olympics for not trying hard enough. The Algerian middle distance runner was expelled from the Games on Monday after the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said he didn't give his all in heats for the 800m. Makhloufi had tried to withdraw from the heat but didn't meet the deadline. He completed just 200m of the race before pulling out, prompting the IAAF to act. But after evidence submitted by a medical officer from the Games organizers, LOCOG, Makhloufi was reinstated and made the most of his reprieve by taking his first Olympic title. Day eleven of the Olympics as it happened . American Leonel Manzano grabbed the silver medal while Morocco's Abdelati Iguider took bronze. Sally Pearson asserted her dominance in the women's 100m hurdles by winning Australia's first track and field gold of the 2012 Games. Pearson, the reigning world champion, set a new Olympic record time of 12.35 seconds, narrowly beating defending champion Dawn Harper of the United States while another American, Kellie Wells, claimed bronze. ""I don't even know how to describe it because it's like a dream right now,"" she told the host broadcaster. ""I really wanted this tonight, I've worked so hard for the last two years. ""My goals were last year to win the world champs and this year to win the Olympic Games and I've done that and I couldn't be happier."" Robert Harting won the men's discus final with a throw of 68.18m to hand Germany their first athletics gold of the Games. The 27-year-old kept up his formidable record in the sport, having not been beaten in two years, and celebrated by jumping some of the hurdles that were on the track during his lap of honor. Ehsan Hadadi came second to give Iran their first ever Olympic medal in athletics while defending champion Gerd Kanter of Estonia took the bronze medal. In the men's high jump, Russia's Ivan Ukhov took gold with a leap of 2.38 meters, edging America's Erik Kynard into second. Qatari Mutaz Essa Barshim, Derek Drouin of Canada and Great Britain's Robbie Grabarz shared the bronze. Usain Bolt, who successfully retained his 100-meter title on Sunday, began the defense of his 200m title easing through his heat, shortly before fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake. Team USA's Maurice Mitchell clinched the third heat, while France's Christophe Lemaitre clocked the fastest time of the morning to win his heat. The women's 200-meter semifinals were also held ahead of the final Wednesday. American sprinters Sanya Richards Ross, Allyson Felix and Carmelita Jeter will likely battle with Jamaica's Veronica Campbell-Brown and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce for the medals after clocking fast times to qualify.","Taoufik Makhloufi wins gold in the 1500m after being reinstated to the Games .

"(CNN) -- Three people wounded in the July mass shooting at a Colorado multiplex are suing the theater owner, claiming that security was lax the night a gunman opened fire and killed 12 people. Two lawsuits filed Friday against Cinemark USA Inc., owner of Century Aurora 16, allege negligence on the part of the corporation because the theater lacked adequate security or sufficient alarm systems. ""Although the theater was showing a midnight premier of the movie and was expecting large crowds of people to attend the midnight showing, no security personnel were present for that showing,"" according to both lawsuits, which were filed by the same law firm. ""The exterior doors to the theater were lacking in any alarm system, interlocking security systems, or any other security or alarm features."" James Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire on a crowded theater during the July 20 midnight showing of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Fifty-eight people were wounded in the attack. The lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado on behalf of Joshua Nowlan, Denise Traynom and Brandon Axelrod. Iraq war veteran Nowlan, 31, and newlyweds Axelrod, 30, and Traynom, 24, were at the theater together when the shooting occurred. ""Josh helped me protect my wife, and he got shot. It wasn't expected. But I'm glad he was there with us because the three of us together, we piled on each other and we kept each other safe. And you know, luck or faith, whatever you want to call it, kept us alive,"" Axelrod told CNN in an interview shortly after the shooting. ""Josh, while we were hugging each other in the aisle, got hit in the arm. And at some point, because he's so tall and lanky, he got hit in the leg, as well."" The Denver law firm of Keating, Wagner, Polidori & Free, filed the lawsuits: One on behalf of Nowlan, the other on behalf of Traynom and Axelrod. According to the lawsuits, the gunman was able to go in and out of the theater several times undetected to retrieve a ""virtual arsenal of weapons, including, but not limited to, one or more fully loaded shotguns, an AR-15 assault rifle, one or more fully loaded, automatic Glock handguns, and several tear gas canisters."" Nowlan's right arm was nearly severed by a bullet, Traynom was shot in the buttocks and Axelrod injured his knee and ankle, according to the lawsuits. The lawsuits also allege that the theater's security guards were given the night off, even though there had been several previous criminal incidents. The lawsuits are seeking ""amount which will fully and fairly compensate each of them for damages, losses and injuries"" on behalf of the three victims. The lawsuits were filed the same day that Cinemark officials announced a plan to reconfigure the movie theater and reopen it by the beginning of next year.","Two lawsuits allege security guards were given the night off .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Newt Gingrich is on the ropes, Tim Pawlenty's dropped the gloves, and Mitt Romney will be in the middle. It doesn't matter that Sarah Palin, Rudy Giuliani and Jon Huntsman decided to stay home. The game is on. No more hedging statements, exploratory committees, or one more discussion with the family before deciding to jump into the water headfirst. The final boxes have been checked -- save for Michele Bachmann. For the six others, the race for the GOP presidential nomination begins Monday night at the CNN/WMUR/New Hampshire Union Leader debate. Voters will be looking for the candidates to deliver answers on the pressing issues facing the nation, and Republican viewers will be watching for a candidate to take on President Obama in 2012. Early polling shows GOP voters are not exactly enamored with the current field. Perhaps that would change if Palin and Giuliani decided to run. Huntsman told my CNN colleague Candy Crowley the other day that he is on the verge of making it official. He will run for president. An announcement is expected in the coming days. The former Utah governor sees the lack of enthusiasm with the current field as an opening, as long as GOP primary voters don't punish him for serving as Obama's ambassador to China. It is very early in the contest, but still much is at stake: for the ""front-runner,"" the ""perceived alternative,"" the ""wounded,"" the ""I told you so,"" the ""unknowns,"" and ""those waiting in the wings."" Here are five things to look for Monday night that will help shape the race for the Republican presidential nomination: . Pawlenty vs. Romney: For months, we in the media have speculated that Tim Pawlenty is setting himself up to be the alternative to front-runner Mitt Romney, a fellow former governor. While Romney must battle criticism that he is a flip-flopper, Pawlenty is trying to overcome the perception that he lacks the edge needed to be a strong leader. Pawlenty showed the sharpness of his political knife Sunday, when he accused Romney of devising the framework for Obama's health care law. And he coined a new word for the political dictionary: ""Obamneycare."" Pawlenty will try to show that he not only has the policy chops, but is politically tough and savvy, an important trait some GOP voters will be looking for in their nominee to take on Obama. But Pawlenty must be careful he does not overreach in his criticism. Romney, who will be center stage, must successfully weather the expected attacks, punch back and effectively promote his CEO creds. Romney, a successful businessman, is basing his campaign largely on his ability to fix the economy -- the No. 1 issue facing this nation. Monday night, he will have the opportunity to sell it to a national audience and try to distinguish himself from his rivals. The wounded: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made a politically questionable decision to take a Mediterranean cruise during this critical building period of his newly launched campaign. When Gingrich returned, his staff fired him, because they did not think he was committed to the campaign. There is no question that Gingrich, a former college professor, is an intellect. He is a policy-making machine, but the former speaker needs to show tonight that he is unshakable during a time of crisis, and convince primary voters that the staff resignations are an inside-baseball story and he has the CEO qualities needed to run the nation. Expect Gingrich to follow Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment, which dictated ""thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican,"" and instead focus his criticism squarely on Obama. Gingrich's goal is to try to convince GOP voters he is the best candidate to defeat the president in 2012 and the most experienced to deal with the woes that face the nation. ""I told you so"": At this time four years ago, Ron Paul was a minor candidate, at odds with his own party, who was running a presidential campaign on a shoestring budget. Times have changed, and so has Paul's status in the GOP field. Instead of polling in the low single digits, he is now in the mid- to high-single digits, is raising money at a healthy pace, and is no longer considered a fringe candidate. What happened? Well, his message seems to have resonated beyond his eclectic group of supporters made up of young adults, anti-war activists and libertarian-minded Americans. He says the country is embracing his views, especially his opposition to the wars and calls for U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan. Tonight, Paul will be the same Paul that stood on this same stage in Manchester four years ago, except this time, he has more support and more money. But his message will be the same -- and don't be surprised if he says ""I told you so."" The unknowns: Rick Santorum once held a senior Republican leadership position in the Senate, Michele Bachmann is a member of Congress, and Herman Cain is a successful businessman-turned-talk show host. Each is well known in social conservative circles and is vying for the support of this key voting bloc. Yet these three Republicans are not household names. They face the difficult task Monday night of striking a balance -- delivering red-meat rhetoric at the same time they're introducing themselves to a broader audience. Bachmann, Cain and Santorum are competing for the same voters and thus risk splitting the vote three ways. Monday night, each will make a targeted pitch claiming to be the true social conservative, in the hopes of cementing that status with this important voting bloc. Waiting in the wings: What will they say during and after the debate? Will Sarah Palin post a statement on Facebook criticizing the policies put forward by the debate participants? Perhaps praise them? Will Giuliani weigh in on the debate or simply ignore it? And will Huntsman, who is just days away from joining the field, pick apart his future rivals' answers? Betting money is that Giuliani remains mum, Huntsman offers a critique, and Palin will have something to say -- on her Facebook page.","Early polling shows Republicans aren't totally enamored with the field .
Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani, who haven't announced, poll high among GOP voters .
Front-runner Mitt Romney must weather expected attacks and counterpunch effectively .
Don't be surprised if Ron Paul says, ""I told you so"""
"(CNN) -- Bee Gees star Robin Gibb is in a coma and has pneumonia, the latest turn in health issues that include a recent battle with colon and liver cancer, according to a message Saturday on his website. Doctors believe that Gibb, 62, has a secondary tumor, his representative Doug Wright said, confirming a news account in The Sun in the United Kingdom. Gibb had emergency surgery in 2010 for a blocked bowel and then had more surgery for a twisted bowel, Wright confirmed. ""We are all hoping and praying that he will pull through,"" said the message on Gibb's website, which noted that reports ""are true"" about Gibb being in a coma and having contracted pneumonia. News of Gibb's condition elicited a flood of support on social network sites and in the music community. Peter Frampton, who like the Bee Gees rose to fame in the 1970s, wrote on Twitter, ""My positive thoughts go out to Robin Gibb and all of the Gibb family. I am wishing you the best and hope for a quick recovery. Much love 2 U."" Others offering their thoughts and prayers online included Julian Lennon, the son of John Lennon, and former Jackson 5 member Jackie Jackson. Diane Warren -- who herself has written and produced dozens of popular songs for a wide range of performers, including Aretha Franklin and Justin Bieber -- described Gibb as ""one of the best songwriters of all time."" Robin Gibb's twin brother, Maurice, died in 2003 of a twisted bowel. Brother Andy died at age 30 from a heart infection. The Brothers Gibb -- calling themselves the Bee Gees -- soared to renown as one of the most successful British groups after the 1977 film ""Saturday Night Fever"" starring John Travolta was built around the group's disco songs. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, the Bee Gees have sold more than 200 million albums, and their soundtrack album to ""Saturday Night Fever"" was the top-selling album until Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" claimed that distinction in the 1980s. While often in the background as brother Barry sang lead vocals, Robin Gibb stepped forward on several top tunes, including ""I Started a Joke"" and ""I've Gotta Get a Message to You."" He also recorded several solo albums during his career. CNN's Anisa Husain contributed to this report.","NEW: Peter Frampton and Diane Warren are among those offering support online .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt made a winning return to the track after his Olympic heroics with an easy victory over 200 meters at the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne Thursday. Bolt charged clear to claim a meeting record 19.58 seconds, outside of his world record of 19.19 seconds, but the Jamaican superstar had ruled out breaking that mark before the event in Switzerland. Bolt took three gold medals in London, relegating teammate Yohan Blake to second place in both the 100 and 200 sprints before Jamaica's stunning world record win in the sprint relay. After coming home ahead of Dutchman Churandy Martina and compatriot Nickel Ashmeade, Bolt told BBC Sport that he was satisfied with his post-Games effort. ""I am definitely very pleased. It was a good run for the end of the season. I just wanted to have fun,"" said Bolt. His training partner Blake also returned to action with a brilliant victory in the earlier 100m in 9.69 seconds. Only Bolt with his 9.58 second world record and his 9.63 second clocking to win London, has ever run faster and he smashed his own personal best of 9.75 seconds. America's Tyson Gay finished second in 9.83 seconds with Nesta Carter of Jamaica third in 9.95 seconds. ""I am delighted,"" said Blake. ""I have been sick all week with flu but I am glad I recovered. My coach (Glen Mills) had told me that I could run faster than 9.75 seconds, a lot faster."" Carmelita Jeter of the United States gained a measure of revenge in the women's 100m, relegating double Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica to second place. Fraser-Pryce had edged Jeter in the final at the Games earlier this month, but was beaten on the dip with both given the time of 10.86 seconds. Best performance of the night in the field events came from Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim. He shared bronze in the high jump at the London Games, but upset gold medal winner Ivan Ukhov in a high class event. Barshim cleared 2.39 metres with Ukhov second with 2.37m, the same height as Britain's Robbie Grabarz, who equaled his country's national record.","Usain Bolt wins 200m at Diamond League meeting in Lausanne .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Inside a former church on a suburban London street, a room has been designed to recreate the conditions found in Siberian salt mines. CNN writer Anouk Lorie relaxes in Britain's first salt cave, in Wandsworth, London. The floor and walls are covered with a thick layer of natural sea salt while particles of dry rock salt are pumped into the room. Welcome to an Eastern European style salt cave which claims to rid asthma and allergy sufferers of their breathing problems through ""salt therapy,"" also known as halotherapy. With the sound of waves playing in the background and the sand-like mound of salt underfoot, the place could easily be mistaken for an exotic snow beach. Before entering the salt chamber, visitors are required to wear a shower cap to cover their hair and shoes to preserve the salt's purity. During each hour-long session they simply sit back, relax and put their feet up while soaking up the saturated air and tranquil atmosphere. Salt therapy claims to work by clearing the airways of mucus and reducing inflammation triggered by allergies to dust, pollen or pollution. Minerals including potassium and magnesium are said to clean out mucus blocking the airways. The treatment is widely used in Eastern Europe and Russia, where people with chronic breathing disorders often spend two to three hours per day in underground salt grottos. The Russian government even approved ""salt caves"" for medical use in 1995. In the U.S., the trend has been adopted in the Chicago area with the popular Galos Cave. Several spas in other parts of the country have also installed salt breathing rooms. In 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on patients with cystic fibrosis who used this kind of saline therapy for 48 weeks. The study found that it was a safe and effective additional therapy for patients. The benefits of salt therapy were first discovered in the late 1800s when workers in Siberian salt mines were found to suffer from a surprisingly small number of respiratory problems. Familiar with such treatments in her hometown, Sofia Benke from Hungary was therefore surprised when she moved to the UK two years ago and discovered there were no salt caves in the country. Have you used the salt cave? Did it work for you? Would you visit one? Tell us in the SoundOff box below . ""I was suffering from sinus problems and antibiotics didn't work. I had heard so many stories of how salt caves had treated friends' problems, so I decided to open one in London,"" the 30-year-old told CNN. The salt, which has no additives, is shipped in from Lithuania. Benke's patients vary from six-month-olds to 65-year-olds and most are asthmatic children who come in with their parents. Ideally, treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day, Benke says. The room's temperature and salt concentration depending on the patients' condition. The benefits are then said to last for up to 12 months. Each session costs around $56 and the first one is free. Many of the patients have reported positive results. Twenty-eight-year-old yoga instructor Tish Webster, who has always suffered from hay fever and severe allergies to dust, told CNN she noticed results after three sessions. ""I noticed first thing in the morning I wasn't as congested as I usually am. Having now done ten sessions, I haven't yet taken an allergy tablet this year, which is incredible for me."" Despite the positive testimonials, the therapy has not yet been recognized by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and at least one study suggests the therapy should be used as a complementary therapy, not as an alternative. Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK, said: ""It's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma. However, some people say they find them helpful. ""Our advice to people with asthma is to follow the recommendations of your doctor or asthma nurse, and to keep them informed if you decide to try a complementary treatment such as halotherapy."" Other health practitioners say stopping medication like steroids for asthma and only opting for alternative care can be dangerous and counter-productive. But, according to Benke, some of her patients have stopped medication, not because she urged them to. ""I would never do that,"" she said. The reason for this is because their symptoms were no longer present after undergoing salt therapy, she said.","A salt cave clinic in London says it can treat respiratory illnesses like asthma .

The process is called salt therapy, also known as halotherapy ."
"(CNN) -- After 75 long years, the United States' national soccer team can finally celebrate a victory across its southern borders. The U.S. had drawn one and lost 23 of 24 previous matches in Mexico, but Michael Orozco Fiscal's late goal in Wednesday's friendly international was enough for a landmark success over the newly-crowned Olympic champions. Orozco Fiscal, who plays for Mexican club San Luis, netted from close range in the 80th minute to inflict just the ninth defeat for Mexico in 120 games at the Azteca Stadium. Mexico beat the U.S. 4-2 in last year's Gold Cup final in Pasadena, after which former Germany international Klinsmann replaced Bob Bradley as coach. ""I think it's huge,"" head coach Jurgen Klinsmann told U.S. Soccer's official website. ""It's huge for all American fans and it's huge for the team. It's historic. ""We were well aware that we've never won here at Azteca and this is an amazing experience for all the players. We told them before the game, 'This moment is for you, go and grab it.' "" Which clubs will win Europe's big leagues? The Americans' triumph owed much to the performance of goalkeeper Tim Howard, who produced a string of saves, including an impressive late denial of striker Javier Hernandez. ""It's a wonderful moment because winning a game against a very good Mexican team that we have a lot of respect for at the Azteca Stadium, that means a lot to us,"" added Klinsmann. ""That was very difficult for us and Tim Howard made some unbelievable saves, and I've said it many times over the last few years that he belongs to the top three goalkeepers in the world and he showed that tonight."" Defeat for Mexico comes off the back of an impressive run at the Olympic tournament, where the under-23 team upset the odds to defeat Brazil 2-1 in the London 2012 final on Saturday. None of the players involved played in Wednesday's Mexico City game. Manchester United agree fee for Arsenal striker Van Persie . ""I think it's important for us to understand that we can compete with big teams at their stadiums,"" said Klinsmann, whose team recorded a historic first win in Italy earlier this year and next face two World Cup qualifiers against Jamaica in September. ""It's like when you play Wembley in England or Stade de France or in Berlin. Those are special occasions. I want the players to appreciate that. I want the players to take it all in because you never know when you'll have another occasion like that. ""That's what we told the players: You have nothing to lose here. Give it all you have. Can we play better? Yes. Can we play technically cleaner? Yes."" Elsewhere, Argentina registered a 3-1 win away to Euro 2012 semifinalists Germany with Lionel Messi scoring after missing a penalty in the Frankfurt contest. The Barcelona forward failed to convert a first-half spot kick after Germany goalkeeper Ron Robert Zieler had been sent off for hauling down Jose Ernesto Sosa. An own-goal from Sami Khedira gave Argentina the lead early in the second half, before Messi and winger Angel Di Maria put Alejandro Sabella's team 3-0 up. Germany could only offer Benedikt Howedes' late goal in response. Louis van Gaal began his second spell in charge of the Netherlands national team with a 4-2 defeat in Belgium, as Robin van Persie was omitted from the match-day squad. The striker, who is poised to join Manchester United after a fee was agreed with Arsenal that day, has lost his place to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar after struggling to impress at Euro 2012. Christian Benteke gave Belgium a 1-0 lead in Brussels, before a first international goal for Luciano Narsingh and a Huntelaar strike put the Netherlands 2-1 ahead. But Van Gaal's team collapsed in the final 15 minutes, with Dries Martens, striker Romelu Lukaku and defender Jan Vertonghen sealing a shock success for Belgium. In a rematch of the Euro 2012 quarterfinal, England turned the tables on Italy to register a 2-1 win in Switzerland. Fielding a much-changed team weeks after being beaten 4-0 by Spain in the tournament final, Italy took the lead through Daniele de Rossi's first-half header. Defender Phil Jagielka equalized for Roy Hodgson's team before substitute striker Jermain Defoe fired in a fine late winner. Former World Cup winner Didier Deschamps began his reign as France coach with a 0-0 draw against 2010 semifinalists Uruguay, while Vicente del Bosque's Spain earned a 2-1 win in Puerto Rico. New Arsenal signing Santi Cazorla and former Gunner Cesc Fabregas gave the world and European champions a 2-0 lead before Marc Cintron scored a consolation goal for the Caribbean side.","The U.S. earn historic first win in Mexico thanks to Michael Orozco Fiscal's late goal .

"(CNN) -- It was the scene of her first grand slam triumph in 2005 and where she roared out of retirement to complete a hat-trick of titles in 2009 and 2010. But this year, the U.S. Open will serve as the swansong to Kim Clijsters' rollercoaster career, and the popular Belgian is aiming to bow out with a fourth Flushing Meadows crown. ""(I am) too old to play the game that I want to play physically,"" the 29-year-old, who initially retired from the sport to give birth to her first child in 2007, told the New York tournament's official website. ""I've put my body through enough strain and everything. The whole lifestyle, that's what I'm dealing with now, the lifestyle I've had for the last 15, 20 years."" The former world No. 1 turned pro in 1997 and has won 41 WTA Tour titles in addition to her three U.S. Open triumphs and her 2011 success at the Australian Open. ""I think for me the most important thing is I've always followed my heart,"" she continued. ""I've always done what I felt was right. I've always stayed true to who I am. ""Players change. There's so many other things involved than just tennis and practicing. I think you see players kind of losing the true sense of life, and of the sport."" Clijsters took the sport by storm on her return in 2009, winning the U.S. Open as a wildcard to become the first mother to take a grand slam title since Australia's Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. She successfully defended her title 12 months on, before adding the Australian Open to her collection just five months later, beating China's Li Na in the final. ""I didn't expect obviously when I started back after having Jada, I never expected that things would be going so well so soon,"" she added. ""It's been an incredible adventure these last three, four years. ""I feel like I've been able to kind of finish that chapter of my tennis year on a good note."" Clijsters returned to the top of the world rankings in February last year, but her body began to let her down. She missed Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2011 with ankle, wrist and shoulder injuries, but was fit enough to play in her first Olympic tournament at London 2012. Silver medalist Maria Sharapova defeated Clijsters in the quarterfinals, but she is now looking forward to bringing her career to a close at an event which has provided so many happy memories. ""I have no regrets. I know I always gave myself 100 percent,"" she said. ""The US Open will be a special occasion for me to be playing there and to end my career there. I'm sure it will be emotional.""","The U.S. Open will be the final grand slam of Kim Clijsters' career .

"Sydney (CNN) -- For a few hours before Ecuador's announcement that it would grant the WikiLeaks founder political asylum, and for 12 hours after the announcement, #Assange trended on Twitter across Julian Assange's homeland, Australia. It was as though the void left by the London Olympics was filled by the oddly mesmerizing spectacle of a widely anticipated decision, well ahead of the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministers' blistering critique of Great Britain, the United States and Sweden and the parlous situation in which the white-haired Assange finds himself. As Assange's supporters rallied in London outside the Ecuadorian Embassy where he has been holed up for 58 days, in Australia the political elite seemed to be scurrying to the safety of black letter law. Opinion: Australia to Assange's rescue? Don't hold your breath . Prime Minister Julia Gillard has made no comment in the wake of Ecuador's decision and it's unlikely she will, formally. In the political typhoon of the 24-hour news cycle she will no doubt be asked for her reaction to Ecuador's clear belief that it is offering Assange support denied him by his own government. Her response is expected to echo the PR-filtered offering of her usually loquacious -- but suddenly media shy -- Foreign Minister Senator Bob Carr. His spokesperson told CNN that having watched events unfold through the night, the Assange drama has ""elements of fascination, in particular the strong statements on the United States."" Australia, he said, contemplated responding to the statements made by Ecuador. Instead it has decided to watch and wait because ""nothing has changed."" Nor is it likely that the impasse might soon resolve, offered the spokesperson. In the meantime, the WikiLeaks founder ""remains an Australian citizen who will receive consular support."" Read more: Standoff at embassy after Ecuador grants Assange asylum . Australia appears to be narrowly interpreting the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister's statement that ""... Mr Assange is without the due protection and help that he should receive from any state of which he is a citizen,"" as an assertion that consular assistance has been denied. ""He has received 62 instances of consular contact in the last 18 months -- more than any other Australian in comparable circumstances,"" the spokesman said. ""We don't expect him to be thanking us, but to suggest he didn't receive it is wrong. ""But we won't engage in a yelling match. We remain where we are,"" he added. And that is, firmly behind Britain's attempt to extradite Assange to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sexual assault and rape and alongside its friend in good and bad times, the United States, of which few questions have apparently been asked about its purported intention to prosecute Assange over the WikiLeaks release of confidential American diplomatic cables. Opinion: Assange's stubborn grip hurts WikiLeaks . If Ecuador is persuaded that the U.S. poses a threat to Assange's liberty and life, some Australians are persuaded that if the British government decides on the drastic option of storming the Ecuadorian Embassy, it can only be because America tells them to. Julian Burnside, a leading human rights barrister took, to twitter to ask: ""Will Aus also collaborate with USA attempts to get Assange?"" But Australia's opposition, usually and expectedly enthusiastic when offered the chance to attack the government, is not taking the bait. Opposition Coalition leader Tony Abbott offered yet more black letter law: ""Whatever the ordinary law of Britain is, whatever would happen to anyone else in the same circumstances, Julian Assange should get identical treatment to anyone else in a similar position,"" Abbott told the Nine television Network. The only political solace Assange has received is from The Greens. But however powerful they are in Australia's hung Federal Parliament, what they have to say on the standoff counts for little as the Gillard government works furiously to distance itself from claims that for helping to deliver it government, the Greens call the shots. Still, the comments of Greens Senator Scott Ludlam are a reflection of what many Australians believe. ""I've been banging my head against this wall for the last eight months now trying to get a succession of foreign ministers to take even a faint spark of interest in what's really happening here,"" Senator Ludlam told the Australian Broacasting Corporation. ""What the Ecuadorian government has done here, in effect, is offer Julian Assange the protection the Australian Government has failed to do.""

"(CNN) -- It was a case of like father like son for Chinese Grand Prix winner Nico Rosberg, who followed in the footsteps of his famous parent on Sunday. The 26-year-old Mercedes driver is the third son of a Formula One racer to win a race -- achieving the feat 30 years after his father Keke claimed his first checkered flag at the Swiss Grand Prix. They joined Britain's Graham and Damon Hill and Canada's Gilles and Jacques Villeneuve as the only father and son duos to triumph in the 62-year history of the sport. Rosberg is hoping to build on his long-awaited first victory after heading off McLaren's Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton in Shanghai. ""It's amazing to have it,"" the German said in a video blog on the team's website after his 111th race as an F1 driver. ""It's been a long time waiting and Niki Lauda (three-time world champion) said that the first win is the most difficult. After that it gets easier. So if that's the way it goes that would be fantastic."" Only four drivers in F1 history have waited longer to claim victory: Button (113), Jarno Trulli (117), Rubens Barrichello (124) and Mark Webber (131). He still has some catching up to do to his Finnish father, who won the 1982 world title with Williams as he collected five race wins in a nine-season career from 1978 to 1986. For Nico, Sunday's win was a cause of celebration with Keke. But the Hills and Villeneuves were sadly never able to enjoy the feat together, as both fathers died in tragic circumstances. Britain's Damon Hill made history in 1996 when he won the world title with Williams to add to those Graham took home in 1962 and 1968, making them the only father and son to both be drivers' champions. Damon won 22 races in an eight-season career spanning from 1992 to 1999, but Graham never saw him race as he died in 1975 when the plane he was flying crashed in foggy conditions in North London. His son was just 15 at the time. Hill senior earned the nickname ""Mr. Monaco"" after winning on the Monte Carlo circuit five times out of his career total of 15 victories. Gilles Villeneuve was also never there to see his son Jacques win the 1997 world championships with Williams, triumphing in 11 races overall in a 10-season career spanning 1996 to 2006. A charismatic and thrilling driver, Gilles died in 1982 during a qualifying session at the Belgian Grand Prix -- having been runner-up in the world championship three years earlier with Ferrari. He won six races overall, the first in his home grand prix in 1978 at the Montreal circuit now named after him.","Nico Rosberg wins Chinese Grand Prix, 30 years after father Keke won Swiss Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Autopsies on an American couple found stabbed to death in their St. Maarten home were performed Monday, a day before a suspect in their deaths appears in court, the island's solicitor general said. The bodies of Michael and Thelma King of South Carolina were discovered Friday at their oceanfront residence in Cupecoy, in what St. Maarten's Solicitor General Taco Stein described as ""an ugly scene."" Two days later, an unidentified suspect was arrested. He will appear Tuesday before a judge in the Dutch Caribbean nation, who will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to hold him longer or order his release. No charges have been filed against anyone in the case. ""There are strong indications he is involved in the crime,"" Stein said Monday of the suspect, without divulging details. Identifying him only by his initials M.K.J., the St. Maarten Public Prosecutor's office described the suspect in a Monday press release as a 28-year-old, Jamaican-born man. The prosecutor's office said the suspect ""heavily resisted his arrest,"" engaging in a confrontation that ended with both him and a police officer ""wounded."" After being treated at an area hospital, the Jamaican man was taken to a police station. ""He has been cooperative to a certain extent, but was reluctant to answer critical questions,"" the prosecutor's office said. The suspect's attorney, Brenda Brooks, said she'd met with the suspect Monday at a police station in St. Maarten's capital Philipsburg, where he is being held. He had signs of a ""beating,"" according to Brooks. Stein, who was once solicitor general for Aruba, said authorities ""are not certain of the motive in the case."" ""Some things are missing"" from the King's home, but there were no signs of a break-in. The killings occurred in what is ""generally considered a safe area"" that is popular with tourists, according to the solicitor general. ""This is something that does not happen every day,"" he said. Results from the autopsies on Michael and Thelma King will be discussed by prosecutors and police, but they will not be released to the public ""in the interest of the investigation,"" the public prosecutor's office said Monday. In addition to Tuesday's court hearing, forensic experts and prosecutors will meet with a representative of the Dutch Forensic Institute to discuss material ""secured during this investigation,"" the office said. The couple's bodies will be handed over ""presumably"" Tuesday to their relatives, some of whom had a ""lengthy conversation"" with prosecutors on Sunday, according to the prosecutor. The suspect and the slain couple didn't appear to know each other, said Stein, noting they ""were not moving in the same circles."" Topper Daboul, a restaurant owner in the area, said he was a friend and business partner of the Kings. ""They were beautiful people,"" he said, adding he is ""still in shock."" ""They were kind to everybody."" Zane Jackson offered a similar story, and sentiment, in an interview with CNN affiliate WIS. Describing himself as a friend and business partner of the Kings, who helped him open a sports bar in Columbia, South Carolina, Jackson said, ""They'd have given anything to anybody."" ""It just seems very senseless,"" he said. ""They were good people."" CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","NEW: The couple's bodies will likely be handed over to kin Tuesday, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United came from behind to deny Liverpool on an emotional day as Anfield paid tribute to the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster. Robin van Persie's 81st minute penalty gave Sir Alex Ferguson's men all three points against a Liverpool side which played for most of the game with ten men. Jonjo Shelvey was shown a straight red card in the 39th minute following a two-footed tackle on Jonny Evans. And although Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard gave the hosts a 46th minute lead, goals from Rafael and van Persie won it for United. Football's most poisonous rivalry? Liverpool and Manchester United's tempestuous past . On a day where the rivalry between England's two most successful clubs was put aside, fans and players of both teams paid their respects to the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough in 1989. Shirts, flowers and cards adorned the Shankly Gates by the permanent memorial to the victims who perished 23 years ago. Both sets of players wore the number 96 as they emerged from the tunnel with Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton presenting former Liverpool striker Ian Rush a bouquet of flowers. Reds captain Steven Gerrard and his United counterpart Ryan Giggs then released 96 balloons into the Anfield sky. Fans held up mosaics around the ground as Liverpool's traditional anthem of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' was played. English FA offer apology on Hillsborough . Luis Suarez and Patrice Evra put aside their personal differences and shook hands in the lead up to kick off. Liverpool striker Suarez was banned for eight matches by the Football Associaton after racially abusing the Frenchman during a league game at Anfield. But while the pre-match atmosphere was full of respect, the intense rivalry between the two sides was never far away. Once the game had started, both sets of fans began to goad each other, with a small section of United fans singing, 'Where's you famous Munich song?' Panel: Police at fault in response to deadly UK stadium football crush . That was a small blot on an emotional and entertaining afternoon as both teams produced the kind of cut and thrust football that makes these derby games so thrilling. Liverpool, without a league victory under new manager Brendan Rodgers this season, came out firing on all cylinders as it looked to take the game to United. Both Gerrard and Suarez had opportunities as the home side dominated possession. But the game was turned on its head six minutes before the break when referee Mark Halsey showed Shelvey a straight red card. Down to ten men, the hosts re-grouped at half-time and grabbed the lead within a minute of the restart. Glen Johnson tricked his way into the United penalty area and picked out the unmarked Gerrard, who volleyed home from close-range. It was a poignant moment for Gerrard, whose 10-year-old cousin Jon-Paul Gilhooley was among 96 victims. That goal sparked an outpouring of emotion from the Kop as the Liverpool players celebrated in front of their supporters. But their joy was cut short as United hit back almost immediately with Rafael curling home a spectacular equaliser from inside the penalty area. The visitors continued to make the most of their numerical advantage and were awarded a penalty when Antonio Valencia went down under minimal contact from Johnson. Van Persie, who missed his last spot kick during the recent win at Southampton, made no mistake this time as he beat Pepe Reina. Martin Kelly wasted a late chance to equalize for Liverpool as United held out for victory.","Tributes paid to the 96 before the game at Anfield .

"(CNN) -- As the sun set Sunday evening, millions of people in a mammoth chunk of the Central and Eastern United States finally got relief from scorching heat -- though, for many of them, it won't last long. Summer has been out in full force for days, baking areas from Missouri to New York to Georgia in life-threatening heat, and unleashing thunderstorms that knocked out power to millions and killed 13 people on Friday and Saturday. Then, three more people died Sunday afternoon after a fresh batch of storms. Between June 24 and Saturday, 1,928 record-high temperatures were broken or tied nationwide, not including new ones expected from Sunday that still aren't in the National Climatic Data Center's official count. Many cities and towns in the Southeast and Midwest saw temperatures Sunday that topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit, much like they've experienced in the few days prior, and the Northeast also saw blistering heat. The National Weather Service warned, for instance, that the heat index (or what it actually feels like) near the North Carolina coast could hit 120 degrees. Thunderstorms rolling across some of the roasting locales late Sunday afternoon brought some relief, but also danger as well. The National Weather Service reported that a man in Calico in eastern North Carolina, died around 4:30 p.m. when a shed fell on him as he was trying to store his golf cart. A few minutes later and about 15 miles east in Gilead, strong storm-related winds knocked over a tree that fell on a couple in a golf cart, killing them both. These deaths were tied to a batch of storms that affected not only North Carolina, but also South Carolina and Georgia. Another band moved east from the Chicago area through Ohio, at one point prompting a tornado warning. Tamara McBride, an Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman, said the latest storms downed trees and power lines to produce yet more outages. Yet as of Sunday night, there were no reports of new fatalities. The forecast in that state, like in many others through the Midwest, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic region, calls for slightly cooling Monday, compared to over the weekend. Yet temperature drops are all relative: It will be cooler, for instance, for residents of Louisville, Kentucky, but they can still expect a high of 99, and a heat index of 103, on Monday. In Columbus, Ohio, the thermometer is forecast to rise as high as 96, though it should feel even warmer. Many other locales should be even more sweltering, with highs Monday forecast yet again to be around or above 100 degrees from Missouri to South Carolina. The lack of any significant let up in the blistering conditions is a concern, authorities say, because the effects of heat can be cumulative -- so the longer you experience it, the more likely you are to experience conditions such as heat stroke, dehydration and the like. ""Current indications are that this heat wave may continue for much of the upcoming work week,"" the weather service's St. Louis bureau warned. ""Do not wait until the heat wave has lasted for several days, take action today to protect your health and continue to do so."" Hundreds of thousands of people in Indiana through Maryland are still dealing with this heat without the benefits of electricity, due to a derecho -- or massive storm usually with straight-line wind damage -- that barreled eastward late Friday and into Saturday and was fueled, in part, by the extreme heat. The destruction prompted state of emergency declarations by governors of Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia and Virginia. Deaths tied to those storms were reported from Ohio to New Jersey, all of them linked to downed trees except for the electrocution of a man in Washington. Will 2012 be the hottest summer on record? Virginia had the highest death toll, at seven, with the state Department of Emergency Management noting the deaths were spread across four different counties. And in New Jersey, 2-year-old and 7-year-old cousins died after a fallen tree crashed on the tent they were huddling inside in Parvin State Park, state Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said. While down from a peak of about 4 million from right after the storms hit, the number of storm-related outages was still dangerously high given that people were trying to get by without working air conditioning or ice. Record heat, storms bring despair, 'horror' One of the most affected utilities was APE Ohio, which had around 425,000 customers out of power as of 10 p.m. Sunday. Widespread outages were reported further east as well, including over 310,000 Dominion customers in Virginia plus more than 490,000 outages in Maryland for customers of BGE and Pepco. ""It's the combination of heat and power outages that are hitting people,"" McBride from Ohio's emergency management agency said, predicting some may not get electricity until ""well into the week."" ""As the days continue with food and without power, we will just have to mobilize resources."" One such initiative, ordered by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is to have National Guard troops check on and help the state's most vulnerable, primarily the elderly and the ill. Cities throughout the affected regions offered water at certain sites and opened cooling shelters, including 35 in Virginia alone, to help people stay cool. Photos: Storm damage in Washington, D.C. Emergency rooms in Prince George's County, Maryland, filled up over the weekend by people looking to escape the heat, said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. She noted that libraries and community centers across the state would stay open late to act as cooling centers. ""This is not a one-day situation; it is a multiday challenge,"" said Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who called it the largest power outage unrelated to a hurricane in his state's history. Instagram down in mass power outage .

"(CNN) -- The organization that grants academic accreditation to Penn State has warned the school that it is in danger of losing that crucial status in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal, the university announced this week. The move by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education is the latest blow for the beleaguered university, which has seen its reputation clobbered and its football program hobbled after investigators found school leaders did too little to stop the abuse. Were the commission to pull Penn State's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs, guaranteed student loans, federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid, commission spokesman Richard Pockrass said in July. Paterno family wants to appeal Penn State sanctions . Penn State will resolve the commission's concerns, promised Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Blannie Bowen. ""This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,"" Bowen said in a statement posted Monday to the school's website. ""Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation."" The commission voted August 6 to place the school on warning status. Two days later, it notified Penn State officials that the school's accreditation was ""in jeopardy"" based on information contained in former FBI Director Louis Freeh's report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky and a National Collegiate Athletic Association action against the school. Freeh found that Penn State's leadership showed ""total and consistent disregard"" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky, the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in June on 45 counts involving child sex abuse. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Among other things, authorities say school officials failed to properly address a report that Sandusky had been seen in a football complex shower, apparently engaged in sexual contact with a young boy. Timeline of the Penn State scandal . Last month, the NCAA fined Penn State $60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. The commission also said it had insufficient evidence that Penn State officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided ""accurate, fair and complete information"" about what was happening at the school, according to the letter. The commission asked Penn State to report by September 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements, as well as information about the school's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal. A team assembled by the commission will visit Penn State after the September report to evaluate the school's performance, the commission said. Bowen said the commission ""wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements"" and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation. ""It is critical to emphasize that Middle States does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance,"" Bowen said in the statement. ""This certainly is true for Penn State. We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the warning seemed to be a bit of ""piling on"" in light of the sanctions already in place against Penn State. But it may be another factor to further motivate the university to comprehensively deal with the scandal, he said on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""It all creates pressure on Penn State to make sure it has policies in place to make sure nothing like this ever happens again,"" Toobin said.
