"An amateur treasure hunter with a hand-held metal detector has turned Canadian history on its head after finding a 16th century shilling buried in clay on the shores of Vancouver Island. The 435-year-old coin discovered in western-most Canada has rekindled a theory that a British explorer made a secret voyage here two centuries before it was discovered by Spanish sailors. Official historical records show the Spanish were the first Europeans to set foot in what is now Canada's British Columbia province in 1774, followed four years later by British Royal Navy Captain James Cook. Retired security systems installer Bruce Campbell found the coin in mid-December, along with a rare 1891 Canadian nickel, a 1960s dime and penny from 1900. Retired security system specialist Bruce Campbell has found a coin that has revived a theory the Canadian pacific coast was not discovered in 1774 by the Spaniards, as officially thought, but in 1579 by British sailor Sir Francis Drake . This rare Edward VI shilling, minted in London between 1551 and 1553, was found Victoria, British Columbia, in mid-December . 'I was getting fat and tired of watching TV,' he said about what got him into his hobby, surrounded in his Victoria, British Columbia home by a trove of adventure novels and a few dug up treasures. He never imagined, he said, stirring up controversy with his latest find. According to conspiracy theorists and some historians, the silver coin (produced between 1551 and 1553) is evidence that English explorer Sir Francis Drake traveled as far north as Canada's Pacific Coast during an expedition to California in 1579, in search of the famed Northwest Passage. But he covered it up at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I, who supposedly wished to avoid confrontation over the new territory with Spain. At the time, Spanish explorers had kept to more southern parts of the continent after disappointment (seeing few apparent resources and natural ports) in California. Samuel Bawlf, a leading proponent of the so-called Drake theory and author of a 2003 book on the subject, says the coin is proof the English arrived here first. He noted two other finds that support the theory: a 1571 sixpence dug up in 1930 in the backyard of a Victoria home and another Tudor-era coin unearthed on nearby Quadra Island. History rewritten: The British are known to have visited California in 1579, while the Spanish are believed to be the first Europeans to arrive in Canada in 1774. However the discovery of the coin suggests the British also went to what is now British Colombia during Sir Fancis Drake's voyage . Drake would have given the coins to aboriginals he met 'to show to later comers that England had already found (and staked a claim to) these lands,' Bawlf told AFP. Royal British Columbia Museum curator Grant Keddie, tasked with examining the evidence, is skeptical. He said his analysis typically looks at 'what was written at the time, and archeological artifacts'. And there is currently not enough evidence to support this theory, he said, noting that Drake's logs were burned in a London fire a century later. If it is ever corroborated, it could have implications for Canada and the United States, whose shared border was drawn based partly on past European colonial land holdings. The 49th parallel was chosen in 1818 as the western boundary between the United States and the British colony, but disputes over interpretations of the treaty erupted on several occasions since then. The last row was settled in 1903 by a joint British, Canadian and US tribunal establishing Canada's boundary with Alaska. For Campbell, the coin is nothing more than a lucky find that will be hard to match. 'It's gonna be impossible to find something older,' he quipped.","Retired security systems installer Bruce Campbell started hunting for treasure with a hand-held metal detector because he was sick of TV and 'getting fat'

"Put down that moisturiser  and remove that man bag from your person boys because metrosexuality is well and truly over. Nowadays it's all about the 'lumbersexuals'. Not literally men who are lumberjacks (because really, where are you going to find one of those?) but men who look like they could be. Unlike their metrosexual brothers these men look rugged, unkempt and like they'd be a dab hand at using an axe... even if they've never picked one up in their lives. Kanye West and Ben Affleck both enjoy the lumbersexual look in relaxed shirts, however, there is still a sense that these are men who take pride in their looks . David Beckham used to be the king of the metrosexual men but now he prefers a more relaxed 'lumbersexual' look with his scruffy beard and checked shirt . They have beards, checked shirts and are decidedly more hipster than the dapper fellows we've been hanging around with for the last ten years. But unlike real life lumberjacks, where the inspiration for the name of the trend is derived from, their look is still calculated, their beards often groomed to within an inch of their lives, no hair out of place. As online site GearJunkie says, 'He looks like a hardened outdoorsman but his flannel feels soft to the touch. 'He will open your beer with an omni-present Buck knife. He is a master of the retro Instagram filter. His flannel is coated with a waterproof DWR coating. 'His laid back style has been honed with more effort than he would like you to know.' 'Whether the roots of the Lumbersexual are a cultural shift toward environmentalism, rebellion against the grind of 9-5 office jobs, or simply recognition that outdoor gear is just more comfortable, functional and durable, the Lumbersexual is on the rise. 'Lumbersexuals' should not be confused with real life lumberjacks who actually do frequent forrests and enjoy chopping trees . Model Ricki Hall has previously revealed that he does not identify with the 'hipster' label some people have bestowed upon him. But how would he feel about being a lumbersexual? Many celebrities have already been giving the look a go. From Kanye West who has long been a fan of the plaid flannel shirts favoured by real life lumberjacks, to Ben Affleck whose off-screen look is relaxed, almost scruffy at times. David Beckham, Professor Green and Sienna Miller's partner Tom Sturridge are all also in on the lumbersexual trend, often shying away from being overly preened whether they're heading out for a walk, or heading to the red carpet. Some websites though have joked that these men are just metrosexuals in disguise with Urban Dictionary describing them as, 'A Metro-sexual who has the need to hold on to some outdoor based rugged-ness, thus opting to keep a finely trimmed beard.' Professor Green heads to a party rocking a checked shirt and cap, perhaps he hurt is leg going for a ramble in the woods . Sienna Miller's partner actor Tom Sturridge enjoys a relaxed look coupling his checked shirt with a pair of boots that would be suitable for wearing on a hike . Indeed, it does seem that whilst these men look like they could have just stepped out of the woods there is a conscious decision - and a considerable amount of effort - behind their styling. And even though it is likely that we will be seeing lumbersexuals around more and more, writer Peter Lawrence Kane thinks that men probably won't want to take ownership of the label themselves. 'It goes without saying that virtually no man ever called himself a metrosexual, which really just referred to men who shopped for their own pants, went to the gym, and used moisturizer,' he said. 'So don’t expect the term Lumbersexual to blow up, no matter how ubiquitous Lumbersexuals become.'","Latest trend favours men who look more rugged .

"Lionel Messi showed why he is the boss at Barcelona making the first two goals and scoring the third in a 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp. After a week when the Argentine had taken on coach Luis Enrique, the board had sacked the Sporting Director and called early elections the Barcelona players closed ranks around their number 10 and closed the gap on Real Madrid at the top of the table to one point. Messi clearly used his arm to make the second goal of the night for Luis Suarez and gave away a second half penalty as Atletico Madrid clawed their way back into the game but he made sure Barça rode out the visitors’ come back by scoring the decisive third. Barcelona's Holy Trinity (L-R) of Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi all scored in the 3-1 defeat of Atletico Madrid . Brazilian sensation Neymar celebrates with Messi after opening the scoring for Barcelona on 12minutes . Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored only his third league goal of the season after being played through by Messi .

Messi raises his fist after scoring the third and final goal following a week that has claimed there is a power struggle at the Nou Camp .

Subs not used: Suarez, Oblak, Niguez, Miranda. Booked: Gamez, Mandzukic, Juanfran, Tiago, Griezmann, Godin . Scorer: Mandzukic (pen) 57' Barcelona’s front three clicked as early as 12 minutes when Messi and Dani Alves exchanged passes down the right with the Argentine angling his run towards goal. His pass to Suarez cannoned off the Uruguayan and ran to Neymar who scrambled it past Miguel Moya. It wasn’t pretty but Luis Enrique will take anything at the moment and it lifted the pressure inside the Camp Nou – a Camp Nou with 70,000 more supporters inside it than for Barcelona’s midweek cup game. That match on Thursday saw Barça demolish lowly Elche and everyone had expected this to be a much tougher test but the Atletico Madrid who were unbeaten against Barcelona in six games last season had simply not turned up. There was none of the relentless pressing of the opposition and, with journeyman right back Jesus Gamez playing as a left-back up against Messi, Barcelona were threatening down that flank every time they attacked. When the second goal came it came from Messi picking the ball up on the right – almost literally – he nudged it forward with his arm before racing clear and playing in Suarez who buried it for 2-0. Simeone remonstrated with the referee Alberto Undiano, and Diego Godin and Mario Mandzukic made various gestures towards the match official suggesting he had seen the incident but not had the courage to stop play. It had been a busy first half for the Undiano. Neymar was left with a bloodied foot after clashing with Jose Gimenez, Mandzukic elbowed Sergi Busquets and Messi caught Gamez with his forearm.

The second half continued in the same spirit with Juanfran going through the back of Neymar and picking up a yellow card. Arda Turan should have followed him into the book for chopping down Andres Iniesta. The referee than had the biggest call of the game as Messi tried to pinch the ball from Gamez in the Barcelona penalty area. He made contact with the full-back who exaggerating the clash throwing himself up in the air and persuading Undiano to point to the spot. Mandzukic slammed home the penalty despite the 98,000 screams inside the stadium and Atletico were back in the game. Suarez was booked at the other end after protesting when the referee waved away appeals for a foul on Rakitic from Jimenez as the pair jumped for a cross. Mandzukic had words with Suarez no doubt trying to provoke the Uruguayan further. Tiago then went into the book for pulling back Neymar. With 20 minutes left Simeone threw Fernando Torres into the mix. The Atletico Madrid striker came into the game with a record of five goals in six appearances on this ground. His moment of glory so nearly came with 10 minutes left when Mandzukic’ cross left him racing to the loose ball but he was beaten to it by Claduio Bravo. Messi made no mistake two minutes from time when he was given two chances to convert Rakitic’s cross and he sent it past Moya at the second attempt. The power he has off the pitch has been up for debate all week – the in fluence he has on the pitch has never been in doubt.

"An 11-year-old NRL ball boy for the Parramatta Eels who was told he lost his team their game is reportedly 'crying himself to sleep' at night. With a couple of minutes on the clock against Canterbury Bulldogs, a try from Eels halfback Chris Sandow was disallowed after the boy threw the ball straight to Eels winger Vai Toutai for a quick restart, instead of putting the ball on the sideline. Eels coach Brad Arthur explained to Triple M's Dead Set Legends that 'an NRL official told the ball boys that they cost Parramatta the game'. On Sunday, Eels CEO Scott Seward defended the boy after the incident on Friday night at the ANZ stadium in Sydney.

"Police have banned two Chinese pro-democracy activists from Brisbane's G20 security zones - virtually the city's entire CBD - after they unfurled a protest banner near the Chinese president's hotel. The 'furious' activists now say Australia is ruining its democracy after police punished them for wielding their banner near the Stamford Plaza Hotel on Thursday evening. Queensland University of Technology students Tony Zhang, 21, and Nardo Wai, 23, said they had unfurled the banner for 'just ten seconds' when police swooped. Scroll down for video . Tony Zhang, 21, (front) and Nardo Wai, 23, (behind) have been banned from Brisbane's G20 exclusion zone for protesting . The pair unfurled this banner outside the Chinese president Xi Jinping's hotel on Thursday afternoon before being swooped by police . Mr Zhang (far left) and Mr Wai (second from left) were questioned by police before being issued Exclusion Notices . Mr Zhang (left) said he had been arrested in China before and moved to Australia out of dislike of the Chinese government . The banner was a reference to pro-democracy protests that broke out in Hong Kong in September, pictured . Their bright yellow sign said 'Support HK Umbrella Revolution', a reference to pro-democracy protests that broke out in Hong Kong in September. After intense questioning involving around half a dozen police, witnessed by Daily Mail Australia, the pair were handed Exclusion Notices which barred them from the entire G20 Security Area and insisted they leave immediately. If they returned to the Security Area they would likely face charges. Mr Zhang (right) is on a hunger strike until the G20 finishes, here with Mr Wai (left) holding their notices . The men say they believe Australia is becoming less democratic and losing its precious freedoms . The students also revealed they would have been happy to simply leave the area if asked to by officers . They revealed all they wished to come from the exercise was for the Chinese president to see their protest . The notices said they were in 'possession of a prohibited item' - the banner - 'without lawful excuse' Mr Zhang, an IT student who has been arrested in China before said: 'The reason why I come to Australia to study (is) because I don't like Chinese government, because I think there's no democracy in China.' But now Mr Zhang - who is on a hunger strike until the G20 finishes - said he believes the country he arrived in earlier this year is losing its precious freedoms. 'Before what happened today I did not really believe [rumours Australia was becoming less democratic], but now I believe Australia is losing its democracy,' he said. The notices said they were in 'possession of a prohibited item' - the banner - 'without lawful excuse'. Mr Wai said they would have just left the area if they had been asked. The Queensland State Government introduced tough new security laws - criticised as draconian by civil libertarians - specifically for the G20 Summit, which will hold its leader's meeting at the weekend. Several other items are prohibited in G20 areas under the Security Act, including weapons, antique firearms, replica guns, bows, cattle prods, urine, nails, eggs, tacks, a reptile, an insect, metal cans and fireworks. Brisbane is in lockdown with thousands of police patrolling the area on land, sky and sea . Mr Zhang did say that Australian police were more understanding and willing to listen than those in China . A flotilla of 18 boats took to the Brisbane River on Thursday in preparation for the huge event this weekend . The exclusion zone encompasses Brisbane Airport, the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, and many of the hotels where leaders will be staying . In Hong Kong people have been protesting for months now blocking main thoroughfares in the city . Brisbane went into lockdown on Thursday as thousands of uniformed police patrolled the area. Some officers manned steel fences, which protect the hotels of visiting leaders such as President Obama and Russian President Putin. Some took to the Brisbane River to show off a police flotilla of 18 boats. Others still monitored the city from helicopters buzzing in the sky. The protesters told Daily Mail Australia they had a simple intention. They wanted the Chinese president to 'see our protest', which they thought would last longer than it did. Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, is expected to touch down in Brisbane tomorrow. Mr Zhang said Australian police were more understanding and willing to listen than those in China. Some officers are stations at different points across the city, with many in front of visiting leaders' hotels . Much of Brisbane's CBD is inside the exclusion zone for the upcoming summit . Queensland Police refused to comment on the activists' remarks about democracy . In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a spokesman for the Queensland Police Service said it understands the right for people to protest lawfully and peacefully. 'However behaviour that threatens the safety and security of the communities in Brisbane will not be tolerated, nor actions that pose a risk to the safety and dignity of those attending the Leader's Summit.' The spokesman said all G20 protesters need to be aware of and adhere to 'specific requirements' and that liaison officers are available to help people organising protests. Twenty-seven protest groups have formally registered with police. As for Mr Zhang, he said that if he had a conversation with the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman or his ministers: 'I would say I am very angry about that and say he's helping China's government. 'He just want to make Chinese government happy (sic). In an interview with the ABC on Thursday evening, Mr Newman said the government just wanted people to protest peacefully. 'All we're after is for people to be peaceful... But protest their hearts out, shout their lungs out in terms of what they want to say. 'But we do have to run a safe, secure G20.'

"Pupils and parents are being warned by head teachers about the dangers of a rapidly growing social networking site that puts teenagers at risk of vicious anonymous abuse. Schools across the country are sending out letters advising pupils not to use Ask.fm, which has more than 30 million users around the world and has been linked to suicides and serious bullying. The website lets anyone see the names, photographs and personal details of boys and girls as young as 13, then post comments or questions on their profile pages that range from insults to sexual advances and threats of violence. Warning: Pupils and parents are being told about the dangers of a rapidly growing social networking site that puts teenagers at risk of anonymous abuse . Unlike other services such as Facebook and Twitter, there is no way to report offensive comments, increase privacy settings or find out who is behind anonymous bullying. The website is based in Latvia, making it even more difficult for police to take action, while its owners dismiss any problems with the site as the result of British and Irish children being more cruel than those from other countries. Jim Gamble, head of security consultancy Ineqe, said: ‘Ask.fm has become associated with some of the worst forms of cyberbullying and has been linked to a number of recent teen suicides in Ireland and the US. ‘It is almost a stalker’s paradise. In cases like this young people need protection from those who exploit internet anonymity to intimidate, isolate and bully.’ Uncontrolled: Unlike other services such as Facebook and Twitter, there is no way to report offensive comments or find out who is behind anonymous bullying . Richard Piggin, deputy chief executive of the charity BeatBullying, said: ‘The tool that enables it to be anonymous can facilitate young people to say things that they might not say face to face or if their names were attached to it. So it releases their inhibitions, which can be very dangerous. ‘Sites like Ask.fm lack even the most basic child safety mechanisms or reporting protocols. They are of huge concern to us and the young people we work with.’ Founder Mark Terebin said: ‘We only have this situation in Ireland and the UK most of all. It seems that children are more cruel in these countries.’","Schools across the country are sending out letters advising pupils not to use Ask.fm .

"A former Miss Iceland has claimed the $2million reward for the tip which led to the arrest of fugitive crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger. Anna Bjornsdottir, a 57-year-old yoga instructor who starred in 1974's Miss Universe, tipped off police after recognising Bulger, one of America's most wanted people who had been on the run for 16 years, on a television news report. She is said to have become friendly with the mobster's long-term partner Catherine . Greig in Santa Monica, California, after the two women took a shared interest in a local stray . cat. Now and then: Bjornsdottir in a recent picture taken outside her home in Iceland, left, and in 1974, right . Bulger, 82, and longtime girlfriend Greig, 60, were arrested in June with a stash of about 30 firearms and $822,000 in cash hidden in the walls of their apartment. Just days before the arrest, the FBI had launched new televised public service announcements about the pair, aimed at female viewers who might have seen Greig. To evade authorities, the couple had moved from Boston to California, where they assumed the aliases Charles and Carol Gasko. Bulger was rarely seen by neighbours and known as a frail old man, no longer strong enough even to accompany his 'wife' on her morning stroll with their dog. In fact, with hundreds of thousands of dollars and a hoard of weapons stashed inside his flat, the Boston gangster was  second only to Osama bin Laden on the FBI's 'Most Wanted' list for his alleged role in 19 murders. Captured: The tip led to police finding James Whitey Bulger, left, and longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig, right . The changing faces of Bulger: This poster shows the various crimes he is alleged to have been involved in . The notorious fugitive now faces a possible death penalty for his alleged crimes as a mobster. Bulger was notorious for leading the . violent Winter Hill Gang, a largely Irish mob that ran loan-sharking, . gambling and drug rackets in the Boston area. He was nicknamed 'Whitey' for his . shock of bright platinum hair and wanted for his alleged role in 19 . murders, including the killilngs of businessmen in Florida and Oklahoma. Mrs Bjornsdottir received the huge reward in June, the FBI said, after she recognised Bulger in a news report when she was at home in Reykjavik, Iceland, and called authorities. Arrest: This is an undated FBI handout photo released Wednesday, Dec. 30, 1998, showing reputed Boston mobster and fugitive James J. ""Whitey"" Bulger . The FBI had revealed in September that it had . paid $2.1 million to 'more than one individual' for information that led . to the arrests of Bulger and Greig, but had not given any more details. According to the Boston Globe, Bjornsdottir collected $2 million of the $2.1 . million in FBI rewards for her tip. A call to the FBI's Boston office . was not immediately returned on Sunday.

She had moved to Southern California in the late 1970s and appeared in cosmetics commercials.

"If you thought Tesla's cars were the most innovative electric vehicles around, think again. Aircraft maker Airbus Group NV is learning from carmakers as it works on developing a small plane powered by hybrid electric engines that could represent its first move into the market for regional jets. The development of a regional plane, seating between 70 and 90 people, that can take off and land using electric power could take between 15 and 20 years, Airbus Group Chief Technology Officer Jean Botti told reporters in Munich. The E-Fan prototype electric aircraft, a 31.2-foot (9.5 metres) wingspan plane that Airbus is touting as the precursor to hybrid passenger aircraft, makes a demonstration flight above Merignac airport, France . Airbus, which with Boeing dominates the market for passenger jets, presently makes planes that seat more than 150 people. They are already working on an all-electric two-seater plane called the E-Fan, powered by two electric motors with a combined output of 60 kilowatts, hoping this technology will serve as a step to bringing electric motors on to larger aircraft. The E-Fan uses a pair of motors with ducted fans powered by a battery. It has a wingspan of 31.2 feet (9.5 metres) and weighs 1,212 pounds (550 kilograms) It can fly for about half an hour at 110 miles (177 kilometres) per hour. One . of the main landing gear wheels has a small electric motor that can . propel the airplane up to 35 miles (55 km) per hour to maximise flight . time. The two-seater, which Airbus says is suited for short missions such as pilot training and aerobatics, can run on its lithium-ion polymer batteries for half an hour, with the aim to get it up to an hour. The batteries are tricky, though, Botti says: 'They're causing us a lot of headaches.' Botti, who was part of a team developing battery-powered cars at General Motors Co more than 20 years ago, said Airbus was looking at electric cars in order to learn from them. But he declined to comment on how much the group was investing in hybrid and electric technologies. A pilot sits inside the EADS model of the E-Fan 2.0 prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at the Merignac airport. The E-Fan is a technology demonstrator of a fully electrically-powered, all-composite aircraft . Thumbs up: French Economy and Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg (right) and test pilot Didier Esteyne (left)show their pride after a demonstration flight of E-Fan . The two-seater E-Fan will be built at Bordeaux in southwest France and production could start at the end of 2017. Botti said he would like to see a prototype for a regional jet in 2030. The 31.2-foot (9.5 metres) wingspan E-Fan prototype electric aircraft made a demonstration flight above Merignac airport, southwestern France, on April 25, 2014. The plane results from an association between Aero Composite Saintonge (ACS) industry and European multinational aerospace and defence giant Airbus Group.","Airbus has unveiled their all-electric E-Fan 2.0 protoype electric aircraft .

"A teenage girl's profiles on social networking sites reveal the vile messages from internet trolls that friends say pushed her to kill herself. Jessica Laney, 16, was found dead at her home in Hudson, Florida, on Sunday night after users on social networking sites branded her 'fat', a 'slut' and tormented her over her looks and love life. Messages on the teen's profile on Ask.fm - where people can post . questions anonymously on a user's page - show the constant abuse that friends claim pushed Jessica over the edge. One user asks Jessica, 'Can you kill yourself already?' while another comments: 'Nobody even cares about you.' 'Bullied': Jessica Laney, 16, was found hanged at her home in Hudson, Florida, on Sunday after being bombarded with abuse on social networking sites, her friends have claimed . Jessica, who . was a keen soccer player, also takes to the page to reveal her own . turmoil, sharing her heartbreak at her troubled family life, school . spats and concerns over her body. 'My brother and I don't talk . anymore,' she wrote earlier this month. 'My dad, yeah he ignores me like . I don't even f***ing exist. I have almost no friends I actually trust. My mom bitches at me for the littlest things. I am basically all alone.' And in one now haunting post, she responded to a question asking what she thought about suicide. 'If . you ever feel this low I just wanna say it's not your fault,' she wrote . at the end of November. 'I know you feel useless, broken, not wanted . and alone. I was there. But I promise you it will get better. 'You will get through the endless . pain I promise school will be over soon and you can get away from the . judgmental f***s. Nothing is worth it; it will all get better.' 'Victim': Friends said the bullying Jessica suffered occurred on her Ask.fm page, where people called her 'a slut' Torment: Jessica's Ask.fm page - where users post anonymous questions - show her struggles . Her friends are now demanding the site is taken down, claiming the bullying led to Jessica's suicide. 'My friend Jessica Laney took her life,' friend Valeria Canales told ABC. 'She was constantly bullied and bullied. And she was pushed and pushed to . the point where she couldn’t handle it anymore. 'Ask.fm is a website where people . can ask anonymous questions to anyone they want. And that's how Jessica . was constantly put down and bullied... It needs to be shut down. 'She was a beautiful girl & everyone loved her. Shes gonna be missed. We have to put an end to bullying. Please help.' However, officials at Pasco County .

'Our . thoughts and prayers go to the Jessica Marie Laney's family as they . deal with their loss,' Sheriff's spokesman Doug Tobi added. Loss: Jessica had complained about her family and school life on her social networking pages . Missed: Jessica, who had a boyfriend, uploaded this picture to her Facebook profile at the weekend . Jessica Laney's friends are demanding that Ask.fm be closed after claiming messages posted on the social networking site led to the teen's suicide. On the website, people can post anonymous questions to other users' profiles. It is said to have more than 20 million members. On Jessica's profile, many of the questions are chatty and harmless, while others are cruel. The Latvian-based site has also come under fire in recent months after it was linked to the deaths of two teenagers in Ireland. Erin Gallagher, 13, was found dead days after warning users who had sent her abuse that she would kill herself. Six weeks earlier, Ciara Pugsley, 15, took her own life after being bombarded with hate messages on the site. Its terms of service recommend 'by way of example, and not as a limitation' that users do not transmit 'offensive, threatening, harassing, libellous, hate-oriented, harmful' content. On Tuesday, students at Fivay High School, where Jessica attended and played soccer, wore purple in remembrance of the teenager. The students are also pushing for the website, Ask.fm, to be closed down. 'After I saw that, I thought they should just delete the website,' friend Laney Torres told ABC Action News. 'Nobody should have that, to have people say stuff like that on there.' Around 3,000 people have signed a petition at Change.org to close the website. Sheriff Chris Nocco said the messages on Ask.fm are disturbing and an investigation continues. 'What we can say is that we are going through the social network sites right now,' he said. 'We don't even know if a crime occurred. It could have been nasty words that were said, that led this young girl . to take the actions that she did.' Ask.fm is a website where users . can post anonymous questions to other users and is said to have more . than 20 million members. The Latvian-based site, which targets 13 to 18 year olds, previously came under fire after it was linked to the deaths . of two teenagers in Ireland earlier this year. The . website's terms of service recommend 'by way of example, and not as a . limitation' that users do not transmit 'offensive, threatening, . harassing, libellous, hate-oriented, harmful' content. And during a previous investigation, . founder Mark Terebin posted: 'Ask.fm is just a tool which helps people . to communicate with each other, same as any other social network, same . as phone, same as piece of paper and pen. Upset: Another post on the social networking site reveals Jessica's turmoil at her family and social life .

'Don't blame a tool, but try to make . changes... start with yourself... be more polite, more kind, more . tolerant of others... cultivate these values in families, in schools.' Laney's death has been classified as a . suicide but the sheriff's office continues to investigate the events . that led to her death.

"The ex-wife of one of Google's founders is a self-confessed Scrooge when it comes to spending her fortune. Anne Wojcicki shares an estimated $30billion (£19.2billion) with her former husband Sergey Brin, making her one of the richest women in Silicon Valley. Despite this, she admits to loving freebies - and confessed that she used to drink so much complimentary carrot juice at work, it turned her skin orange. Scroll down for video . Anne Wojcicki, pictured with estranged husband Sergey Brin, at a party for her DNA-testing company in New York. The 41-year-old admits she misses life on a budget . 'Because it was expensive I felt I had to maximise the amount that I consumed, so I drank 32oz every day for a year and turned orange,' she told The Sunday Times. She explains: 'I grew up with my mom being very, very cheap, so when it's free I'm like 'Oh my God, it's free - I have to take as much as I can!' As a Wall Street newbie, she earned $40,000 a year, but still managed to save $1,000 a month and took subway rides for fun, simply because they were free. While her appearance exudes the wealth she has, she still feels the risk of parking illegally is worth it and never orders drinks in restaurants.

Always maximise consumption when it comes to complimentary drinks. Ms Wojcicki says she drank almost a litre of free carrot juice every day for a year - because it was 'expensive'. She hates it when people order drinks in restaurants, as drink and desserts are where all the margins are made. Park illegally on the street as the risk is worth it. Her research shows the 50/50 chance of getting a ticket is worth the fine if it means saving time and cost of a ticket more regularly. She said: 'I think being on a constraint with money makes you much more creative.' Ms Wojcicki met her estranged husband when he and Larry Page used her sister's garage to launch Google as a start-up. Having bonded over the fact they both grew up 'very cheap' they married in the Bahamas in 2007.

"A Belgian husband has spoken of his 'horror' after learning his wife of 19 years used to be a man. The duped 64-year-old - named only as Jan - said he had 'no clue' his bride had been born a boy. The shocking revelation only emerged after almost two decades of marriage when a cousin from his wife's native Indonesia finally exposed the truth. Jan told how he met 'Monica' in 1993 when she arrived in his home town of Antwerp as an au-pair to his sister's children. Picturesque: The city of Antwerp, where the pair have lived since they married 19 years ago. The marriage is on the rocks after Jan discovered 'Monica' was born a man and had undergone a sex change operation . He described as her 'very beautiful and feminine' - but said he now understood why she was 'no good at ironing'. Jan told Belgium's Nieuwsblad daily paper: 'My second marriage was on the rocks at the time and we quickly fell in love. 'I thought she was an attractive woman, and she was all woman - she had no male traits. 'She was 27 years old at the time, so I asked her if she wanted children. 'I was glad when she said she didn't as I was 44 and already had two of my own. Deception: Monica was described as 'feminine' by her unknowing husband. The transsexual hails from Indonesia (pictured) 'Over the years she said she was taking the pill, and even during sex I never noticed anything, though now I understand why she always used a lubricant, which is apparently normal among transexuals. 'She was always a good mother to my children, and also a fantastic cook, though we wasn't that great at cleaning and ironing - and now I know why!' But Jan said the relationship had begun to suffer over the past two years as she insisted on staying out late on her own wearing 'very revealing outfits' He added: 'She would wear tiny tops that revealed a lot of flesh and had more than 100 pairs of shoes. 'I also caught her ogling pictures of young men on the Internet. 'But I didn't suspect a thing until a cousin of hers came to visit and let something slip. 'I mentioned it to my son and he said he'd heard a rumour too that Monica used to be a man. 'One evening I confronted her and she finally confessed she had been born a boy and had a sex change operation. 'My world collapsed in a few seconds. I was horrified. I feel like have been violated for almost 20 years.' The couple are still living under the same roof after a judge refused to grant Jan an order to evict her. But he added: 'We live in separate rooms and rarely speak. What Monica has done to me and my family is unforgivable. I just want her out of my life.'","64-year-old had no idea his Indonesian wife was born a man .

"Riders are getting their first turns on a skyline-changing Las Vegas Strip observation wheel that's opening as the world's tallest. A ceremony Monday at 11:30 a.m. local time marked the completion of the 550-foot High Roller — built by Caesars Entertainment Corp. as part of its $550 million LINQ development at the heart of the glittery Strip resort corridor. Standing more than 100-feet taller than the London Eye, the High Roller is the tallest observation wheel in the world. Ready to roll: A general view of the Las Vegas High Roller at The LINQ in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 550-foot-tall attraction is the highest observation wheel in the world and features 28 spherical cabins that can hold up to 40 people each . Iconic: The highly anticipated High Roller has dramatically changed the Vegas Skyline . It's wheely here: It's not the first time someone in Vegas has tried to build an observation wheel. The partially constructed Skyvue is still visible on the south end of the Strip, far short of the 500 feet it was supposed to reach . The Ferris-style wheel has 28 glass-enclosed and air-conditioned gondolas that can each hold up to 40 people. A full revolution takes 30 minutes. Tickets are $24.95 in the daytime and $34.95 at night. The height tops the 443-foot London Eye and the 541-foot Singapore Flyer. Riders can take in unparalleled view of the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding valley during the 30 minutes that the wheel takes to complete one full rotation. Lights out: The Las Vegas High Roller at The LINQ is dark for Earth Hour to raise awareness for climate change on March 29 . Look at the view: There is an expansive view of the entire Strip. From the Wynn, LVH to the north, and down to Mandalay Bay on the south . Round and round: Each cabin has 300 square feet of glass, so you're guaranteed a great view. There are orange benches on each end. But mostly, people stand . The Ferris wheel is located across from Caesars Palace, adjacent to Flamingo Las Vegas and The Quad Resort & Casino. Caesars also said each pod is equipped with air conditioning which should provide relief for summertime riders. Caesars expects between 4 million and 5 million riders within the first year of operation. The new attraction also will serve as the towering centerpiece of Caesar Entertainment’s LINQ project, the combination retail, restaurant and entertainment complex that first broke ground in 2011. Flanked by the Flamingo and Quad resort casinos, the half-billion-dollar complex is arguably the biggest development to hit the Strip since CityCenter opened in 2009. The ride also includes a dynamic video and music show that fades away seamlessly as the wheel ascends to showcase the most impressive views of the Las Vegas valley. The High Roller is the latest in a string of family-friendly attractions to open in Las Vegas in recent years. Circus Circus debuted its new roller coaster ""El Loco"" last month. The Rio is preparing to open a new zipline, and the Slotzilla zipline downtown is also nearing completion. This summer, families will have two water parks to choose from: Wet ‘n' Wild, which opened last year, and Cowabunga Bay, which is scheduled to open in the coming weeks.","The High Roller breaks records as the world's tallest observation wheel .

"Shirley Temple died from a crippling lung disease brought on by a lifetime of smoking, MailOnline can reveal today. The woman dubbed America’s little darling, passed away earlier this month at the age of 85, and it was claimed that she died of natural causes. But MailOnline can exclusively reveal she was actually killed by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Secret . smoker: Even though Shirley Temple was a self-confessed chain smoker by . 17, later in life she was said to have kept her habit very private. Here she's pictured with cigarette in hand with her husband Lt Cmdr . Charles Black in 1953 . Official: Shirley Temple's death certificate puts the causes of death as pneumonia and COPD, which she suffered for years. Pneumonia is a common complication of COPD sufferers . Temple's death certificate held at San Mateo County reveals the primary cause of death as being pneumonia, then COPD. Pneumonia is often a complication of the lung condition. The condition is America’s third biggest killer and has symptoms similar to chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Sufferers have horrendous coughing fits in the latter stages of the disease. It is well known that Temple chain-smoked all through her late teens but in her later life she tried to keep the habit a secret, fearing her homespun goody-goody image might be tarnished. She did let her guard slip at certain times during her career, with one such occasion during an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 1979. The interviewer described how Temple waited until the television cameras left the room before lighting up. She apparently said she felt guilty and did not want to be photographed smoking – not for vanity’s sake, but to avoid setting, ‘a bad example’ for her millions of adoring fans. But in private she was still a heavy smoker and it seems the bad habit eventually caught up with her. COPD claimed the lives of 133,965 Americans in 2009 and in 2011, 12.7 million U.S. adults were estimated to have the condition. Other stars to have died having showing symptoms linked to COPD are Rat Pack legend Dean Martin, TV host and comedian Johnny Carson and American composer Leonard Bernstein. Our stunning revelation that the disease has claimed another victim will stun Shirley Temple fans around the world, who were left devastated by her death. The actress and singer passed away at her home in Woodside, California on February 10 surrounded by her family and caregivers. Cause . of death: The actress' death certificate said she died of COPD at the . age of 85. When she died earlier this year the cause of her death was . publicly given as 'natural causes' 'We salute her for a life of remarkable achievements as an actor, as a diplomat, and most importantly as our beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and adored wife for 55 years of the late and much missed Charles Alden Black,' her family said in a statement. She was born in the Californian beach town of Santa Monica on April 23, 1928, the third child of George Temple and his wife Gertrude. Temple was just three years old when she was spotted by talent scouts at her dance school and appeared on screen for the first time, in the one-reel short 'Poverty Row'. But it was the 1934 film Bright Eyes that made her famous. The actress's face and voice are imprinted on generations around the world as a result of her performance of the song On The Good Ship Lollipop. With her hair in ringlets, angelic face and wearing a checked pinafore dress, the unforgettable rendition made her one of the biggest box office draws of the era. At the year's end she had entered the list of the world's top ten moneymaking stars at number eight. She became the youngest actor ever to win an Academy Juvenile Award in 1935, at the age of six. Her handprints were placed in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood along with the biggest stars of the day. She was the world's number one box-office star from 1935 to 1938 - leaving Clark Gable trailing in second place. Her earnings were placed into a trust - during that time all she ever saw was $13 a month in allowance. Her mother, Gertrude, worked to keep her daughter from being spoiled by fame and was a constant presence during filming. Fatal: COPD is the third most common cause of death in America today, with the major cause being smoking . She went on to star in films such as Curly Top and The Littlest Rebel, helping the U.S. cope with the Great Depression of the 1930s, becoming a nationwide sensation. Mothers dressed their little girls like her, and a line of dolls was launched that are now highly sought-after collectables. Her immense popularity prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to say that 'as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right'. She was credited with helping save the film company 20th Century Fox, which owed $42million, from bankruptcy. Her career faltered in 1939 after Fox refused to loan her to MGM, she lost the lead in The Wizard of Oz to Judy Garland. However she struggled to maintain her cinematic career in adulthood, though she continued to work in television. Despite retiring from Hollywood in 1950, Shirley starred in 43 feature films. The actress married her first husband John Agar, a sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Corps, in 1945 when she was just 17 years old. He is the father of her daughter Linda. The couple divorced four years later after the marriage disintegrated due to Agar's drinking and infidelity. On holiday in Honolulu in 1950 she met and fell in love with California businessman Charles Alden Black, nine years her senior, who confessed that he had never seen one of her films. They were married in December of that year and their son Charles Jr. was born in 1952 and daughter Lori in 1954. They lived for many years in the San Francisco suburb of Woodside. The couple were married for 55 years until Charles passed away in August 2005 at the age of 86 from complications from a bone marrow disease. She described him as the 'love of her life' and kept his voice on the couple's answering machine.In 2006, when receiving a lifetime achievement award a few months after Charles had died, the veteran star said that her greatest roles were as wife, mother and grandmother. 'There's nothing like real love. Nothing,' she added. Although she had mostly retired from showbiz, by the early 1960s Temple's interest in politics soon brought her back into the spotlight. Goody goody: Shirley was said to have kept her habit secret because she didn't want to spoil her image and also set a bad example . She made an unsuccessful bid as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967. After Richard Nixon became president in 1969, he appointed her as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. In the 1970s, she was U.S. ambassador to Ghana and later ambassador to Czechoslovakia during the administration of the first President Bush. She was the first woman to serve as US chief of protocol in the Department of State. 'Politicians are actors too, don't you think?' she once said. 'Usually if you like people and you're outgoing, not a shy little thing, you can do pretty well in politics.' 'I have one piece of advice for those of you who want to receive the lifetime achievement award. Start early.' In 1999, the American Film Institute ranking of the top 50 screen legends placed Temple at No. 18 in a list of 25 actresses. In 2006, Temple received the Screen Actors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award for having 'lived the most remarkable life, as the brilliant performer the world came to know when she was just a child to the dedicated public servant who has served her country both at home and abroad for 30 years'. She is survived by her children Susan, Charles Jr., and Lori, granddaughter Teresa and great-granddaughters Lily and Emma.","Shirley Temple's family said she died from 'natural causes' in February .

"Josie Cunningham has said she will inform the father of her baby in a Christmas card . NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has said she will reveal the identity of her baby's father to him on Christmas Day, it has been reported. The 24-year-old asked three men to take a paternity test to determine which one could be three-month-old Grace's father - and she plans to write the outcome in their Christmas card. She expects to find out the truth in two weeks and claims all three men will receive a card late on Christmas Eve, but only one will have a copy of the test results. The mother-of-three shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS and then threatened to have an abortion so she could appear in Big Brother. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'How to tell all three men has been a really hard decision but, as it's Christmas I thought it would be a really nice surprise for Grace's dad to find out on Christmas Day. 'I feel that whoever the father is, he should be pleased that he has had such a beautiful daughter with me.' The wannabe model from Leeds, West Yorkshire, has arranged for a friend to put the cards through all three of the potential fathers front doors late on Christmas Eve. She will also change her mobile number and the card being posted to Grace's father will be the only one which contains her new one. Josie added: 'Whichever man it is he's a lucky chap. Not only does he have a beautiful daughter but he got to have a wild night between the sheets with me.' At one point, the former glamour model thought the child's father could be Hull City captain Curtis Davis, but it was later revealed that she had been duped. The man, who she began sleeping with after meeting him at a Leicester hotel in April last year, had allegedly told her he was the £2.2million central defender. Friends had warned her it might not be him but she still fell for it, even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google. Writing on Twitter at the time she said: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.' Scroll down for video . Josie Cunningham, left. was duped into thinking her boyfriend and the baby's potential father was Curtis Davis, Hull City captain, right. But it turned out to be someone pretending to be the footballer . She has sent off for a DNA test for two of the men - one of which is a surgeon she slept with whilst working as a £1,000-a-night prostitute. The other is her best friend's boyfriend and the third is the Curtis Davis 'look-a-like' The other two contenders for the possible father include a surgeon she slept with whilst working as a £1,000-a-night prostitute and her best friend's boyfriend. She has split the cost of the £300 DNA test between two of the men, with the footballer impostor refusing to give a sample, and says if they aren't the father they will get their money back. However, she believes it is unlikely the conman will be the father because Grace is 'light-skinned', she told the paper. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The 24-year-old has sparked fury recently among mothers after saying breastfeeding was 'borderline incest' And the former escort, who already has two sons aged six and three, only stopped smoking and drinking when she found out her unborn child was a longed-for girl. She also said she would attempt to sell tickets for £10,000 to watch the live birth of her daughter. And recently the single mother sparked fury among mothers after saying breastfeeding was 'vile and borderline incest'. Josie has now embarked on her next venture - a string of websites to encourage girls to 'get pregnant and live on benefits'. The young mother, who has just moved from her council house in Leeds to a bigger one in a village 20 miles away - has launched WantKidsNow.com, which allows women to arrange unprotected sex sessions. Josie, pictured leaving St James Hospital in Leeds, with baby Grace and her agent in September, this year . She has also set up easysingles.co.uk, for people seeking casual sex, and pullthepig.com, aimed at average looking girls, The Sun reports. She told the paper: 'People will think I'm promoting unprotected sex so women can get pregnant, bag themselves a council house and have a life on benefits. 'But it's really no different to what many girls have on a Saturday night. Parents gain more points in many councils' scoring system so having a child definitely helps.' Josie compared herself to '2014's answer to Cilla Black' and reckons the sites will turn over £800,000 a month. Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Josie, from Leeds, made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice. Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Josie Cunningham gave birth in September but doesn't know who father is .

"Mohamed Hassan, 55, is a world-renowned award-winning consultant working in a government hospital in Abu Dhabi. His son discovered the bomb . This is the American doctor whose family's quick thinking foiled a bomb plot - and helped police catch the Reem Island Ghost suspected of murdering a teacher in a shopping mall. Mohamed Hassan is a world-renowned award-winning consultant working in a government hospital in Abu Dhabi. The 55-year-old Egyptian doctor studied in the US, where he worked and won numerous accolades over more than a decade, including the title of physician of the year from the Pennsylvania Advisory Board in 2003. He is a paediatric nephrologist working with young kidney transplant patients. It was Dr Hassan's 13-year-old son who spotted the makeshift bomb, packed with nails to create maximum havoc, on the doorstep of their beachfront apartment in the United Arab Emirates capital. He saw the object on their doormat as he was going to the mosque to pray and told his mother. She alerted police, who quickly dismantled the bomb before it could explode. Within 48 hours, officers had arrested Dalal al Hashemi, a 38-year-old Emirati of Yemeni origin, at her home in Abu Dhabi, where they discovered bomb-making equipment. There were fears she was not acting alone, although police have refused to be drawn on how many others might have been involved. Security officials said the two victims - American teacher Ibolya Ryan, 47, and the Arab-American doctor - had been targeted because of their nationality. Al Hashemi was said to have given a full confession and is now facing the death penalty if she is convicted of a terrorist act. Father-of-three Dr Hassan, a consultant nephrologist at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City and an expert in kidney diseases, told the government-run Emirates News Agency the bomb attempt and murder, thought to have been committed by the same burqa-clad female suspect, amounted to 'a cowardly crime that is alien to the good UAE society whose government is keen to show the highest generosity and hospitality. 'This crime is an aggression against innocent people whose only fault is that they are western nationals.' He said it was only thanks to his family's swift actions and those of the police that more injuries were not caused among his family and 'anyone who might have been in the vicinity where the bomb was planted, including children, other residents, cleaners, guards, delivery men and other innocent people'. Attack: In footage that was released earlier this week, the suspect can be seen entering the mall at 1.13pm . On the move: In other newly-released footage, the suspect is seen dragging a small suitcase towards where an Egyptian-American doctor lives. She is accused of leaving a home-made bomb outside his door . Caught on camera: She is seen dragging her small suitcase across the parking lot of the apartment building . Dr Hassan said his wife called him after their son discovered the bomb. The family were evacuated and rehomed in a hotel apartment. It is not known how the attacker knew Dr Hassan's nationality. She allegedly stabbed Mrs Ryan in public toilets in Boutik Mall on Reem island on Monday - then drove 30 minutes to Dr Hassan's beachfront apartment block. A security guard became suspicious after seeing a veiled woman wearing gloves wheeling a small black suitcase into the building, then leaving several minutes later. A similarly-dressed woman had visited the apartment several days earlier - but once she had checked to see if the Hassans were home, she fled before they had a chance to identify her. Dr Hassan said he had been called personally by Sheikh Saif Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the deputy prime minister of the UAE and the Interior Minister in charge of security. The prince assured him the offender would be brought to justice. Dr Hassan said: 'The phone call provided great relief during that critical ordeal. It reflects the noble and civilised approach of the leaders and the government's work to consolidate the security and stability of the UAE.' The doctor has been working in Abu Dhabi since 2006. Mom: Teacher Ibolya Ryan, 47,  was the mother of 11-year-old twin boys. She was previously married and lived with her then-husband, Paul, in Denver, Colorado. She was killed in Boutik Mall on Reem island . Victim: Mrs Ryan, 47, a teacher, said in online profiles that she was born in Hungary and raised in Romania . He studied medicine at Alexandria University in Egypt before completing his postgraduate studies in the US. He practiced and taught in the US for more than a decade. He was an assistant professor of medicine in Pennsylvania State University and was awarded the Ronald M Franz trophy for high academic achievements in 1996. He won physician of the year seven years later. Dr Hassan is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and of the American Society of Nephrology and is a reviewer for the American Board of Internal Medicine. He has published numerous papers on diabetes and nephropathy and is an expert in acute and chronic kidney failure and kidney transplant evaluation. Dr Hassan is a paediatric nephrologist treating young kidney transplant patients. He did his postgraduate studies in Capital Health System in New Jersey and was a fellow in nephrology in Thomas Jefferson University, Pennsylvania.

"These are the brazen images of James 'Whitey' Bulger visiting his old haunt Alcatraz - just weeks into his 16-year run from the FBI. One picture, taken around 1995, shows the most wanted gangster smiling with his 'moll' Teresa Stanley on a tour of the notorious prison where Whitey was incarcerated from 1959 to 1963. In one incredible image Bulger . and Stanley even donned prison stripes outside 'The Rock' for a souvenir snap, both stencilled 'Property of . Alcatraz.' The candid holiday snaps - which show the pair visiting Britain's Tower of London, dining in Paris and posing with the Stanley Cup - will embarrass the FBI who for years have been criticised for not trying hard enough to catch Bulger. Jail birds: This Souvenir photo of James 'Whitey' Bulger and Teresa Stanley shows the pair dressed in mock prison uniform while on a visit to Alcatraz. It is thought to have been taken while he was on the run from the FBI . The Alcatraz pictures are thought to have been taken in January 1995, just weeks after he fled Boston on a tip off that the FBI were about to arrest him. The family friend who provided the pictures to the New York Post said the fugitive pair took time out from dodging the law to visit the site of Bulger's previous imprisonment almost 40 years before. Travel: A photo showing James 'Whitey' Bulger's expired passport. The previously unseen pictures show Bulger lived a fine life while on the run from the FBI . The law finally caught up with him . last week when the now 81-year-old and his long-term girlfriend . Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica. Bulger . is charged with 19 murders, extortion, money laundering and other . crimes; if convicted, he faces life in prison or the death penalty. The incredible images from Alcatraz show just how confident he was about not getting caught. They will lead many to speculate how he may have gone to visit his old cell, where he was locked up for four years on federal armed robbery charges. Wanted and on the run, Whitey became a master of evasion by adopting an unassuming lifestyle, limiting his social contact . to small talk and adhering to a code of silence from the mob life he . left behind. When federal agents tracked him to his lair last week, it . was only after targeting the one part of his past that Bulger didn't . leave behind -  his girlfriend Catherine. By all . accounts, the two did little to ever arouse suspicion, posing as two . retirees holed up in a bland white 1970s apartment complex in Santa . Monica amid other buildings of the same era. Summer holiday: James 'Whitey' Bulger and girlfriend Teresa Stanley are pictured outside the Tower of London, England. Bulger was caught last week after 16 years on the run . Cordon Bleu: Bulger is seen here with Teresa Stanley at dinner in Paris, France. The fugitive was a master at evading capture, while also living the high life . Although Bulger was believed to have . millions of dollars stashed in secret accounts, and investigators found . $800,000 hidden in the apartment, the couple didn't live lavishly. They . paid $1,145 cash several days in advance each month for a . rent-controlled unit, while newer neighbours paid more than twice as . much. Greig shopped at a 99-cent store. Cowboy: This undated photo of Bulger was taken at an 'old time' studio while on holiday with Teresa Stanley . Occasionally, they splurged, even while remaining discreet. Andrew . Turner, the general manager of Michael's, recognised pictures of the . fugitives this week as the couple who dined occasionally at table No 23 . at the upscale institution. He had a record of them paying their $190 . tab in cash for a meal that included Grey Goose vodka cocktails, foie . gras, steak and lobster, topped off by wine, in September 2009 - the . month Bulger turned 80. The couple kept to themselves and were . unassuming, Turner recalled. 'This guy was just nice, mild and meek, milquetoast in a little apartment in Santa Monica,' said Bill Keefer, a . retired U.S. marshal who supervised the witness protection program in . Los Angeles, Hawaii and Long Island, New York. Family: Undated photo of Bulger with his younger brothers, William Bulger and Jackie Bulger . Fun: Bulger is seen here on an Island holiday in this undated photo . 'This guy should have been a . supervisor with the marshal's witness protection programme. He did an . outstanding job, the louse.' Neighbours of the couple said they stuck close to home. Greig was . the more outgoing of the two while Bulger was sometimes cranky and . reclusive. Barbara Gluck, a tenant down the hall, described Greig as . sweet and lovely, Bulger not so. 'It was like she was hanging on to a time-bomb,' Gluck said. 'At one point, she said, ""he has a rage issue"".' Buddies:  Bulger with Chris Nilan, formerly of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, with the Stanley Cup. Nilan was the son in law of Bulger's longtime companion Teresa Stanley . Others said the couple went out of their way to ingratiate themselves while also maintaining a distance. 'They were good neighbours,' said Catalina Schlank, 88. 'I will miss them.' Bulger's . wealth helped him maintain independence from family or former criminal . allies who might have given away his location, said retired FBI agent . Scott Bakken, who worked the Bulger case for a short time in 2002. 'Here you have somebody who is far more . sophisticated than some 18-year-old who killed someone in a drive-by,' Bakken said. 'To be a successful fugitive you have to cut . all contacts from your previous life. He had the means and kept a low . profile.'

The typhoon, which made landfall in Eastern Samar late Saturday, is moving slowly, dumping heavy rain that could trigger landslides and more flash flooding. At least three people have died, with local radio stations suggesting that number could be higher in Eastern Samar and Iloilo, where some reports of deaths are yet to be confirmed by officials or the Red Cross. Among those killed by the typhoon were a baby and a woman who died of hypothermia in Iloilo yesterday. Another person died after being hit by a falling tree in the eastern town of Dolores, where the typhoon first made landfall . Two women were also hurt by another falling tree when it struck the tricycle taxi they were riding on in central Negros Oriental province. Traumatised by the massive death and destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan - which struck just a year ago, killing thousands - more than 800,000 people fled to around 1,000 emergency shelters as the government, backed by the 120,000-strong military, tried to maintain a degree of calm. Rhea Estuna, a 29-year-old mother of one, fled on Thursday to an evacuation center in Tacloban - the city hardest-hit by Haiyan last year - and waited in fear as Hagupit's wind and rain lashed the school where she and her family sought refuge.

The EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, said a team of experts would be deployed to help assess the damage and needed response. 'The Philippines are not alone as they brace up for a possible hardship,' Mr Stylianides said, adding that the European Commission was 'hoping that the impact will be less powerful than a year ago, when Typhoon Haiyan left a devastating imprint on the country.'

While officials expressed relief, they were quick to warn that Hagupit - Filipino for 'smash' or 'lash' - was still on course to barrel across three major central islands before starting to blow away Tuesday into the South China Sea. Several typhoon-lashed eastern villages isolated by downed telephone and power lines were out of contact, Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman said. 'It's too early to tell,' Philippine Red Cross Secretary-General Gwendolyn Pang said. 'Let's cross our fingers that it will stay that way. It's too close to Christmas.' Army troops were deployed to supermarkets and major roads in provinces in the typhoon's path to prevent looting and chaos and clear debris, all of which slowed the government's response to Haiyan last year. Unlike past years, many people readily left high-risk communities ahead of Hagupit, Soliman said. He added: 'Haiyan was the best teacher of all. People did not need much convincing to move to safety.

"Six prisoners held for 12 years at Guantanamo Bay have been sent to Uruguay to be resettled as refugees, the U.S. government announced Sunday — a deal that had been delayed for months by security concerns at the Pentagon and political considerations in the South American country. The six men — four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian — are the first prisoners transferred to South America from the U.S. base in Cuba, part of a flurry of recent releases amid a renewed push by President Barack Obama to close the prison. All were detained as suspected militants with ties to al-Qaeda in 2002 but were never charged. They had been cleared for release since 2009 but could not be sent home and the U.S. struggled to find countries willing to take them. Pictured: The ambulances transporting the six detainees arriving from Guantanamo heads for the Military Hospital in Montevideo on December 7 . Arrived: Six men detained at Guantanamo for more than a decade have been resettled in Uruguay, as US President Barack Obama attempts to fulfill his long-delayed promise to close the US military prison . Uruguayan President Jose Mujica agreed to accept the men as a humanitarian gesture and said they would be given help getting established in a country with a small Muslim population. 'We are very grateful to Uruguay for this important humanitarian action, and to President Mujica for his strong leadership in providing a home for individuals who cannot return to their own countries,' U.S. State Department envoy Clifford Sloan said. Among those transferred was Abu Wa'el Dhiab, a 43-year-old Syrian on a long-term hunger strike protesting his confinement who was at the center of a legal battle in U.S. courts over the military's use of force-feeding. The Pentagon identified the other Syrians sent to Uruguay on Saturday as Ali Husain Shaaban, 32; Ahmed Adnan Ajuri, 37; and Abdelahdi Faraj, 39. Also released were Palestinian prisoner Mohammed Abdullah Taha Mattan, 35, and 49-year-old Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi of Tunisia. Uruguayan officials declined comment Sunday on the transfers. Adriana Ramos, a receptionist at a military hospital in Montevideo, the capital, said the six men were being examined there but declined to provide any details. Hunger strike: Among the six was Syrian prisoner Jihad Diyab, 43, who had staged a hunger strike and requested a US court to order prison officials to stop force-feeding him . Arrival: The Pentagon identified the other Syrians sent to Uruguay on Saturday as Ali Husain Shaaban, 32; Ahmed Adnan Ajuri, 37; and Abdelahdi Faraj, 39. Also released were Palestinian prisoner Mohammed Abdullah Taha Mattan, 35, and 49-year-old Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi of Tunisia . Cori Crider, a lawyer for Dhiab from the human rights group Reprieve, praised Mujica, a former political prisoner himself, for accepting the men. 'Despite years of suffering, Mr. Dhiab is focused on building a positive future for himself in Uruguay,' said Crider, who was heading to Montevideo to meet with him. 'He looks forward to being reunited with his family and beginning his life again.' The U.S. has now transferred 19 prisoners out of Guantanamo this year, all but one of them within the last 30 days. Saturday's move brings the total number of prisoners still at Guantanamo to 136 — the lowest number since shortly after the prison opened in January 2002. Officials say several more releases are expected by the end of the year. Obama administration officials had been frustrated that the transfer took so long, blaming outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for not approving the move sooner. They said after Mujica had agreed to take the men in January, the deal sat for months on Hagel's desk, awaiting his signature as required by law. The Pentagon didn't send the notification of the transfer to Congress until July. Uruguayan President Jose Mujica reiterated last week his willingness to resettle six Guantanamo prisoners in his country while calling on the United States to end its decades-old embargo against Cuba. Mujica's open letter to President Barack Obama appeared Friday on his presidency website. Uruguay's leader agreed earlier this year to resettle the men for humanitarian reasons. Held at the U.S. base in Cuba, they are not charged with a crime. The U.S. says they pose no threat, but cannot return to their countries. 'We have offered our hospitality for human beings who suffered an atrocious kidnapping in Guantanamo,' Mujica said Friday, hinting a transfer could occur soon. The Pentagon in the fall gave Congress a required 30-day notice that it intended to transfer the prisoners to Uruguay, but resettlement was postponed.

The public Maciel Hospital in Montevideo, where one of the six Guantanamo detainees arrived on December 7, according to local sources.  Six Guantanamo detainees, including four Syrians, one Palestinian and one Tunisian, have been transferred to Uruguay . By then, the transfer had become an issue in Uruguay's political election and officials there decided to postpone it until after the vote. Tabare Vazquez, a member of Mujica's ruling coalition and a former president, won a runoff election on Nov. 30. Upon taking office, Obama had pledged to close the prison but was blocked by Congress, which banned sending prisoners to the U.S. for any reason, including trial, and placed restrictions on sending them abroad. The slow pace of releases has created a tense atmosphere inside the prison. A hunger strike that began in February 2013 totaled about 100 prisoners at its peak, including Dhiab and Faraj. The U.S. now holds 67 men at Guantanamo who have been cleared for release or transfer but, like the six sent to Uruguay, can't go home because they might face persecution, a lack of security or some other reason. Prisoners from Guantanamo have been sent around the world but this weekend's transfer was the largest group sent to the Western Hemisphere. Four Guantanamo prisoners were sent to Bermuda in 2009 and two were sent to El Salvador in 2012 but have since left. Here is a look at the prison on the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following the release of six prisoners to Uruguay: . The detention center now holds 136 prisoners spread out over several camps depending on the category and behavior of the detainee. That is the lowest number since shortly after it opened in January 2002 to detain and interrogate detainees suspected of involvement in terrorism or having links to al-Qaida and the Taliban. About 600 prisoners have been released under President Barack Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, most of them sent to their home countries. A detainee walks outside his cell in Camp Delta 4 at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The latest move by the Obama administration comes as the president tries to make good on a years old promise to close the Cuba prison . President Obama pledged to close the prison within a year of taking office but was blocked by Congress, which has enacted legislation that prohibits transferring any prisoners to the U.S. mainland for any reason, including trial or imprisonment, and imposed rules making it harder to sending them overseas. Congress eased the transfer restrictions last year and they have resumed after a lull. The U.S. has released 19 so far this year and more releases are expected by Dec. 31. Of the 136 still detained, there are 67 prisoners who have been determined to be suitable for release by a task force of U.S. government agencies. Some of these men can't go back to their homelands for reasons that include the possibility that they could face persecution or torture or because the U.S. considers their countries too unstable to provide adequate guarantees that they can be monitored and kept from engaging in militant activity. The remaining prisoners pose the biggest challenge to any effort to close the detention center. They are a mix of prisoners who have either been deemed too dangerous to release or are at some stage of the process of trial by military commission. This last group includes five men charged with terrorism and other crimes for their alleged roles in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. Their case is in the pre-trial stage and no date has been set for the death penalty trial.","The six men — four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian — are the first prisoners transferred to South America from the US base in Cuba .
All were detained as suspected militants with ties to al-Qaeda who were cleared for release in 2009 - only now would a country take them .
Uruguayan President Jose Mujica agreed to accept the men as a humanitarian gesture while asking Obama to end Cuba embargo ."
"Stolen: Thieves are thought to have used a crowbar to prise the historic plaque from the wall of Dore Abbey . A string of medieval monuments stolen from historic country churches are believed to have been targeted by a gang stealing the artefacts to order for wealthy collectors overseas. The stone effigy of a 13th century bishop is the latest in a series of treasured objects lifted from unlocked churches in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire in recent months - ranging from a medieval grave slab to a carved stone knight dating back 800 years. The culprits are thought to have used a crowbar to prise open iron clamps fastening the 15in tall plaque - which originally marked the spot where the 13th century bishop of Hereford John de Breton's heart was interred - to the wall of Dore Abbey in Herefordshire. Churchgoers in the area were left devastated by the loss of the 'irreplaceable treasure', which experts believe was swiped by a gang of thieves that is smuggling the artefacts to other countries - most likely those with different laws surrounding the ownership of stolen property. In Britain title always reverts to the original owner, but in some countries an object bought in good faith becomes the property of the buyer. Targeted: Historic Dore Abbey is thought to have been targeted by thieves stealing historic artefacts to sell to collectors overseas . Sally Badham, president of the Church Monuments Society, told The Times she was convinced the monuments were being smuggled abroad. 'My guess is they are being stolen to order,' she said. 'They (the thieves) clearly know what they want and they are clearly going around with intent.' It is understood that some of the stolen items could fetch many thousands of pounds if they were to be sold legitimately on the open market, but Miss Badham stressed the historic and sentimental value of the missing effigies. 'They are all part of our heritage,' she said. 'We want to pass them on to future generations.' Hazel Prowse, church warden at Dore Abbey, said of the effigy stolen from the Grade I listed church: 'You can't put a price on it. 'It is irreplaceable.' In May an 800-year-old carved figure of a medieval knight was wrenched from the windowsill in St Michael's Church, Castle Frome, near Ledbury. Other historic artefacts targeted by thieves include a medieval grave slab showing a young girl wearing a cloak, and the head and shoulders of a grave effigy of Sir Roger de Wakering from the church he founded at Newland in the Forest of Dean.","The effigy of a 13th century bishop is the latest historic object to disappear from a country church .

"Zoe Sugg, known under her vlogger name Zoella, sold a record number of copies of her debut book last week, but rumours are flying that she did not write the book herself. The 24-year-old YouTube sensation's book Girl Online broke the all-time record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days. Rumours soon spread  that Zoella's book had been ghostwritten, and now publishers have admitted that the tween-idol 'did not write the book  on her own.' Publishers Penguin has said Zoe 'Zoella' Sugg, 24, 'did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' but did not confirm that the sales success was ghostwritten . Girl Online, the first in a two-book deal Miss Sugg has signed with Penguin, is a novel about a teenage blogger, which thanks to Zoella's ginormous fanbase,is set to become the best-selling book this Christmas. The record number sales is higher than the first books of veteran authors included JK Rowling and Dan Brown, author of the Da Vinci Code. The figure is also more than five times higher than the number of copies which were sold of EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey in its first week. 'To be factually accurate, you would need to say Zoe Sugg did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' a penguin spokesperson told the Sunday Times, adding that despite this, the story is very much Miss Sugg's work. Girl Online's acknowledgements thanks 'everyone at Penguin for helping me put together my first novel, especially Amy Alward and Siobhan Curham, who were with me every step of the way.' Zoe Sugg, pictured, who is a video blogger sold almost 80,000 copies of her book during its first week . Ms Sugg's 'vlog' has 12 million viewers a month while an estimated two million people follower her on Twitter . The former, Ms Alward, is Zoella's editor, the latter, Siobham Curham, is a freelance writer and the author of several young adult novels. A since deleted post on Ms Curham's blog allegedly read that she had been approached with writing a novel in six weeks, and finished the task, 80,000 words, in August. MailOnline has reached out to Ms Curham for comment. Zoella’s ‘vlogs’, short for video blogs, attract 12 million hits each month. She began posting the videos in 2009 as a ‘creative outlet’. She now has six million followers on YouTube and is read by more than 2.5 million on Twitter. Penguin Random House, the publisher behind Girl Online, agreed to sign Zoella after its CEO Tom Weldon was told by his 13-year-old goddaughter that the book would be ‘a huge best-seller’. Miss Sugg was also an unlikely addition to Band Aid 30 where she joined Bob Geldof and One Direction for the charity single. She also featured in the November issue of Vogue. Of the record-breaking achievement, Miss Sugg said: ‘It’s such an amazing feeling. I’m so grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of Girl Online. I love that so many of my viewers are enjoying the book! This year has been so exciting and this for sure is the icing on the cake.'","Zoe 'Zoella' Sugg, 24, sold almost 80,000 copies of debut book in a week .

"A former school counselor has been jailed for almost 14 years for having sex with a 13 year old student. Brooke Dinkel slept with the underage teen at her home while he was working there to earn money. The 33-year-old had met the teen while at Smoky Valley Middle School in Salina, Kansas, during her first year as a counselor. The affair lasted from October 2013 to March 2014 when school officials were tipped off about the relationship. Sentenced: Brooke Dinkel was sentenced Thursday to nearly 14 years in prison for having a months-long sexual affair with a 13-year-old student at the Kansas school where she was a counselor . Prosecutor Christina Trocheck said Dinkel, who has daughters aged four and six, gave the boy gifts and encouraged the relationship. She told the court despite warning from colleagues and friends Dinkel continued the illegal relationship. Trocheck also said the counselor shared intimate details of her sexual encounters with friends and had tried to manipulate the teen into lying about their affair. The court heard Dinkel had defied a court order to contact the teen after her arrest and while out on bond. Dinkel's lawyer had argued at the sentencing hearing that she was mentally unstable and incapable of forming criminal intent. Asked for leniency: Dinkel unsucessfully pleaded with the judge Thursday to let her stay with her daughters, aged 4 and 6 . A psychologist told the court Dinkel suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and a personality disorder with 'borderline avoidant and dependent traits,' according to the Salina Journal. The counselor had claimed the teen raped her on December 26th at her home saying 'after that, I don't know what happened to me.' Dinkel wept in court as she was given the chance to plead for a light sentence. She told judge Patrick Thompson: 'I'm begging you to be able to return to my family, my little girls . 'I need counseling; I need medication, but I am not a sexual predator.' The judge rejected her plea and sentencing her to 13 years and nine months in jail told her: 'You are not the victim' Scene: Dinkel was a counselor at Smoky Valley Middle School in Salina, Kansas.

"Teenage girls are increasingly looking at fitness bloggers on Instagram and Facebook as role models but it is making them feel guilty that their bodies don't match up, new research shows. Associate Professor Claire Drummond from Flinders University set out to study what motivates or discourages girls aged 13 to 17 to do physical activity. But in her interviews with 75 teens she was surprised to find that most of them said their main role models were women who ran 'fitspo' or fitness inspiration pages. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Lomas, from the NSW Central Coast, has 115,000 followers on Instagram and says she is mindful to portray a 'balanced' attitude for her young fans . Ms Lomas, 20, lost 11kg after switching to a 'clean eating' diet, which avoids processed foods, two years ago and has since gathered followers by posting pictures of her workouts and meals . 'I thought they would say people like Sally Pearson or their parents, but for the majority it came out that it was these online fitness models on Instagram and Facebook,' she said, . 'I asked them to explain what do you like about them and they said the fact they have magnificent, awesome bodies or great abs. 'But they also said things like ""Seeing how perfect they are made me feel really bad about my body"".' Professor Drummond said when she looked at the 'fitspo' pages mentioned by her interview subjects, the majority of the women running the sites had no background in fitness or nutrition. Others were models or personal trainers whose jobs allowed them plenty of time for exercise. Ms Lomas works for a fitness marketing company and is signed to Chadwick modelling agency . 'I try to post every aspect of the health and fitness world, like when it comes to days when I don't feel like working out, because obviously everyone's human and everyone has days like that,' Ms Lomas said . 'Some of them have degrees but the majority are doing it because they're, let's face it, genetically-blessed and really good at doing their fitness,' she said. 'A very small percentage can spend all day long working on their bodies, it's just an unrealistic perception that some girls are taking away.' Associate Professor Claire Drummond from Flinders University . But Professor Drummond said fitness models didn't always have a negative effect.

"The seven year itch is the psychological theory that happiness in couples starts to deteriorate after seven years together, increasing the chances of a break-up. The phrase became world-famous after Marilyn Monroe starred in a film of the same name in 1955, where she plays an attractive actress who becomes the focus of a married man's affections. But new research shows that psychologists got it wrong - the point in a marriage when a couple is most unhappy, therefore most likely to stray, is actually the ten-year mark. The seven year itch is theory that love begins to fade in couples at this time. The idea was made world-famous in 1955 film starring Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell. But a new study says the point when couples are most likely to split is actually ten years . A study involving more than 2000 women born between 1957 and 1964  questioned their feelings about their marriage over 35 years. During the interviews, students at Brigham Young University in Utah found that in two thirds of marriages, happiness started at high levels but then steadily declined. Women revealed themselves to be most  unhappy in their relationships after ten years together. Researchers suggest that this point coincides with when the females are juggling the biggest workloads both in household chores and childcare. Women revealed themselves to be most unhappy in their relationships after ten years together.Researchers suggest that this point coincides with when the females are juggling the biggest workloads both in household chores and childcare . But these levels of discord are short-lived, just five years later, women began to argue much less with their partners. Those who managed to stay together for more than three decades found that their levels of happiness began to grow again, although for most it never reached the same levels as when they first got married. Couples at this stage in their relationship also argued less than they had at any point in their marriage. The researchers linked this upwards turn in emotion with the point when a couple's children reached the age of financial independence.","Seven year itch is theory that love begins to fade in couples at this time .

"Read Martin Samuel on why one of the greatest players of his generation was never able to deliver for England . England captain Steven Gerrard has ended his international career to focus on Champions League glory with Liverpool. Gerrard, 34, won 114 caps for England, scoring 21 goals in the 14 years since his debut. The Liverpool midfielder captained his country at the World Cup in Brazil this summer but they went out in the group stage and he has decided to call it a day on the international stage. Walking away: Gerrard has announced his retirement from international football after 14 years . The tenacious midfielder has won the third highest number of caps for England: . 1. Peter Shilton - 1252. David Beckham - 1153. Steven Gerrard - 1144. Bobby Moore - 1085. Ashley Cole - 1076. Bobby Charlton - 1067. Frank Lampard - 1068. Billy Wright - 1059. Wayne Rooney - 9510. Bryan Robson - 9 . Gerrard, who is England's third most capped player ever, behind David Beckham and Peter Shilton, said: 'I have enjoyed every minute of representing my country and it is a sad day for me knowing that I won’t pull on the England shirt again. 'However, I do look forward to continuing my strong relationship with the FA and helping out in any way I can going forward. 'I’d like to firstly thank my family and friends for all their support throughout my England journey. 'I’d also like to thank everyone who has been part of my international career, from the England managers I’ve played under to the staff at the FA and, of course, all the players I’ve been fortunate to play alongside. 'In particular, the supporters have been amazing, not least in Brazil when they got behind the team despite the disappointing results. The cap fits: Gerrard played his first international in 2000 under Kevin Keegan, against Ukraine . Delight: 'I have enjoyed every minute of representing my country,' said the former England skipper . Back then: Gerrard made his England debut alongside the likes of Steve McManaman 14 years ago . Social statement: Gerrard took to Instagram to announce his retirement . Who should be England's next captain? Who should be England's next captain? Now share your opinion . 'I’d especially like to thank Roy [Hodgson], firstly for giving me the captaincy permanently when he took the job, making me the proudest man in the country and allowing me to fulfill my childhood dream. 'He has been very understanding over the past few weeks and is a man I will always hold in the highest regard. 'This has been a very difficult decision, one of the toughest I’ve had to make in my career. 'I have agonised over this since coming back from Brazil and have spoken to family, friends and people close to me in the game before coming to this point. Captain: Gerrard leads the way for Liverpool during training at Harvard University on Monday . Lean on: Gerrard uses midfield partner Jordan Henderson for support during Liverpool's training session . Knees-up: The Liverpool captain has said he is focusing on their upcoming Champions League campaign . Ton up: The England captain won his 100th cap in 2012, when England met Sweden in a friendly . End of an era: Gerrard applauds the England fans after his final international appearance against Costa Rica . Celebration: Gerrard returned to his primary school when he won his 100th cap to celebrate with the pupils . Caps: 114 (38 as captain) Goals: 21 Red cards: 1 . 'Most importantly, Brendan [Rodgers] has been fantastic and obviously I have to look after my body as much as possible to ensure I can give everything when I take to the field. 'To ensure I can keep playing to a high level and giving everything to Liverpool Football Club I believe this is the right decision, and having Champions League football back at Anfield is another big factor in my decision.' 'I do feel as if I could probably still play for England in September, October, November, I'm still in great physical condition,' Gerrard continued. 'But - big picture-wise - over the next two, three, four years, the best thing for my body where I stand now is to step aside out of the international fold' Passion: Being made England captain made Gerrard the proudest man in the country, he claimed . 'The most important thing for me was not to make an emotional decision . or rash decision. I was asked questions before during and after the . World Cup to make a decsion on my future and it wasn't the right time. 'It was important that I came away from football, I had some time to be . alone, time to be with my close family and friends and basically discuss . and talk about what's going to be the best decision for me moving . forward. 'The first time I spoke to Roy properly was this week, I had tried to . have an initial chat with him straight after the World Cup but I was too . emotional to talk to him, I was still very upset with how the World Cup . went. Iconic: A young Gerrard scored a stunning goal in England's 5-1 victory over Germany in 2001 . Heartache: The midfielder was one of England's penalty villains as they crashed out of the 2006 World Cup . Good times: Gerrard's 21 goals for his country put him 20th on the list of England all-time top goalscorers . 'What I'll always remember the supporters for is the reception the fans gave me straight after the Costa Rica game - we'd just gone out of the World Cup at the first stage, it hadn't gone well for myself personally or the team and they gave me an unbelievable reception and that's what's sticking in my mind. 'I'd have loved nothing better than to carry on and continue to fight for the England fans moving forward but there is a time when you're a football player where you've got to make the right decision, when you've got to be selfish.' Having made his debut under Kevin Keegan in 2000, Gerrard played in six major tournaments, scoring twice in the 2006 World Cup as England reached the quarter-finals. Debate: His career was constantly dogged by the question of whether he could play with Frank Lampard . Sad end: The 2014 World Cup in Brazil could have been a glorious ending - but it ended in humiliation . His career was always dogged by an inability to thrive alongside Frank Lampard in the centre of midfield, but he will be fondly remembered for a 20-yard strike against Germany during the 5-1 win in 2001, and a superb strike against Trinidad in the 2006 World Cup. However he was also part of the England team that lost 3-2 to Croatia at Wembley to miss out on qualification to Euro 2008, and captained his country during their turgid 2010 World Cup campaign in the absence of Rio Ferdinand. Having been made permanent skipper by Roy Hodgson, he started both of England's meaningful games in Brazil as they lost to Italy and Uruguay to exit the World Cup after two games for the first time ever. A remarkable 110 of his 114 caps came from the start, and his 21 goals make leave him 20th on the all-time list of England goalscorers.","England captain earned 114 England caps since his debut in 2000 .

Search and rescue crews this weekend identified their search for Jackie, 15, who disappeared after she went to let the family cat out of the house on November 27 and never returned to her home in Cheney, just outside of Spokane. 'That's what caused the friction between her and her parents, she let the cat out and the cat got away,' Chief John Hensley, of the Cheney PD, told ABC News. 'The thought is to avoid getting in trouble for not following instructions - she just ran off.' Worried relatives said Jackie had run away before but never for this long. The teen has mental issues and needs constant medication. 'Without the medication she can make poor choices,' Hensley told ABC News. Relatives had been passing out flyers around the local cities while police searched with ATVs and canine patrols around the area. 'She's out in the cold,' Doucette had toldKVEW-TV.

"Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers will not be allowed to torture terrorism suspects, under new laws. The federal government says ASIO has never been involved in the technique but will ensure that tough new counter-terrorism laws explicitly prohibit torture by intelligence officers. Labor and a number of Senate crossbenchers have been critical that one part of a bill to give ASIO extra powers could allow the use of torture, under some circumstances. Attorney-General George Brandis says there is no need to legislate against torture because ASIO had never engaged in the practice but 'explicit prohibition' will still be included in the new anti-terror laws to be introduced into parliament . In fact, crossbench Senators  David Leyonhjelm (Liberal Democratic Party) and Bob Day (Family First Party) threatened to withdraw their support for the Abbott Government because of the laws. Senator Leyonhjelm claimed they would allow ASIO officers to resort to torture techniques. The prohibition on torture is supported by new ASIO chief Duncan Lewis. ""The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has never practised torture, it does not practise torture and it never will,"" he said. Senator Brandis stated that the move to outlaw torture did not require legislation because ASIO had never engaged in that practice. Attorney-General George Brandis makes the announcement on non-torture laws. The prohibition is supported by new ASIO chief Duncan Lewis . Restrictions already are in place but the specific reference should 'clear up debate on the matter'. 'I want to stress that there is absolutely no necessary legal reason to do this,' Senator Brandis said. But he wanted to avoid the debate being diverted by an issue that 'is nothing but a red herring'. 'The Australian Government has never and will not support torture.' He added that the decision heeded strong views put forward by Muslim leaders. ASIO officers, however, should remain protected from legal liability if they have to 'play along' with planning a terrorist act, for example. A planned law allowing the foreign minister to declare certain overseas areas no-go zones to Australians will also be subject to a 10-year sunset clause. 'The Australian Government has never and will not support torture' Attorney-General George Brandis says there is no real need to legislate for non-torture but that stipulation will be made in the new laws . 'The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has never practised torture, it does not practise torture and it never will' Senator Brandis said he had also agreed to put in place the sunset clauses, kicking in from 2025, for a range of police anti-terrorism powers including control and preventative detention orders. A second tranche of laws to be introduced to parliament on Wednesday would allow the foreign minister to declare certain overseas terrorist hotspots are no-go zones. Anyone travelling to those designated regions could face jail unless they have a valid reason for visiting the areas. The individual zone declarations will be presented to parliament not as legislation, rather as regulations, known as legislative instruments. The foreign fighters legislation will also have a sunset clause of 2025, after which time it will be reviewed. The bill to give ASIO extra powers was slated to be debated in the Senate today (Monday) but has been put off until Tuesday to allow the Labor shadow cabinet and caucus to consider it in detail. The Attorney-General defended the raids in Sydney and Brisbane last week, involving more than 800 police officers, which resulted in one man being arrested and charged with a terrorism-related offence . Senator Brandis said it would be a mistake to say the joint operation across two capital cities last week was not justified, insisting it had been necessary to act to prevent the public from imminent harm .

"The young lovers accused of Bali’s ‘body in the suitcase murder' are expected to be transferred to the island’s notorious Kerobokan Prison tomorrow, taking them one step closer to their first court appearance. Legal sources on the holiday island told MailOnline that police interrogations of the pair have been completed and papers have been passed to the prosecution, allowing 19-year-old Heather Mack and her 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer to be moved from police prisons. They will then await a court appearance when they are expected to be charged with premeditated murder. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21 are accused of murdering Miss Mack's mother and then hiding her body in a suitcase in a Bali hotel . The pair are set to be transferred to the notorious Kerobokan Prison (pictured) while they await a court hearing . Chicago socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62, was found dead inside a suitcase that was loaded into a taxi outside a luxury hotel on the Indonesian island . The pair were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the body of Heather’s mother, Chicago socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62, stuffed into a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel. Police claim the pair plotted Mrs Mack’s murder following an earlier argument between Heather and her mother over money. But the lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated and that Heather had hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room. According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty because he was the father of her unborn baby, who is due in March. The account she has given to police - which her lawyer Mr Raja Nasution hopes will result in her receiving a lesser charge  - paints a picture of a terrified young woman who waited in terror in the bathroom of room 317 while her boyfriend and her mother had a furious argument which resulted in Mrs Mack being beaten to death. Senior Police Commissioner Djoko Hariutomo told MailOnline: ‘If they are both convicted of murder they could face the death penalty. There is evidence here of premeditation.’ Police claim the couple plotted Mrs Mack’s murder following an earlier argument between Heather and her mother over money . The body of Mrs Mack, who had been bludgeoned to death, was found in a suitcase outside the St Regis Hotel . But Miss Mack has told a different story, explaining that she was horrified when her boyfriend struck her mother and ran from the bedroom. ‘Mr Schaefer had arrived at the hotel from the US at two o’clock in the morning of August 12 - just six hours before the murder - and Mrs Mack did not know he was coming,’ said Mr Raja. ‘In order to appease her mother, Heather suggested he go to her room and take with him a gift.’ That ‘gift’, police say, was a heavy fruit bowl from his room and, they insist, Schaefer did not intend to give it to her as a present because he was hiding it under his shirt, planning to use it to kill Mrs Mack following a fierce argument shortly after he arrived at the hotel. The argument is said to have continued when Schaefer entered Mrs Mack’s room, his anger exploding when she referred to her daughter as expecting the child of a ‘n*****’. He is said to have angrily told Mrs Mack that her late husband was a ‘n*****’ and she is alleged to have replied: ‘Yes, but he was a rich one.’ Pregnant Miss Mack's lawyer will argue that she hid in the bathroom while her boyfriend and mother had an argument which led to Mrs Mack's death . It is understood that Miss Mack has told police that her mother had reached out and grabbed Schaefer around the throat - and it was at that moment that he struck her on the head with the fruit bowl - before continuing to batter her with it as her daughter hid in the bathroom. As part of Miss Mack’s defence, her lawyer will argue that she had Mrs Mack’s blood on her shirt because she hugged her mother’s body. ‘Heather acted robot-like,’ said Mr Raja. ‘She wanted no part of what had happened but Mr Schaefer was the father of her child and she went along as if in a trance when he forced Mrs Mack’s body into the suitcase.’ Police have revealed that because the suitcase would not close properly with the body inside, the couple tied a sheet around it to keep the lid down - then placed it under their suitcases on a luggage trolley before accompanying a bellboy with it to a waiting taxi. The couple then left the hotel but found they could not leave the country as their passports were in the hotel's safety deposit box, which only Mrs Mack had permission to open. After checking into another hotel, the pair were arrested. . A police spokesman said today that  Miss Mack will continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant. It is understood she will have to share a cell with several other women prisoners because the jail is overcrowded.","Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer to be transferred to Kerobokan Prison .

"As the old saying goes, 'keep your friends close and your enemies closer'. But this cricket took the old adage to a new level as it perched on the head of a green papua tree frog - its natural predator. The brave insect dices with death, crawling along a red petal as the frog used the flower as a makeshift resting spot. Making its move: The brave cricket dices with death as it clambers on to a petal where a green papua tree frog - its natural predator - is relaxing . Friends close, enemies closer: The cricket does not seem fussed by the frog as it walks along the petal, standing on the amphibian's side . Not cricket: Usually the frog would gobble up the insect without a thought, but the two seem to become friends as the cricket explores the creature's face . As it crawls forward, the cricket brushes against the frog, standing on its side and almost poking the frog in the eye. Seemingly taking a shine to each other, the cricket then climbs atop the amphibian's head, standing over its left eye - just an inch from the frog's mouth. The cricket gets itself comfortable on the frog's head before, settling down for a quick snooze on his unlikely friend. The green papua tree frog is predominantly found in the north and east of Australia, as well as southern parts of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Living mostly in swamps and pond areas, it thrives in wet, humid conditions. They are not endangered, but are often eaten by cats and dogs. In Indonesia, as many as 75,000 of the frogs are exported to become pets a year. The incredible pictures were taken by  nature photographer Monica Anantyowati in her back garden in Malang, on the east of Java, Indonesia. 'This set is about two different species, a predator and his prey, taking a rest together on the petal of a flower,' the 42-year-old said. 'They sat with each other for a long time, which I found weird as a cricket would usually be a frog's main course for dinner. 'They seemed to make friends with each other, which was actually quite cute.' Ms Anantyowati said: 'I was surprised that this happened, as usually the frog would devour the cricket in seconds, especially if he was hungry. 'It wasn't planned at all. I left them to quickly get my camera and lens, and when I came back they still were still sat peacefully. 'Many people are as surprised as me and ask a same question, why did this happen? Nature is a mystery. 'I love photography because it teaches me things that cannot see by the naked eye,' she added.

"England’s hopes of a revival following Wednesday’s win in Hambantota lasted as long as it took Kumar Sangakkara to reassert his superiority here in Colombo. For Sri Lanka, Sangakkara’s effortless 86 meant a six-wicket win and a nigh-on uncatchable 3-1 lead. For England’s stand-in captain Eoin Morgan, whose side blew their chance with the bat after a highly promising 90 in 109 balls from James Taylor, it was a reminder of how thankless leadership can be. And news that England had been fined for a slow over-rate — only four days after Alastair Cook had been suspended for the same offence — confirmed it. Batting at No 3 as the order was rejigged in Cook’s absence, Taylor produced an innings full of chutzpah, while Morgan himself crashed 62 off 47 balls as others flailed around him. England must now win the last three games to avoid another one-day series defeat. Even the most optimistic might struggle with that one. The truth was that, from 170 for three in the 35th over, a total of 265 was at least 20 below what they should have achieved. Taylor, needing treatment for cramp — a consequence of Colombo’s cloying heat and the energy-sapping exuberance of his batting — finally went when he could only sky Ajantha Mendis into the covers. In the next over, Ravi Bopara — having pleaded for a chance in the middle order — was bowled tamely by Tillekeratne Dilshan. That heralded some dim batting from the rest, and it was left to Morgan, with 18 off the last over, to ensure respectability. Kumar Sangakkara's innings of 85 guided Sri Lanka to victory over England in the fourth ODI in Colombo . James Taylor anchored England's innings as he scored 90 from 109 deliveries . Alex Hales was sent back to the pavilion with a golden duck to his name by Dhammika Prasad . Moeen Ali hit three boundaries before being stumped by Sangakkara for 19 . ‘We were aiming for 280-290 and the latter part of the innings wasn’t good enough,’ he said. ‘But James was outstanding. To come in after a long break and play as he did was brilliant.’ Morgan’s late flurry, which lifts his record as captain to 427 runs at an average of 71, briefly camouflaged another problem. On a Premadasa pitch offering turn, Sri Lanka’s four slow bowlers had taken nine wickets. England, on the other hand, again omitted off-spinner James Tredwell, preferring to take another look at the out-of-sorts Ben Stokes. Morgan said: ‘We did need another spinner but we wanted to give other guys a chance. Giving Ben a game here gives the selectors another chance to see what he’s about.’ In the event, Stokes sent down only two overs, taking his series figures to 8-0-85-0. Earlier, he had scored six before top-edging a sweep. If a cricketer can unpick himself for a World Cup, Stokes is doing precisely that. Joe Root was bowled by Rangana Herath for 36 to leave England on 122 for three in the 26th over . Taylor celebrates his 50, but he had to depart for 90 after being catch by Kusal Perera . Ravi Bopara departed soon after Taylor as he was bowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan . Dilshan celebrates the wicket of Bopara to leave England at 173 for five in the 36th over . Stand-in captain Eoin Morgan made a valuable contribution of 62 down the order . Morgan and Jos Buttler got into a tangle when they collided in the middle of the wicket while running . Chris Woakes had removed Dilshan early, but the folly of omitting Tredwell in a game which England had to win was underlined by a sharp-turning off-break from Moeen Ali which had Kusal Perera edging to slip. Instead, Mahela Jayawardene, back after missing the third game to mark his daughter’s birthday, helped his old mate Sangakkara put on 96 before Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews finished the job with two balls to spare. The 12 wides England bowled took their tally for the series to 43. Sri Lanka have sent down only 22. In the endless search for positives, Taylor provided a gimme. Playing only his third one-day international — and his first not against Ireland — he was nervous initially, before settling down with a six over midwicket off Thisara Perera. Ajantha Mendis also disappeared over the ropes and Taylor began to resemble the buccaneer who slashed three hundreds for Nottinghamshire in last summer’s Royal London One-Day Cup. Captain Morgan hit two sixes and a four in the last over to nudge England up to a total of 265 . Chris Woakes picked up England's first wicket as he dismissed opener Dlishan for 16 . Kusal Perera was the second wicket to fall for Sri Lanka as he was dismissed by  Ali for 31 . Mahela Jayawardene (left) and Sangakkara put on a 96-run partnership as Sri Lanka took command . Now England’s management face a dilemma when selecting the team for Wednesday’s fifth game in Kandy, when Cook, confirmed as captain for the World Cup, returns as opener. That leaves Alex Hales vulnerable only two matches after his return. His golden duck here was horribly anti-climactic, and he later dropped Mathews off Chris Jordan as Sri Lanka’s chase neared its conclusion. The other option would be to rest Joe Root, whose last two innings have brought him 48 not out and 36. Chris Jordan bowled Jayawardene for 44 to end his long partnership with Sangakkara . Sangakkara looked to be in complete control before picking out Woakes on the boundary for 86 . Jordan's double scalp of Jayawardene and Sangakkara proved to be too little, too late for England . Either way, Cook remains the cog around which others must fit. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek programme, England’s former batting coach Graham Gooch summed up the situation. ‘The best thing is to somehow get Cook back in form to make him worthwhile of his place in the team,’ he said. ‘He can only open and if he scores runs then all this talk will go away. I can’t see him not playing and still being in the squad.’ For the time being, though, England will be nursing their disappointment that another one-day series is on the verge of passing them by.","Kumar Sangakkara scores 86 as Sri Lanka win fourth ODI in Colombo .

"There is outrage at the highest levels of the Australian Islamic community after a senior sheikh who recently met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott  was unable to board his flight after being stopped for a two-and-a-half hour baggage check. Sheikh Shady Al Suleiman was leading a delegation to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj spiritual pilgrimage when he was halted by authorities at Sydney Airport last Thursday. He was released without charge but was the only member of the delegation to miss his flight. The incident provoked an extraordinary blast from religious leader Grand Mufti Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, who expressed his 'anger' over the sheikh's 'detention' in a fiery statement released by the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC). Scroll down for video . Pictured: Sheikh Shady Al Suleiman was stopped from boarding a flight after a baggage check by airport officials on Thursday. Made it to Saudi Arabia: Sheikh Shady Al Suleiman, pictured with his delegation after the incident. The Islamic community has become concerned by a number of anti-Islamic incidents in recent weeks, such as the alleged vandalism of this car in Sydney's west recently. 'It is totally unacceptable for any Australian citizen, let alone a senior member of the (Imams Council) to be subjected to this seemingly random yet profiled manner causing severe stress and unwanted convenience,' Dr Mohammad said. In his role as a senior ANIC member, Sheikh Al Suleiman was part of a delegation who met the Prime Minister to discuss community concerns about the government's proposed anti-terror laws in August. A spokesman for Scott Morrison, the Customs and Border Protection Minister, said Mr Al Suleiman was not randomly targeted and the government would not be providing 'running commentary' on the issue. 'The Government will take the steps necessary at our borders to protect our national security,' the spokesman said. 'At times this will mean that national security takes priority over the convenience of travellers. 'Our officers do not stop travellers indiscriminately, including in this instance.' Thursday's incident - which occurred on the same day as the largest terror raids in the country's history - was labelled  'a bit embarrassing for all involved' by one Islamic leader, Joseph Wakim, and branded 'a deliberate balls-up' by community spokesman Keysar Trad. It comes at a time where Muslim leaders said they are concerned by anti-Islamic sentiment. Mr Wakim, the founder of the Australian Arabic Council, said the sheikh was a ‘respected’ member of the community who had provided the police with advice in the past and that Customs had wanted to double check his baggage. Sheik Al Suleiman has condemned the Islamic State terror group in recent media reports. He has since travelled on to Saudi Arabia, and spoken to Mr Wakim, who said Customs officials had wanted to double check his baggage. 'We don't want to ever compromise on safety,' Mr Wakim said. 'Any individual travelling in and out, there does need to be scrutiny. 'It was just odd on this occasion, at this particular time, that it happened to one of the most senior Muslim clerics in Australia. 'It's a bit like having a bishop who was stopped. It was a bit embarrassing for all concerned.' Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad, who said he sat across from the Sheikh Al Suleiman at the meeting with Muslim leaders and the Prime Minister last month, accused the government of deliberately attempting to 'send a message' to the Islamic community. 'I'm sure that he is one of the people who would be on the computer as a high profile person,' Mr Trad said. 'It's very, very likely that detention was intentional... I think it's a deliberate balls-up to send a message (to the Islamic community).' Last Thursday the nation witnessed the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country's history, in which 15 people were arrested. Omarjan Azari (pictured) was arrested and charged by police with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act last Thursday. The counter-terrorism raids, which involved more than 800 police, were the biggest in Australia's history. An image, supplied by NSW Police, of terror raids last week. Two men were later charged, including Omarjan Azari, 22. In court documents seen by Daily Mail Australia, police alleged Azari conspired with Australia's most senior jihadist militant, former Underbelly actor Mohammad Ali Baryalei, to conduct a public beheading on a random member of the public. Following the raids, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione announced the beginning of Operation Hammerhead, which will see 220 police deployed in 'high visiblity police work' across Sydney to maintain order and protect significant infrastructure and iconic locations. Members of the Islamic community have set up a Facebook page, the Islamophobia Register Australia, to publicly document anti-Muslim incidents. The page had recorded a number of recent threats, including towards the Grand Mufti and a number of mosques. Mr Wakim said recent threats against Muslims were actually helping the Islamic State terror group. 'The people who are perpetrating these attacks, who think it's open season at the moment, are inadvertently helping ISIS,' Mr Wakim said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State. 'They are actually doing it because they think they're helping the war against ISIS by attacking local people, but what they're doing inadvertently is driving a lot of Muslims in Australia to the margins. 'You want to be doing the exact opposite because, in fact, any war against ISIS requires full cooperation from the Muslim (community),' he said, adding that it is members of the Muslim community who are denouncing extremist neighbours and tipping off ASIO to threats.

"Thibaut Courtois has urged his Chelsea team-mates to put their first defeat of the season behind them to cement their place at the top of the Barclays Premier League table. The Blues ended up on the wrong end of the scoreline for the first time in 22 games in all competitions at Newcastle on Saturday as substitute Papiss Cisse's second-half double secured a 2-1 victory for the Magpies. However, keeper Courtois insists they must forget the disappointment of defeat at St James' Park as they prepare for Wednesday night's Champions League clash with Sporting Lisbon before turning their attention to Hull's visit to Stamford Bridge and the business of winning the title. Thibaut Courtois (right) has urged Chelsea to regroup following the 2-1 defeat against Newcastle . Papiss Cisse came off the bench to score twice against Chelsea on Saturday . Chelsea fell to their first Premier League defeat in 15 games this season . The 22-year-old told Chelsea TV: 'That's the most important, that we are still leaders and from the next game on, we will fight to keep that bonus up and make the gap bigger. 'There are only difficult games in the Premier League and we know that. The next game is in the Champions League at home and then against Hull, we have to win in front of our fans.' Chelsea, who have now lost on their last three league visits to St James' Park, left the north east for the second time in a week wondering how they were doing so without three points after dominating for long periods just as they had done at Sunderland seven days earlier, when they emerged with a 0-0 draw. On this occasion, however, their inability to turn pressure into tangible reward was punished by their hosts, who defended manfully before striking decisively on the counter. The Chelsea keeper is unable to stop Cisse's opening goal at St James' Park . John Terry looks on helpless after Cisse scores the second goal for Newcastle . The deadlock was broken with 57 minutes gone when Cisse, who had only been on the pitch for four minutes, slid home Sammy Ameobi's cross after Gary Cahill could only help the ball into his path. Chelsea immediately launched a fightback and came desperately close to an equaliser with 12 minutes remaining when Eden Hazard's shot came back off the post with Newcastle's third-choice keeper Jak Alnwick, who had replaced the injured Rob Elliot at the break, beaten for the first time. But worse was to follow as the Magpies turned defence into attack for Moussa Sissoko to play in Cisse for his second. Substitute Didier Drogba gave the visitors hope when, after defender Steven Taylor had been dismissed for a second bookable offence, he glanced home an 83rd-minute Cesc Fabregas free-kick, but despite having 13 minutes, including six of stoppage time, in which to find an equaliser, they could not manage to beat debutant Alnwick again. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho remonstrates with fourth official Robert Madley . Didier Drogba rises above the Newcastle defence to give Chelsea hope in the closing stages .

"Could this be the weekend Chelsea wrapped up the Premier League title - despite losing for the first time this season at Newcastle? As Chelsea's 3,000-plus travelling fans were making their way back south, wallowing in the unfamiliar sensation of defeat, phones would have lit up and hearts would have been lifted by the news coming in from Manchester. For at the Etihad Stadium, Sergio Aguero was hobbling from the field in tears. The deadly Argentine striker, who has scored an incredible 19 goals in 20 matches this season, was clearly in agony - you could tell simply from the grimace on his face. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . A visibly emotional Sergio Aguero prepares to leave the field after suffering a knee injury against Everton . Aguero grimaces with pain after going down following a tackle by Muhamed Besic early in the match . Aguero was able to walk off unaided but will have a scan on his knee this week to find out the damage . Manchester City beat Everton 1-0 to cut the gap to just three points after Chelsea lost at Newcastle . Slowly, the news emerged that every Manchester City fan had feared. Suspected knee ligament damage, MRI scans this week, the possibility of their talisman on the sidelines for weeks, maybe months. So on the day City trimmed Chelsea's lead at the Premier League summit to just three points, finally breathing new life into the title race, a potential disaster. As Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville tweeted: 'If Aguero's injury is a bad one then this could be the weekend Chelsea won the league!' While we won't know for certain about the extent of Aguero's injury until the middle of the week - though he will certainly miss their make-or-break Champions League trip to Roma - we do know that City have been adversely affected before by his absence. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville tweeted that Aguero's injury could decide the outcome of the title race . Aguero celebrates after scoring the second of his two goals in City's 4-1 midweek win at Sunderland . In all, Aguero has scored 19 goals in 20 matches so far this season, including a hat-trick against Bayern . Aguero is carried off on a stretcher after suffering an injury in City's match with Southampton in August 2012 . Since the striker arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2011, he has played in 102 Premier League matches and missed a total of 27 either through injury or selection. City's win percentage dips from 69.6 per cent to 63 per cent when Aguero is not in the side. In his second campaign at City, Aguero missed two league matches with a knee problem in March. One of them saw a 2-0 defeat at Everton that pretty much ended any hopes of catching Man United in the title race. Last season, he was out injured for City's trip to Aston Villa in late September and they lost 3-2. And his lengthy absence with hamstring and knee problems late in the campaign included a 1-0 home loss to Chelsea. His absence didn't affect City in the title race - they ultimately secured the title - but his hamstring troubles did contribute to their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona.

Aguero's injury presents a headache for City manager Manuel Pellegrini ahead of the Christmas schedule . 19 - Sergio Aguero . 6 - Yaya Toure . 5 - Frank Lampard . 4 - Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic . 2 - David Silva . But there have also been spells when Aguero has been out injured and City have not really missed him. For example, he had a calf injury about this time last season and City still won all five league matches in his absence. The reality is that Aguero has become an even more talismanic figure this season. It is not just his remarkable goalscoring run that has pretty much kept City in contention both at home and in Europe, but the astonishing work rate and creativity that sets up goals for others. If the worst fears are realised and Aguero is ruled out for the pivotal and congested Christmas and New Year fixture list, the burden will fall heavily on City's other stars. Most have not yet reached the heights of last year. Their first test will come in the cauldron of the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night as City try to prolong their European campaign beyond Christmas. But if Aguero is sidelined for a while, City's next challenge is to find a way of compensating for the lost goals he would have provided. The goalscoring burden now falls on Edin Dzeko, who has four so far this season . Stevan Jovetic has also contributed four goals so far this campaign but will now get more game time . Aguero has 19 in all competitions this season. The next highest is the six scored by Yaya Toure. Of the other strikers at Manuel Pellegrini's disposal, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic have just four apiece. With City's main source of goals cut off, Chelsea could easily have re-established their commanding lead at the top by Christmas. City fans will be awaiting news of Aguero's hospital scans, praying this injury isn't as bad as it first appeared.","Sergio Aguero suffered suspected knee ligament injury on Saturday .

"The misery of being forced to watch other clubs in the Champions League this season is driving Manchester United to ensure that is not their fate next year, defender Chris Smalling has admitted. Smalling says even just hearing the Champions League music brings it home to him that United are missing out on Europe's elite club competition. United, however, are on course to qualify for the next season's Champions League, with four successive victories propelling Louis van Gaal's side to fourth place in the Premier League table. Chris Smalling says seeing others in the Champions League is driving Manchester United on this year . Smalling says even the Champions League music brings it home that United are not in the competition . Three points from the trip to Southampton on Monday night and United will leapfrog Saints into third place. Smalling said the bitter experience of being a bystander in European football is all the incentive his United team-mates need. 'You hear the Champions League music when they all line up and it's just a case where we've been in it year after year, so it's a sad time,' Smalling told www.manutd.com. 'We'll be making sure we don't miss out again next time. 'I was watching it the other week. Even when we were in it, I would watch it on the other night anyway. Even more so this year. It's a bit gutting that we're not involved but you can see the standard of football we need to make sure we rise to.' United's four victories have been achieved despite a lengthy injury list, not least in defence, but they will at least have captain Wayne Rooney available after a scare last week which saw the England striker have a scan on a possible knee problem. Smalling (pictured being sent off at the Etihad) says United have been given plenty of incentive to qualify . Manchester United can leapfrog Southampton on Monday night if they beat the Saints at St Mary's . It may also be a good time to play Ronald Koeman's Saints, whose impressive start to the season has stalled with successive defeats in their last two games. United boss Van Gaal, meanwhile, has spoken of being impressed at the team spirit that has developed, highlighted by the Christmas party organised last week by Rooney. 'It was fantastic,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'Usually, I don't use words like this, but I think it showed the cohesion in our group from both the players and staff. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. 'The squad is very important, and that's why the timing of our Christmas party was fantastic - it showed the togetherness in the squad. I think we are in a good position.' The match at St Mary's is being built up as a battle between warring Dutch coaches Van Gaal and Koeman, who fell out when they worked together at Ajax in 2004. The pair have refused to discuss their relationship but they appear to have buried the hatchet. According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, at a recent League Managers' Association meeting Van Gaal complimented Koeman on his work, told him: 'You have a good team,' and clapped him on the shoulder.

"The mother of Eric Garner, the Staten island resident who was killed by an officer who put the man in a chokehold after he grew agitated over being stopped for allegedly selling cigarettes on the street, has praised the protesters gathering across the city in her son's honor after a grand jury decided not to indict the officer responsible for his death. 'It is just so awesome to see how the crowds are out there,' said  Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, who added that she herself even ended up stuck in her car after protests shut down traffic. 'I was just so proud of that crowd. It just warmed my heart.' Scroll down for videos . Hope from tragedy: The mother of Eric Garner, Gwen Carr (left), and his widow, Esaw Garner (right), have both revealed how 'proud' they are of those protesting the death of Garner . Celeb support: At a march in Los Angeles on Sunday, Tyrese Gibson (above) came out to lead the protesters . Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, echoed that sentiment, saying she told her son when she saw protesters from their window, 'Look at all the love that your father's getting.' And these protests show no signs of dying down, this as model and actor Tyrese Gibson led a march in Los Angeles on Saturday in memory of both Garner and Michael Brown. Demonstrators around the country have staged die-ins and other protests since the Garner grand jury's decision Wednesday, which closely followed the Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict a white officer in the fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. Garner's family members joined the Rev. Al Sharpton later Saturday as Sharpton laid a wreath at the site on Staten Island where Garner died July 17 in a confrontation that started when police tried to arrest him for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. An amateur video seen by millions showed Garner gasping, 'I can't breathe' during the fatal encounter. Difficult decision: These protests began on Wednesday across the country after a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer whose chokehold killed Garner . Keeps going: It has been four days since the grand jury decision, and the protests show no signs of slowing down . 'All we're concerned about is justice from the police,' said Garner's stepfather, Benjamin Carr, who wore a T-shirt with the words, 'Enough is enough.' Protests continued in New York City for a fourth day with several dozen people lying down on the floor of Grand Central Terminal. There were no reports of arrests. On Friday night, 20 protesters were arrested on disorderly conduct charges in New York, police said. Hundreds of demonstrators marched and many briefly laid down in Macy's flagship store, Grand Central and an Apple store. They streamed along Fifth Avenue sidewalks and other parts of Manhattan, with signs and chants of 'Black lives matter' and 'I can't breathe.' Big name support: Al Sharpton and Spike Lee were at a news conference days after a Grand Jury decided not to indict the officer involved in Garner's death . In Oakland, California, hundreds of protesters briefly blocked Interstate 880, a major freeway, on Friday night. There were no immediate reports of any arrests or injuries. Protests have also been held in Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami and a number of other cities. Sharpton announced plans this week for a march in Washington, D.C., next Saturday to protest the killings of Garner, Brown and others and to press for change at the federal level.","Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, has said she is 'proud' of the people protesting in her son's honor around the country .

"Gateshead ended Warrington Town's FA Cup ambitions as goals from Matty Pattison and Danny Wright ensured the Conference side squeezed into the third round draw. South African midfielder Pattison finished high into the net after eight minutes after Rob Ramshaw had got the better of Craig Robinson near the touchline and pulled the ball back. But they needed a stoppage time second from Wright to overcome Warrington's spirited resistance. It was a moment to forget for goalkeeper Karl Wills, who tried to launch a late Warrington assault but saw his clearance fall straight to Wright, who finished into an empty net. Gateshead's Matty Pattison celebrates his eighth-minute goal to put the Conference side in front against Warrington Town . Gateshead: Bartlett, Baxter, Curtis, Clark, Allan (O'Donnell 57), Pattison, Turnbull, Chandler, Rodman, Oster (Wright 76), Ramshaw . Substitutes not used: Jones, Shaw, Guy, Rankine, Jack Wilson . Scorers: Pattison 8; Wright 90+1 . Booked: Rodman . Warrington Town: Wills, McCarten, Robinson, Hardwick (Foster 69), Field, Mannix, Burke, Corrigan, Doughty (Colbeck 57), Metcalfe, Gaskell (Ruane 76) Substitutes not used: Gaghan,  Booth, Davies, Johnson . Booked: Doughty, Robinson, Metcalfe . Referee: James Adcock (Nottinghamshire) - replaced by Richard Clarke at half-time after injury. Attendance: 2,874 . Despite the scoreline, this was far from comfortable for the hosts, who rank three divisions and 79 places above their Northern Premier League Division One North opponents. Warrington were the toast of football romantics everywhere when they dumped League Two Exeter City out in the first round in front of the BBC cameras and they were backed by over 1,000 vocal travelling fans in the north-east. Gateshead, looking to reach the third round for the first time since 1954-55, overcame a banana skin of their own in the first round when they won 4-0 at eighth-tier Norton United. While Warrington benefited from Craig Robinson's early goal against Exeter, this time they fell behind in the opening stages when Pattison struck. Indeed, they were holding on at times as first John Oster and then Alex Rodman were denied in quick succession. Defender Tom Hardwick blocked Oster's shot on the line, before Wills saved Rodman's low angled effort. Gradually, the Wire fought their way into the game and striker Lee Gaskell attempted an audacious overhead kick inside the box that flew just wide of the post. On 25 minutes, Oster saw another shot cleared off the line as Gateshead, who are in contention for the Conference play-off places once again, attacked down the right. The Heed were getting plenty of joy down that flank and one such move saw Pattison send the ball wide at the near post. The half-time interval saw a change of referee, with James Adcock suffering an injury and replaced by Richard Clark. Warrington emerged the brighter and home goalkeeper Adam Bartlett had to touch away a left-wing cross from captain David Mannix as Lewis Field lurked.

But having failed to sample the competition for half a decade, the Reds skipper is determined to ensure the club continue to qualify year in, year out. 'This isn't a reward for finishing second last year. I don't see it as a reward. This is where Liverpool should be — and should be consistently,' he said. 'It's the responsibility of myself and the players to give it our best crack. It is important that we have got the Champions League next year as well. 'The players who haven't sampled this and then get a taste of it — once they have had that taste I know they are going to love it.

"If Vikings were here today, the sounding of a distinctive horn in York would have created chaos. The ancient instrument, blown last night, signalled exactly 100 days until the end of the world, according to Norse mythology. Legend has it that the Norse God, Heimdallr, would blow the mythical Gjallerhorn to warn of the Viking apocalypse, also known as 'Ragnarok'. The end of the world was signalled in York last night as a horn was blown to herald the beginning of the apocalypse . 'Then the Awful Fight', by George Wright in 1908, depicts the final battle of the gods . Ragnarok, which translates to ‘Doom of the Gods’, is due to be preceded by the winter of winters. Vikings believed, prior to the apocalypse, three freezing winters would follow each other with no summers in between. All morality would disappear and fights would break out all over the world, signalling the beginning of the end. The wolf Skoll would devour the sun, and his brother Hati would eat the moon, causing stars to vanish from the sky and the Earth to be thrown into eternal darkness. Norse mythology experts have calculated that Vikings believed this will take place on February 22, 2014. On this day, the god Odin will be killed by the wolf Fenrir and the other ‘creator’ gods. The sound of the horn is supposed to call the sons of Odin and the heroes to the battlefield, where Odin (pictured) will ultimately be killed .

Norse mythology experts have calculated that this is due to take place on February 22, 2014. On this day, the god Odin will be killed by the wolf Fenrir and the other ‘creator’ gods. There will be huge earthquakes, the sea will rear up and the soil and the sky will be stained with poison. The Earth will sink into the sea, paving the way for a new utopian world with endless supplies. There will be huge earthquakes, the sea will rear up and the soil and the sky will be stained with poison. The sound of the horn is supposed to call the sons of Odin to the battlefield, where Odin will ultimately be killed. After his death, the Earth was foretold to sink into the sea, paving the way for a new utopian world with endless supplies. Danielle Daglan from the Norvik Viking Centre told MailOnline that a number of recent events spoken about in the legends of Ragnarok led them to believe that the end of the world may well be imminent. The legend states that ‘the first to notice shall be man, brother will fight brother and all the boundaries that exist shall crumble.’ ‘The idea that “boundaries that exist shall crumble” could be said to be about the Internet age, where you can communicate with millions of people simultaneously around the world thanks to the global rise of social media,’ said Ms Daglan. Viking tradition also believes that a vast winter will appear before the apocalypse. 'Kampf der untergehenden Götter' which translates as 'Battle of the Doomed Gods' was painted in 1882 by Wilhelm Wägner and depicts the gods in their ultimate fight. This was predicted to occur shortly before huge earthquakes and treacherous seas. it was thought that the soil sky would then be 'stained with poison' ‘There . are predictions that we are heading into a mini-ice age thanks to a . fall in solar flare activity - what is a mini-ice age but several . winters rolled into one?’ said Ms Daglan. Another . part of the legend claims that the Midgard Serpent, named Jormungand, . shall free itself from its tail and rise up from the ocean. Ms Dagland points to the two huge fish which appeared on a beach in California last month. The . giant oarfish were dead when they washed up on land, and some . scientists believe they came ashore to die because they are ‘in . distress’. ‘Traditionally, . the Viking festival of Jolablot marked the end of the winter - if this . winter truly does not end, then that feast may be given over to Ragnarok . instead,’ said Ms Dagland. The Jorvik Viking Centre predicted that Ragnarok would occur on 22 February because this is the end of the feast of Jolablot. While . not a scientific conclusion, they claim that Vikings loved to feast and . wouldn't want to miss this event. For this reason, they argue that . Vikings would believe the world would end in 100 days. The end of the world is coincidently the start of the grand finale of the Viking festival in York. ‘Following a study published in 2010 that . bearded men are more trustworthy than those without, we’re also looking . for fantastic displays of facial hair, so that we can identify those . with the potential to take us into the brave new world that is foretold . to follow Ragnarok,’ said Danielle Daglan director of the JORVIK Viking . Festival. ‘In the last . couple of years, we’ve had predictions of the Mayan apocalypse, which . passed without incident, and numerous other dates where the end of the . world has been pencilled in by seers, fortune tellers and visionaries,’ she added. ‘But the sound of . the horn is possibly the best indicator yet that the Viking version of . the end of the world really will happen on 22 February next year.’ The sound of the horn is possibly the best indicator yet that the Viking version of the end of the world really will happen on 22 February next year, claims festival director Danielle Daglan .

"CLICK HERE to read Matt Lawton's full match report from Anfield . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has leapt to the defence of Raheem Sterling after claims the teenager dived to try and win a penalty in Saturday's goalless draw with Sunderland. The England youngster, who will celebrate his 20th birthday on Monday, collapsed under a challenge from Wes Brown towards the end of the game at Anfield, but referee Neil Swarbrick waved away the subsequent penalty claims. Rodgers insists that there were no devious intentions behind Sterling's fall - instead claiming that the winger is so fast and tricky that he is vulnerable to losing his balance even at the slightest contact.

Brendan Rodgers agrees it was not a penalty but insists Sterling did not take a dive . 'He is so bright around the box and makes defenders tackle him and want to get around him,' said Rodgers. 'When you watch it closely, Wes Brown has a dangle for the ball, misses it, and Raheem moves to the side. As he comes down with his foot, he probably just lands on Wes Brown. 'I didn't think it was a dive, but I don't think it was a penalty. I just think it was one of those coming togethers in the box that sometimes happens and the referee made the right decision.' Meanwhile, the Liverpool manager has urged his players to step up instead of relying solely on Steven Gerrard after again resting his captain for the game against Sunderland ahead of a decisive Champions League fixture against Basle next week. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was rested for a second Premier League game this season . Rodgers has challenged his players to fill the void left when Gerrard is not playing in the team . ‘It is very hard to replace that quality,’ Rodgers said of Gerrard. ‘You see that pass when Stevie first came on; not too many in the whole league could play that, that quality. He still has that talent, he has world-class ability and that is something of course we will need. ‘But we can’t always rely on Stevie. His talent is world class but that contribution has to come from the team. It can’t be up to him every single game to be the catalyst.

"A probe has been launched into the free nursery school milk scheme after taxpayers were cheated out of £10million a year. Middlemen are being paid almost £1 a pint for milk - while most consumers can buy a pint for 45p. A loophole means the Government are forced to pick up the bill, regardless of costs, submitted by firms acting on behalf of schools. Rip-off: The Department of Health ended up over spending by millions after being over-charged for nursery school milk . Last year it was estimated that the . difference between the amount taxpayers were being billed and the market . price was £10million. Ministers are now considering setting up a system of national suppliers to cut out the middlemen. Another suggestion is to cap the . price that childcare providers can claim for milk. The other alternative . is to issue e-vouchers to providers. The Government's Nursery Milk scheme provides under fives in England, Scotland and Wales with a third of a pint every day for free. It dates back to 1940, when milk was issued to pregnant women and young children to protect them against wartime food shortages. But a host of 'agencies' that claim to do all of the sourcing and administration work for nurseries and schools has sprung. They were supposed to save educational establishments time and hassle, but instead ramped up the prices. Public Health Minister Anne Milton . said: 'Milk has many benefits to children's health and is important for . their development - we are committed to continuing to provide free milk . for all under-fives. 'But the current scheme has not changed operationally since it began and costs have ballooned. 'In four years, costs have jumped . from £27 million in 2007 to a staggering £53 million in 2011. Estimates . show that modernising how the scheme operates could save as much as £20 . million each year. 'Everyone is encouraged to take part in this consultation and share their views on the proposed changes.' Long history: The Government's Nursery Milk scheme, providing under fives with a third of a pint every day for free, dates back to 1940s and suggestions it would be axed in 2010 were quickly played down at the time . Plans to alter provision have proved politically explosive for the Conservatives in the past. In 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron . slapped down suggestions by Ms Milton that the supply would be scrapped, . saying he 'did not like' the idea. In 1971 Margaret Thatcher earned the . nickname 'Thatcher, Thatcher milk snatcher' for ending free school milk . for the over-sevens while education secretary. Every child under five receives a . third of a pint of milk free of charge at school each day and the . nurseries claim back the cost from the Government. Shadow public health minister Diane . Abbott said: 'Trying to cut the cost of this scheme may end up snatching . milk away from the country's children, disproportionately affecting the . poorest. 'In a recession, which has been made . in Downing Street, when there is a squeeze on families, it is the wrong . time for risks with our children's health.' The School and Nursery Milk Alliance said that any change to milk schemes must be best for children and not financially driven. The organisation said some of the suggestions put forward by the Government could have a negative impact on the scheme. Jon Thornes, interim chairman of the . organisation, said: 'Drinking milk in schools, nurseries and while in . the care of childminders is vital in helping children to develop . important nutrition and social habits. 'The nursery milk scheme has proven . both incredibly popular and hugely successful in contributing to the . healthy development of children. 'We will be engaging fully with the . consultation to ensure the scheme continues to benefit as many children . as possible - and would urge the Government to ensure its focus is on . children's wellbeing rather than just the bottom line.'","'Middle men' claiming milk costs £1 a pint, when price is really closer to 40p .

"Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for Al-Qaeda, was killed in a raid by Pakistani military . The Pakistani military says they've killed a senior an Al-Qaeda leader who grew up in the United States and was on the FBI's most wanted list. Adnan el Shukrijumah, 39, was the chief of global operations for the terrorist group. He was killed along with two other suspected militants in Shinwarsak, South Waziristan,on Saturday. Shukrijumah, who lived in New York and Florida for 15 years, was accused of plotting to blow up the New York City subway. He also planned attacks on the London Underground and trains in Norway. Federal prosecutors say he recruited three men in 2008 to receive training in the lawless tribal region of Pakistan for carrying out attacks. He eventually took over a position once held by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed —  the mastermind of the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks — who was captured in 2003. Shukrijumah was found hiding in a compound after fleeing from a  North Waziristan tribal district where the army launched a major operation against militant bases in June. 'The al-Qaida leader, who was killed by the Pakistan army in a successful operation, is the same person who had been indicted in the United Stated,' said a senior Pakistani army officer. Pakistan military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said in a tweet that five terrorists were also arrested during the raid. Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to the US as young child. He settled with his family in Brooklyn, New York, where his father preached in a mosque. The family moved to Florida, where he took classes at a community college and worked odd jobs. But when the FBI showed up to arrest him as a material witness to a terrorism case in 2003, he already had left the country. He lived in the US for 15 years but rose to a prominent position in Al-Qaeda and took over a position once held by the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks . Prosecutors believe he visited Trinidad and London on his way to al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where he started with lowly camp duties. He was moved up the FBI's most wanted list — including a $5 million bounty on his head — when three men accused of plotting suicide bomb attacks on New York's subway system named him as their key liaison in Pakistan.","Adnan el Shukrijumah was killed along with two other suspected militants .

"Roma have insisted that midfielder Kevin Strootman is not for sale. The 24-year-old Dutchman, who has been linked with a potential January move to Manchester United, is currently out of action after suffering a serious knee injury in March. And the Italian club are adamant that he will not be going anywhere when he makes his return. Kevin Strootman scored five goals for Roma in an impressive season last year before his knee injury . Roma are desperate to keep hold of Strootman when he returns from injury despite interest from United . Roma general manager Mauro Baldissoni told Sky Italia: ‘We can’t wait until Kevin is back on the pitch. ‘We miss him a lot, but he is getting closer to his return. We are proud that Kevin is part of our squad and he is not for sale.’ Strootman had been a big part of Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal's plans when he was in charge of Holland, but the knee injury kept him out of the Dutchman's squad for the World Cup. However, Van Gaal is still said to be extremely interested in signing the midfielder, with Juan Mata touted as a possible makeweight in any potential deal.

"Paula Radcliffe has called for life bans for any athlete found guilty of doping, amid allegations the practice is widespread in Russian sport. Last week a German television documentary presented what it claimed was evidence of widespread drugs use, while it also alleged that corruption extends beyond Russia and implicated the IAAF in covering up the abuse. The Russian Athletics Federation says the allegations are untrue, while the IAAF's independent ethics commission is already investigating the allegations and the World Anti-Doping Agency has revealed it will follow suit. Paula Radcliffe has called for life bans for any athlete found guilty of intentional doping . Last week a German television documentary presented what it claimed was evidence of widespread drugs use . Radcliffe, the women's marathon world record holder, described the allegations as 'shocking and sickening' and despite WADA saying that life bans for athletes convicted of doping offences are unenforceable in law, she believes that any athlete guilty of the offence should not be allowed to return to the sport. 'I would advocate a life ban for anybody intentionally doping but we know that unfortunately that can't be implemented for legal reasons,' Radcliffe told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'Stepping up to a four-year ban was a big step and I think I'd like to see sanctions come into place for federations when they pass a certain number of positive cases and certainly for the entourage - that is the coaches and the managers. Radcliffe, the women's marathon world record holder, described the allegations as 'shocking and sickening' Radcliffe feels a life ban would be adequate for any athlete caught or found guilty of intentional doping . 'The independent testing bodies maybe need to be taken away from countries if they can't be trusted and I think sanctions for that country competing in events like the world championships, like the Olympic Games. 'If it is true that 99 per cent of athletes are cheating then maybe Russia should not be in the world championships and not take part in the next Olympic Games. 'I think it shouldn't just be Russia that's singled out here but any country that isn't abiding by the WADA code of practice, and in athletics the IAAF code of practice and anti-doping rules, and implementing sanctions and testing as they should, then maybe we should look at whether they are allowed to take part in the world championships.'

"Ethnic Kurds are fighting against their own brethren and helping ISIS to take the town of Kobane by deciphering messages in the Kurdish language and giving information on battlefield terrain. One of Islamic State's top commanders in Kobane is also Kurdish, a man known as Abu Khattab al-Kurdi - which translates as Abu Khattab the Kurd. Hundreds of Kurds have joined forces with the Islamic State, but it is not known how many are fighting with the 3,000 ISIS troops in their seven-week battle for Kobane, a strategically key Syrian town on the Turkish border. Traitor: Hundreds of Kurdish troops are thought to be fighting with ISIS in Kobane against their own people, including Abu Khattab al-Kurdi (pictured) one of the militants' top commanders . Lethal: There are thought to be around 3,000 ISIS troops fighting in the seven-week battle for Kobane, though it is not known exactly how many of them are Kurdish . Fighting their own: According to the People's Protection Brigade (YPG) leaders in Kobane, the Kurds are helping decipher radio messages in the Kurdish language and giving ISIS information on the terrain . Most of those fighters, including al-Kurdi, are thought to come from the town of Halabja in Iraq, though some come from Kobane itself, while others arrived from regions such as Afrin and Jazeera. Islamic State websites recently published photographs of him - a young bearded man - wearing the traditional Kurdish dress of baggy pants standing in front of dead Kurdish soldiers. In Baghdad, an Iraqi security official said al-Kurdi was a member of Ansar al-Islam, a Sunni militant group with ties to al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006. Al-Kurdi served with the group for years, and later joined the Islamic State group, the official said. The Iraqi official said al-Kurdi is wanted by Iraqi authorities, but refused to give his real name. He added: 'Our latest information is that he is in Syria fighting in the Kobane area. He is an expert in mountainous areas. 'He is commanding the Kurdish group within Daesh [an Arabic name for ISIS] because he is a Kurd.' Reports from inside the city suggest that ISIS troops have already begun beheading civilians in areas they control, meaning the Kurdish fighters are helping in the massacre of their own people. Slaughter: According to witnesses, ISIS fighters have already beheaded civilians in the parts of Kobane they control, and Kurdish fighters (pictured) fear thousands more may die if the whole city falls . Turncoat: While most Kurdish ISIS fighters have come from outside the city, there are some who have been drawn from Kobane itself (pictured, a YPG fighter launches a mortar shell at ISIS troops) The U.N. has warned that, as in Sinjar and Mosul, thousands more could be slaughtered if ISIS win full control of Kobane. Halabja is a predominantly Kurdish town in the north of Iraqi which gained notoriety after Saddam Hussein bombed it with chemical weapons  in 1988, killing some 5,000 people. Shorsh Hassan, a  spokesman for the People's Protection Units (YPG) in Kobane, said: 'The fighter  from Kobane is not like someone who hails from Chechnya with no idea about tracks and roads.' YPG officials say they became aware of Kurds among the mostly Sunni Muslim extremists early in the fighting. As Kurdish fighters were defending the nearby Syrian village of Shiran in September, two Kurdish men with different accents and wearing YPG uniforms infiltrated their ranks, Kurdish officials said. They were captured and upon questioning they admitted to fighting for the Islamic State group, the officials added. Thousands of militants from all over the world - including north Africans, Asians and Westerners - have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the ranks of the Islamic State group. Turkish nationals are among their number, but it is unknown if any are fighting in Kobane. Bloody: The seven-week battle for Kobane has seen extensive airstrikes by America and its coalition partners - including the UK - and is the longest and deadliest battle in Islamic State's campaign so far . Informants: Two Kurdish ISIS fighters infiltrated the ranks of the YPG (pictured) during the fight for Shiran in September, but they were captured and admitted to spying . Halabja was known as  the home of Abdullah Goran, one of the best-known Kurdish poets in the 20th century, and used to be largely non-religious. But in the past three decades, radical Muslim preachers have become active there and turned it into one of Iraqi Kurdistan's most conservative areas. Kiwan Mohammed, the 25-year-old goalkeeper of Halabja's soccer team, was killed last month  while fighting for the Islamic State group in Kobane - to the shock of many Iraqis. Mohammed was identified by jihadi websites as Abu Walid al-Kurdi. According to reports, the athlete left Syria in July 2013 and had not been heard of until his death. Some 70 Iraqi Kurds, mostly from Halabja, went to fight in Syria with the Islamic State group, according to Dana Jalal, a journalist who follows jihadist groups. Most go through Turkey where they say they are going for tourism, but they then they cross into Syria, with some taking their families with them. Nawaf Khalil, the Europe-based spokesman for Syria's powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said Kurdish fighters within the Islamic State group are invaluable in the Kobane battle because they know the geography, the language and the mentality of fellow Kurds. He said: 'A main part of their work is tapping (electronic surveillance) and intelligence-gathering. They might be also using some from the Kobane area to benefit from the geographical knowledge of the area.' Mustafa Bali, a Kurdish activist in Kobane, said that by having Kurdish fighters, Islamic State extremists are trying to win the hearts and minds of Syrian Kurds in the area. He added: 'Daesh is trying to tell the people of Kobane that it does not consider them enemies and its fighters include Kurds.'","Hundreds of Kurds are thought to have joined ISIS since fighting began .

"Manchester United: £228.8million. Chelsea: £186m. Manchester City: £154.95m. At a combined cost of half a billion pounds, this trio had the most expensive starting XIs over the weekend's fixtures. Yet Aston Villa downed Liverpool on Saturday with a starting side which was compiled spending an astonishingly low £13.6m, less than 10 times the amount of those Premier League superpowers (and less than Mario Balotelli). Sat in second place behind leaders Chelsea, Villa are becoming the Robin Hood of the Premier League, stealing points from the rich clubs and keeping them for the poor. Aston Villa are currently second in the table despite manager Paul Lambert's shoe-string budget . Liverpool paid £16m for Mario Balotelli, making him more expensive than Aston Villa's starting XI . Brad Guzan, 30, £600,000 from Chivas . The American stopper is finally making the No 1 spot his own after a loan spell at Hull and even ending his contract in 2012 before re-signing for the club. Alan Hutton, 29m £3m from Tottenham . Ended a frustrating time at Spurs only to land himself in a completely new one, being part of Lambert's 'Bomb Squad' when he made a group of first-team players train with the reserves, but has now been brought back into the fold. Nathan Baker, 23, academy graduate . Joined Aston Villa aged 13 and after going out on loan at Lincoln City and Millwall is not establishing himself in Villa's defence. Philippe Senderos, 29, free from Valencia . The Swiss failed to make an impression in Premier League at Arsenal, Everton and Fulham but Paul Lambert has seen enough in the player to bring him back. Aly Cissokho, 26, £2million from Valencia . The left-back did not do enough on loan at Liverpool last season to earn a permanent switch, but Lambert moved for him instead. Tom Cleverley, 25, loan from Manchester United . Made the latest of deadline day moves away from Manchester United after being vilified by their fans. He has been handed a fresh start in the Midlands. Ashley Westwood, 24, £2m from Crewe . One of the many players to come from Crewe's prolific production line of young talent, he signed a four-year deal in 2012 and has flourished under Lambert. Fabian Delph, 24, £6m from Leeds . Was the surprise name in England's starting line-up against Switzerland and his reputation is soaring. Started his career at Leeds but Villa beat a host of top-flight clubs to his signature in 2009. Kieran Richardson, 29, free from Fulham . The controversial left-sided player jumped ship from Fulham when they sunk back into the Championship last season. He has plenty of Premier League pedigree, playing at Manchester United, West Brom and Sunderland as well. Andreas Weimann, 23, academy graduate . The sharp-shooting striker started his footballing education at Austrian sides Stadlau and Rapid Wien, but Villa poached him in 2007 when he was just 16. Gabriel Agbonlahor 27, academy graduate . Villa through-and-through, having been at the club since 1994 and working his way through the academy. The rapid forward has won three England caps. Total: £13.6m . The Aston Villa starting XI that beat Liverpool cost just £13.6m, and included three academy graduates . Simon Mignolet, £9m from Sunderland . Javier Manquillo, loan from Atletico Madrid . Dejan Lovren, £20m from Southampton . Mamadou Sakho, £18m from PSG . Javier Moreno, £12m from Sevilla . Steven Gerrard, academy graduate . Adam Lallana, £25m from Southampton . Jordan Henderson, £16m from Sunderland . Philippe Coutinho, £8.5m from Inter Milan . Lazar Markovic, £20m from Benfica . Mario Balotelli, £16m from AC Milan . Total: £144.5m . They are joined by the Merry Men of Swansea, whose starting XI this weekend cost just £24.18m, and Southampton, at £45.3m, in third and fourth, keeping ahead of the big-spending clubs with their early-season form. How long can they keep it up? Swansea's entire 25-man Premier League squad was built by spending just £52.73m, Southampton only £89.2m and Villa £139.5m. It means that so far this season Swansea have spent just £5.9m per point they've won so far, Southampton £12.7m and Villa £13.9m. While the richest clubs in the league shower money on world stars, these three are managing to muscle their way at the top end of the table on a comparatively frugal budget. Manchester United  have now become the most expensively-assembled squad in the league after splashing huge sums on the likes of Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, overtaking rivals City and Chelsea.

"Danny Welbeck joined his Arsenal team-mates on Thursday for the first time since his £16million move from Manchester United as Arsene Wenger’s side trained at London Colney. Arsenal face Manchester City on Saturday afternoon at the Emirates after an international break that saw Welbeck take the plaudits for England’s 2-0 win in Switzerland. Welbeck scored twice for Roy Hodgson’s side in the Euro 2016 qualifier in Basle, giving hope to Gunners fans that he will be the man to lead the line with Olivier Giroud out injured. WATCH Scroll down to see 'Phil Neville: Welbeck was one of best signings this window' Danny Welbeck took part in his first Arsenal training session since joining the club from Manchester United . Danny Welbeck jokingly grabs Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere around the neck during Thursday's session . Danny Welbeck looked to enjoy his first training session since his £16million switch on deadline day . Danny Welbeck chats with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during his first training session with the Gunners . Arsene Wenger and Danny Welbeck both had something to smile about following their brief chat . Danny Welbeck appeared to be settling in with his Arsenal and England team-mates Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere . It seems the 23-year-old has bedded in well with his new pals, pictured having a laugh and putting his arm around England team-mate Jack Wilshere. Welbeck should start against Manchester City for the vital Premier League clash, with Arsenal looking to start their season off well against the top four having stumbled against the big boys in previous years. Wenger  revealed his deadline-day preference had been to sign  Welbeck on loan rather than a permanent deal. Danny Welbeck watches on with Jack Wilshere, Yaya Sanogo (left) and Joel Campbell (right) Danny Welbeck smiles in his Arsenal training shirt ahead of the Gunners' clash with Man City on Saturday . Danny Welbeck watches on as defender Calum Chambers shields the ball from the former Man United striker . Wenger confirmed his initial priority was to secure a season-long loan with an agreement to buy next summer. That position is understood to have shifted when United insisted on a permanent transfer, with Tottenham also in discussions to sign the England striker. When asked if a loan move had been his primary intention, Wenger said: ‘With an option to buy, yes.’ Having spent his time at Old Trafford fluctuating between his preferred central role and positions put wide, Welbeck is now set to be played through the middle at Arsenal. Wenger said: ‘He arrived on Wednesday and he’s happy and confident of course because he scored two goals for England in a very important game and that can only boost his confidence. 'Welbeck is young, strong and a great finisher. He can improve here. ‘When you analyse his game you think he has the qualities to play through the middle. At Manchester United, where you had many big stars, and he is a player who is very versatile, he had to make room sometimes for players to play through the middle. Danny Welbeck completed his move from Manchester United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day . Aaron Ramsey limped off injured for Wales in their 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier win at Andorra . 'But if you analyse in an objective way his qualities, I think he has the perfect style to play through the middle.’ Wenger added: ‘He has been questioned about that (his finishing), but the second goal (for England) gives you a good answer.’ 'Welbeck's best position is through the middle. He is happy and confident' Wenger has drawn criticism in some quarters for being in Rome on deadline day, but he said: ‘If I had not travelled that day, Welbeck would not be here. I'll explain that a bit later but the coincidence made that because I was on my way. Arsene Wenger (left) gets his message across to Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla on Wednesday . Danny Welbeck scored twice to help England to a 2-0 win against Switzerland during the international break . ‘If I stayed at home, Welbeck would not be here today. I will tell you that story one day but that's the truth. We are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel. The advantage of that day was I had to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and I was available the whole day.’ When asked if Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a deal, Wenger joked: ‘You should ask him. I met him by coincidence on Tuesday and Wednesday and I would like to keep that conversation to myself!’ Wenger added: ‘We sold Robin van Persie to Manchester United so that's a reciprocity that happened there. Arsene Wenger revealed that Theo Walcott is 'two to three weeks' away from being fully fit . Per Mertesacker (left) takes on Santi Cazorla during Arsenal training on Wednesday . 'When they bought (Radamel) Falcao they had to let somebody go and I was not aware at the start when I heard that he (Welbeck) could be available. It was quick because it was on the last day of the transfer window and I had no hesitation to do it.’ Arsenal expect to have Aaron Ramsey fit to face Manchester City on Saturday despite injuring his ankle for Wales against Andorra. Wenger said: ‘The first news is not bad. He will be assessed today (Thursday), he has a little chance to be available for Saturday. He had an ankle sprain, it's a minor one that's for sure. Will it be enough to be available for Saturday? We'll know today. ‘Mikkel Arteta and Kieran Gibbs are back in the squad and in normal training. Mesut Ozil had a knock and didn't play for Germany because he had a sprained ankle. He will be available as well.’ Danny Welbeck is expected to be given more chance to impress in his favourite central role at Arsenal . Danny Welbeck celebrates his second England goal against Switzerland with Rickie Lambert on Monday . Gary Neville admitted on Wednesday that he was stunned by Welbeck’s £16million sale from Manchester United to Arsenal. I have to admit I thought the Danny Welbeck sale was a strange one, but that’s just me. ‘Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m? ‘How have Arsenal got him [Welbeck] for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly. ‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.","New Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck takes part in first training session .

"Ministers have launched a review of the free nursery milk scheme amid evidence taxpayers are being ripped off by more than £10million a year. Ministers claim that milk being supplied via 'middle men' has seen the Government billed up to £1 a pint – while it can be bought in shops for an average of 36p. They have warned that the cost of the scheme has doubled in four years to £53million, which could soar to £76million by 2016 unless costs are curbed. Milking it: All under-fives receive a third of a pint free each day . Public Health Minister Anne Milton said the Government would then face being overcharged £20million a year. But the review has prompted toxic . allegations of 'milk snatching' by critics who warned that it will lead . to a fall in the 1.5 million children who currently benefit from free . milk. The Government's Nursery Milk scheme . provides under-fives with a third of a pint every day. Older children . entitled to free school meals are also offered free milk. The Government's review was launched . after it emerged from the Department of Health that 'middle men' – firms . which supply nurseries, schools and childminders with milk and claim . the money back directly from the Government – were deliberately ramping . up their prices to as much as £1 a pint. One option being considering by the . Government would cap the amount that can be claimed back on a pint of . milk – which could save as much as £40million a year. Another would see a . system of national suppliers set up to cut out the middle men. Mrs Milton yesterday insisted that the Government remained committed to providing free milk for all under-fives. Rip-off: The Department of Health ended up over spending by millions after being over-charged for nursery school milk . Long history: The Government's Nursery Milk scheme, providing under fives with a third of a pint every day for free, dates back to 1940s and suggestions it would be axed in 2010 were quickly played down at the time . Margaret Thatcher, pictured here in 1970 with Prime Minister Edward Heath was nicknamed the 'milk snatcher' in 1971 . She said: 'The current scheme has not . changed operationally since it began, and costs have ballooned. In four . years, costs have jumped from £27million in 2007 to a staggering . £53million in 2011. Estimates show that modernising the scheme could . save as much as £20million each year.' The state first gave free milk to . pregnant women and young children in 1940, to protect them against . wartime shortages, and it was later extended to all schoolchildren. However, Margaret Thatcher was dubbed the 'milk snatcher' in 1971 after scrapping free school milk for the over-sevens. The nickname became shorthand for the . Tories' supposedly heartless approach to spending cuts. David Cameron . last year shot down suggestions that the free milk scheme could be axed . completely – underlining the Tories' sensitivity over the issue. But shadow public health minister . Diane Abbott said: 'Trying to cut the cost of this scheme may end up . snatching milk away from children, disproportionately affecting the . poorest. In a recession, when there is a squeeze on families, it is the . wrong time for risks with our children's health.' Jon Thornes, chairman of the School . and Nursery Milk Alliance, which is made up of a group of organisations . that campaign to retain free milk, said: 'Drinking milk in schools, . nurseries and while in the care of childminders is vital in helping . children to develop important nutrition and social habits. The Nursery . Milk scheme has proven incredibly popular and hugely successful in . contributing to the healthy development of children. 'We will be engaging fully with the . consultation to ensure the scheme continues to benefit as many children . as possible – and would urge the Government to ensure its focus is on . children's wellbeing rather than just the bottom line.' John Sedgwick, managing director of . milk provider Cool Milk, said: 'Making the scheme more burdensome for . nurseries and childminders will only serve to reduce the number of . children receiving milk. 'The risk is that the scheme will atrophy until it no longer exists. Cutting the scheme by the back door is not the answer.'","Cost of free milk has soared from £27million in 2007 to £53million last year .

"Rio Ferdinand might struggle to convince the majority of coaches in modern elite sport that banning chips the night before a game amounted to a catastrophic error of judgment. But in his new autobiography the former Manchester United defender presents an aversion to deep fried potatoes as one of a number of reasons why David Moyes failed to last beyond 10 months as the successor to Sir Alex Ferguson. Some might point to Ferdinand as one of a number of senior players who happened to be past their best when Moyes took charge at Old Trafford in July last year. There is no denying Moyes was presented with a huge rebuilding job that is only now being addressed by Louis van Gaal with a massive transfer outlay approaching £200million. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . Rio Ferdinand (right) says that playing under David Moyes (left) at Manchester United was embarrassing . Rio Ferdinand (right) returned to Old Trafford to face Manchester United with Queens Park Rangers . Ferdinand and Manchester United struggled for form under David Moyes' management last season . Moyes would not deny he made mistakes either. Indeed he admitted as much in the interview he gave to Sportsmail; the first since his brutal dismissal on April 22. But Ferdinand gives his own, fairly detailed view of the Moyes tenure in the book, #2Sides, being serialised in The Sun. The 35-year-old defender, who moved to QPR during the summer, does recognise that Moyes was ‘unlucky’. He also says he could not fault his desire to succeed. ‘He was a genuine guy and no one could have worked harder,’ he writes. But Ferdinand thought Moyes made a number of key mistakes, among them the banning of what had long been part of a traditional pre-match meal. He said it was ‘a ritual’ to have ‘low-fat chips the night before a game’. Ferdinand said the United players ‘loved’ their chips but within a week of becoming manager Moyes had banned them ‘for no good reason’. ‘All the lads were p****d off,’ complains Ferdinand. He says the moment Moyes left and Ryan Giggs took temporary charge, chips returned to the menu. Moyes believed in going for a pre-match team walk. Ferdinand said this was anathema to the players. ‘When lots of little things start changing its destabilising,’ he said. Manchester United struggled under Moyes and failed to qualify for the Champions League, finishing seventh . Rio Ferdinand (left) has slammed David Moyes for the Scot's reign as manager of Manchester United . In his interview with Sportsmail, Moyes accepted that in hindsight he might have taken ‘a slightly different approach’. At the same time he conceded methods that proved successful at Everton perhaps did not work as well at United. But he insisted he did not go in and make wholesale changes. ‘I didn’t want to change anything immediately,’ he said last month. ‘I wanted to take my time working out what I thought was needed.’ He felt he was ‘not given time to succeed or fail’, but praised the players for their work ethic. ‘They were fantastic,’ he said. Ferdinand is not quite so generous towards Moyes, claiming there was a lack of clarity when it came to tactics and a lack of appreciation of what it meant to be part of United. He recalls a training session Moyes held in a public part of Munich ahead of a Champions League game at Bayern. Ferdinand said it was ‘bizarre’ to practise set-pieces in front of members of the public who began filming the session. ‘It was amateurish,’ writes Ferdinand. ‘I mean, why not just send Bayern an email or a DVD.’ Ferdinand reveals how Moyes then told him he would not be playing against the Germans ‘in front of everybody’. ‘It was probably the worst single moment I had at United,’ he recalls. ‘It killed me. Inside I wanted to scream and grab him.’ Rio Ferdinand received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford faithful when he returned with QPR . David Moyes (left) was sacked as Manchester United manager in April but had managed Rio Ferdinand . When it came to delivering instructions for the match, Ferdinand claims Moyes only succeeded in confusing the players. He says Ferguson used to give ‘simple, concise, clear instructions’. Moyes, however, said they could employ ‘three formations’ depending on ‘how Bayern played’. ‘We lost and 13 days later Moyes was sacked,’ writes Ferdinand. The former England captain agrees that Moyes was not dismissed ‘in a dignified way’ by United. But he says Moyes ‘tried to impose a vision but never seemed to be completely clear what that vision should be’. He says he ‘unintentionally created a negative vibe’ and ‘slowly lost’ the players because of an ‘accumulation of mistakes’. Ferdinand thinks Moyes abandoned United’s tradition for playing with ‘wingers’, and instead ‘wanted the wide players coming inside’. He also stopped the ‘small-sided match on a small pitch’ the players used to enjoy under Ferguson on the eve of a game, changing it to a two-touch game. Ferdinand says this was why United so often ‘looked cramped and played without imagination’.","Rio Ferdinand believes David Moyes made a number of mistakes during his Old Trafford tenure .

"A law firm has strongly denied it wrote the script for a racist ad using a character called Mr Wong Fong Shu and claimed hackers posted the video on its YouTube channel.

The England striker is shown sparring in the ring, landing some heavy blows on his opponent.

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game, including team formations. Julian Speroni was the hero for Crystal Palace, superbly saving an 84th minute penalty to secure a draw for his side. The Argentine, who had been linked with a move away from Selhurst Park this summer, proved his worth to the Eagles again when he got a strong hand to Scott Arfield’s spot kick. It was an excellent save celebrated raucously all round Selhurst Park but nobody was as relieved as Mile Jedinak.

Managers: Neil Warnock 5, Sean Dyche 6 . Referee: Mike Dean 7 . The Palace captain, so often the lynchpin in his side's midfield, had been below par all afternoon and his rugby tackle on Lukas Jutkiewicz in the box had referee Mike Dean rightly pointing to the spot. Speroni had denied midfielder Arfield earlier in the game, making a fingertip save to keep out his powerful effort from 25 yards. The penalty was a more tame effort down the middle and at the right height for Speroni. Burnley will be crestfallen having failed to take advantage of that gilt edged opportunity to secure a first victory since returning to the Premier League but a draw was probably a fair result. The real losers were the fans who were given false hope of an exciting contest after a pulsating opening ten minutes. Neil Warnock has made a point of stating that he wanted the side that rocketed to 11th under Tony Pulis by being watertight in defence to evolve into a more attacking unit that would entertain. It seemed they might live up to that billing initially. Wilfried Zaha, who was given a raucous reception when the stadium announcer read out his name, almost helped Palace to an early goal from Jason Puncheon’s short corner. He cut the ball back inside the box to find Damien Delaney in space but the defender blasted over. Zaha’s pace and dizzying step overs confounded the Burnley defence.

After Frazier Campbell doggedly won the ball in midfield he released Zaha to burst down the wing and into the box where his right footed strike was spilled by keeper Tom Heaton and required defender Jason Shakell to clear off the line. Another chance went begging when Michael Duff’s botched header fell to Dwight Gayle, who had plenty of time to pick out his shot but he sent the ball soaring over the cross bar. George Boyd made his debut for Burnley in place of the injured Matt Taylor. The boyhood Crystal Palace fan was subject to jeers from the stands, with fans recalling how he opted to join Nottingham Forest instead of Palace last year. He saw plenty of the ball and looked lively but was unable to capitalise on a few half chances. Palace had a flurry of chances at the start of the second half. First, Dwight Gayle was unable to connect with a Mile Jedinak header in the box. Then Damien Delaney headed into the side netting from a Jason Puncheon corner. At the other end, Speroni was given his first proper test of the afternoon with an hour played, when forced into a fingertips save of Scott Arfield’s powerful shot from 25 yards out. There was disappointment for former non-league man Danny Ings, who looked in agony as he pulled up with what looked like a torn hamstring. The 22-year-old who played non-league after being released by Southampton has worked tirelessly to get into the Premier League with Burnley, was close to tears in the dugout.

"Former bikie gang boss Toby Mitchell and Australian footy player Jake King have continued their association, despite the Australian Football League's clear stance against the friendship. Mitchell, an ex-Bandidos enforcer, posted pictures on his social media account of the pair at a fight night last weekend at Melbourne Pavilion. The two were also hanging out watching King's football club, the Richmond Tigers, play last month. Ex-bikie Toby Mitchell (left) and footy star Jake King (right) pictured hanging out together again at a fight night last weekend . This follows former AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou's push for the Tigers forward to drop links with the notorious bikie who was ambushed and shot five times in 2011. The duo were pictured at a fight night on June 21 at Hawthorn East which 7km from Melbourne's CBD. The event was promoted by Powerplay, which Mitchell - former champion kickboxer - was previously a director, reported the Herald Sun. Mitchell, who recently avoided jail over a Melbourne strip club brawl in 2010, and his controversial friendship with King made headlines when the Richmond forward invited him to his club's dressing rooms in September last year. Demetriou described as a 'pretty stupid' move at the time. The pair have continued their association despite the AFL's clear stance against the friendship . They were also spotted together at a football game last month . He said he was concerned people of certain backgrounds had the potential to 'infiltrate' the code. King was warned after he brought Mitchell to his club's dressing rooms in 2013 . 'We know after the past 12 months, from our code's perspective, it's not what we want,' Demetriou said. 'I'm surprised given the level of awareness, the efforts we've gone to with each club, to explain the importance of this particular issue … in fact I think it's pretty stupid.' Although the AFL and Richmond did not comment on the pair's recent outing, the club's CEO Brendon Gale said he was disappointed about their relationship. 'Jake's relationship with Toby Mitchell pre-dates his time at Richmond,' he said in a statement on the club's website last year. 'Certainly we'll have a discussion with him. These are instructive opportunities to remind all players of the risk involved. 'We've brought it to Jake's attention that he should think long and hard about those sorts of friendships and connections and associations.' Mr Gale said King hasn't broken any rules.

"CLICK HERE to read the reasons behind Micah Richards' training ground row with Mario Balotelli . Micah Richards isn’t your typical Brit abroad. He isn’t in Italy just to party. He’s here, in Florence, to rebuild his once burgeoning reputation. The defender once heralded as the undisputed successor to Gary Neville’s England right back slot has had 18 months to forget. There are various theories to explain Richards’s fall from grace. Injury is one; the form of Pablo Zabaleta another. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Micah Richards first training session with Fiorentina . Micah Richards pictured arriving in Italy to complete his move from Manchester City to Fiorentina . Former England defender Micah Richards has signed for Serie A side Fiorentina to get more playing time . The former Oldham Athletic defender said he feared for Manchester City's young academy graduates . Former Manchester City boss revealed his superstitious side when he banned players from wearing purple at the club. The 49-year-old believed that the colour brought bad luck. His failure to convince Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini of his abilities is, perhaps, the most pertinent reason. Speaking for the first time since calling time on his 12-year career at City, Richards provided his own account of why he feels his career has hit a brick wall. ‘I don’t have any bad feelings towards the club. They put me on the map and gave me a chance when I was 17,’ said Richards. ‘But I do have bad feelings towards the playing time (I was given). For any player, when you’re not playing it’s frustrating. When Roberto Mancini was in charge, he would rotate the full backs. ‘When we won the league in 2012, I played more than Zabaleta. So, I feel as though I could have been given more chances to play (under Pellegrini). I felt like I had improved and that I could do it at that level.’ Richards, who also revealed his hope of breaking back into England contention, admits he has doubts over whether City’s current youngsters will ever emulate his achievement of breaking into the first team. Dedryck Boyata, a Belgian, is the only ‘club-trained’ player in City’s Champions League squad. ‘It’s going to be hard for them to come through. If you look at the squad now there’s 22 international players,’ Richards said. ‘You’re going to have to be extra special to get through. Hopefully, the new facilities they are building will help to bring young players through. It would be nice to see more coming from the academy, but the standard’s pretty high now. ‘The manager [Pellegrini] always said if you’re good enough, you’ll get a chance. I hope he sticks to his word. But I decided I wanted to go somewhere where I had the opportunity to be No 1.’ Micah Richards poses with the club's shirt at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence . Micah Richards on the training pitch with his Fiorentina team-mates ahead of their Genoa clash . Micah Richards said that when he spoke to representatives from Fiorentina they made him feel very welcome . He’s got that chance now, amid the plush surroundings of Tuscany. The prospect of playing on the same flank as Colombia’s World Cup sensation Juan Cuadrado this season has re-invigorated the defender. Richards was chirpy at his official unveiling at the Stadio Artemio Franchi; his difficult 18 months now a bygone chapter. His season-long loan to Fiorentina, however, has come at considerable emotional expense. Facts and figures show that Micah Richards' career has taken a down turn at the Etihad Stadium . The 26-year-old is very close to his family; leaving them back in England has been a huge wrench, according to those close to Richards. But he wanted it this way. The hard way. He could easily have stayed in the Barclays Premier League — his comfort zone. Richards had a firm loan offer from West Ham, who made their interest known in the defender just hours after their opening-day defeat by Tottenham. Likewise, Richards could have easily sat back and picked up his £70,000-per-week salary at the Etihad Stadium, knowing full well he’d have virtually no chance of playing and that his contract ran out at the end of the season. Micah Richards did say that he was grateful to Manchester City for giving him a chance when he was 17 . Micah Richards took a pay cut to join Fiorentina so he could get appearances instead of being a substitute . Sunday Genoa (H) September 18 Guingamp (H, Europa League) September 21 Atalanta (A) September 24 Sassuolo (H) September 28 Torino (A) October 2 Dinamo Minsk (A, Europa League) But his mind was made up. The move to Fiorentina had been in the pipeline for three weeks. As discussions between the Serie A club and Richards’s representatives progressed, the more the defender’s eyes widened. ‘I had interest from English clubs, Man City offered me a five-year contract to stay, but for me I wanted to come somewhere I could make a fresh start,’ he said. ‘A lot of players in England just want to stay but I wanted to play abroad, I’ve always wanted to do that. This was the best option for me. I watched Italian football on TV, the pace looks slower, but more technical. ‘Teams look after the ball a bit better. That’s what Italy is known for and tactically I want to improve my game. ‘For example, sometime in games you can fizzle games out, I learned that under Mancini. I learned a lot from Mancini and he is one of the reasons I came here, too. Richards squares up to Mario Balotelli during their time together at Manchester City - the pair had actually come to blows on the training ground a few weeks earlier (below) James Milner holds back a furious Micah Richards as he tries to get at Mario Balotelli during a training session . Micah Richards decided to leave Manchester City having been there since 2001 . But even with the Florence sun beating down on him yesterday, rainy Manchester was never too far from his thoughts. ‘Leaving City was always going to be sad after 12 years, it was hard for me to leave because I know nothing else but Manchester City,’ he said.

"A secret police dossier on worldwide outlaw motorcycle gang, the Hells Angels, details murder, rape, assaults on women, drugs, fraud, car bombings, drive by shootings, bashings, standover and extortion going back years. The file obtained by the MailOnline is part of a 13,000-page brief of crimes and violence which police in NSW will use as a national test case to outlaw bikie gangs around Australia as organised crime groups. Police list 80 violent or illegal acts committed by a membership of just 46 Hells Angels bikies. The case will be  watched closely by the international Hells Angels organisation, and bike gangs and law enforcement agencies around the world. They are criminals: Sydney police have documented in a court application over thousands of pages of crimes and atrocities they say the Hells Angels (right) committed going back decades against rival gangs like the Finks  and which they will use as a national test case to outlaw bikie gangs around Australia . The chilling catalogue of atrocities tendered in court by the NSW Commissioner of Police includes crimes never prosecuted because the victims or witnesses were intimidated by Hells Angels members, a practice which the document lists among the club rules. The submission originally filed to the Supreme Court of NSW lists the names of the gang's full members, prospects, or probationary members, and 'hangarounds' - would be Hells Angels bikies, as well as strict codes of silence and discipline. Club rules prohibit membership for 'black men, police officers (current or former), women and informants'. The inventory of crimes includes gang wars between the Hells Angels and their sworn enemies, the Finks, the Comanchero, the Nomads, the Lones Wolves and the former Notorious gang associated with Sam Ibraham, a convicted kidnapper. The NSW Gangs Squad which is currently collating the dossier for the police commissioner to place before the NSW Supreme Court for a new application say they are prepared for a fight by Hells Angels lawyers. Gang lawyers representing former Hells Angels president Derek Wainohu previously mounted a challenge in the High Court of Australia - and won - on the grounds the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act contravened club members' human rights. Wainohu argued the law infringed on his 'implied constitutional freedom of political communication and political association'. The full bench of the High Court agreed and ordered the NSW Government pay the Hells Angels' costs. Hands off my human rights: Former Hells Angels president Derek James Wainohu (above) was the face of a High Court challenge against the NSW Police Commissioner's attempt to have his club deemed illegal. Wainohu argued the legislation infringed on his 'constitutional freedom of political communication and political association'. A new NSW Police application documenting claims of four decades of crimes and atrocities by the Hells Angels is being prepared . The High Court said that to declare the Hells Angels an outlawed criminal gang, a judge 'had to be satisfied that the members of the organisation associated for the purposes of organising, planning, facilitating, supporting or engaging in serious criminal activity and that the organisation represented a risk to public safety and order'. The dossier of crimes the police have tendered to prove the Hells Angels are engaged in 'serious criminal activity' starts with a 1972 murder when seven members of the Finks gang gunned down a Hells Angels bikie as he arrived at his clubhouse in Mascot, near Sydney Airport. In 1989, police said a club 'hangaround', who was hoping to become a gang prospect, was arrested in possession of a loaded revolver and illegal drugs on a street in the NSW coastal town of Coffs Harbour. The application submitted by the NSW Police Commissioner to the court listed the following crimes it says were committed on specific dates by the Hells Angels and other clubs: . On February 13, 1995, a Hells Angels bikie entered the home of his ex-girlfriend armed with a knife and assaulted, wounded and raped her. Charges were withdrawn after the victim refused to attend court due to fears for her safety. On May 11, 1995 A Lone Wolf member who later patched over to the Hells Angels, was charged with the murder of a young man who came to the aid of his father who was being assaulted by other bikies in a western Sydney hotel. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1998, Hells Angels prospect Zeljko Mitrovic was convicted for his involvement in the ambush and shooting at Bankstown of two men who died from multiple gunshot wounds. On July 13, 1998, Hells Angel David Newham is killed in a drive-by shooting at the clubhouse in western Sydney. In 2000, Peter Sidirourgos manufactured commercial quantities of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine in cough and cold tablets for the syndicate in Sydney's western suburbs. Jailed for 35 years: Christopher Hudson (left) shot dead solicitor Brendan Keilar (right) in the street. He had come to the aid of his killer's girlfriend . On May 23, 2001 a prospective member along with three accomplices bashed two men with baseball bats, causing serious head injuries. On January 27, 2001, prior to joining the Hells Angels, two men caused an underage girl to become intoxicated and forced her to perform oral sex on both of them. They robbed her of $100 and left her in an apartment. The victim later declined to attend court. On June 23, 2002, two Hells Angels attempted to rape a pregnant woman. They assaulted her on a bed slat in a unit in south-western Sydney and demanded she have an abortion. She was believed to have moved interstate after the assault and no charges were laid. The following year, one of the men lent his car to an associate and after the vehicle was damaged in an accident, threatened the man and his parents. Months later, two Hells Angels kicked in the panels of the man's car at an intersection, but charges were withdrawn after the complainant said he feared reprisals. On June 27, 2003, a Hells Angels club member and another male assaulted a 56-year-old shopkeeper in Queanbeyan, near Canberra, with a loaded pistol and demanded $100,000. The man declined to make a statement for fear of retribution. Murdered in Melbourne peak hour: Father of three, solcitior Brendan Keilar, 43, was shot in Melbourne's CBD by Hells Angels, Christopher Wayne Hudson, after Mr Keilar went to the assistance of two women Hudson was threatening. Keilar died  on the street. Hudson is serving 35 years to life . On June 30, 2006, a former Hells Angels prospect threatened the owner of a childcare centre in Sydney's south-west after his wife was sacked from the business. He threatened to burn down the centre 'with everyone in it'. June, 2007: Christopher Hudson fires at Melbourne police after a night of drinking with Collingwood footballer Alan Didak. On June 18, drunk and armed with a pistol, he assaults a stripper and drags his 24-year-old girlfriend Kaera Douglas on a street in central Melbourne during morning peak hour. When two men came to the women's aid, Hudson wounds Dutch backpacker, Paul de Waard, shoots Douglas in the stomach and shoots solicitor Brendan Keilar who dies in the street.  Hudson is serving 35 years jail. A club prospect and two other men assaulted a man on September 1, 2007, beating him unconscious and lleaving the victim with a permanent brain injury. After his release from prison, McLeod became a full member. Then a Hells Angels hangaround, on August 20, 2008 a member was involved in the kidnapping from Rose Bay in Sydney's eastern suburbs and assault of Daniel Elahi, forcing him to transfer $84,000 in assets. He was convicted. On June 16, 2008 members of the Notorious Outlaw Motorcycle gang fire shots into the Hells Angels Sydney Chapter clubhouse. IIn retaliation, on July 15 a bomb went off underneath the car of a Notorious enforcer, shots were fired and a further unexploded device was found at the enforcer's home. A Hells Angels prospect was indicated. The following day, 40 shots were fired into a house which had been owned by the enforcer's parents, on the NSW Central Coast. The Mailonline has the full list of named Hells Angels NSW chapter full members and prospects, the details of 80 crimes and the club rules ascertained by Strike Force Raptor, which was charged specifically to target the Hells Angels. The NSW Gangs Squad said the application to have the Hells Angels outlawed on the basis of the crimes catalogued above in the submission would be presented to the NSW Supreme Court at a date to be fixed. The NSW Attorney General, Brad Hazzard, declined to comment on the matter.","The police crime file declares the Hells Angels an organised crime gang .

"The boss of the Victorian Comanchero bikie gang wants to stand down from his role and spend more time with his family, the supreme court has heard. Michael James Murray, 36, is in court charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, possessing firearms and possessing testosterone after he allegedly tried to intimidate a man into taking the blame for explosives found at the house of another Comanchero. His lawyer Philip Dunn QC argued in the Victorian supreme court for his client to be granted bail on the grounds that his trial wouldn't begin until mid-2015 and that his businesses would collapse in the meantime. Kicking back: The Victorian boss of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle gang, on trial for perverting the course of justice, wants to step down and spend more time with his family, court heard on Monday . He told the court Mr Murray intended to resign his post as the Victorian commander of the Commanchero outlaw motorcycle gang to spend more time around his loved ones. 'He doesn't want to be in jail, he wants to be at home with his wife, his family and his business,' AAP reported Mr Dunn as telling the court on Monday. Victorian police allegedly found vials of testosterone when they raided Murray's home in Lysterfield, in Melbourne's southeast, in February. A second police raid the following month, at a Dewhurst property owned by his wife, allegedly uncovered a six guns, including shotguns and a pistol with tape on the handle. The court heard the guns were buried in plastic bags near a dam at the rural property but were exposed because the dam had dried up. Prosecutor Bill Stougiannos opposed Murray's bail application, saying he faced a serious accusation of perverting the course of justice. He said Michael 'Mick' Murray could re-offend if he was granted bail. Lawyer Philip Dunn argued Murray's two businesses, Nitro Gym and Nitro Ink tattoo parlour, could fail if his client was behind bars. He said Murray would submit to a curfew on bail, and a $1 million surety would be posted by an associate. Justice Gregory Garde said he would make a decision on Murray's bail on Tuesday. Murray has been in police custody since March after police launched a number of raids on properties around Victoria. Almir Dzafic and Robert Morando were also charged with perverting the course of justice for allegedly pressuring a man into taking the blame for explosives found at a Comanchero member's house in March 2013.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this week, including why Steven Gerrard is the set-piece master. Click here to follow @ralphellis56 . 1) Everybody remembers Steven Gerrard for the 'Take a Bow Son' last minute goal against Olympiakos, and his equally dramatic equaliser that sunk West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup Final. Those type of stunning strikes from open play are becoming a thing of the past, however. His coolly taken spot kick against Tottenham at White Hart Lane meant that only one of his last 18 goals for Liverpool have not been either free kicks or penalties. The odd one out was last season's header from a Luis Suarez corner that kicked off the 4-0 win over Everton at Anfield. VIDEO Scroll down for Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker make their QPR debuts . Specialist: Only one of Steven Gerrard's last 18 goals for Liverpool have not been either free kicks or penalties . 2) Nemanja Matic appears to have turned over a new leaf when it comes to discipline this season. The Serbian midfielder was the man playing peacemaker at Goodison, dragging Diego Costa away from trouble after he had riled Everton's defenders by gloating about Seamus Coleman's own goal. Matic certainly needed to sort out his behaviour. He collected a red card plus 13 yellows in each of his last two seasons. New role: Nemanja Matic has become the peacemaker at Chelsea this season . 3) Steven Caulker's pace will be vital for Queens Park Rangers alongside 35-year-old Rio Ferdinand – especially with another veteran in Richard Dunne as Harry Redknapp's alternative defensive option. Caulker, trying to recover the form that brought him an England cap in 2012, was one of only two central defenders in Saturday's Premier League games to register a top sprinting speed of 20mph or more as he helped Rangers register their first clean sheet of the season. Pace: Steven Caulker was one of only two Premier League defenders to get above 20mph this weekend . 4) Aston Villa teenager Jack Grealish is already getting a reputation as a danger man – and he hasn't made his full Premier League debut yet. Hull were so worried about the 18-year-old's tricky dribbling ability when he came on as a late sub they had Nikica Jelavic, Ahmed Elmohamady and Stephen Quinn all booked for crunching tackles on him in the space of five minutes. Danger man already: Hull City players were quick to foul Aston Villa youngster Jack Grealish on Sunday . 5) Antonio Valencia is struggling to handle the defensive side of his new role as a wingback – and the extra workload is leaving him too puffed out for his attacking play too. The 29-year-old got forward often enough to put in 12 crosses at Burnley, but not a single one of them was accurate enough to create a goalscoring chance. Valencia and Ashley Young were United's top two players for the number of sprints they made, but Young also failed to set up a single opportunity. Hard work: Antonio Valencia is struggling in defence for Manchester United, and is too worn out to attack . 6) James Ward-Prowse is in Gareth Southgate's Under 21 squad this week, but could be the next graduate of the Southampton academy to force his way through to senior England honours. The teenager bossed the midfield at West Ham, setting up one goal and making five more chances for team mates before he was subbed with 19 minutes left. He also had two attempts on goal of his own, and found a team mate with 44 out of 49 passes. England call up? James Ward-Prowse could be the next Southampton graduate to hear from Roy Hodgson . 7) Kenny Jackett took over a club in chaos when he walked into Wolverhampton Wanderers last summer, so it is hardly surprising that stability is one of his watch words now. Jackett has kept the same line-up for all the first five of Wolves' Championship games so far, and a comfortable 3-1 win over Blackburn proved the policy is paying benefits. Solidity: Kenny Jackett has kept the same Wolves line-up for all five Championship games... and it's working . 8) Jermaine Beckford has found it tough to be accepted by Bolton fans since his move from Leicester, and manager Dougie Freedman has been forced to defend him against critics on a number of occasions. T . he 30-year-old made things worse for himself by waving at Leeds supporters who cheered him when he got brought on as a 77th minute sub in the 1-0 defeat. Beckford, of course, was a big hit at Elland Road scoring 85 goals in 152 games between 2006 and 2010. Looking for a return? Jermaine Beckford waved at Leeds fans after they cheered the Bolton striker off . 9) Any other League One club might have been stung by selling their 26-goal top scorer just days before the transfer deadline – but Bristol City look capable of surviving the loss of Sam Baldock to Brighton. After signing 34-year-old Aaron Wilbraham, boss Steve Cotterill has even been able to keep Jay Emmanuel Thomas, who got 23 last season, on the bench. JET, as he likes to call himself, is likely to get his chance now. The 23-year-old former Arsenal trainee came on as a late sub before slotting a cool last minute penalty to earn a 2-1 win at Notts County. Main man: Jay Emmanuel-Thomas could step up for Bristol City after Sam Baldock left for Brighton . 10) Micky Mellon was the manager who took Fleetwood from the bottom of the Conference North all the way into the Football League – only to get sacked 18 months ago the first time he suffered a few bad results. The 42-year-old Scot is proving his worth again in his new job as boss of Shrewsbury – following the midweek Cup giant-killing at Premier League Leicester with a 2-0 win over Luton that put his unbeaten side fourth in the table. Mellon made only one change from the side that won at the King Power Stadium – and that forced on him by Andy Mangan's hamstring injury – but made sure that nobody still had their minds on the Cup success.","Only one of  Gerrard's last 18 Liverpool goals haven't been set pieces .

"Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has branded Luis Suarez a 'fantastic person', and said that losing him at Liverpool is comparable to if Barcelona were to lose Lionel Messi. After presenting Suarez with the Golden Shoe award, Dalglish hailed his former striker, and said he hoped he would return to Anfield one day.

"Gareth Bale believes more British players should play abroad at some stage in their career. The 25-year-old winger left the comfort of the Barclays Premier League last summer when he joined Real Madrid from Tottenham for a world-record £85million transfer fee. Bale's decision to swap the Premier League for La Liga was justified when he helped Real win the Champions League at the end of his first season in Spain.

'If you feel you're going to play, then I would encourage a British player to go abroad. 'I've enjoyed every minute of it, the new culture, the new life. I felt like I wanted to challenge myself.

"Allegations: Paul Napoli, 46, is a partner at Napoli Bern. Court papers filed by his former employee and lover Vanessa Dennis allege he fought to continue seeing the 33-year-old young lawyer even after his wife learned of the 18-month affair and began harrassing Dennis . The former mistress and employee of a partner at a top law firm that made millions representing 9/11 victims has officially filed a defamation against her old employer and his wife. Vanessa Dennis, 33, was a young lawyer at the firm of Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik LLP when she says she had an affair with Napoli that he pursued even after his vindictive wife Marie found out and allegedly began harassing her. Dennis now wants $11million from her cancer-stricken former flame as she claims in court documents that the 46-year-old tried time and again to bed her even as his wife stalked Dennis and allegedly kidnapped her cat. The New York Post reports that Dennis recently filed her defamation suit against Napoli, his wife and her former firm Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik LLP. 'At Paul’s insistence, Vanessa saw Paul Napoli in his office, had drinks with him,' reads the complaint obtained by the Post. 'On all of these occasions, Paul Napoli tried to have sex with her, but Vanessa refused.' Napoli, a partner at Napoli Bern which raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers at Ground Zero. In April 2013, Mrs Napoli, 47, hired a private investigator to spy on her husband and Dennis during a Chicago business trip. The suit claims she then emailed the young associate, saying, 'I have evidence that is going to be forwarded to your husband if you do not stay away from my husband.' Mr Napoli demanded Dennis erase correspondence between the pair and admitted he had authorized access for his wife to see both his and Dennis' e-mail accounts, state legal papers. Court papers say Mrs Napoli messaged Dennis' brother to tell him of the affair and then found Dennis' husband, Richard Buonauito, in Dennis' personnel file as an emergency contact and contacted him. Dennis was fired from Napoli Bern on May 2, 2013, with a $150,000 severance. But Mrs Napoli allegedly did not stop the harassment and e-mailed Dennis writing: 'Happy Mothers Day! Oh yea I should say happy motherless day. Tick tock.' Vanessa Dennis, (right) one of the young lawyers at the firm, court papers allege, and when his wife, Marie, (left) discovered it, she stalked and harassed the woman . Napoli is a partner at Napoli Bern which raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers at Ground Zero . Dennis had previously told Mr Napoli that she might not be able to have conceive. The Napolis have three young children - including a baby. In June 2013 an email included in court papers shows an angry Dennis wrote to Mr Napoli: 'What's more believable Paul — that a 32-year-old junior attorney who weighs 100 pounds soaking wet seduced and physically attacked her 40 something year old boss (who happens to be a managing partner and a millionaire) and twice her size or the other way around. She emailed him again to remind him of intimate details he had shared about his view of his wife's body since she became a mother. Dennis, who has since split with her husband, moved to Texas, but she claims Mrs Napoli sent  cards to the wives of Dennis' new bosses, warning them about her and even describing Dennis' private body piercing. She also sent messages to everyone on LinkedIn associated with Dennis' new firm, Dennis alleges. Dennis claims that in one day she came out the bathroom of her Houston apartment to find her back door open and her cat missing - she says she received a series of texts written as if from Padme, with one saying, 'How do u think I got out . . .' The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island . She declined to comment when contacted by the Post and Mr Napoli said he saw nothing wrong 'with confronting a person that there was an affair with.' 'Everything my wife said in any e-mail whether it sounds terrible or not was all true and was all factually correct.' He denied reports he had previous affairs at the firm and denied that his wife had killed Dennis' cat. The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island. A Facebook photo shows Mrs Napoli kissing her husband in Mexico's Cancun this year - the couple are outlined in a heart.

On his firm's website Mr Napoli's bio reads: ' Paul J. Napoli, a Senior Partner in the firm, has achieved more than 100 verdicts and settlements over one million dollars.

"Suzanne MacCrimmon has earned the title of Incredible Shrinking Bridesmaid after her embarrassment at her appearance in several friends' wedding photos saw her lose seven stone (98lbs). When Suzanne  saw herself in her first bridesmaid's dress, she was horrified at how overweight she looked in the size 24 dress, weighing more than 19 stone (266 pounds). The photos inspired her to lose two stone in time for her next bridesmaid role. When Suzanne MacCrimmon from Alloa in saw herself in her first bridesmaid's dress, she was horrified at how overweight she looked in the size 24 dress. She has since dropped six dress sizes over three years and three more weddings . By the time she was a bridesmaid at a third wedding in September 2011, she had slimmed down to a size 18. When Suzanne was asked to be a bridesmaid for a fourth time at her best friend’s wedding, she had successfully slimmed down to a size 14. The 34-year-old from Alloa in the Central Lowlands of Scotland has now lost more than seven stone, going from 19st 4lbs (270lbs)  to 12st 3lbs (171lbs), and has gone down six dress sizes. Thanks to her weight loss she has won a slimming award - and was even accompanied to the awards ceremony by the four brides who were so instrumental in her weight loss. Suzanne said: ‘The worst moment was when I went shopping for that first bridesmaid's dress. ‘It was for my brother’s wedding in 2009 and I’d ordered a dress in a small size as I’d convinced myself that I was going to lose weight in time. But when the dress arrived I couldn’t get into it. ‘Thankfully my sister in law was fabulous about it and we found another dress that was ideal. But when I saw myself in the photos I could see how large I looked and I knew that I had to do something about my weight.’ After wedding number two, Suzanne decided to join her local Scottish Slimmers group and changed her eating habits to try and increase her weight loss . Suzanne, who then weighed 19st 4lbs (270lbs) and was a size 24, joined a gym and managed to lose two stone before one of her friends asked her to be a bridesmaid again. She said: ‘The bridal shops didn’t have any sample dresses in my size so I went along with the strapless style that the other bridesmaids had chosen. ‘I didn’t feel comfortable in the dress but I just got on with it.’ After wedding number two, Suzanne decided to join her local Scottish Slimmers group and changed her eating habits to try and increase her weight loss. She had a good reason to join as she had just been asked to be bridesmaid number three at another friend’s wedding in September 2011. Suzanne was asked to be bridesmaid number three at another friend’s wedding in September 2011 and wore a size 18 dress . She said: ‘This time I was determined to lose more weight before I fitted into my third bridesmaid’s dress. I had lost two stone for the second wedding, and I wanted to lose even more for wedding number three. ‘I decided to order a dress in a smaller size. I know it had proven to be a fiasco at my brother’s wedding but this time I was in a slimming club and knew that I had the support to lose the weight I needed to. Suzanne ditched her bad eating habits and instead ate healthily and managed to lose more weight. She said: ‘This time I bought a size 18 dress managed to lose another three stone (42lbs) before the wedding. 'The dress was absolutely beautiful and I felt much better about what I looked like .’ Suzanne has now lost a total of seven stone (98lbs) She had only just packed away the third bridesmaid’s dress when she was asked to a bridesmaid again, this time at her best friend Sarah’s wedding. Suzanne managed to lose even more weight by the time she slipped into her yellow bridesmaid dress for the wedding in April 2012 , weighing a much slimmer 13st (182lbs). She said: ‘It was a beautiful yellow dress. I’d ordered it in a size 16, and it was actually too big for me on the day. ‘I do feel as though I’ve had a massive achievement. 'When I look back at the bridesmaid dresses I’ve worn and how I’ve got smaller at each wedding, it feels amazing.’ She has since lost more weight and has now lost a total of seven stone (98lbs). Suzanne's weight loss has been recognised by an award from Scottish Slimmers and her four brides accompanied her to the awards ceremony, which took place in October . She added: ‘Not only do my clothes feel so much better but I feel so much healthier now too. 'I managed to climb Ben Nevis in a pair of size 12 trousers that I had borrowed from a friend, and that was a great feeling. ‘I’ve got so much more energy and I’ve also done a sky dive too - something that I would have never done before.’ And her weight loss has also been recognised by an award from Scottish Slimmers.

"Liverpool's weaknesses were exposed by an impressive West Ham on Saturday night, leaving manager Brendan Rodgers with plenty of problems to address. If they are to repeat last season's heroics and mount a sustained challenge for the Premier League title, the manager will need to make quick fixes. Here's five areas in which the Reds were shown up by the Hammers at Upton Park. Liverpool's 3-1 defeat at West Ham exposed a number of weaknesses that Brendan Rodgers needs to address . PANIC IN THE DEFENCE . Liverpool's back line were clearly not mentally prepared for the game and they were breached twice in the opening seven minutes. Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren looked in utter disarray right from the off, while goalkeeper Simon Mignolet got his positioning all wrong. Granted, it was only the third time Lovren and Skrtel have started together at the heart of the defence but they were lightweight and unable to deal with the power and physicality of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho. Liverpool's defence try to organise themselves as West Ham line up a set-piece . Martin Skrtel is beaten to the ball by West Ham's Enner Valencia . Rodgers did the right thing in removing Javi Manquillo for Mamadou Sakho after just 20 minutes and his three-man defence helped give Liverpool some impetus going forward. Yet when Lovren and Sakho clashed heads in the first-half, it neatly summed up the chaos. The defence lacked cohesion and leadership and Rodgers will be alarmed at how long it may take for his new-look rearguard to gel together. Dejan Lovren was left dazed after a clash of heads with Mamadou Sakho during the first-half . LACK OF CONCENTRATION . As alluded to, there were too many moments when Liverpool switched off and West Ham were swift in punishing them. Mignolet, who was at fault for the Ludogorets goals in the Champions League in midweek, was stood in the wrong place as Stewart Downing sent a high free-kick to the far post inside the first 90 seconds, allowing James Tomkins to head down and Winston Reid to tap in. Jordan Henderson and Skrtel were also culpable in the Hammers' opening goal as they failed to deal with the cross. For the second goal, six minutes later, Mignolet was exposed again when Sakho found the top corner with an audacious dink from the edge of the area. Simon Mignolet picks the ball out of his net after Sakho beat him for West Ham's second goal . Left-back Alberto Moreno was also guilty of not being alert enough to close the West Ham man down. During the second half, Skrtel miscontrolled a back pass and Sakho pinched the ball from him on the edge of the area. The Slovakian defender got away with that one but Mamadou Sakho wasn't so lucky two minutes from time when his weak header went straight to the feet of Downing. His perfect through ball to Morgan Amalfitano resulted in West Ham's third goal and made absolutely sure of victory. Rodgers is all-too-aware that mistakes like these will prove costly in the Premier League and especially in the Champions League. Mamadou Sakho is beaten to the ball by his namesake Diafra during the match at Upton Park . NO CONTROL IN MIDFIELD . Sam Allardyce sent his team out with intent and purpose and they quickly seized control of the midfield, a grip they didn't relinquish for the full 90 minutes. It is rare to see Steven Gerrard and Henderson have such poor games and Lucas wasn't a great deal better. Indeed, the Brazilian was replaced at half-time by Adam Lallana as Rodgers desperately tried to inject a bit more creativity. By contrast, the West Ham midfield were on top of their game. The bustling Chiekhou Kouyate was one of the stand-out performers in this match and of the Premier League afternoon. Brendan Rodgers issues instructions to his captain Steven Gerrard . Jordan Henderson comes under pressure from West Ham's Morgan Amalfitano . Allardyce has likened him to Patrick Vieira and his robust challenges certainly had Liverpool rattled. Alex Song revealed before the match that he used to train in a Gerrard shirt but there was certainly no deference for his idol as he patrolled the midfield along with Kouyate and Mark Noble. This is by no means the best midfield Liverpool will face this season, yet they still found themselves overpowered. Cheikhou Kouyate was dynamic in West Ham's midfield and a key part of the win . VIDEO We dominated Liverpool - Allardyce . WHERE ARE THE GOALS COMING FROM? Fabio Borini vowed to stay at Anfield and fight for his place but he didn't put forward a very convincing argument here. The striker was bombarded with abusive tweets after a limp performance in which he failed to provide a cutting edge to Liverpool's attack. Rodgers opted for the Italian ahead of Rickie Lambert and handed him a first start of the season but West Ham's defence weren't unduly troubled. Fabio Borini rues a missed chance on a disappointing afternoon for the striker . His strike partner Mario Balotelli played him in with a brilliant cross-field ball on 53 minutes but Borini opted to shoot, straight at goalkeeper Adrian, rather than pulling the ball back to better-placed colleagues. Rodgers will be desperate to get Daniel Sturridge fit and firing as soon as possible given the shortcomings of the alternatives. IS BALOTELLI STILL A LIABILITY? There has been a lot of talk from both Rodgers that Balotelli is a reformed character who has consigned his immature antics to history. But the hotheaded Italian flared up in the second half when he went head-to-head with West Ham's Adrian. The keeper foolishly kicked out at Balotelli after a heavy tackle but the striker's reaction was disappointing to see. Both were fortunate to get away with a caution. Balotelli will score plenty of goals for Liverpool but that nagging doubt remains that he might be a liability with that aggression never far away.

Seven members of his family have fallen to their death, most recently Nik’s great-grandfather Karl during a 1978 walk in Puerto Rico. That fear of possible death is what brings in the audiences however, says Wallenda. 'The public is fascinated with a guy on TV that could die at any second.' He quickly added, 'Now, do they wanna see me die? I don’t think so.'","Nik Wallenda has announced that his latest tightrope feat will involve him crossing the Chicago River 50 stories in the air .

"Click here for all the heat maps and stats from the big clash at the Emirates . Danny Welbeck will no doubt have taken to the Emirates pitch on Saturday with ideas of making former boss Louis van Gaal eat his words as the young striker made his Arsenal debut against Manchester City. The Dutch boss allowed the English striker to leave Old Trafford for £16million on transfer deadline day before labelling Welbeck as not up to United's 'standard' but the Gunners faithful will disagree after Saturday's performance. The 23-year-old striker may not have been able to find the net, but his energy and movement helped Arsenal to a 2-2 draw in north London. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger assess Danny Welbeck's Arsenal debut . Danny Welbeck impressed during his Arsenal debut as the Gunners took on Manchester City . Danny Welbeck should have given Arsenal the lead with this first half chance . Welbeck began brightly, working the channels and managing to keep both Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis busy during the early stages. The game was barely 10 minutes old before Welbeck ran off the shoulder of Demichelis and haired down on Joe Hart's goal with a debut goal in his sights. As 60,000 Arsenal fans jumped to their feet in anticipation, Welbeck sent a deft chip over Hart's head and agonosingly onto the City post. Danny Welbeck worked hard for Arsenal as he led the line for Arsene Wenger's side . Arsenal fans join Danny Welbeck with their head in their hands after the striker's miss . Danny Welbeck's seemed to enjoy being allowed to play through the middle for Arsenal . It would have been a memorable opener and the Arsenal fans applauded, but they will all have been wishing the former United striker just put his foot through the ball. It's a trait that seemed to anger United legend Paul Scholes, who couldn't understand why Welbeck went for such a showboat finish. Scholes told BT Sport: 'When the big chance comes he didn't take it. I think it's to do with ruthlessness . ‘It's the part of the game he needs to improve. He's not a Ruud Van Nistelrooy he's not an Andy Cole they would have put them away no doubt. He [Ian Wright] would have put that away.’ Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey celebrate after Jack Wilshere levelled the score at the Emirates . However, Welbeck didn't let the first half miss play on his mind as he covered ground and made space for the onrushing Arsenal midfield. The former Sunderland loanee looked to be thriving in his favoured role and it was his tackle on City defender Vincent Kompany that eventually led to Wilshere's equalising goal. Welbeck did brilliantly to rob Kompany of the ball before releasing allowing the Gunners counter-attack which culminated in a brilliant Wilshere leveller. The former Manchester United striker was unlucky not to open his Arsenal account . Shortly afterwards as Arsenal attacked down the right, Welbeck's slight nudge on Kompany inside the City penalty area put the big Belgian off his stride which caused him to miss-time his header and give Wilshere the ball. Wislhere headed to the back into the City box and former Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez needed little invitation to strike towards goal and put Arsenal into a 2-1 lead after 74 minutes. With the score at 2-2, Arsene Wenger brought Welbeck off after 87 minutes to a standing ovation from the Gunners faithful. He may not have hit Van Gaal's high 'standard' just yet, but seemingly already settled in an Arsenal shirt, that 'standard' doesn't seem too far away.

"Scroll down for video . Ross Hadley is the envy of all his friends after being put in charge of fitness for the Miss World contest. Ross, 35, from London has been given the task of measuring just how fit all 126 Miss World contestants really are. The father-of-two only landed his job as director of leisure at the Marriott County Hall in Westminster, London, eight months ago, but now his place of work is home to the entire Miss World cortege ahead of the pageant on December 14. Ross Hadley is the envy of all his friends being put in charge of fitness for the Miss World contest. He is pictured with (from left to right) Miss Wales Alice Ford, 21, a molecular biology student from Cardiff, Miss Northern Ireland Rebekah Shirley, 19, a media student from Belfast, Miss Ireland Jessica Hayes, 21, a business student from Cork, Miss Scotland Ellie McKeating, 20, a film and media student from Stirling, and Miss England Carina Tyrell, 24, a senior student doctor from Cambridge . Miss USA: Elizabeth Safrit, formerly Miss Cabarrus County, North Carolina, is representing the United States at the Miss World contest . He said: ‘I’d love to use the line, it’s a tough job, but somebody has to do it, but I’d be lying as it probably is the best job in the world. ‘I’ve been a fitness trainer since 1999 and never realised when I started out that my diploma in fitness training and sports therapy would lead to anything like this. ‘The contestants are all stunning and very glamorous, but they range in fitness from fairly unfit to spectacularly fit. ‘I had to supervise the tests and mark them and a few girls literally collapsed with exhaustion afterwards. Ross only landed his job as director of leisure at the Marriott County Hall in Westminster, London, eight months ago . ‘You could tell some of the girls have never exercised. Some didn’t know how to use the rowing machine. ‘We were pushing it to the max with their fitness assessment and some were not really ready for that.' Ross continued: ‘The fittest of them all was 22-year-old Miss South Africa, who is called Rolene Strauss – she got full marks in every discipline and scored 20. She was absolutely stunning with dark hair and trained very hard. ‘Miss England Carina scored 16 and the other home nations girls were all pretty fit as well. ‘They all had to do four different fitness tests in a period of 10 to 11 minutes. ‘We started with the 500 metre row in the quickest time, then full body weight squats and then as many press ups as they could manage in a minute. ‘We ended with full burpees that are a mix of press-up, squats and pulling yourself up and it was as many of those in a minute as possible.’ Unsurprisingly, Ross's friends from five-a-side football and former workmates have all been asking if he needs any help with the job while the contestants are in town. He said: ‘I was quite surprised at the level of interest it attracted with people contacting me out of the blue asking if I needed a hand – as well as my mates from five-a-side I’ve had my uncles asking questions. ‘I was quite surprised by some of their performances and a few had booked personal trainers ahead of this, so were taking it very seriously.' Ross might be surrounded by beauty pageant contestants every day at work, but the trainer is adamant that he really only has eyes for his wife Jamie, 28, and their daughters – Molly, six, and Bella, three. He said: 'I know my wife understands it’s all part of the job.’ He continued: 'Others had no idea how to use a rowing machine, so had clearly never seen the inside of a gym. ‘All the guys will have their own view on who is the fittest – but my job is to assess who is truly fit and there was a stand out winner on that front.’ Ross might be surrounded by beauty pageant contestants every day at work, but the trainer is adamant that he really only has eyes for his wife Jamie, 28, and their daughters – Molly, six, and Bella, three.

"Hull City owner Assem Allam has offered to give the club away for nothing if his last-ditch bid to rebrand their traditional identity fails. During a 45-minute briefing at the KC Stadium, arranged of his own volition to make plain his future intentions, the 75-year-old also pledged to deliver Champions League qualification if his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport is successful. Since saving Hull from a financial abyss in November 2010, the Egyptian-born, locally raised businessman has ploughed £72million of his personal wealth into transforming them from a mid-ranking Championship team into FA Cup finalists and Europa League participants. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Assem Allam: If someone wants to buy Hull City - Sold! Assem Allam has announced Hull City Football Club is up for sale and has been for more than five months . There had been growing rumours Assem Allam wanted to sell Hull City and the owner confirmed the news . But, having been denied the chance to drop City from their traditional name to rename them as Hull Tigers by the FA five months ago, Allam is prepared to write off his investment. ‘I’m out means I’m out. I will give it away if the appeal fails and no buyer is found. My message is that if you don’t like Hull Tigers I go,’ Allam confirmed. When the Allam family took over four years ago, the strategic plan included playing top-flight football this season, a feat that was achieved 12 months ahead of schedule. Allam’s legal team are understood to have been working on the CAS appeal over the summer and it is expected to take up to three months to reach its conclusion. ‘Nobody works forever. But I wanted to be here until I achieved my ambition of being in the top four. You will say that it’s a bit wide, a bit exaggerating,’ Allam said. ‘No, because if I told you three years ago there would be Premier League and FA Cup final, and all this, you would have thought it was a joke. Now I am saying I want to be top four. In a couple of years’ time you will find it’s not a joke, it’s a possibility — if I am still here.’ Allam’s frustration over the restriction on Hull’s global branding — he revealed that the club’s current shirt sponsorship with 12Bet is £1m a year less than had been agreed with another unnamed Far East company before April’s FA ruling kiboshed it — follows failure to secure the freehold for the ground from Hull City Council, blocking plans to build a hotel and house other commercial facilities on site. ‘There is a difference between Championship, League One, League Two and Premier League,’ Allam said. Hull City is for sale and has been for five months after Assem Allam announced the rumours were true . The name change was turned down on April 9 and Assem Allam put the club up for sale 24 hours later . ‘Championship and below you are a local club. Gate receipts represent 60 per cent of total income. When you are Premier League you are no longer local, you are global. ‘So you act global, you don’t act local. At the moment, because we have no other income, I pay, as evidence of my commitment to the local community, but there is a limit and I have gone past that limit. ‘We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and playing name be blocked. ‘As a consequence of the FA’s decision on April 9, I announced, on April 10 that Hull City is for sale. I am using the wording Hull City now to show respect to the FA’s decision. This is in accordance with my decision 10 months ago that I would walk away within 24 hours. Assem Allam says Steve Bruce can have no sway over his decision because there's nothing to decide . Hull City Football Club was put up for sale less than 24 hours after the name Hull Tigers was denied . ‘In actual fact it was 22 hours. When I say something I mean it. I don’t call bluffs. We have also begun the appeal against the FA decision via arbitration and we are hopeful of a positive outcome or that the FA reconsider their decision. ‘Until the conclusion of the appeal or the sale, whichever comes first, we will remain fully committed to the club, evidenced by the latest remarkable additions to our already very good team.’ Allam was referring to Hull’s £38.5m outlay on signings since the end of last season, including the record £10m recruitment of Palermo’s Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez, who could make his debut against West Ham next Monday.","The Football Association blocked name change to Hull Tigers on April 9 and owner Assem Allam put club up for sale less than 24 hours later .

"Almost three weeks after the summer transfer window closed, the Premier League table is showing significant signs that clubs do not need to be big net spenders to improve their teams. Or net spenders at all, in fact. Of the six lowest net spenders among the 20 clubs during the window, it is extraordinary to note that five them are currently sitting within the top six places in the table. The six lowest net spenders were: Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, who made respective net profits of £30.7m, £6.5m and £0.8m from their summer trading, and Stoke, Swansea and Aston Villa, who respectively had net spend of just £0.4m, £1.3m and £5.9m. Chelsea bought Diego Costa for £32m but made a net profit and are top of the Premier League . Tottenham were another side to make a net profit in a summer in which they signed defender Eric Dier . The Premier League's net spenders table, with Southampton at the top and Manchester United at the bottom . These are early days in the season, with just four games played in the League so far. But net earners Chelsea are top with a 100 per cent cent record, followed by unbeaten Villa, then Swansea and Southampton in the Champions League berths, with Tottenham in sixth. The Premier League table shows five of the most prudent spenders in the early top six . This is not to say that massive net spending won’t pay dividends in time. Manchester United spent a net sum of £122m on players including Argentinian star Angel di Maria, a British record buy at £60m. Louis van Gaal’s new-look side already look a different proposition after his spree. Arsenal, with £46.4m net spend, are also in the top 10 in the table and strongly fancied to finish in the top four yet again, while Liverpool, Everton and Manchester City (with respective net spend of £35.7m, £32.8m and £32m) all aspire to Champions League football next season, too. Yet the early lesson from the window is it’s not how much cash you can splash that matters, but how it is spent. Chelsea offloaded David Luiz and Romelu Lukaku for large sums, as well as Demba Ba and Patrick van Aanholt but crucial was the reinvestment in Diego Costa (top scorer in the league so far with seven goals in four games), Cesc Fabregas and Loic Remy among others. Southampton’s sale of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert prompted suggestions of meltdown and relegation. But among their replacements, Graziano Pelle is joint second-highest scorer in the league this season, Fraser Forster is one of the most impressive early-season goalkeepers and Dusan Tadic is showing signs he could excel as an orchestrator in place of Lallana. And Southampton made more than £30m profit. Manchester United are bottom of the net spend table - which is unsurprising given that they spent more than £150m in the summer, including the £60m British record signing of Angel di Maria . Alexis Sanchez was Arsenal's big buy of the summer and contributed to their net loss . Liverpool spent £16m on Mario Balotelli as they splurged following the sale of Luis Suarez . Swansea under Garry Monk are also performing above expectation, after a net spend of £1.3m, or equivalent to less than one quarter of Radamel Falcao’s one-year loan fee at Manchester United. That £1.3m is also approximately one-tenth of what United will spend on the Colombia star’s wages alone this season. Tottenham’s trading left them in the profit, meanwhile, something Mauricio Pochettino may not have envisaged when he jumped ship from Southampton. Then again his remit is to make Spurs more than the sum of their parts, not spend a load of money. The same is true at Villa, where a modest net outlay has been no hindrance to a good start, so far.","Southampton top of net spenders table and fourth in Premier League .
Chelsea, surprisingly, made a profit in summer and top the League .

"These days, I am rarely surprised when, after a lecture or book signing, someone will try to talk to me about their addiction to porn and ask where he or she can get help. As an author and feminist social commentator, I often discuss my work at events and meet a wide spectrum of people who talk to me about sex, relationships and, more increasingly, the impact of pornography on their lives. There is no stereotype of what this person will look like. A man in his 60s has asked me if I think his porn addiction accounts for his current impotence. New survey: A major study has revealed that British couples are having about 20% less sex than they did just ten years ago . A lovely young mother of three boys asked sadly how her husband, in an otherwise happy, sexually fulfilled marriage, became 'lost to porn' to the point that she had to leave him. She now wonders how to  protect her sons. A bright, male college student confessed that he is worried about what he calls 'the kink spiral' - the term he uses to describe feeling trapped by his need to see more and more extreme porn to get aroused. Couples in their late teens tell me no one they know can have sex without porn playing on a screen. A guidance counsellor at a private school asks where he can find help for his students - many of whom are so addicted to online porn that the obsession is affecting their schoolwork and social development. Recently, a major British study, the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, which questioned more than 15,000 people aged  16 to 74, showed couples are having about  20 per cent less sex per month than they did just ten years ago. New discoveries: Wolf's new book Vagina: A New Biography discusses how neuroscience shows how pornography negatively affects both sex and relationships . As someone who has been researching in this field for over 20 years, I believe we must take seriously the rise of pornography. New research shows it is having a detrimental effect on men's and women's sexual responses  and harming relationships as a consequence. My latest book, Vagina: A New Biography, about female sexual desire, has a chapter on new discoveries in neuroscience that show how pornography negatively affects both sex and relationships. Popular culture is reflecting this trend: the new film Don Jon centres on porn addiction. The hero is sleeping with Scarlett Johansson but sneaks off to watch porn, since he says nothing with a real woman (even Johansson!) is as good. Meanwhile, sex scenes in mainstream movies are getting more violent. In The Kids Are All Right, I was startled to see Julianne Moore's character start slapping her partner's face as he neared orgasm. Young women tell me that hair-pulling, and even pressure around the neck at orgasm, are normal parts of courtship sex these days. These are 'porn cliches', as one young woman put it. I am not surprised by these shifts because  we all know about the pornification of society. I believe more voices would be speaking out if the new research on this issue were better understood. What we're not being told - and this is a view which many scientists now confirm, but too few ordinary people understand - is that porn use poses health problems. Mine is not a moral position. I think adults should be able see whatever they want in the privacy of their own homes (if the images are not based on a crime or any cruelty being committed). Yet the neuroscience of porn addiction is clear: watching porn causes sharp spikes in the activation of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain, which makes people feel focused, confident and good. The trouble is that this  short-term neurological arousal has long-term consequences. Firstly, it can cause desensitisation to the same erotic stimuli that turned you on recently and, over the longer term, it can cause a greater likelihood of sexual dysfunction. The user then craves more and more extreme pornography - violence and taboo images activate the autonomic nervous system, which is involved with arousal -  in order to reach that same level  of excitement. This acclimatisation and desensitisation explains why images that were seen as fetishistic, taboo or violent ten years ago are now mainstream fare on porn sites. A second effect, confirmed with men and anecdotal with women, is trouble reaching orgasm. Doctors are now reporting an epidemic of healthy young and middle-aged men, with no disease or psychological issue that would otherwise explain their difficulties, who are having sexual problems such as impotence or delayed ejaculation due to this desensitisation. A final problem related to desensitisation is that men start to see their own partners as less attractive, and less able to arouse them by ordinary sexual behaviour. And, of course, one woman can't provide the ever-changing novelty, that constantly renewed boost to the brain that porn artificially delivers by a mouse click of the mouse. There are other ways porn use can negatively affect female arousal. If a woman feels uneasy about her partner's use of porn the stress of her resentment and anger can affect her own ability to become aroused. If you understand the neuroscience of female arousal, women need to have their autonomic nervous systems (heart rate, breathing, blood circulation) highly activated to get turned on. Emotions such as stress,anger, a sense of threat and  resentment can function like throwing a bucket of freezing water on the female system. Detrimental: Porn does not teach men sexual skills that are useful in arousing women . I have also done a lot of research into the fact that sex portrayed in most porn does not teach men, especially young men, sexual skills that are useful in arousing women. As Dr Jim Pfaus, a pioneer in the field of the science of sexual behaviour from Canada's Concordia University, puts it, porn use can take an emotional toll on relationships because men who use it are 'neurologically bonding' not with their partners, but with the porn. Relationship expert and couples' counsellor Michael Kallenbach says: 'Couples are far more aware of porn now than they've ever  been. With everyone owning iPhones and tablets and being constantly bombarded with sexy ads and imagery, porn is leaking into our lives and affecting  our relationships. 'When one partner watches surreptitiously, it's a very dangerous avenue to go down. Their imagination, and relationship, will be put at the mercy of fantasy. This often results in affairs.' A recent University of Sydney study, in which two professors surveyed more than 800 men, found that excessive porn consumption was reported by almost half the respondents (85 per cent of whom were married or in a relationship), and was harming their professional success and relationships. The numbers were dramatic: 47  per cent of the male subjects watched between 30 minutes to three hours of porn per day, one in three said it harmed their work efforts, and one in five would rather watch porn than have sex with their partners. I can understand why the porn industry is keen to keep the addictive nature of its products quiet and promote the libertarian notion that there are no consequences. It is a global industry that wishes to turn men, and increasingly women, into addicts for financial reasons. The situation very much resembles the marketing of cigarettes without health warnings in the Sixties. So why isn't government-mandated disclosure of the risks obligatory, as it is now with cigarettes? The answer is our politicians don't yet fully understand the damage that is being done. Less sexually liberated: Porn is taking over our thought processes and corroding our ability to sustain meaningful relationships . Recently, the Daily Mail won a victory whereby the Government agreed that all households should opt in if they want to be able to view porn on the internet. I believe that with good health information, people can make more informed choices about how, when, and if they want to use porn, and even better choices about what kind of imagery they might seek out or avoid. Those who wish to end their addiction - like ending any addiction - can do so with effort. Men who have done so - that is for whom we have data - report a great sense of regaining psychological control, and heightened arousal with their wives or girlfriends. Mostly they are relieved not to be at the mercy of something that many of those who write to me feel they need - but don't especially like. Are we 'sexually liberated' if porn is taking over our thought processes and corroding our ability to sustain meaningful relationships? I think we are less sexually free. A powerful industry is manipulating us - and ruthlessly exploiting some hard-wiring in the male brain - to turn us more and more into sexual and emotional robots, only capable of achieving sexual fullfilment in a room with a computer, alone.","Couples are having 20% less sex than they did just ten years ago .

"A luxurious New York City building is prohibiting its rent-controlled tenants from enjoying their terrace so market rate-paying residents — who have smaller balconies — don't get jealous, claims a new report. The New York Post reports that the Q41 building, a new tower in Queens with stunning views of Manhattan, has installed a 6-foot high wire barrier to stop people who don't pay market rate from entering its huge balcony. Two such tenants are Erin McFadzen and her live-in boyfriend Erik Clancy, who picked their rent-stabilized, sixth-floor pad because of its wrap-around terrace. They checked out the apartment in March when there was no fence — and were outraged to see the barricade there on moving day in July. Residents say the Q41 tower in New York City is fencing in tenants in rent-controlled apartments so they don't get access to the building's huge balcony — and make people paying market-rate jealous . Erin McFadzen and her boyfriend Erik Clancy say they can't get to the terrace due to a 6-foot wire fence . 'We’re caged in,' McFadzen, who pays $2,186 for her two-bedroom place, told the Post. 'Every time someone comes over, I have to explain why the fence is there — and tell them we’re rent stabilized, like it’s a badge I have to wear.' A similar balcony on a market-rate apartment going for $3,692 per month has no wiring, claims the report. Clancy told the Post he couldn't imagine a prospective market-rate tenant being told: 'You get this beautiful view of Manhattan behind a giant metal fence.' At least eight units are fenced in, the Post reported. One terrace has been rendered useless with wiring that leaves just a couple of feet of room. The 117-unit building's developer, Queensboro Development,  told the couple the fence was necessary so window washers could set up before clean up, according to the Post. 'It has come to our clients’ attention that you are exceeding your area of usage,' the building's attorney, William Slochowsky, wrote the couple on Oct. 28, according to the Post. But a former super told McFadzen and Clancy 'the fence is there to stay' because of market-rate residents with tiny balconies, the newspaper reported. The 17-story Q41 building, at 23-10 41st Avenue in Long Island City, had been stalled until the city pumped $7.6 million in subsidies, according to the Post. Calls to Queensboro Development went unanswered, the newspaper reported. This is not the first building in New York City to offer separate amenities for rent-controlled and market-rate tenants. Developer Extell has drawn much criticism for its plan to build a posh tower on Manhattan's Upper West Side using massive tax breaks —  but then make its affordable-housing tenants use a different entrance from high-paying residents . The building's 'poor door' wouldn't be its only difference: under its original plan, some of the higher-paying residents would also have access to different amenities. Erin McFadzen claims the fence is there so tenants with smaller balconies and who pay market-rate don't get jealous of the amenity she gets for a lower price . Plans for the luxury skyscraper at 1 West End Ave. were slightly altered in August: the building still has separate entrances, but all residents will now have access to such building amenities as a courtyard and river-view roof deck . The affordable segment's lobby will also be stylishly appointed and set facing a park, the developer claims. Some residents and officials still see the divisions as discriminatory. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration has said it aims to bar separate-door schemes.","Rent-controlled tenants say they were lured to the luxury tower by a wrap-around balcony but were shocked to discover a 6-foot fence during move in .

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has confirmed he was given a £16,400 watch by the Brazilian FA during the World Cup but had no idea of its value and will return the gift. The heads of all 32 qualifying countries and FIFA's executive committee were given the Swiss watches, but FIFA's ethics committee said that accepting such valuable gifts contravenes their rules. The committee has demanded that all the watches be returned by October 24 otherwise it will launch disciplinary proceedings. FA chairman Greg Dyke is set to return a £16,400 watch given to him during the World Cup . Dyke claims he didn't know the value of the watch . A luxury Parmigiani watch was given to representatives from all 32 countries at the World Cup . The watch that has caused the controversy is worth £16,400 and is made by the luxury watchmaker Parmigiani Fleurier. With each watch taking upwards of 400 hours to make by hand with precious metals and stones, the timepieces are extremely-highly sought-after and are very expensive. The watch given to Dyke is worth £16,400, but some Parmigiani watches - for example the Bugatti 370 model - cost £122,000 each. Approximately £1million of Parmigiani watches were handed out in 65 gift bags by the Brazilian football federation to 32 representatives from World Cup competing countries, FIFA executive members and South American officials at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo in June. Dyke said the watch was inside a bag and he had intended to give it to charity along with other items. He said in a statement: 'During the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo, a bag with a watch inside was left in my hotel room by the Brazilian FA. I had no idea of the value and it has been left untouched in my office since returning to England. 'We are already taking steps to return the bag and its contents - which are still in their original packaging. 'I welcome FIFA's investigation on the matter, including their intention to donate the items to good causes back in Brazil. 'The fact that gifts of great value are being handed out randomly and often with the recipient unaware shows up a culture in need of change. 'I had actually set the bag aside in my box of items to donate to charity."" The watches were manufactured by Parmigiani, complete with alligator skin straps, and were given to the 32 association chiefs, 28 FIFA executive committee members, and five other members of South American associations. Sepp Blatter would have been on the list of recipients but hasn't commented on what happened to his watch . UEFA president Michel Platini is set to return his 'gift' A statement from FIFA's ethics committee said: 'The CBF should not have offered the watches, and those who received gift bags should have promptly checked whether the items inside were appropriate and, upon discovering the watch, either returned it or... reported the matter to the investigatory chamber. 'The FIFA code of ethics plainly prohibits such gifts. Football officials may not offer or accept gifts that have more than 'symbolic or trivial value'. 'If in doubt, gifts shall not be offered or accepted. Football officials are expected to be aware of the importance of their duties and concomitant obligations and responsibilities. 'In an effort to resolve this matter expeditiously, the investigatory chamber will not pursue further formal ethics proceedings in this matter against officials who submit the Parmigiani watch they received from CBF to the secretariat of the investigatory chamber by no later than October 24, 2014.' British FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce claims he was unaware the gift bag even contained a watch until he was contacted by the media . It is understood UEFA president Michel Platini is also to return the watch given to him, which is also still in its original box, while Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said he was unaware the gift bag had even contained a watch until he was contacted by media this week. FIFA president Sepp Blatter would also have been on the list of recipients but there was no response from the world governing body about what happened to that watch. The watches will then be donated to independent non-profit organisations 'committed to corporate social responsibility projects in Brazil', said the FIFA ethics committee statement. Several senior FIFA officials did report the watches to the ethics committee and the CBF confirmed it had distributed 65 gift bags, each containing a Parmigiani watch. The CBF said it had paid 8,750 US dollars for each watch but that the ethics committee had obtained an independent valuation of 25,000 Swiss francs (£16,400).","FA chairman will return a watch given to him by his Brazilian counterpart during this summer's tournament .

"Louis van Gaal is expected to take Manchester United back into the top three in the Premier League this season — and he will have to do it without any major signings in January. The target was revealed by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward as he detailed the club’s accounts for last season and made forecasts for this campaign. Figures published show United had record income of £433.2million for the 2013-14 season, but that is expected to plunge to £395m because the club are not in the Champions League, from which they made about £55m last season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United won't win title - Robson . More deals: Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has admitted Manchester United could spend in January . Big money: United signed Angel di Maria from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £60million . All change: Holland international Daley Blind was part of United's £150m summer recruitment drive . Influence: United will consider any requests from Louis van Gaal for more new players in January . £433.2m United’s income for the 2013-14 season (the year to June 30, 2014), made up of £108.1m matchday income (tickets, pies etc), £135.8m broadcasting (TV cash) and £189.3m commercial income (sponsorship, kit deals etc) 10% The amount United expect their income to FALL in 2014-15, to around £395m. This is mainly because of a £55m black hole caused by United not being in the Champions League. Last year they earned £36m in prize money and £19m from five CL home games. £5.2m Compensation pay-offs made to former manager David Moyes and to ‘certain members of the coaching staff’ who were axed last season. £214.8m United’s total wage bill in 2013-14, £34.3m more than the previous season, a whopping 19 per cent rise. And that is before this summer’s transfer spree. £341.8m Gross debt still sitting on the books as a result of the Glazers’ takeover in 2005. This was down 12.2 per cent year on year, from £389.2m, but United spent £27.4m on interest and debt-related payments in 2013-14. Getting back into Europe is an urgent priority for United and Woodward confirmed Van Gaal’s target when he said: ‘We assume third in our budgets.’ Another consequence of David Moyes’ miserable year in charge was £5.2m in ‘exceptional costs’, most of which represented compensation payments to the former manager and his staff. Woodward gave the strongest indication yet that there will not be a further splurge in January to follow the £153.1m spent on Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao. ‘We don’t intend to significantly increase capital expenditure [by buying players] in January,’ he said during a conference call aimed at investors in the 10 per cent of the club that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. ‘We will continue to monitor in association with Louis his view of the squad and which areas we want to strengthen and which areas we want to sell. I wouldn’t have expectations for January but if there is a willingness from the manager, we will engage with him and if there is an opportunity, we will try and take that as we did last January.’ Woodward said the club was ‘very proud’ of the record income figures and added: ‘With Louis van Gaal at the helm as manager, and the recent signing of some of the world’s leading players to further strengthen our squad, we are very excited about the future and believe it’s the start of a new chapter in the club’s history. ‘Louis’ footballing philosophy fits very well with Manchester United and he has an impressive track record of success throughout his career, winning league titles with every club he has managed.’ New boy: United splashed out a £6million loan fee to bring Radamel Falcao to Old Trafford on loan . Same again? Woodward admitted that United could spend in January, as they did to sign Juan Mata (right) Rebuilding job: Van Gaal has assembled a new-look squad at Old Trafford but may want to spend more . VIDEO United won't win title - Robson . One potentially worrying figure for United was their wage bill of £214.8m, up 19 per cent on the previous year. United say salaries will drop in 2014-15 because there will be no Champions League bonuses, though they are not expected to fall by much. United’s debts have fallen 12.2 per cent year-on-year but still stand at £341.8m — all a result of the Glazer family’s leveraged takeover in 2005. United spent £27.4m serving the debt in 2013-14, approximately the price of Luke Shaw. Critics of the Glazer family regularly cite the amounts spent on debt financing — now well over £500m — that might have been used to bring in more big-name players. Compensation: It cost United £5.2m to sack David Moyes and his coaching staff last season . But the debt in itself does not endanger United’s future. They remain by a considerable margin England’s richest club by income. In global terms, only Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are at their level of half a billion euros of income or more per year. The club’s revenue last season was split between match day income of £108.1m — effectively from ticket sales, pies, pints and programmes — at an average of £3.5m per game at Old Trafford; £189.3m from sponsorship, kit deals and other commercial partnerships; and broadcasting income of £135.8m. Match day income is likely to remain stable. The other two streams are growing, respectively up 24.1 per cent (commercial) and 33 per cent (TV) year-on-year and are likely to increase significantly in the medium term. The recently announced kit deal with adidas is worth £75m per year for 10 years from 2015-16, £50m more every year than the expiring Nike deal. They can expect to pocket TV money of between £90m and £100m from the Premier League this season and next. That is likely to go up under the TV rights deals for 2016-19, which are due to be negotiated soon. Champions League income for British clubs will also soar from next season because of BT Sport’s near £1bn deal to show all European football from 2015-16. Last season’s £36m UEFA cash for United could feasibly be double that or more by next season — as long as they are back at Europe’s top table.","Manager Louis van Gaal will be allowed to recommend new players despite spending £150million on talent over the summer .

"Sportsmail has teamed up with Icons.com to offer one lucky reader the chance to win a signed Cristiano Ronaldo Real Madrid shirt and a photo of the Portuguese star . Cristiano Ronaldo’s multi-million pound return to Old Trafford at the end of this season is a scenario that potentially suits everyone: Real Madrid get a large part of their £80million outlay on the player they bought in 2009 back; Ronaldo gets to be the returning hero; and the Glazers get to put right one of their biggest regrets as Manchester United owners – letting their prize asset leave the club. What none of the parties involved will do just now, is admit it’s a possibility. Real Madrid have lost two of their opening three games of the season and the president, Florentino Perez, is under pressure – the last message he needs to be sending out is that at the end of the campaign he will sell a player who after just five seasons already has club legend Raul’s all-time top goalscorer record in his sights. Ronaldo likewise will not want to be seen to be the bad guy agitating for a move. He is happy in the Spanish capital playing for a manager he likes and with a group of players whose company he enjoys. Angel di Maria was a friend but best pal Fabio Coentrao is still at the club and Gareth Bale is also now part of the former United man’s inner circle. Cristiano Ronaldo shows off his skills as Real Madrid train while Pepe (left) and Karim Benzema watch on . Ronaldo is reportedly unhappy with life at Real Madrid and is considering quitting the club . Gareth Bale (second right) and Fabio Coentrao (right) watch on as Cristiano Ronaldo shows off his footwork . Ronaldo and his Real Madrid team-mates are preparing to face Basle in the Champions League . Ronaldo is reported to be unhappy with Real Madrid's decision to sell Angel di Maria to Manchester United . Real Madrid (2009- ) Appearances: 251 Goals: 256 . Major honours: 1 LA Liga, 1 Champions League, 1 UEFA Super Cup, 2 Copa Del Reys . Manchester United (2003- 2009) Appearances: 292 Goals: 118 . Major honours: 3 Premier League titles, 1 Champions League, 1 FIFA Club World Cup, 1 FA Cup, 2 League Cups . But still, in spite of that contentment in Spain, there is a doubt. Real remain an instable club – perhaps the only club in the world that would respond to winning the Champions League by selling two of its best players. The summer transfer activity did not entirely please Ronaldo and he made sure people knew it. 'If I was in charge I would have done things differently,’ he said. That was a slap around the face for a president who just a year earlier had made Ronaldo the highest paid player in the club’s history. Perez said publicly several days later that he in no way saw it as a show of dissent but there was really no other way to see it and the quote will come back to haunt both men if the season does not go well for Real Madrid. Doing his best to pour a little gasoline over the smoldering flames was former Real president Ramon Calderon on Monday, when he said he believed a Ronaldo return to Old Trafford was possible. Ronaldo enjoyed a glittering six-year spell with Manchester United and could return to Old Trafford . Ronaldo is still considered a hero at Manchester United - five years after he left the club . Ronaldo won the Champions League with Manchester United on a rainy night in Moscow in 2008 . ‘My impression is he is fed up with the policy of the current president,’ said Calderon of his sworn enemy Perez. ‘When he came to Real Madrid with [Arjen] Robben he thought he would be a good colleague for him in the team but then he was sold. ‘[Gonzalo] Higuain was sold and he didn’t like that. Last year he thought it was a mistake to let [Mesut] Ozil leave and the last straw was selling Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria this summer,’ he went on. Some of Calderon’s comments are fanciful. Ronaldo was not disappointed that Robben was sold in 2009, he was too busy being delighted about taking his place in the team. And any disappointment at Ozil leaving last year soon evaporated as Bale came in and helped Ronaldo win another European Cup. Neither was he particularly close to Alonso to be too fussed by his departure but after his years spent in the secure bosom of Old Trafford where Sir Alex Ferguson built and rebuilt his squad with care, he has been somewhat dismayed by the ripping apart of last season’s European champions. Ronaldo could link up with old friend Di Maria once more if he returned to Manchester United . Ronaldo felt Real Madrid should have signed Radamel Falcao, who also signed on loan for Manchester United . Ronaldo would be reunited with old friend and team-mate Wayne Rooney if returned to Man United . He also shares an agent – Jorge Mendes – with Radamel Falcao, who he feels should have been signed in the summer, and Di Maria who he would have liked to have seen stay. He would be reunited with both at Old Trafford if he returns, providing Falcao is kept on beyond his initial season-long loan deal. That might be another card that United can play at the end of this season. They might also remind Ronaldo that United fans have never stopped singing his name. At Real Madrid he is now the adored talisman he feels he always should have been but he has had to fight hard for the adulation and the jeers and whistles for Iker Casillas at the weekend will have reminded him that this club does not always appreciate its legends. The Real keeper has been at the club for 15 years but that has not stopped the boo-boys demanding he be dropped. There would be hero worship at Old Trafford, a reunion with Di Maria and with Rooney and if Perez can get his money back on Ronaldo and swoop for several stars – it will take a least two huge new signings to appease the fans if Ronaldo is sold – then maybe, just maybe it can happen. For now, however, everyone at Real Madrid will go on pretending it is out of the question. Too much is at stake for them to say anything else. I love Manchester. Everyone knows that — I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart. I left many good friends there, the supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day. I am happy here in Real Madrid and have four more years, but in the future you never know because they treated me unbelievably there. Cristiano Ronaldo opens up in an interview with the Daily Mail (2014) I loved it there, I was 18 years old, I win everything there, the people treat me like a god there so I appreciate and the future nobody know. It’s crazy that they still sing my name. I’ll not forget it so I appreciate it a lot. I love Manchester, to be back, I never know, you never know, football you never know. Of course I’m happy at Real Madrid. It’s my home, it’s my club but Manchester treat me unbelievable so we never know. Ronaldo in an interview with MUTV (2014) I did think about United. They are still in my heart. It is a club where I played for six years and I love that club. I have a lot of friends there and I wish them all the best .

"Tottenham left Belgrade with a solitary point to show for their efforts in the Group C opener against a spirited Partizan side. As Mauricio Pochettino made his entry into full European competition the chances were slim for both sides, although Harry Kane went close for the visitors early hitting the crossbar and Hugo Lloris was tested more than his counterpart. Sportsmail's Dan Ripley was there and rates the Tottenham players' performances below. Tottenham striker Harry Kane's shot hits the cross bar in one of the best chances to break the deadlock . TOTTENHAM . Hugo Lloris - 6.5 . Not the busiest of nights for the French stopper, who was otherwise reliable when called upon between the sticks. Kyle Naughton - 6.0 . Much like Ben Davies, Naughton was limited to providing attacking width from full-back and struggled defensively. Federico Fazio - 6.5 . Misjudged a header in the first half that nearly resulted in Partizan scoring, but helped marshall the defence well. Jan Vertonghen - 7.0 . Made a number of crucial blocks to cover team-mate errors. The Belgian slowly looks like getting back to his best. Tottenham Hotspur's Jan Vertonghen was a rare encouraging performer for his side . Ben Davies - 5.0 . Looked uncertain in possession, and was the target for many Partizan attacks down the right side. An uncomfortable night. Nabil Bentaleb - 5.0 . Anonymous in an attacking sense and was careless in giving the ball away. Never looked like making a major impact. Benji Stambouli - 6.5 . Calm and composed in possession and anchored the midfield well. Replaced by Capoue after picking up second half knock. Nabil Bentaleb went missing in attack and didn't value possession when given the opportunity . Aaron Lennon - 5.5 . Lennon's strongest asset is his pace, but even on the rare occasions he could use it, the winger darted into dead ends. Paulinho - 5.0 . A passenger throughout the game. It was no surprise to see the Brazilian replaced by the attack minded Soldado on the hour. Andros Townsend - 6.5 . Tried to be Tottenham's most creative player. But Spurs never had a shot on target while he was on the pitch. Replaced by Lamela. Harry Kane - 6.0 . Hit the woodwork in the opening moments, but never linked with team-mates in midfield and was easily marked out of the game. Harry Kane came close hitting the woodwork but was shutdown too easily . SUBSTITUTES . Roberto Soldado 5.0 (for Paulinho 60') Brought on to help Kane in attack with 30 minutes left but hardly got a sniff of the action or anywhere near the Partizan goal. Erik Lamela 6.0 (for Townsend 59') Brought tricks and flicks to Tottenham's attack after coming on, but like Townsend couldn't help the visitors take control. Etienne Capoue 6.5 (for Stambouli 72') Disciplined in midfield after replacing Stambouli, and brought a physical presence to help limit Partizan's growing influence. Striker Roberto Soldado came on with half an hour to go to add spice to Spurs attack and chase a goal .","Harry Kane hit the crossbar in one of the 0-0 draw's rare chances .

"A Seattle police officer who punched a drunk woman in the face while she was handcuffed in the back of a patrol car will not face charges, prosecutors have revealed. Dashcam footage from inside the vehicle shows Adley Shepherd hitting Miyekko Durden-Bosley, 23, after she kicked the officer in the head while under arrest. The officer's blow fractured the woman's right eye, according to medical records. But prosecutors said that Shepherd had 'acted professionally' and concluded they did not have enough evidence to prove his use of force wasn't necessary. Scroll down for video . Blow: Dash-cam footage from inside the vehicle shows Adley Shepherd hitting Miyekko Durden-Bosley after she kicked the officer in the head while under arrest in Seattle . Injuries: The 23-year-old fractured her eye socket during the incident, but prosecutors have revealed the officer won't be charged because he was 'acting professionally' The decision comes as unrest grows in New York and Missouri following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police hands. On June 22, Officer Shepherd arrested an intoxicated Durden-Bosley while out on patrol. She then protested, claiming she had not made any threats and had not been violent to her partner. Frustrated, she is then heard saying 'f*** you bitch' during the footage before kicking the officer. The strike is not seen on camera. Shepherd reacts by pushing her into the back of the patrol car and punching her in the eye. After the kick, Shepherd is heard saying 'my jaw is jacked' but according to the Seattle Times, medical records showed there was no sign of injury. A statement released on Friday by the King County Prosecutor's office said: Officer Shepherd reacted instantaneously to the kick by the suspect, who was wearing boots, with one punch to the suspect's head which caused a fracture of an orbital socket. 'While Officer Shepherd may have had other options or alternatives, we have concluded that we would be unable to prove that Officer Shepherd's use of force was criminal.' Seattle Mayor Ed Murray told Q13 shortly after the incident in June that he found the punch disturbing. Response: Shepherd reacted after the suspect allegedly kicked him in the head outside of the patrol car . He told the station: 'I'll go out on a ledge here and hopefully not get myself in trouble with unions or whatever. But, if someone is in handcuffs, if someone in handcuffs and seated in a car, that person should not be punched. According to the Times, Shepherd's response was deemed 'inappropriate' and he had inflicted 'unnecessary injuries' on the woman by Robert Bragg Jr - who oversees use-of-force training for the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission. Shepherd had been placed on administrative leave for six months following the incident but the Seattle Police Officers' Guild President released a statement suggesting that may come to an end following the decision. Detective Ron Smith said: 'The Seattle Police Officers Guild hopes that Officer Shepherd will be returned to full duty as soon as possible, and that SPD will review its Force Investigation Team procedures to review whether the system is working in the best interest of all involved.' Protests have been going on for the past four days following the decisions not to indict Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown and Daniel Pantaleo in the 'chokehold' death of Eric Garner. It is our opinion that had the suspect heeded the officers' commands, the resulting incident in question would not have occurred .

"Rihanna's NFL performance was canceled at the Baltimore Ravens game on Thursday following the  release of a video showing ex-player Ray Rice knocking his fiancée unconscious. The singer was herself the victim of a high-profile . domestic violence incident back in 2009 when she was assaulted by her . then boyfriend Chris Brown. CBS' Thursday Night Football, featuring the debut game of Pittsburgh Steelers at . Baltimore, eliminated a track of Jay-Z's, Run This Town, featuring . Rihanna and Kanye West - along with other 'high energy' elements and a comedic stint, NFL officials said. Scroll down for video . Rihanna stepped out in New York on Thursday for Fashion Week after her song was cut from the opening of NFL Thursday Night Football following the Ray Rice domestic violence incident . Former Ravens star Ray Rice is shown in May with his wife Janay at a New Jersey courthouse to face charges of domestic violence. He was let go from the Baltimore team this week after the full video emerged from the incident showing Rice punching his then-fiancée unconscious . CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said that the changes were made to give the game coverage a more 'subdued' tone and journalistic approach. The broadcast was to open with a report by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell . about Rice, who was cut by the Baltimore Ravens after TMZ released the . surveillance video on Monday. The footage has called into question how the NFL disciplines players . involved in domestic violence. Earlier, Rice had been suspended from two . games for the assault. Asked if Rihanna's own history as a victim of domestic violence was a . reason the song was cut, McManus said it was among several factors . considered but was not the overriding one. Rihanna, who was pictured on Thursday attending New York Fashion week, was attacked by . then-boyfriend Chris Brown before the 2009 Grammy Awards and was forced to cancel her appearance. A leaked photograph obtained by TMZ showed visible injuries to Rihanna and Brown, 25, later pleaded guilty to felony assault. How the network will approach next week's broadcast has yet to be determined, McManus said. Rihanna teamed her golden dress with a bright pink jacket as she headed to sushi restaurant Nobu with her entourage in the Tribeca district . Rihanna wore another fashion-forward ensemble as she made her way to Nobu for dinner on Thursday night following attending New York Fashion Week shows . CBS Sports had previously announced that Run This Town with added . narration by Don Cheadle, was to accompany each of the 2014 broadcasts . as part of an opening sequence that would be customized for each week's . game. TMZ claimed in a . Thursday report, that 'CBS didn't want to feature another celebrity who . was involved in a high-profile domestic violence incident'.

'We can use him as a sub. Adam was very good against San Marino and interpreted the role behind the two attackers very well. 'They are different types of players and both feature strongly.' Given Hodgson’s comments on Thursday, it was perhaps no surprise that Lallana started.

"Sportsmail’s Graham Poll gives his assessment of Mark Clattenburg’s performance at the King Power Stadium as Manchester United were humbled by Leicester City. Sunday's Premier League encounter took a huge turn after Rafael was penalised for an apparent foul on Jamie Vardy when Manchester United were 3-1 up. The decision proved costly as Leicester went on to claim all three points by scoring five goals past David de Gea. Rafael was penalised by Mark Clattenburg for a late challenge on Jamie Vardy when he had in fact been fouled by the Leicester forward . Rafael and Wayne Rooney protested against Clattenburg's decision to send off Tyler Blackett . Blackett deserved to see red after deliberately fouling Leicester forward Vardy . Leonardo Ulloa scored from the penalty spot to round off the scoring for Leicester City . It’s hard to criticise a referee, but the elite group are told by management that they cannot defend the indefensible. With Manchester United cruising and destined for three points, Clattenburg somehow missed what appeared to be a clear foul on Rafael by Vardy – and to compound the error then gave the softest of penalties when the Brazilian recovered and brushed the striker off the ball. If that was an error then the second penalty certainly wasn’t, as was the easy decision of sending off Tyler Blackett for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.","Premier League official Mark Clattenburg awarded Leicester a penalty in the second half for an apparent foul by Rafael on Jamie Vardy .

"An aristocrat was deemed mentally unfit to face charges of theft and criminal damage today and taken from court to hospital by ambulance. David Brudenell-Bruce, the 8th Earl of Cardigan, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly damaging pheasant feeders, stealing a battery and an electrical power unit. Brudenell-Bruce, 59, is alleged to have caused £66 damage to a number of pheasant feeders belonging to James Tilly. Paramedics escort Lord Cardigan, pictured in a blue and white striped shirt, out of Salisbury Magistrate Court to take him to hospital after a judge declared him 'unfit to plead' The Earl of Cardigan is accused of causing £66 pounds worth of damage to his neighbour's pheasant feeders . The Earl appeared at Salisbury Magistrates' Court today accused of damaging and stealing property belonging to a neighbour. The Earl looked dishevelled in the dock, and appeared to be in some considerable distress. Miss Marie-Claire Amuah, defending, told the court: 'My client is unfit to plead today. I am certainly unable to take instruction from him.' Brudenell-Bruce was declared unfit to plead by a special District Judge brought in from London. Jennie Bradley, a court assessment officer and psychiatric nurse, said: 'He is psychologically unwell, but does not need to be detained under the mental health act or any an enforced admission to hospital.' She added that his risk of committing suicide was 'fairly low at the moment.' Judge Emma Arbuthnot declared the multi-millionaire unfit to plead and adjourned the case so he could visit a nearby hospital. Brudenell-Bruce was taken from court to hospital by ambulance on the advice of the judge . Judge Emma Arbuthnot adjourned the case at Salisbury Magistrates' Court until July 12 . Judge Arbuthnot granted Brudenell-Bruce bail until his next hearing, but imposed two conditions requested by prosecutor Vyvyan Thatchers. The judge ruled he cannot contact or come within 50 metres of five specific people who live on his 4,500-acre Savernake Estate, including Mr Tilly. The Savernake Estate, which includes a stately home and Britain's only privately-owned forest, has been in the Earl's family for almost 1,000 years. Brudenell-Bruce was later taken from court by ambulance to a nearby hospital, on the advice of the judge. His case was adjourned until July 12, when he will appear at court in Swindon. Aristocrat: The Earl of Cardigan holding a painting of one of his ancestors at his home on the Savernake Estate . The Earl of Cardigan pictured outside his ancestral home Tottenham House in the Savernake Forest on the outskirts of Marlborough in Wiltshire . The aristocrat appeared in the same court last week, accused of beating a trustee of his estate, near Marlborough, in Wiltshire. Brudenell-Bruce allegedly battered barrister's clerk John Moore in April, a week after a high court legal wrangle between the pair was resolved by a High Court judge. The Earl lost the case, in which he accused his former friend of stealing millions of pounds worth of paintings from his extensive family estate, and allegedly took his frustration out on Mr Moore. Brudenell-Bruce last appeared before Salisbury Magistrates' Court last Tuesday, on charges of common assault and criminal damage, but that case was adjourned until October for trial. The Earl's daughter, musician Bo Bruce - runner-up on BBC talent show The Voice - may be called to give evidence in that trial, as hers was among a list of five names given to magistrates as possible witnesses. Miss Bruce, 27, whose real name is Catherine Brudenell-Bruce, was runner-up on BBC talent show The Voice earlier this month. Since publication of this article, Lord Cardigan has asked to make clear that the judge did not order him to attend at a mental hospital. He asked to go to the nearest general hospital because he had been denied his medication.

"Liverpool fell to a surprise 3-1 defeat at Upton Park on Saturday evening as West Ham scored two early goals to dent Liverpool’s title challenge. Winston Reid headed West Ham ahead after only two minutes before Diafra Sakho lobbed Simon Mignolet with a sublime chip after seven minutes to double the lead for the Hammers. England starlet Raheem Sterling fired in a low drive to reduce Liverpool’s deficit before half-time but Brendan Rodgers’ side failed to overhaul West Ham’s fine performance with Morgan Amalfitano completing the scoring late on. Sportsmail’s Sami Mokbel was there and rates the West Ham and Liverpool players below. West Ham United (4-4-2) ADRIAN - No chance with the Sterling's strike and held firm as Liverpool threw caution to the wind. Booked. 6.5 . GUY DEMEL - Had his hands full with Liverpool's fluid attacking unit and coped well before being substituted. 6.5 . JAMES TOMKINS  - Has had his detractors in recent weeks, but coped well with Balotelli's threat yesterday. 7 . WINSTON REID - West Ham need to get the New Zealander signed up to a new deal ASAP. Solid again. Booked. 7.5 . AARON CRESSWELL - Solid display from the left-back. Easy to see why he was so highly-rated at Ipswich. 7 . Winston Reid celebrates heading West Ham into the lead after just two minutes at Upton Park . MARK NOBLE - Typical display from the hammers skipper. On point with his passing and discipline in midfield. 7.5 . CHEIKOU KOUYATE - Powerful and energetic in midfield. Can see how he kept Momo Diame out of the team. Booked. 8 . ALEX SONG - Bossed the midfield for late sections of the game. Great piece of business by Sam Allardyce to sign him. Booked. 7.5 . West Ham captain Mark Noble put in a typical solid performance for the Hammers in the midfield . STEWART DOWNING - Led the line for the Hammers and caused his former club a host of problems in the first half. 7 . ENNER VALENCIA - Industrious and economical for the Hammers. The Ecuadorian looks a real class act. 7 . DIAFRA SAKHO  - Ran, ran and ran. His work-rate and directness was infectious against the Merseysiders. 7 . Diafra Sakho scored a fine chip to double West Ham's lead on seven minutes as the Hammers won 3-1 . SUBS: . CARL JENKINSON (for Demel 61) - Helped see out late Liverpool pressure. Booked. 6 . JAMES COLLINS (for Valencia 76) - Experience was key for the Hammers late on. 6 . MORGAN AMALFITANO (for Song 69) - Shored up West Ham's midfield in the closing minutes and scored vital third. 6.5 . SUBS NOT USED: Zarate, Vaz Te, Jaaskelainen, Cole. Morgan Amalfitano was a late substitute at Upton Park but still managed to have a strong impact with a goal . Liverpool (4-4-2) SIMON MIGNOLET - Brilliant shot stopper but his ability to to stop crosses, however, remains suspect. 5 . JAVIER MANQUILLO - Lasted just 22 minutes before enduring the embarrassment of being substituted. A day to forget. 4 . MARTIN SKRTEL -  Looked uncomfortable dealing with West Ham's excellent front three. Not the Slovakian's best day. 5 . DEJAN LOVREN - Shaky opening 35 minutes became even shakier following a hefty blow on the head in a collision with team-mate Sakho.5 . ALBERTO MORENO - Caught out of position on occasions, particularly in the first-half. Decent outlet going forward, though. 5.5 . Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno clears the ball during the defeat at Upton Park . Dejan Lovren was caught in a real battle at Upton Park as Liverpool failed to contain West Ham . STEVEN GERRARD - The game bypassed the Liverpool skipper a little bit. Found Song and Kouyate's power in midfield too much to handle. 5 . JORDAN HENDERSON - Should have done better with West Ham's first, but still tried to drive his side forward. 6 . LUCAS - Contributed very little to his side in the first half and was duly substituted at half-time. 5 . RAHEEM STERLING - Hauled his side back into the game. Overtaking Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's most important player. 7 . England international Raheem Sterling was his usual influential self, scoring with a fine low strike . FABIO BORINI - Didn't show enough to convince Liverpool fans he is an adequate replacement for Daniel Sturridge. 5.5 . MARIO BALOTELLI - Cut a frustrated figure for much of the game, but showed flashes of brilliance to scare West Ham. 6 . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli failed to replicate his Champions League scoring heroics from midweek . SUBS: .

"When Sarah Kam started getting labor pains, she decided to get in the car and head to the midwife's clinic. Not forgetting what the 33-year-old went through with her second child Ezra last year, she covered the back seats in blankets, just in case. But as they drove towards the Midwife's Place in Bellvue, Omaha, it became more apparent that history was going to repeat itself. During the 25-minute journey to the clinic, their third child, Evelyn, was born in exactly the same spot as her older brother - on the I-80 exit ramp to 42nd street. Family: Sarah Kam, 33, holds new-born Evelyn in front of her eldest son Ethan, three, and his brother Ezra (bottom right) who was also born on the ramp between 42nd street and the I-80 in Omaha, Nebraska . Last Thursday Mrs Kam and her software engineer husband Hugh, 49, thought they had left enough time to avoid having to pull over. But during the 25-minute journey, the contractions became more intense, prompting the mother-of-three to shout: 'Oh no, it's happening again. 'Stop the car! Stop the car! The baby is coming,' she screamed. Mr Kam thought they could make it to the nearby University of Nebraska medical center, but his wife shouted: 'You've got to catch her, or she's going to go on the floor.' Her husband then leaned over in the SUV and grabbed the infant who was crying. He then handed her to his wife and wrapped the new-born in a blanket. They then continued onto their intended destination, and Evelyn is said to be in good health. 'I was kind of nervous,' Mr Kam told the Omaha World Herald, 'because I was driving, and I had to pay attention to her and see how she reacted, because the baby could pop out anytime.' On February 15, 2013, Mrs Kam, went through an identical experience. Throughout the day her labor pains had been sporadic, according to the paper, but then they started coming more frequently. 'We were like, oh, my word, we have to leave now,' she said. As they stopped on the stretch of road, nurses from the nearby hospital rushed out after Mr Kam in, saying that his wife had just given birth in their car. Their first child, Ethan, was born in a hospital. Now, after their second roadside delivery, what's their plan if there's a fourth child? 'If there is,' Mrs Kam said, 'Maybe we'll just go park there (at the Midwife's Place) a month early or something, or as soon as the first contraction hits.' When he kids are older, the stay-at-home mother plans to go back to the spot and take a picture. Mr Kam told the paper: We wanted to avoid this happening again. But it not just happened, it happened in the same place... Lightning does strike twice in the same place .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger should shoulder some of the blame for what he considers Jack Wilshere's lack of progression from his days as a teenage wonderkid. Scholes has been critical of Wilshere's development since he burst into the Gunners' first team as a talented 16-year-old back in 2006. The ex-England star has now explained that he thinks Wenger, who has overseen Wilshere's progression at the Emirates, should have done a better job. But Scholes could be left eating his words after the midfielder's sensational goal against Manchester City - a match which he was keeping a close eye on as a pundit for BT Sport. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere: I'll study Pirlo and Mascherano to improve my play .

Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere (left) gets away from from Manchester City debutant Frank Lampard (right) Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes airs his views about Jack Wilshere on BT Sport . Arsene Wenger (right) is partly to blame for Jack Wilshere's lack of development according to Paul Scholes . Reacting to Paul Scholes' claim that he hadn't improved in five years, Wilshere told Sportsmail in May: 'I wanted to get to the bottom of it. I just wanted to hear what he thinks. I respect him so much. 'We had quite a good chat. He's entitled to his opinion. He explained it a bit better and told me what I should work on. 'He was right in a certain way. I can't keep saying I've been injured a lot. There comes a time when you stop being a kid and I think that's what he's referring to.' CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL INTERVIEW WITH WILSHERE . Asked whether Wilshere, who was named Man of the Match by commentator Michael Owen, was good enough to be starting for Arsenal before the game, the 39-year-old told BT Sport: 'I don't really know. Is he a holding midfield player or an attacking player? I think he's confused. 'I think he's a frustrated figure at the moment. He's trying to force the play.' Aaron Ramsey revealed that he had a meeting with Wenger to turn around his poor performances and get his game back on track before the start of last season. Scholes believes Wilshere would benefit from doing the same, even though he feels the Frenchman should have already addressed issues surrounding the 22-year-old's game. 'He needs a similar meeting  with Arsene Wenger. He needs to simplify his game,' he said. And asked whether Wenger was to blame for Wilshere not playing to his full potential, Scholes said: 'Has has to be blamed, he's the manager. I don't know how much work he does with him, but I'm not sure he does enough. 'He has fallen so far behind Aaron Ramsey. They're trying to find a position for him and I don't know what it is.' Jack Wilshere needs to simplify his game and stick to one position, according to Paul Scholes . Aaron Ramsey, pictured scoring against Everton, says a talk with Arsene Wenger helped him improve . Paul Scholes has also criticised the use of Jack Wilshere by England boss Roy Hodgson against Switzerland . But he did praise Wilshere after Arsenal's clash with Man City. Speaking on BT Sport, Scholes said: 'It shows he's an attacking midfielder capable of doing it at the highest level. It's still early in the season, time will tell. 'What he has done is made a great start to the season, now he's got the base to go on and have a good season.' Scholes' criticism comes less than a week after he questioned Roy Hodgson's decision to play Wilshere in a holding midfield role in England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland. Writing in his column for The Independent, the former Red Devils man said: 'I still have my concerns about the diamond formation in midfield (for England) and most of all about Jack Wilshere's role in it. 'Don't get me wrong, Jack has great ability and at some point I hope that he will be in a position to score goals and to create them. 'But I just do not believe that playing in front of the back four, on his own, suits him.' After his man of the match performance against Man City, Wilshere gave his take on the game and his form. He said: 'Second half we did enough to win it, they could have won it too. 'I’m just trying to do what I do week in week out, I’m fitter and fitter each game. 'I felt good, I had a good couple games with England recovered well and we all felt fresh, you saw that in the first half. We started brightly, unfortunately we didn’t win. 'I think again we showed great character to come from one down against the champions. 'I just keep playing week in week out. I got on the score sheet, I said in the past I want to score more goals.'","Paul Scholes says Jack Wilshere has fallen 'so far behind' Aaron Ramsey .

"READ OUR ORIGINAL ARTICLE ABOUT THE FAIRYTALE STORY HERE . After an incredible year that saw the tiny French club of Luzenac promoted into Ligue 2, this should be one of the season of honorary president Fabien Barthez's life. But the dream is now over for the former Manchester United goalkeeper. The biggest fairytale story in European football will end with an amateur club in the seventh tier without him involved. So, what happened? Denied a place in the second tier in France because of their stadium size, the club were also told by the French Football Federation (FFF) that they won't be rejoining the National Championship despite finishing second in the division last season. Barthez says the 'story ends here.' Honorary president Fabien Barthez met with the French Football Federation regarding Luzenac . The tiny French side were denied access into Ligue 2 because of their stadium size, with a 400 capacity . The Luzenac players celebrate what they thought was promotion from the National last season . Where the tiny village of Luzenac is in France . The village of Luzenac Ariege Pyrenees contains just 650 inhabitants, and is tucked away in the Ariege Pyranees in France. Barthez, who was born just 30km away in Lavalanet was handed his role in 2012, a year after Jerome Ducros bought the club with the intention of bringing success to the region. It didn't take long. The French Federation deemed their original stadium of the Stade de Paul Fedou to be too small, with just one stand holding around 400 supporters, so their wild celebrations upon achieving promotion in April took place at the Stade de Courbet in Foix,  20km from home. Luzenac stormed through the National with the help of Cameroonian striker Ande N'doh, top scorer in the division with 21 goals; manager Christophe Pelissier was on the verge of greatness, a step away from one of the top five divisions in Europe. Though the possibility of denial into the league above lingered, pre-season didn't start too badly. A draw with local rivals Toulouse, a mainstay in Ligue 1, gave fans hope that they could not only compete, but excel in Ligue 2. But now, it is all over. The Barthez project, that is. Barthez was named honorary president at the club in 2012 and was born just 30km away from the village . The beautiful region in the Pyrenees where it is based, with a population of approximately 400 . 'The refusal to accept Luzenac into the National brings an end to our project,' Barthez is quoted as saying in Get French Football. 'We can not accept residing in CFA2 (5th division) with players who had earned their place in Ligue 2. 'We were given no promises of an automatic rise next season either. For us, Jerome and me, it's over, the story ends here.' Barthez and Ducros met with the FFF on Wednesday but they couldn't find an agreement to reinstate the club back into a professional league. All players who did their utmost to achieve their great feat will be released from their contracts, with their second team now set to step to the fore down in the amateur seventh division. Barthez made it his duty to pick the new signings, and he did so with pinpoint accuracy. He attracted Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 outcasts desperate for a new adventure who would find it hard saying no to a World Cup winner. Youngsters train at the Stade de Paul Fedou, which will now host the seventh division games this season . One of those men was Nicholas Dieuze, 35, a man who had played 157 games for Toulouse. Even a man with such experience couldn't believe what was going on. 'Who would have thought that five months after our promotion to Ligue 2, we'd be saying goodbye to each other in a car park?' lamented Dieuze to AFP. 'I feel a lot of sadness about what's been done over recent years. 'They're sending us to DHR (division d'honneur regionale) with a great kick up the bum. In two weeks, we'll no longer speak about Luzenac. 'The players, like many people in France, will go down to the dole office.' Many will say that a village of this size with a stadium of this size are back to where they belong. But Luzenac had earned it. Barthez had earned it.","Luzenac finished second in the National Championship last season .

"A 10-year-old boy was among at least 13 casualties of a US-led raid late Friday that ended with the death of an American photojournalist held captive by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Special operations commandos sent to rescue Luke Somers, 33, in the village of Dafaar in Yemen became bogged down in a firefight and were unable to reach him before he was shot and killed by his captors. Another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by captors in the midst of the raid, US officials said. Failed rescue: Special forces sent to rescue Luke Somers, 33, in the village of Dafaar in Yemen became bogged down in a firefight and were unable to reach him before he was shot and killed by his captors . The list of casualties included a woman, an AQAP commander and two militants, as well as six members from their tribe, according to other militants' social media feeds. The commander, Jamal Mubarak al-Hardal-Daghari al-Awlaki, appeared to be the same person as Mubarakal-Harad, named in a Yemen Defence Ministry statement on Saturday as the leader of an AQAP faction. Several of those killed were reported to be from the Daghari and Awlaki families, important tribes in Shabwa . province. The hostages were . being held in the house of a man named Saeed al-Daghari, according to a statement from the Yemeni government  on Saturday. SEAL officers came as close as 100 yards from the building where the hostages were being held, before becoming embroiled in a firefight with AQAP militants. As special forces fought off the attack, kidnappers in the home where the two hostages were being held shot and killed them, according a local identifying himself as Jamal. Killed: South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by his captors, adding to the list of at least 13 killed during the raid . Held hostage: Somers had been held by extremist militants since September 2013 and pleaded for his life in a video released by his captors . Kidnapped: Somers was taken from Sana'a, Yemen's capital, and brought to Dafaar, a village in the Shabwa province to the south . Ministry of Defense: Yemen's government and local residents said Yemeni forces participated in the raid, though US officials claim the raid was carried out by American forces alone . US officials have said the raid was carried out by U.S. forces alone, but both . Yemen's government and local residents said Yemeni forces participated in the raid, though US officials claim the raid was carried out by American forces alone. 'Before the gunshots were heard, very strong floodlights . turned the night into daylight, and then we heard loud . explosions,' Jamal told Reuters. 'The soldiers were calling on . the house's inhabitants to surrender and the speaker was clearly . a Yemeni soldier,' he added. Another witness, named Abdullah, said the Yemeni army had . blocked access to the Wadi from all directions before the raid . began. 'When the forces withdrew, we found lots of bloodstains, but . did not know if those were of the soldiers or the hostages,' Abdullah said. For the South African Korkie, the raid came just before his expected release on Sunday, according to the Gift of the Givers relief group, which had negotiated for his freedom. The South African government said it had undertaken 'numerous initiatives' to help free Korkie. His body was expected in South Africa on Monday. Yemeni journalist Abdel-Razaq al-Jamal said AQAP may have originally intended to ransom Somers as well, but was likely angered by the earlier rescue attempt in November. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the second operation had only been approved . because of information that the American's life was in imminent . danger. AQAP, formed in 2006 by the merger of the Yemeni and Saudi . branches of the network, has for years been seen by Washington . as one of the movement's most dangerous branches. At least one British hostage and a Turkish man are currently being held by the group.","Navy SEALs sent to rescue Luke Somers, 33, were unable to reach him before he was executed by his captors .

"Quizaholic David St John even travelled to Australia to take part in an Ashes-style clash between UK and Australian quiz champions . We're about to watch David St John’s finest hour. He flicks on the DVD and there he is — all gleaming smile and big hair — flanked by a brace of matronly women. He’s notching up the points so smartly on a quiz show called Jeopardy that his fellow contestants look mildly stunned. David’s score is unfeasibly high. He seems to have acquired several thousand points. He carries off a (relatively modest) £500, but this is 1996; a gentler era, before TV quiz shows became ferociously competitive and offered bonanza prize money. David is on a winning streak with Jeopardy. The following week he comes back and trounces the opposition again. Kerching! Another £500 drops into his lap. ‘Jeopardy was a quiz show with a difference,’ he says. ‘The host, Jonathan Ross’s brother Paul, read out the answer and you had to supply the question. I blasted through, knocking the reigning champion off her perch.’ David, 64, does not look like the archetypal quiz nerd. He has the aura of a Sixties pop star. But do not be deceived: his brain is a veritable compendium of trivia, and he has the fastest trigger finger since Wyatt Earp. He is also, it emerged last week, Britain’s most prolific quiz show contestant, having made 28 appearances on TV game shows over the past 30 years. The Weakest Link, Eggheads, No Win No Fee, Brainwave: these are just a sample of the shows on which he has competed. He has faced a panoply of star hosts from Bob Monkhouse (‘my comedy idol’) to Jeremy Beadle (‘very pleasant’), Gyles Brandreth (‘terrific!’) and Queen of Mean, Anne Robinson. ‘Luckily I have the hide of a rhino,’ says David, a comedian and entertainer. ‘Anne didn’t intimidate me one bit. ‘I’m used to performing — after all, it’s my day job — and I was expecting a bit of flak from her. ‘When I was voted off she said: “Oh, so David, you’re a comedian. That wasn’t very funny, was it?” I’d have liked a bit of banter with her, but I didn’t get the chance.’ Keeping up appearances: Quiz show master David St John on the set of Star Quality in 1990, left, and on Sale of the Century 1982, right . Through the ages: David's appearance on Down Under in 1986, left, and Eggheads in 2008, right . His most recent appearance, broadcast last week, was on a show called Face The Clock, hosted by impressionist Rory Bremner. It wasn’t all glamour, however. ‘The auditions for Face The Clock were in a freezing cold warehouse in Glasgow. You have to answer questions against the clock, but you’re not told when the time will run out. I lost by a split second, narrowly missing the £1,800 jackpot.’ David, alas, has endured an infuriating number of such near-misses. He has won a relatively modest £5,000 in prize money over the years, though when critics carp that this makes him more vanquished than victor, he points out that surmounting the hurdle of the audition is a triumph in itself. He says his job helps him keep cool under fire. He works in clubs, pubs, on cruises and as an after- dinner speaker, and never gets stage fright. He also has  instant recall and the memory of  an elephant. ‘Most contestants are nervous, but I never am,’ he says. ‘There are auditions before every show and you have to come across as confident and knowledgeable.’ His top subject is Sixties pop music, and by golly, he’s good. Not only is his brain a compendium of every hit song of the decade, he also recalls bogglingly obscure facts. ‘I know Paul McCartney used a Vox T-60 bass amplifier and I can remember the registration numbers of The Beatles’ road managers’ cars.’ But how good is his general knowledge? I fire a couple of questions from the Daily Mail’s fiendish Masterquiz. ‘The Sea Cook was an early potential title for which novel of 1883?’ He answers correctly: Treasure Island. ‘Which instrumentalist might play a rimshot?’ He’s right again: a drummer. Brainiac: David racking up the money  on Channel 4's Face the Clock, hosted by Rory Bremner . Trivia-mad: David in his first television appearance with presenter Nicholas Parsons on Sale of the Century in 1982 . Dedicated: David, pictured here appearing on Star Quality with Giles Brandreth in 1990, says he would liked like to be a quiz show host himself . The one subject that often stumps him is sport. ‘I don’t follow players, managers or teams. I don’t even know the star players of my local football team, Wolverhampton.’ David is self-taught — he was encouraged to leave his Southampton grammar school by teachers, who felt he was more interested in his pop band than studying. Actually, they were only half-right. David did love music and performing. His mum, Joan, ‘a frivolous type who loved dancing’ and worked at the Pier Ballroom in Southampton, encouraged him. ‘She said to the manager: “Let my nipper sing.” So I went on the stage. I was ten. It was my first gig.’ But he also had a thirst for knowledge. ‘My dad, a carpenter, taught me to love books,’ he says. ‘I read encyclopaedias. I absorbed information like a sponge. And I enjoyed exams. But my teachers said I had the attention span of a gnat.’ He got into quiz shows by default when he auditioned for TV talent contests New Faces and Opportunity Knocks, and failed to get on. Friends . teased him for knowing a lot of useless information. ‘I thought: “I’ll . show them. I’ll try a quiz show,” ’ he says. And he did. Human encyclopedia: David has made 28 appearances on quiz shows in the past 30 years . His first appearance was in 1982 on Sale Of The Century. Hosted by the perennially popular Nicholas Parsons — David ranks him ‘the ultimate quiz show host’ because of his geniality, clarity of diction and the speed with which he rattled through questions. In its heyday, the show drew 20 million viewers. David was on sparkling form. He even beat a fellow contestant, a vicar, on the buzzer with a Biblical question. What was it? ‘In the Garden of Eden, Eve was beguiled by what?’ he recalls. He leapt in so swiftly with the correct answer, a serpent, the vicar was left pink with embarrassment. Four years later, he was invited to fly to Australia for a Sale Of The Century: The Ashes contest. ‘The two weeks in Melbourne was a prize in itself. I was spoiled rotten.’ Also picked for the GB team was the accomplished quizzer Daphne Fowler. ‘She sat by the pool studying lists,’ says David. ‘I don’t do any swotting. You can’t revise, because you never know what’s going to come up, do you?’ In the event, however, Daphne’s mugging up paid dividends. She beat him. He encountered her again in 2008 on Eggheads. David still kicks himself over the question that lost him the contest; a tricky one on Hitchcock films. ‘People watch at home and say “Oh it’s easy. I could answer that”, but it’s a different ball game when you’re in the studio. It can be nerve-racking,’ he says. David, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, lives in Cannock, Staffordshire with his Greek-born wife Maria, 59. ‘And no, I’ve never asked her to take my speeding points,’ he quips, referring to Chris Huhne and his Greek-born wife. He is never short of a wisecrack, and would rather like to be a quiz show host himself — but not on one of the more cerebral shows. He says there is a quiz show hierarchy, and University Challenge, Brain Of Britain and Mastermind are considered the elite. He auditioned for the latter, and didn’t get on. And it irks him when he encounters ‘big-headed’ sorts on shows. Modest: Despite all his appearances, David has won only £5,000 over the years . ‘Sometimes you come across university types who can be annoyingly boastful. You hear them listing the shows they’ve been on and it can intimidate the more nervous contestants,’ he says. David has rarely been flummoxed, though last February in The Chase, he did have a moment of madness. ‘The question was “What do you call something that provides a steady income?” and, of course, the answer was a cash cow. But it was so easy I thought it was a trick question. I said cash camel. It was my first dumb answer.’ Even contestants with nerves of steel can become jibbering wrecks under pressure. Dumb answers are legion. I wonder if David has a favourite. ‘One contestant was asked to name a bird with a long neck. He said: “Naomi Campbell.” ’ During his three decades as a quizzer, he’s seen prize money shoot up and competition become fiercer. Getting onto a show like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? is a costly, time-consuming exercise. ‘A friend spent £1,000 on phone calls before he qualified for the show. Then he didn’t get past the “fastest-finger” question — which is something silly such as “How many rivets are there in the Eiffel Tower?” He was quite miffed.’ David may be approaching his bus pass years, but his memory is still as sharp as a tack. ‘I haven’t had any senior moments yet,’ he says. ‘Besides, older people have had time to acquire a breadth of knowledge. Actually, they make the best quizzers — so perhaps my best years are yet to come.’","David St John, 64, is Britain's most prolific game show contestant .

"CLICK HERE to find out why Europe captain Paul McGinley is worried about being favourites at Gleneagles . American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson has admitted that he will be targeting Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter at Gleneagles next week and telling his team: ‘Take down the big dogs.’ Watson said he would be seeking to take a leaf out of the Europeans’ book, in the manner in which they always received a boost in past matches whenever Tiger Woods was beaten. ‘Of course it gives everyone a lift if players like Rory and Poulter are beaten, and I’ll be telling my players that,’ said the skipper. Captain Tom Watson aims to go after Europe's 'big dogs' when the USA face Europe in the Ryder Cup . Rory McIlroy (L) and Ian Poulter (R) have been picked out as Europe's most dangerous players at Gleneagles . In his last public thoughts before his team leave for Scotland on Monday, Watson defended the format that will see his team travel without their best two players on current form. Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk performed brilliantly to top the standings at the end of the four-tournament FedEx Cup play-off series on Sunday. McIlroy and Sergio Garcia were among those who expressed ‘relief’ that they would not be part of the opposition team. But Watson said: ‘The last time I was captain in 1993 I made my picks six weeks before the match and now it is only three weeks, and I think that is about right. USA will be travelling without in form Billy Horschel, despite him winning the Fed-Ex Cup play-off series . Watson regards 'young stud' Rickie Fowler (L) and 'machine' Jim Furyk as his leading men . ‘Billy was on my radar back in February. I said to him back then: “Come on man, step it up”. But the bottom line is he didn’t perform well enough during the qualifying process.’ Watson also accepted Europe have the strongest team on paper but downplayed any idea his team were underdogs. ‘That’s not in my team’s mind at all,’ said Watson. ‘I believe in this team and I think they believe in themselves.’ Watson singled out McIlroy for particular praise. ‘He’s the best player in the world and that’s a huge plus for them. ‘But the beauty of the Ryder Cup is he can’t win it all by himself.’ As for his own side, he called Rickie Fowler his ‘young stud’ and veteran Jim Furyk a machine. ‘I only wish he could play in every match,’ said Watson of the 44-year-old, whose Ryder Cup record from his 27 matches reads: won 8, lost 15, halved 4.","Europe face USA in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles on September 26-28 .

"The Earl of Cardigan could be set to lose the ancestral home which has been in the family for nearly 200 years. Trustees of the estate are looking to sell Tottenham House, a 100-room mansion in the 4,500-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire, it has been reported. The Earl, who lives in a different house on the estate, is living on £71 a week Jobseekers' Allowance and became a father again last week following the birth of his baby daughter. The Earl of Cardigan could be set to lose his ancestral home as the trustees of the Savernake Estate look to sell Tottenham House . The dilapidated Tottenham House is the main property on the 4,500-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire . According to a report in The Times, property tycoon Jamie Ritblat is in discussions with the trustees to buy the Grade 1-listed, 19th Century Palladian mansion. It is believed however the final sale may not go ahead or may be held up by litigation. The Earl, 60, meanwhile, who is taking legal action to remove the trustees from the estate, has vowed to fight any sale of the house. He said today: 'I am in a London meeting all day, doing everything necessary to block that sale arranged by two men who have taken over half a million from my estate without my permission. 'My claim in the High Court against these two trustees is that they have taken over £500,000 from my Estate without my consent.' The Earl went on to say: 'That matter needs to get sorted first, . and then I can turn my hand to finding another hotelier who wants to . make Tottenham House a very elegant hotel that befits the building.' The Earl (pictured, left, and right, with his second wife Joanne) is taking legal action in an attempt to remove the trustees of the estate. The Earl, the heir apparent to the Marquessate of Ailesbury, has been engaged in a vicious legal battle with the two trustees of the estate. When he . moved to America to live for four years, the Earl appointed the trustees . – John Moore, a barrister’s clerk, and Wilson Cotton, an accountant – . to help him manage Savernake. The Earl is the father of Bo Bruce, who starred on TV talent show The Voice . But he has accused them of refusing to give him access to his own money. The trustees, one of whom was a friend of the Earl, have also made 14 criminal allegations against him, ranging from damaging pheasant feeders to spitting at them, although none of the charges resulted in a conviction. In August the Earl, whose name is David Brudenell-Bruce, said he was 'absolutely thrilled' at the prospect of becoming a father again in November with his second wife Joanne. The Earl, who is estranged from his daughter Bo Bruce, who starred on The Voice, was first married to Rosamund Jane in 1980, but she asked for a divorce in 2005. The Earl left the UK for America and appointed the two trustees of the estate. But when he returned they refused to give up control of the estate, leading him to take legal action which will culminate in December. Savernake Estate trustee John Moore refused to comment on anything to do with the sale of Tottenham House today. The barrister's clerk said: 'I cannot comment on things which are connected with the Trust affairs, because I am a trustee. That is the legal position of all trustees. 'When something is happening that doesn't meet with the approval of some people, or, in this case, one person involved we are not allowed by law to comment.'","Trustees of Savernake Estate look to sell £10m Tottenham House .

"America's biggest boasters are on the West Coast. Residents of California and Washington came in as the top self-promoters on social media, according to a recent survey. On the other end of the spectrum, Utah and Oregon came in as the most humble of all the states. Self promotion: Residents of California and Washington came in as the top self-promoters on social media, according to a recent survey . A poll conducted by urban exploring app Hey Lets asked 2,500 respondents how many social media posts they made about typically 'self-promotional' topics, such as special events or exotic travel. They found that for Californians, a whopping 77 percent of their social media output was potentially self promotional, with 76 percent for Washingtonians. In Utah it was only 22 percent and in Oregon only 26 percent. All that social media hype might actually be anti-social, according to a study published in Psychological Science in October. In a paper titled The Unforeseen Costs of Extraordinary Experience, researchers described finding that a person's singular experience brings little pleasure to those hearing about it second hand. A person who, say, had an incredible vacation or enjoyed the opportunity to test drive a luxury car enjoyed increased nonsocial pleasure. Study: A study in Psychological Science found people took nonsocial pleasure in extraordinary experiences but did not enjoy trying to talk about that experience with others . But afterwards, the person felt he or she did not derive any social pleasure from talking to peers about the experience and instead came out feeling worse than if they simply had an everyday experience. 'It’s a timely question, given how much people are sharing and bragging about their experiences through social media,' Cassie Mogilner, an assistant professor of marketing at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told the New York Times. 'This suggests that people may be rolling their eyes at all those posts about amazing vacations.' Drawing from a pool of 68 participants, the study's authors broke subjects up into groups of four, showing three people a video other groups had rated two stars, while one lucky person watched a video rated four stars. When the groups came together to discuss their experience, the one who had experienced the extraordinary movie enjoyed the socializing less. 'Our subjects thought they would be the star of the interaction, and they were surprised they were left out of it,' said co-author Daniel T. Gilbert, a Harvard social psychologist. 'They didn’t understand why everyone else wanted to commiserate” about the bad movie “rather than hear about their great one.' As for what got promoted most in social media updates, Hey Lets found survey subjects talked most about trips they had taken, followed by unique events attended and encounters with celebrities.","Urban exploration app Hey Lets surveyed 2,500 individuals .

"Nicole Kidman's father died of a heart attack inside a Singapore hotel restaurant shortly after completing his morning exercise, according to reports. The Sydney psychologist is believed to have collapsed when he was inside the Wheelhouse restaurant at the Tanglin Club - a private hotel he had been staying at while visiting his daughter Antonia and six grandchildren during their school holidays. A doctor and guests at the hotel who were present  tried to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived and he was taken to hospital,The Straits Times reported. Police confirmed that he died at Tan Tock Seng Hospital about 10am and were now  investigating the exact cause of death.

A similar statement was released by Nicole Kidman's publicist in the U.S. Leslee Dart said: 'Nicole and her family are in shock by the sudden death of her father. She appreciates the outpouring of support and kindly requests privacy during this very difficult time. Thank you.' A hospital source was reeling from the shock of the news. 'We don't know how to deal with this at the moment or how to digest the fact he's gone,' the source told News Corp Australia. Dr Kidman was a clinical psychologist at Royal North Shore Hospital and a director of health psychology at the University of Technology Sydney. He was in Singapore spending time with his youngest daughter, Antonia, who lives in Singapore with husband Craig Marran  the managing director of Credit Captial Markets Global Banking.

Network Ten reported earlier that Dr Kidman was visiting Nicole's younger sister Antonia who lives in Singapore with her husband Craig Marran and her six children. As well as his work as a clinical psychologist, he has done research into the psycho-social impact of diseases, including breast cancer. He  also ran community service seminars on aspects of mental health, was a regular speaker on radio and television and wrote for academic journals and the general public. He was awarded an Order of Australia in 2005 for his contributions to clinical psychology. The family was last seen together in Sydney back in January for Dr Kidman and his wife, Janelle's 50th wedding anniversary. In June this year, a beaming Nicole Kidman, 46 walked the red carpet with her father and husband Keith Urban at the Swisse Celebrate Life Ball in Melbourne. In one of his last public statements, Dr Kidman wrote of the pointless pursuit of happiness. In the article titled 'Forget happiness, search for meaning', Dr Kidman wrote about the importance of striving for achievable goals in life, with a focus on being contented with what you have rather than on a life of material wealth. Nicole Kidman was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1967, while her parents were studying abroad. The family moved to Sydney's North Shore when the actress was four.

Nicole Kidman has previously been quoted describing her father as a 'great' man that she could rely on at any time of the day. 'He's a great father, I can call him at three in the morning and he's there for me,' she said. 'By the time I was a teenager, I had developed skills as a writer, and my father encouraged me to think about a career in journalism.' 'I began keeping a diary, which I maintain to this day. I used to fill whole notebooks with my writings.' 'My parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination, but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it.' She said her family once told her that she couldn't become an actress because of her height. 'They said that I couldn't be an actress because I would be taller than all my leading men, so I thought I would be a writer instead.' But despite this she said her parents have always been supportive of her career in acting. 'They allowed me any artistic outlet I wanted.' 'Each weekend I'd go to the theatre at Phillip Street. I used to just lock myself in there for the whole weekend. I thought it was fantastic. I'd be teased a lot though, because I'd be going off to the theatre instead of going to the beach with the boys and all the girls. I felt like an outsider because of that.'

"The first portraits created from 3D scans of a sitting president are going on display at the Smithsonian. Digital imaging specialists at the Smithsonian created a 3D printed bust and life mask of President Barack Obama this year. The portraits were first shown at the White House during a gathering of inventors, entrepreneurs and students. First ever: A 3D printed bust of President Obama went on display at the Smithsonian Castle, along with life masks that were also printed in plastic . Life masks: The president's life mask, here with masks made of President Lincoln (left and center) and his bust are made out of thousands of layers of plastic melted together using lasers . The portraits went on display Tuesday at the Smithsonian Castle. They will be on view through December. The president's face was scanned by experts from the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies. The photo shoot included 50 custom-built LED lights, eight sports photography cameras and six wide angle cameras to gather the data needed for the 3D image of President Obama. The Smithsonian team then used handheld 3-D scanners and traditional single-lens reflex cameras to record peripheral 3-D data to create an accurate bust. The bust was 3D printed using a laser to melt plastic together in 5,000 layers. It took 40 hours to print, and because it's plastic, the material will be durable over time, said image specialist Adam Metallo. High tech: The photo shoot (pictured) included 50 custom-built LED lights, eight sports photography cameras and six wide angle cameras to gather the data needed for the 3D image of President Obama . Scanners: The actual scanning took about 5 minutes. The result was a 3D scan of the president at a higher resolution that is currently possible to print in 3D . Lifelike masks are nothing new, of course, though the technology is. Plaster masks were created of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln's faces during their lives, and they are kept in the Smithsonian collection. 'We were really inspired by our experience with the Lincoln life masks,' said Gunter Waibel, director of the Smithsonian's digitization program. The group has made 3D scans and prints to replicate the original Lincoln masks from early and late in the Civil War. They have proven especially popular with school groups using the Smithsonian's 3D scans. 'There's a very, very deep connection that gets made when you have accurate data of a person's face and that person was a part of history,' Waibel said. 'People really felt the Lincoln life masks deeply spoke to them and connected them to a place, a time, a life and ultimately a legacy of the 14th president.' The group has made 3D scans and prints to replicate original plaster-cast Lincoln masks from early and late in the Civil War. They have proven especially popular with school groups using the Smithsonian's 3D scans. The portraits went on display Tuesday at the Smithsonian Castle. They will be on view through December . But past presidential masks were created through plaster casting that required a president to sit with plaster on his face, breathing through straws stuck in his nose. So the Smithsonian set out to update that process with 21st century technology to make it fast and easy. The team proposed a scan of Obama in 2013, and the White House agreed. Obama joined them for about 15 minutes in the White House. The actual scanning took about 5 minutes. The result was a 3D scan of the president at a higher resolution that is currently possible to print in 3D. 'You can see down to the wrinkles in the skin and the pores on his face,' said Vince Rossi, a 3D imaging specialist. For centuries, artists have used the latest technology to create imagery of leaders, whether it was busts chiseled out of marble, paintings or photographs. 'We think we've really added a new genre to portraiture,' Waibel said. 'It will be fascinating to see how that will be picked up and how down the line other administrations will also use that particular tool.' Ultra-realistic: The plastic material makes the portraits very durable and also ultra-realistic. The president's face was scanned and replicated down to the tiniest wrinkles .","Digital imaging specialists at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington created a 3D bust and life mask of President Barack Obama this year .

"A review into social media and its role in children's suicides 'glorifies and normalises suicidal behaviours' a recent study has shown. The Commission for Children and Young People in Queensland, concerned at   suicide rates amongst Australian youngsters, released some of the 140 submissions they have made on Sunday night, exploring the way social media plays a part. One child a week commits suicide, with another 50-60 admitted to hospital for self-harming - and boys are twice as likely to end their own lives than girls, writes The Australian. More and more Australian youngsters are exposed to suicide via the internet and socia media, sparking some copycat cases says a new submission by the Commission for Children and Young People in Queensland . The submission report, spear-headed by Megan Mitchell, the National Children's Commissioner says that several have killed themselves after looking up instructions on the internet. But even more worrying, some of the 140 submissions that were released on Sunday show that youngsters can be drawn into the social leverage and immortalisation it gives them. There is proof that one teenager chose to end her life after seeing the outpouring of grief another youngster had received online after killing herself, with one user's condolence message attracting 190 likes. The submission says: 'It can be interpreted that there is clearly a social status in not only knowing a suicide occurred but even more so in contributing and participating in the shared grief. There is a social reward for this behaviour.' Because the internet and SMS has replaced the traditional way in which children and teenagers communicate,  access to suicide is instantaneous and un-policed. 'The fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death,' says the submission . More than 2000 young people have signed up to websites set up in memory of recent youngsters who committed suicide in Queensland, even though the majority didn't even know the troubled teenagers. That figure is five times the number of people who would usually be exposed to suicide in the community. 'The instant outpouring of grief and love means that 'young people are actively engaging in activities that expose them to youth suicide, such as seeking out suicide tribute pages online,' says the submission. 'The fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death.' A quick Google search flags up pro-suicide websites and the report clearly states, 'There are pro-suicide forums with content that glorifies and normalises suicidal behaviours'. 'The fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death,' says the submission . According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare there were 18,277 hospitalisations for young people intentional self-harming between the ages of 3 and 17 in 2007 and 2013. And 333 youngsters between the ages of four and 17 died from their injuries which were cause by self-harming between 2007 - 2012. Alarmingly the report also found that of the 187 Queensland children and youngsters who have committed suicide, one third  knew someone who had done it before them. The National Children's Commissioner is demanding the government to do more on a national level to raise awareness and train those who are in a position to spot the risks and warning signs before it's too late. If you are suicidal, self-harming, depressed or need someone to talk to contact Beyond Blue or Kids Helpline or dial them on 1 800 55 1800.","One child a week commits suicide in Australia .

"This is the terrifying moment two carriages on an amusement ride at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland collided while spinning almost 200ft up in the air. Footage of the heart-stopping moment when the two carriages hit each other was captured by spectators filming the ride at ground level. The attraction, called the Sky Swing, can be seen spinning in circles as expected, before a gust of wind appears to begin heaving two carriages towards each other. Scroll down for video . The two carriages collided (circled) after a gust of wind blew them together nearly 200ft above ground . Footage of the heart-stopping moment when the two carriages hit each other was captured by spectators . They eventually collide, after which the ride is abruptly stopped. After initially joking about how close together some of the carriages were swinging, those filming the incident reacted with shock when they witnessed the collision. One said: 'It looks like its going to hit her. See that? It him them.' His friend then responds: 'Oh my God it's hit them. They've stopped the ride.' The video was posted on Facebook by a woman named Leanne Williams, who offered a stark warning to those visiting the attraction. The carriage was seen swinging wildly moments before it collided with people sat in a separate carriage . After the close encounter, the ride stopped spinning and the carriages were dropped to the ground . She wrote: 'Just a warning to any one who goes to Winter Wonderland (Cardiff) be aware of this ride. 'Watch and see what happens. Scariest moment of my life.' Onlookers said operators of the giant Sky Swing ride were making sure every carriage was filled today to avoid a repeat of the collisions which terrified passengers 200ft above the ground. Passengers who paid £5 each to enjoy the ride waited for as long as 20 mins before each of the two-seater carriages had someone sitting in them. If there were not enough paying passengers then workers sat in an empty carriage to stop it swinging wildly in the strong winds.

"Mexican immigrants illegally enter the United States every day, often scaling 18-foot-tall fences in the hope of finding work or, in some cases, trafficking drugs. But one woman picked the wrong day and the wrong place to cross over, jumping into America just a few yards away from four US senators who were visiting the Arizona border as part of a fact-finding tour. Republican Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Democrat Michael Bennet of Utah and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York were near the town of Nogales when the illegal immigrant made her mad dash and ended up in the waiting arms of US Customs and Border Patrol officers. McCain tweeted the surprising event Wednesday afternoon. 'Just witnessed a woman successfully climb an 18-ft bollard fence a few yards from us in #Nogales,' he wrote. 'Border Patrol successfully apprehended her, but incident is another reminder that threats to our border security are real.' Four US senators (L to R), Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Michael Bennett and Jeff Flake, toured the Mexico border and witnessed a woman jumping the border fence and entering the country illegally. Border patrol agents meet regularly with cattle ranchers near Nogales, Arizona, the town whose border fence the senators visited. Drug smugglers and 'coyotes' who herd illegal immigrants across the border for a price, often show up on ranches before they make their way north . The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2008 that there were 11 million immigrants with no documentation living illegally in the United States. Most of them crossed the border from Mexico. But the Christian Science Monitor reported in 2006 that an Arizona labor union representing border patrol agents estimated that the number was somewhere between 12 million and 15 million. The Pew Research Center published data in 2010 that showed 63 percent of adult illegal immigrants had been living in the US for at least 10 years. President Barack Obama has put political muscle behind an effort, first announced in a 2012 White House Rose Garden speech, to mainstream illegal immigrants into US society and provide them with a path toward legal status - and, some say, citizenship. Some Republican lawmakers have claimed the administration's efforts are aimed at creating a new class of Hispanic voters who, like many African-Americans after President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs took effect, would show their gratitude with Democratic Party loyalty. But Obama has said his initiative is more about fairness and practicality than politics. Giving illegal immigrants some sort of legal documentation would allow federal and state government agencies to track their whereabouts, tax their earnings and get an accurate sense of ow many of them are in the country. Conservatives counter that among the costs associated with granting legal status to illegal immigrants, the health care costs alone would put an unprecedented strain on the federal budget, driving up annual deficits post the point where new tax revenues could offset them. They also don't relish the idea of rewarding unlawful behavior with what amounts to a gradual amnesty, providing new incentives for more immigrants to cross the border, or displacing American citizens from jobs that have become scarce in a down economy. U.S. Border Patrol agents detain thousands of illegal immigrants annually at the southern border of Arizona. Agents Colleen Agle and Richard Funke were photographed patrolling along the border fence at the town of Nogales, Arizona. A Mexican immigrant jumped a fence like this one Wednesday as four US senators stood and watched during a fact-finding tour . Obama described his plan in 2012 as the eventual outcome of a series of executive orders that would not need congressional approval. But Republicans in Congress suggested they could hold up the funding required to implement those orders unless the Department of Homeland Security made a serious effort first to seal the border with Mexico. The four senators who visited the border Wednesday are part of a larger group of lawmakers, the so-called Gang of Eight, who are shaping and negotiating details of an immigration reform package. When Congress reconvenes in April, that package is expected to be made public . Sen. McCain's spokesman would not comment on the episode at the Arizona-Mexico border beyond pointing MailOnline to the senator's tweets. Spokespersons for Sens. Flake, Schumer and Bennet did not respond to requests for comment.","'Just witnessed a woman successfully climb an 18-ft bollard fence a few yards from us in #Nogales,' Sen. John McCain tweeted .

"Shaun Fagan, who died while receiving treatment for pneumonia at the Harley Street Clinic in central London . A doctor in charge of a father-of-two who died at a Harley Street clinic says a senior nurse failed to check his oxygen tube when she noticed it had slipped. Doctor Rashid Suleman told an inquest he believed 50-year-old Shaun Fagan's life could have been saved if the nurse Lermo Lindero had properly checked his oxygen tube when she noticed it had slipped. Mr Fagan, 50, was receiving treatment for pneumonia at the Harley Street Clinic in central London when he suffered cardiac arrest after his air supply was affected. The independent financial advisor was starved of oxygen as staff attempted to resuscitate him, Westminster Coroner’s Court was told. Despite managing to stabilise Mr Fagan, he suffered 'catastrophic' brain injuries and his family were forced to switch off his life support machine eight days later. He was married to wife Sandra and had two sons. His family slammed the care he received at the clinic and say doctors prevented them having one last conversation with him. Sports fanatic Mr Fagan, of Mill Hill, north London, was admitted to Barnet Hospital with chest pains on September 16. He was then transferred to the clinic with a severe lung infection two days later. Dr Suleman also blamed the experienced nurse for errors during attempts to reinsert the tube when it became clear it was not providing an air supply. Shortly after he gave evidence at Westminster Coroner's Court this morning, Coroner Fiona Wilcox adjourned the hearing to enable Nurse Lindero to seek legal representation. Financial analyst Mr Fagan was starved of oxygen and suffered a cardiac arrest when his ventilator tube slipped while he was treated for pneumonia at the prestigious Harley Street Clinic on September 22 last year. Nurse Lindero told the inquest she had noticed Mr Fagan's ventilator tube, known as an ETT, had slipped 'one to two centimetres' from his mouth when she went to assess him after seeing his heart rate drop. But she said she did not check it was correctly in place and failed to pass the information on to Dr Suleman when he answered the emergency call after the patient went into cardiac arrest. Dr Suleman told the hearing he received a 'brief account of events leading up to the cardiac arrest' from Nurse Lindero when he arrived in Mr Fagan's room. Coroner Wilcox asked Dr Suleman: 'Was any mention at all made of the ETT?' He replied: 'I was not made aware of any incidents at all regarding the ETT.' Coroner Wilcox said: 'If Sister Lindero did have any concerns about the ETT, for example if it had moved, would you expect that information to be passed on?' 'Yes,' Doctor Suleman said, adding: 'A clear airway is first and foremost the important thing when managing a cardiac arrest. 'On initial inspection of the upper airway I found the tube was not going through the vocal chords but was disappearing out the back and into the oesophagus. 'I informed the team it was dislodged. I cut the tube and removed it and asked for an oxygen mask.' By the time the mask was placed on Mr Fagan's face, he had been starved of oxygen for at least 15 minutes, causing him 'catastrophic' hypoxic brain injuries, the inquest heard. Dr Suleman went on to describe how Nurse Lindero, described by the Coroner as a senior member of staff with many years' experience, then hindered his attempts to reinsert a new ETT. He said: 'In this case, she went on to remove the bougie [a guiding aid for the air tube before I had sufficient time to advance the ETT far enough for it to be in the trachea. 'Given the importance the lack of oxygen in Mr Fagan was, I immediately removed the tube and reinserted the oxygen mask instead of wasting time looking for other ways to confirm the position.' Mr Fagan had been receiving treatment for pneumonia at the Harley Street Clinic, pictured, after being transferred from Barnet Hospital . Mr Fagan had then been without oxygen for at least 15 minutes and Dr Suleman told the inquest it was his experience that patients would start to suffer brain injury between three and five minutes without air. Coroner Wilcox, addressing Dr Suleman, said: 'If support had been given to Mr Fagan at about 6.31am, could his brain injury have been averted?' 'In my opinion, yes,' he said. 'Steps should have been taken to confirm whether the airway was secured or in the appropriate position.' Coroner Wilcox then adjourned the inquest until next month to allow Nurse Lindero to seek legal representation. Her decision to delay the hearing, which had been expected to conclude today, reduced members of Mr Fagan's family to tears in the public gallery. The Coroner said: 'The evidence we have heard this morning has taken this inquiry in a different and unexpected direction. 'The evidence clearly suggests there was an omission by Miss Lindero that may have caused or contributed to Mr Fagan's death. 'It is properly arguable that, had she done something to rescue that compromised airway, we would not be here at all. Because of the seriousness of that I feel we have no choice but to adjourn.' Earlier Doctor Carlos Gomez, in charge of Mr Fagan’s care, told the inquest: 'He was in severe respiratory distress, struggling to breath, move or talk. 'He was receiving oxygen through a tight-fitting mask, but we decided to put him on a ventilator to pre-empt him requiring emergency breathing assistance.' Mr Fagan’s wife, Sandra, said she and her sons were not informed of the decision to place him on a ventilator, robbing them of their last chance to speak to him. In a statement read to the court, she said: 'The nurses said they were putting lines in him for the antibiotics and would be about 30 minutes. 'After about an hour-and-a-half I became troubled as still no-one had come to see me. They never said anything about putting him on a ventilator. 'I was particularly upset about the complete lack of communication. It would have been better if they would have explained what they were doing and why.' Dr Gomez said that in hindsight he 'regretted' not keeping the family informed. He said: 'I wish Mrs Fagan had the chance to say goodbye.' Mrs Fagan said she had serious concerns about the treatment her husband had received at the Clinic, adding: 'He was a fit and healthy man. 'He loved golf and exercising at the gym. He had a very active social life, attending charity events. Westminster Coroner's Court, pictured, heard that a nurse failed to tell her supervisor about the displaced tube . 'I have lost my husband and my two sons have lost their father. I have a number of concerns about his treatment at the Harley Street Clinic. 'I don’t understand how they allowed this tube to become dislodged when he was paralysed for so long.' Mr Fagan was given sedation drugs after he started to resist the ventilator and was pumped with five different types of antibiotics to try and fight the lung infection, the inquest heard. But on September 22, six days after he was admitted to the Clinic, he suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after 6.35am as he lay paralysed in bed. Data recorded on the ventilator showed Mr Fagan’s oxygen levels had plummeted in the minutes leading up to his cardiac arrest. Coroner Fiona Wilcox asked Dr Gomez: 'Would it be fair to say this dislodging led to a lack of oxygen and then the damage to his brain and his subsequent death? 'And would it be fair to say that, but for the dislodgement, this death wouldn’t have occurred at this time?' Dr Gomez replied: 'Yes'. Nurse Lermo Lindero, who rushed to Mr Fagan’s room after seeing his heart rate drop on monitors at the nursing station, told the inquest: 'His heart rate slowed down to 40 from 60 or 70. 'At the time, the line was flat and there were no numbers on the screen. 'I heard a colleague say they had increased the oxygen to 100 per cent. Then I saw the ETT (oxygen tube) was one to two centimetres away from his lips.” She added: 'The saturation probe was not in the right place. It could have been disconnected from the monitor.' Asked if she checked the connection, Ms Lindero said: 'No'. Asked what she did next, the nurse said: 'It did not come to my mind to do anything because it happened quickly. 'I told my colleague to perform CPR and put out the call. People arrived in less than two minutes.' Claire Fazan, of Leigh Day Solicitors representing the family, said: 'The inquest being on the anniversary of the events in question has obviously been very distressing for the family. 'As you can imagine they are enormously distressed that they now have to wait even longer for answers. Beyond that, they have no comment to make.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Shaun Fagan was receiving treatment for pneumonia at Harley Street Clinic .

"She had, as French President Francois Mitterand once memorably opined, the eyes of Caligula and the mouth of Marilyn Monroe'. Now Margaret Thatcher has been named the owner of one of the most influential hairstyles ever created - all thanks to her trademark coiffed blonde locks. Asked to nominate the most iconic hairstyles of all times, a poll of 2,000 British women found that Mrs Thatcher's look remains popular and even beat the long, flowing locks of the Duchess of Cambridge. Scroll down for video . Triumphant: Mrs Thatcher's coiffed blonde look has been named one of the most influential styles ever made . Most popular of all though, was Jennifer Aniston's iconic 'Rachel' haircut, a look that was widely copied in the late 90s and early noughties following the transatlantic success of Friends. Second place in the poll was taken by Marilyn Monroe's platinum blonde bob, while late singer Amy Winehouse and her trademark beehive came third. In fourth place was Princess Diana whose short blonde crop came well ahead of her daughter-in-law's long locks which could only manage 10th spot. 60s designer Mary Quant, famous for her short graphic bob, came fifth while sixth place went to eccentric 80s singer Grace Jones.

Next on the list was Mrs Thatcher and her famously helmet-like head of hair, with Mia Farrow and Annie Lennox taking eighth and ninth places. Like Mrs Thatcher, who kept her trademark style in place until her death last year, almost a third of the women asked said they rarely changed their look. That was despite four in 10 saying they felt more attractive after a cut and 15 per cent worrying about men judging them on their hairstyle. What all agreed upon is that healthy hair is important with more than a quarter saying greasy hair was particularly unattractive. Sheryl Franklin-Worth, Corporate Affairs Manager at Amway UK, which conducted the poll, said: 'Having healthy great looking hair increases a woman's confidence and how she feels about herself. 'If she has beautiful, thick luscious hair then she feels confident and can achieve anything she puts her mind to. 'It is great so see that the women who came out on top are all iconic and powerful women.' Top five: Mary Quant's iconic pixie cut earned her the final spot in the top five along with Amy Winehouse .

"A chlorine gas leak at a suburban Chicago hotel hosting an annual Midwest furry convention sent 19 people to hospitals because of nausea and dizziness and forced the evacuation of thousands of guests, including many in cartoonish animal costumes. Investigators believe the early Sunday leak at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in Rosemont was caused intentionally and are treating it as a criminal matter. The Rosemont Public Safety Department says authorities responded to the hotel at around 12.45am. Scroll down for video . Attack on the furries? Furry convention attendees console one another after a chlorine gas release, which police believe was intentional, ruined the annual Midwest FurFest just outside Chicago early Sunday . Gased: Rattled furries, many of them clad in the animal costumes that have become synonymous with their subculture, wait outside the Hyatt Regency O'Hare after a deliberate chlorine gas release . Sabotage: It was evacuated because of high levels of chlorine gas in the air. The source appeared to be powdered chlorine found in a 9th-floor stairwell . Show must go on: Officials assured attendees Sunday afternoon that the convention events would continue as scheduled despite the apparent attack . It was evacuated because of high levels of chlorine gas in the air. The source appeared to be powdered chlorine found in a 9th-floor stairwell. Police say the manner through which the gas was dispersed 'suggests an intentional act,' reports the Chicago Tribune. Now police are investigating the incident as a crime. 'It was shocking,' attendee Morgan Smejkal, who was visiting Midwest FurFest from Iowa, told the Tribune. Photos from the aftermath of the apparent attack showed groups of rattled conventioneers, some still wearing elaborate animal costumes, standing outside the Hyatt as EMTs whisked away those who'd taken ill. 'A lot of people thought this was just someone pulling the fire alarm,' 27-year-old Thomas Zell told the Tribune. 'But it was serious this time.' As the convention returned to its regularly scheduled programming Sunday, event officials struggled to keep an optimistic atmosphere after someone tried ruining the annual celebration of all things furry . According to WikiFur: . Someone who says they are furry is generally expressing an interest in anthropomorphic animals and/or creatures (and perhaps some affiliation to). They may express that that interest in a variety of ways - through art and stories through to roleplay and performance. How deep or meaningful an interest in Furry is varies greatly from person to person. Some furries look at their affiliation to and/or expression of an anthropomorphic animal--called a fursona--as a means of expressing how they feel they truly are, that is 'an animal in a human body' Other furries are more akin to Comic Con attendees in that they dress in costumes that mimic their favorite cartoon characters. Some furries express themselves through the 'fursuiting' that the group has become so synonymous with, but others express their furrydom without the use of actual fur. Still other furries derive sexual pleasure out of dressing like anthropomorphic animals and may dress in costumes that may be worn during sexual acts. Arm-in-arm: The entire Hyatt Regency was evacuated just after 1am Sunday morning . Sickened: Nineteen were taken to hospitals complaining of nausea and dizziness after the gas released . All-clear: The hotel remained evacuated for hours until after 4am, when an all-clear was finally given by a hazmat team . Terrifying: The Hyatt Regency O'Hare was cmopletely evacuated for several hours . Facilities near the Rosemont hotel accommodated guests after the hotel was completely evacuated at 1.10am. According to a FurFest statement, a team in full hazmat gear responded to the scene as some attendees waited anxiously outside. 'At 4:21 AM the all-clear was given and we worked with the Hyatt staff to return all of our guests to the hotel in the quickest and safest manner possible,' reads the FurFest statement. In spite of the rattling night, the events for Sunday were scheduled to all go on as planned. 'All events scheduled for today will continue to operate on schedule. We are all running on little sleep. Your patience is appreciated,' organizers tweeted Sunday before noon. The hotel is hosting the 2014 Midwest FurFest convention, where attendees dress as animals to celebrate art, literature and performance. Chlorine, a chemical used in industry and water purification process, was first introduced as a chemical weapon at Ypres in World War I with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time. According to the National Institutes of Health: . Acute exposures can result in symptoms of acute airway obstruction including wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and/or dyspnea. Clinical signs, including hypoxemia, wheezes, rales, and/or abnormal chest radiographs may be present. More severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Up to 1% of exposed individuals die. In October, Iraqi officials said Islamic State (IS) militants used chlorine gas during fighting with security forces and Shiite militiamen in September north of Baghdad. In the attacks, about 40 troops and Shiite militiamen were slightly affected by the chlorine and showed symptoms consistent with chlorine poisoning, such as difficulty in breathing and coughing, the three officials said. The troops were treated in hospital and quickly recovered. In neighboring Syria, a joint U.N. fact-finding mission sent to investigate alleged chlorine attacks was ambushed and briefly detained by armed men earlier this year in rebel-held territory. The mission had said it was virtually certain chlorine had been used as a chemical weapon in the country's north. ISIS forces have used chlorine gas as a weapon, according to Iraqi officials .","The nearly 20 attendees at Midwest Furfest outside Chicago were rushed to hospitals after midnight Sunday .

"Food mash-ups seem to be all the rage these days, with the rise of the cronut and more recently the Ramen Burger causing a buzz in the culinary world. But one fusion creation has been satisfying the appetites of San Francisco's fast food fans for the last two years. The sushi burrito - sushi wrapped in a huge burrito - has been gaining notoriety in the city since Peter Yen and chef Ty Mahler unveiled their creation long before the latest craze for culinary clashes. Sushi burritos have been satisfying the appetites of San Francisco's diners for the last two years . The restaurant chain has opened three stores in San Francisco . Their business, Sushirrito, currently runs three shops in the city selling its unique brand of Asian and Latin fast food. According to Business Insider, the company has been operating in the city for the last two years. The company sells a variety of sushi burritos, such as the Sumo Crunch, featuring surimi crab and shaved cabbage, and the Geisha's Kiss, which is made from yellowfin tuna. According to its website, the business was founded by Mr Yen, who was frustrated with the lack of choice in restaurants selling sushi in downtown San Francisco. In 2010 he joined forces with Ty Mahler, the former executive chef of Roy's Hawaiian Fusion in the city, to create Sushirrito. Earlier this month MailOnline reported how the latest food craze to hit the streets of New York City was the Ramen Burger. The company sells a variety of sushi burritos including the Geisha's Kiss, which is made from yellowfin tuna . The creation of chef Keizo Shamamoto is a juicy hunk of meat topped with scallions and arugula and stuffed between two mounds of fried noodles. And in May the cronut - half croissant, half donut - was revealed to the world before quickly becoming a culinary craze. The cronut is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian vanilla cream.","Fusion of sushi and burritos has gained notoriety in San Francisco .

"A serving British soldier has left his base to join Kurdish fighters battling against Islamic State jihadists in Iraq, it has emerged. The 19-year-old, who is understood to be a private serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, is the first UK soldier to have abandoned the Army to fight Islamist jihadists. In a text message to his mother before he went to fight, he wrote: 'I really want and need to do this and I will be safe... I'm so sorry to put you through this.' It is believed the soldier, who is said to have once shared a barracks with murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby, had previously gone to Iraq  to train the Kurdish Peshmerga. The 19-year-old is said to have told his family that helping the Kurdish peshmerga in their battle against the extremists in Syria and Iraq was something he 'needed to do' The soldier was stationed in Cyprus but had been on leave in Dubai when he decided to go to Iraq. His route is unknown. The man, who has not been named for security reasons, told his parents that he was leaving two days ago in a text message. A text message to his family said: ‘I have good skills and I can speak the language, I can help these people and help with this fight.’ ISIS launched its unexpected assault on the strategic Syrian border town of Kobane in September. Over the following four months, men and women belonging to the Kurdish Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG) and the the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) resistance groups defied all odds and prevented the Islamist militants capturing the city centre, while American and Arab warplanes bombarded ISIS-held buildings from above. Kurdish peshmerga forces from neighbouring Iraq later travelled to join the fight, giving the embattled ground forces a much needed boost. ISIS lifted the siege of Kobane in January after the city became little more than a death trap for them, retreating to their terror strongholds approximately 20 miles away and leaving the schools, municipal buildings and roads in Shahine's neighborhood as little more than rubble-strewn ruins. He added: 'I will get in trouble for being AWOL, but it's minor and no prison sentence.' His mother was last night understood to be beside herself with worry. The soldier is not yet officially AWOL – absent without leave – because he is still on leave. An Army source said that if he outstayed this he could face a court martial. The source added: ‘But our concern at the moment is just getting him back as quickly and as safely as possible.’ The teenager has been in the Army since leaving school at 16 and is known to have been learning Arabic. It was reported this morning that he once shared a barracks with Lee Rigby, the Fusilier who was murdered by two Islamist fanatics in the streets of Woolwich, south-east London in 2013. While he is believed to be the first serving soldier to travel to the region to fight, hundreds of former soldiers from Britain, the US and Canada are planning to do so. Ex-special forces are among those who have contacted a private security company saying they want to help the Kurds. It is understood the soldier was ‘driven by his conviction that the Kurds need the help of the British, they need help with trained soldiers who can travel to the region’, according to a Sky reporter. Correspondent Ashish Joshi, who has spoken to the family, said: ‘He speaks the language, he is travelling out there and he thinks he can make a difference to the cause.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We are aware of these reports and are looking into them.' The teenager joins a number of young Europeans who have travelled to the region to fight on behalf of the Kurds who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. It is understood he has joined a group that call themselves the Lions Of Rojava, who boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' He is understood to be a private serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment and is the first UK soldier to have abandoned the Army to fight Islamist jihadists . The serviceman, who has not been named for security reasons, was stationed in Cyprus and is believed to have travelled to the region via Dubai while on annual leave. He is thought to have then entered Iraq . The soldier is thought to be the first serving member of the Armed Forces to join the peshmerga, though a number of former servicemen are believed to have gone to fight. In December it emerged that two former British soldiers had travelled to Syria to fight against ISIS after feeling 'compelled' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning. James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobani from the brutal terror group, whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 British Muslim recruits. Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings. Earlier today, a sickening new video emerged showing hundreds of savage supporters of the Islamic State kicking, punching and stamping three terrified Syrian soldiers to death before dragging their bloodied corpses through the streets chained to the back of motorcycles. The barbaric footage is believed to have been filmed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa and bears all the chilling hallmarks of ISIS' professionally produced and edited propaganda films. The man told his friends he intended to spend a year in the region, but he is not yet officially AWOL- absent without leave - because he is officially still on annual leave . The soldier is thought to be the first serving member of the Armed Forces to join the peshmerga, though a number of former servicemen are believed to have gone to fight. Above, an ISIS militant in Raqqa, Syria . The gruesome killing of three  Syrian soldiers is just the latest in a long line of horrific filmed murders released by the Sunni Islamists since last summer's self-declaration of a caliphate in the vast areas of Syria and Iraq they control through a campaign of rape, massacre and brutal oppression. Security forces also estimate some 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria to join the conflict there, some of them with ISIS. Around half have since returned, and dozens have been arrested in Britain under anti-terrorism legislation. Peshmerga forces have been fighting IS in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq and trying to surround the city of Mosul to cut off IS supply lines from Syria. Islamic State has caused international alarm by capturing large expanses of Iraq and Syria, declaring an Islamic 'caliphate' and erasing borders between the two. British forces have been taking part in air raids on IS in Iraq but only a handful of troops remain on the ground in the country, in a training capacity. It is understood the British soldier joined a group called the Lions Of Rojava, who boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Westerners in Kurdistan: A photo of Western fighters from the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page . Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. Brothers in arms: Briton Jamie Read, right, with American Jordan Matson, who is also fighting in Syria . Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. Last October it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","Soldier reportedly left Cyprus base and travelled to Middle East to fight ISIS .

He continued: 'At Slimbridge Wetland Centre we sometimes see whole gangs of crows using a stick for a game of tag.

"A jury decided that Hugo Selenski should be sentenced to life in prison for killing a pharmacist and his girlfriend in 2002. Hugo Selenski was convicted last week on two counts of first-degree murder in the 2002 strangulation deaths of Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett. Police found their bodies, along with three other sets of human remains, in Selenski's yard in 2003. Sentencing: Hugo Selenski is led into the Luzerne County Courthouse, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.,  for opening testimony in the penalty phase of his murder trial . Gruesome discovery: Police say the bodies of Tammy Fassett and Michael Kerkowksi were found buried in Selenski's back yard in Kingston Township in 2003. The remains of three other people were also found there . First Assistant District Attorney Sam Sanguedolce said Wednesday in his closing argument that Selenski tortured Kerkowski before killing him and has a long history of violent crime. Those are two aggravating circumstances the jury can use to sentence Selenski to death. Pennsylania's governor recently declared a moratorum on the death penalty, but the law remains on the books. Prosecutors said Selenski, 41, and a co-conspirator brutally beat Kerkowski to compel him to reveal the location of tens of thousands of dollars he kept in his house then used flex ties to strangle him and Fassett. Authorities found their decomposing bodies about a year later, along with at least three other sets of human remains on Selenski's property. Justice: Geraldine Kerkowski, right, mother of Michael Kerkowski, and Michael Kerkowski's son Connor walk to the courtroom for the opening day of testimony in the penalty phase of the murder trial of Hugo Selenski . Selenski, who is already serving decades in prison for an unrelated robbery, escaped from prison months after his 2003 arrest using a rope fashioned from bed sheets, and he spent three days on the run before turning himself in. The jury reached its verdict last week after deliberating more than 11 hours over two days. It convicted Selenski of eight of 10 counts, including first-degree murder and robbery. Prosecutors and defense lawyers, under a gag order, were unable to comment on the verdict. One of Selenski's sisters cried quietly and left the courtroom after hearing the verdict. The victims' relatives remained stoic, hugging prosecutors after the jury exited. 'Thirteen years,' murmured Kerkowski's mother, Geraldine Kerkowski. Later, Selenski's brother Ronald Selenski Jr. rushed toward an elevator holding the victims' relatives and prosecutors, and pointed a finger at them. Sheriff's deputies walked him away from the elevator and put him in handcuffs. It wasn't immediately clear whether he would be charged. Hugo Selenski has been a familiar face in northeastern Pennsylvania since his 2003 arrest on charges he killed a pair of drug dealers whose charred remains also were found on the property north of Wilkes-Barre. In 2006, a jury acquitted him of one homicide and deadlocked on another but convicted him of abusing the men's corpses. After the verdict, authorities immediately charged him with killing Kerkowski and Fassett. Edward Rymsza, left, and Bernard Brown, defense attorneys for Hugo Selenski, arrive in court .The jury found Selenski guilty on all charges except conspiracy to commit robbery on Fassett and solicitation for murder on Kerkowski . Kerkowski, from Hunlock Creek, had pleaded guilty to running a prescription drug ring that netted at least $800,000 and was about to be sentenced when he and Fassett were reported missing in May 2002. They were both 37 years old. Selenski saw an opportunity to scam Kerkowski, getting the pharmacist to give him tens of thousands of dollars for legal work he never performed, prosecutors alleged. But Selenski quickly burned through all the money and needed another $10,000 to cover a check that his girlfriend, Christina Strom, had written to purchase a house, giving him a motive to rob and kill Kerkowski before the pharmacist headed to prison on the drug charges, prosecutors said. The defense contended Selenski was framed by another man, Paul Weakley, who led police to Selenski's yard in June 2003. Weakley later pleaded guilty in federal court, testified against Selenski to avoid the death penalty and could ask for a reduction of his life prison sentence because of his cooperation. The law: Prosecutors Sam Sanguedolce, left, Jarrett Ferentino, right, and Willam Finnegan, rear left, walk to the courtroom. Selenski is already serving a 32 to 65 year sentence for a violent home invasion and robbery . Weakley, who met Selenski in prison in the 1990s, told jurors how he plotted with Selenski to kill Kerkowski and then helped him carry out the crimes and bury the bodies. He described how he and Selenski bound the victims and covered their eyes with duct tape. Weakley said Kerkowski, who was beaten with a rolling pin, told them where to find his hidden bags of cash. He said Fassett was killed simply because she was with Kerkowski when they showed up at the pharmacist's house. After the killings, Selenski stole tens of thousands more dollars that Kerkowski had given to his father for safekeeping, pointing a gun at the father and threatening him, other witnesses said. The fifth body discovered on his property was never publicly identified.","Hugo Selenski, 41, was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder last week .

"Ronan Farrow has been awarded a journalism award, even though he has anchored just three broadcasts . Ronan Farrow, the news anchor with a grand total of three hours of daytime television, has received a prestigious journalism award. Yesterday the 26-year-old was handed The Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism at a ceremony in New York. The honour is named for renowned American journalist Walter Cronkite, who presented the first award in 1984. Giving such a prestigious accolade to Mr Farrow has raised eyebrows, not least with the man himself. He tweeted: 'Maybe I can earn a Cronkite award by investigating how long it'll take me to actually live up to a Cronkite award.' Before the event, organisers Reach The World banned reporters from asking 'off-topic' questions - to ensure that Farrow will not have to comment on the controversy surrounding whether his father was Woody Allen or Frank Sinatra. The organisation even threatened to throw out anyone who broke the rule. 'The theme of the evening is global education and service,' a memo to the press read, reports Politico. 'All press are required to stay strictly on message. Any press who ask guests or Mr. Farrow about off-message topics will be immediately escorted out of the event.' MSNBC denied that the diktat came from Farrow's team. A statement to the New York Post read: 'Ronan and his team did not request any restrictions on reporters' questions.' Farrow later tweeted: 'I’d never demand anyone not ask me anything, obviously. (Doesn’t mean I have to answer though.)' Farrow tweeted a tongue in cheek response to receiving the accolade . Things looked more positive in February for Farrow when he won a coveted journalism award . Despite little prior experience, MSNBC had high hopes that Farrow will help them attract millennial viewers, something which hasn't happened so far . Earlier this month Woody Allen wrote that Ronan, his son, could have been fathered by Frank Sinatra and claimed that mother Mia Farrow may have been lying about it for decades. The Annie Hall director said Ronan, his only biological child with Farrow, ‘looks a lot like Frank’ thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial features. Allen said that if it were true then Farrow would have kept a dark secret during their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support. Allen’s claims were in response to an article in Vanity Fair magazine in which Farrow said that Sinatra was ‘possibly’ Ronan’s father. Writing in the New York Times, he also for the first time publicly addressed allegations he abused his adopted daughter Dylan and called them ‘ludicrous’. Woody Allen has questioned whether Ronan Farrow is his biological son. There is speculation that Frank Sinatra is his real father .","MSNBC anchor given prestigious journalism award despite inexperience .

"These haunting photographs capture the huge cloud of ash from a Japanese volcano that swept towards a hiker just seconds before killing him. The images - which were taken last Saturday  on Mount Ontake - show the moments immediately after the volcano erupted, sending dense plumes of gas and ash high into the sky and leaving at least 47 people dead, with a further 16 people still unaccounted for. Among the victims of the volcano was 59-year-old hiker Izumi Noguchi, whose body was found near Mount Ontake's summit shrine compound. Search and rescue teams recovering his body discovered his camera and among the photographs he had taken were images of the a huge cloud of ash creeping ever closer to him following the eruption. His wife Hiromi has now opted to make the images public as a tribute to Mr Noguchi's memory. The images emerged as doctors determined that almost all of those killed on Mount Ontake died of injuries relating to rocks flying out of the volcano. Scroll down for video .

Rescuers have retrieved 47 bodies from the ash-covered summit area of Mount Ontake since Saturday's eruption. Authorities this morning announced that another 16 people are still missing, with search efforts suspended once again due to rain. Doctors concluded that all but one of the bodies showed signs of having been hit by volcanic boulders and rocks, Nagano prefectural police said. The other victim died of burn injuries caused by inhaling hot air. Those hit by the rocks and debris had multiple cuts and fractures, particularly in the head and the back, as well as the legs, a prefectural police official said on condition of anonymity, citing department policy. Nagano police had earlier said the victims died of 'disaster,' without specifying the cause. Most of the bodies were found near Mount Ontake's summit, where many climbers were resting or having lunch. Some bodies were retrieved from a trail at a slightly lower elevation. Experts say hikers near the summit might have been hit by rocks flying as fast as 190 miles per hour. Most of the ash fell in the first hour of the explosion, according to the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute.

The other victim died as a result of burn injuries caused by inhaling hot air . Survivors said they fled for their lives as rocks and debris rained down on them while they struggled with hot air and ash hitting their face. Medical experts who have examined some of the nearly 70 injured have said most had bruises, cuts and bone fractures on their back, an apparent sign they were hit by rocks flying out of the volcano. Some of the injured reportedly had damage to their lungs and other organs due to the impact of rocks hitting them. The eruption at Mount Ontake, located in central Japan, caught hikers by surprise. Seismologists have said that increased seismic activity had been detected at Ontake, one of 47 active volcanoes in Japan that are under 24-hour monitoring, but that nothing signaled such a big eruption. The death toll is the highest from a volcanic eruption in Japan's postwar history, exceeding the 43 people killed in the 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen in southern Japan. Ontake, Japan's second-highest active volcano, last had a minor eruption seven years ago. Researchers say predicting a steam-driven explosion is especially difficult - and even harder with limited information about a peak's past volcanic activity.

This diagram shows how the pyroclastic flow works its way down the slope, reaching incredible speeds and leaving huge rock deposits in its wake . Pyroclastic flows are one of the most destructive and deadly processes of a volcanic eruption. The flows act and look like a body of liquid but are actually composed of hot gas and rock. Formed inside the volcano by the fragmentation of magma and rocks during the eruption, they travel down the mountain slope at breakneck speeds, often incinerating everything in their path. The flows act as a fast-moving current and appear similar to a snow avalanche when they burst from the volcano. These flows, composed of volcanic rock debris and toxic gases, are usually deadly as they can reach speeds over 100 km/h and temperatures of 1,000 degrees. Although they are composed of gas and rock, the properties of pyroclastic flows mean they act more like a liquid. The heavier debris moves along the ground, covered by a gas plume which radiates upwards as it moves. Depending on the size of the rock debris carried within them, they can leave behind deep layers of rock fragments. The eruption at Mount Ontake likely triggered a pyroclastic surge, although it is thought to have been relatively cold when compared to some other documented flows. Professor Emeritus of the University of Tokyo, Shigeo Aramak, told NHK World the colour of the debris clouds seen in the footage of the erupting Mount Ontake showed the temperature was relatively low for a pyroclastic flow, which may mean magma was not present.","Images taken last Saturday by hiker Izumi Noguchi show the moments immediately after Mount Ontake erupted .

"A man has been left with serious injuries after jumping into a lion enclosure at Barcelona zoo where he was picked mauled by three of the animals. Dressed in military uniform, the man climbed over railings and began scaling one of the walls in the enclosure before being picked off by one of the animals and thrown into a pit. The 45-year-old was rescued around 30 minutes later covered in scratches and bite marks. He was taken to the city's Hospital de la Vall D'Hebron where he remains in a serious but not life-threatening condition. Scroll down for video . Mauled: The man has been left with serious injuries after jumping into a lion enclosure at Barcelona zoo . Fire fighters were forced to use power hoses to scare the lions away from the man's body after he jumped into their enclosure in Barcelona Zoo. Though covered in scratches and bite marks, the man's condition is not thought to be life-threatening . According to Spanish reports, the man climbed over fencing to enter the enclosure as horrified tourists watched on. Footage of the bizarre incident shows him scaling one of the enclosure's walls before being tossed by the leg into a pit by a lioness. He emerged some 30 minutes later after fire fighters used hoses to fight the animals off of him. According to local reports, the man, named by El Pais as Justo Jose MP, is a neo-Nazi demonstrator. He was arrested last month in the city centre after draping banners emblazoned with Swastikas over the famous Casa Mila building in an anti-abortion protest. It is not known whether the incident at the zoo was a demonstration, though fire fighters said the man could not have entered the enclosure accidentally. Zoo keepers said the animals were not trying to kill the man but were merely attempting to play with him . 'The security system makes it impossiblef for a person to fall into the enclosure. It cannot have been by accident, to enter (the enclosure) you have to want to go in,' said chief fire fighter of the Bomberos de Barcelona, Hector Carmona. While he emerged from the enclosure covered in bite marks and scratches, zoo keepers have insisted the lions were merely trying to play with him, Spanish news outlet 20minutos reports.

"Hairdresser Donna Hamer attacked her then boyfriend after a gay friend sent him a picture of a penis 'as a joke' A hairdresser furiously attacked her boyfriend with a kitchen roll holder and threatened him with a 12-inch knife after a gay friend messaged him a photo of a penis 'as a joke'. Donna Hamer, 28, 'went mad' and sank her teeth into Rick Scherzo's hands after he received the picture message on his computer. As Mr Scherzo, 30, pleaded with Hamer to stop and told her it was just a prank, she punched him in the face and shouted: 'You're gay.' She even threatened her boyfriend with a 12-inch knife and broke his phone when he tried to call the police. After the violence, Hamer, from Nelson, Lancashire, posted a string of messages on Facebook falsely claiming Mr Scherzo had beaten her up. She wrote: 'Just found out my ex is now messaging my friends on here. Tellin lies trying to justifie (sic) what he done.He can do what he wants now never again will he hurt.' But then she bombarded Mr Scherzo with more than 100 apologetic texts as she tried to win him back. Prosecuting, Enza Geldard told Burnley Magistrates' Court that the pair started their relationship at Christmas in 2013, but had broken up by March last year. A week later, Hamer told Mr Scherzo that she was pregnant, leading the pair to get back together and move into her flat. She later said she had lost the baby, with Mr Scherzo telling the police that he did not know if she was pregnant in the first place. Rick Scherzo insisted the penis picture was a prank but Hamer continued her attack, punching him in the face . Hamer, 28, also beat Mr Scherzo with a rolling pin holder and threatened him with a 12-inch chef's knife . The couple were at home in September 19 last year when the victim was chatting to his male friend, who is gay, on his computer. Miss Geldard said: 'He says Donna Hamer saw this picture and has gone mad. She started calling him gay and wouldn't let it go, although he told her it was just a joke.' Hamer, who admitted assault by beating, then punched Mr Scherzo in the face and bit both his hands as he was restraining her. She started hitting him again before the pair tried to calm the row down, the court heard. Mr Scherzo said he was going to bed and didn't want her sleeping in the same room. Hamer then began striking him again so he punched her in the face in self-defence. She went into the kitchen, returning with the 13-inch long kitchen roll pole before hitting him with it. Mr Scherzo managed to grab it off her so Hamer went into the kitchen again, coming back with a 12-inch chef's knife. She then demanded money from him they had spent on holiday flights together. Mr Scherzo said in his statement: 'I panicked when I saw her with the knife. She held it to my chest and said: ""Are you going to get me the money tomorrow?""' He tried to sleep in the living room while Hamer was in the bedroom, but she followed him and started 'kicking off again'. After warning her he would the call the police, she grabbed his phone from his hand, cracking the screen and breaking it. Violent: Hamer was handed a community order and told to attend a course to deal with her behaviour . After the attack, Hamer bombarded Mr Scherzo with more than 100 apologetic texts as she tried to win him back . Mr Scherzo added: 'In the morning I had to go to work. I told her to pack her things and get out. When I got home she gave me the keys and left. That night she placed it all over Facebook that I have beaten her up. I have blocked her so I couldn't see it, but my friends told me about it.' Throughout the next week, Hamer sent him 102 text messages, which he deleted, as well as contacting his friends. He told police: 'I just want her to leave me alone and stop texting and threatening me. I want to move on with my life and just want her to do the same.' The court was told that Mr Scherzo did not want contact with Hamer, who is pregnant with his child, but did want to be involvement in his child's life. Defence lawyer Kamran Yousaf said the incident was fuelled by alcohol and added: 'Clearly, she was aggrieved when she saw that image on the computer and confronted him. She found it offensive and disgusting, but she acted wrongly. She shouldn't have done what she did. 'She was clearly angry. She admits assaulting the complainant in order to prevent him from assaulting her. She didn't intend to injure him. She used these weapons to threaten and intimidate the victim. 'Since this incident she has stopped drinking, because of the incident and because she's pregnant. She is remorseful and regrets this incident.' Sentencing, justice of the peace David Bennett told Hamer: 'This was a serious offence and concerned us somewhat because of the nature of the offending, it was in alcohol and the presence of weapons. There is always an enormous risk and the consequences can be horrendous.' Hamer was given a community order and must attend a course to deal with her behaviour. She must also pay a £60 victim surcharge and £200 costs.","Donna Hamer attacked her boyfriend after he was sent a 'joke' penis photo .

"Two of Australia’s most wanted jihadis are suspected of starring in a sickening new Islamic State beheading video. In the execution clip, Sydney man Khaled Sharrouf - heavily bearded, dressed in khaki and holding a knife - appears to stand behind a man in black who IS claims is a ‘spy’. Watching on is a gang of men, one of whom appears to be Sharrouf’s friend and fellow terrorist Mohamed Elomar. The man who looks like Elomar holds a large rifle as he stands to the left of the man who resembles Sharrouf in the death cult's propaganda video, titled Harvest of the Apostates. A man who looks like Australian jihadi Khaled Sharrouf holds a knife (centre) and Mohamed Elomar appears to stand to his left holding a rifle . Sharrouf beheads a man dressed in black who Islamic State claim is a an 'infiltrator' The clip, in which the man on his knees is labelled an ‘infiltrator’, is being investigated by authorities, The Daily Telegraph reports. Sharrouf and Elomar both fled Australia to join the Islamic State insurgents fighting in Syria and Iraq in 2013 and in July 2014 the Australian Federal Police issued arrest warrants for the disturbed pair. Sharrouf flew out of Sydney in December 2013 using his brother’s passport and was soon followed by his convert wife Tara Nettleton who brought their five children to the Middle East with her. The men gained notoriety as part of the more than 100 Australians who have joined Islamic State after they posted disturbing photos of themselves holding up decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers last year. Sharrouf even got his seven-year-old son to hold up the severed head of a soldier in the Syrian city of Raqqa, accompanied with the caption 'that's my boy', in an image that shocked the world. Both have been active users of social media from the Islamic State frontline and The Courier Mail claims Elomar has recently contacted men in Queensland in a bid to get them to join Islamic State. Khaled Sharrouf is pictured here holding a decapitated head of a Syrian soldier last year . Mohamed Elomar has been accused of trying to recruit men living in Queensland to join IS . A man with Syrian relatives who was contact by Elomar told the paper: ‘He was saying things like “you should repent” and that by joining (ISIS) “you could make up for bad deeds”. He even offered to pay for me to travel over there.’ In January this year, four Iraqi women came forward to accuse Sharrouf and Elomar of kidnapping and enslaving them for two months. The women, who belong to the religious Yazidi minority, told ABC's 7.30 they were taken from Iraq to Syria by force, and were among thousands of others who were targeted because of their beliefs. A heavily bearded man who resembles Sharrouf leads the blindfolded man to his death . Authorities are reportedly investigating the video which was filmed near the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria . When Islamic State stormed northern Iraq in 2014, they targeted the Yazidis, an ancient Kurdish religious group which IS believes to be infidels. Since 2014, reports of the kidnapping, rape, and forced marriage of Yazidi women has been widely circulated, but the testimonies have been almost impossible to corroborate. The four Yazidi women, who asked for their names to be changed out of fear of reprisals, identified their captors from mug shots presented to them by an ABC journalist. The women kidnapped by Sharrouf and Elomar are believed to have been held on the second floor of a building on Newbridge Road, on the outskirts of Raqqa, in Syria. Australian terrorist Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton brought their five children over to the Middle East . Sharrouf shocked the world when he shared this image of his seven-year-old son holding a decaptitated head . One of the women, Layla, who claims to have been taken captive said that Sharrouf, who was jailed in Australia for his involvement in a terror plot, threatened to sell the women if they cried. 'He threatened to sell us if we did. He said, 'Why are you sad? Forget about your home and family. This is your home and we are your family now,' she told 7.30. 'Forget about your gods, for good, because we have killed them all,' she said. Sharrouf told the women that he had been beaten while in jail in Australia, and that when he got angry, he could kill someone because he had 'no mercy in [his] heart'. Another of the women, Ghazala, said that Sharrouf's five children, who are believed to be with him and his wife, participated in their terrifying ordeal. In January this year, four Iraqi women came forward to accuse Sharrouf and Elomar (pictured) of kidnapping and enslaving them for two months. Sharrouf (pictued) and Elomar are both wanted by the Australian Federal Police . 'His children were treating us badly,' Ghazala said. 'They had knives and cell phones saying that they will take videos while cutting off our heads because we follow a different religion.' Ten out of the thirteen members of Ghazala's family are still missing, along with tens of thousands of other Yazidi men, women and children. Another woman claimed that Elomar would take girls for the night, beat them and sell them on. 'At night he was taking a girl downstairs, and when the girl returned she’d tell us, ‘he told me you have to marry me or else I will sell you, and if you say anything to my wife I will sell you or kill you’,' said one of the women.","A man who looks like wanted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf holds a large knife .

"A young woman has described in great detail the horrific moment a fellow surfer was snatched from the ocean by a shark just metres from her, and the traumatic and gruesome events that followed the fatal attack. Brooke Mason, 20, was surfing at Shelly Beach  on the New South Wales north coast last Monday with a group of around eight others, including Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara. Nakahara, 41, had both his legs severed straight off in the horrific attack and was pronounced dead at the scene after losing a huge amount of blood. 'I just watched him, I thought he just got off his board took a deep breath and went in for a swim,' Ms Mason told Daily Mail Australia, speaking of the moment Nakahara was pulled underwater. Scroll down for video . Tasmanian competitive surfer Brooke Mason, 20, witnessed the horrific fatal shark attack that killed Tadashi Nakahara at Shelly Beach on the NSW north coast last week . Nakahara, 41, (left) died after a shark bit off both his legs while he was surfing last Monday . About eight other surfers were out in a group when the 41-year-old was snatched from the ocean and dragged underwater at Shelly Beach (pictured) 'I was just watching waiting for him to come back up and he didn't come back up ... The reason I knew it was a shark was there was blood everywhere in the water. It nearly reached me,' she revealed, adding she couldn't have been more than 15 metres from him. 'There wasn't a sound, it just pulled him under quiet as,' the competitive surfer continued. The Tasmanian woman said she had always had an enormous fear of sharks, but the attack was nothing like she had envisioned. She had moved to the area only days before, and the devastating attack took place during her second surf in her new home. Ms Mason described the eerie calmness and quiet of the water as she and the other surfers tried to make it back to shore safely after Nakahara had been bitten. 'Everyone was ashen faced paddling in and...There was no waves in, it was the scariest moment of my life', Ms Mason revealed. When she had almost reached the shore the young woman said she turned around to see one brave man pulling in Nakahara's disfigured body from the ocean, as another man rushed to help him. Ms Mason told of the horror of seeing blood fill the water around her and her fear that she would also be attacked . The 20-year-old had moved to the town just two days before the shark attack which has made her reconsider her professional surfing career . Ms Mason, a medical student, acted quickly once Nakahara's body was out of the water tourniquetting the man's legs with ropes from surfboards . 'As they were pulling him in I saw that he had no legs, he literally had an inch.' Having completed her first year of medical school Ms Mason acted quickly, tourniquetting the man's legs with ropes from the group's surfboards. 'I've done first year med school so I was pretty okay with seeing his body,' Ms Mason said. 'I went up and held his head while they were doing CPR. 'I was just saying things like ""it’s going to be okay, you’re going to be fine"". 'And then there was a pulse and everyone clapped and cheered, there was so much camaraderie.' Shortly after this paramedics arrived and Ms Mason rushed to meet them at the top of the sand to show them where Nakahara was laying. 'I raced up the hill to the ambulance man and he handed me a defibrillator and something else,' the young woman revealed. 'I went to run back down to the beach and he stopped me and told me to calm down. The young woman said she was shattered when paramedics told her Nakahara wasn't going to make it . Ms Mason revealed that the traumatic experience had made her even more determined to continue her medical studies . The 20-year-old medical student then helped transport Nakahara's body to a stretcher . 'I thought every second was crucial but the paramedic said to me ""This guy (Nakahara) pretty much has no hope of surviving"". 'That was shattering to hear,' Ms Mason recalled. The 41-year-old surfer's body then lay on the sand for ten minutes while a crowd of 'at least 30 people' watched on. 'They (paramedics) went over and pronounced him dead and he was just lying there for ten minutes and there was all these kids around, it was like a horror scene,' Ms Mason said. The 20-year-old medical student then helped transport Nakahara's body to a stretcher before it was taken away in an ambulance. 'Me and another girl I babysit plus a few paramedics carried the body up, and his stumps were rubbing against my arms the whole time,' Ms Mason recalled. Since the horrific attack the surfer said she's had a hard time dealing with the incident, and the traumatic experience has made her reevaluate her aspirations of being a professional surfer. 'I’m just so in shock still I can’t get the images out of my brain,' Ms Mason said. Since the horrific attack the surfer said she's had a hard time dealing with the incident . 'I’m just so in shock still I can’t get the images out of my brain,' Ms Mason said . With her best friend Leo (left) by her side Ms Mason returned to the waves just a week after the incident, in honour of Nakahara's life . 'It’s made me think I don’t want surfing to be my whole life.' She's grappled with the reason Nakahara was taken and not her or someone else, pointing out that the event has really opened her eyes to how quickly life can be taken away. 'I guess you just don’t really understand why it wasn't you, like I had my full body in the water and it doesn't make sense that he went past my legs and attacked him, I don't understand,' Ms Mason said. The student also said the horrific incident might be a push for her to continue with her medical studies and 'really make a difference in the world'. 'It’s made me really realise if I was a doctor maybe I could have saved him.' After the attack Ms Mason went home to see her parents in Tasmania, who tried to convince her to stay away from the water for good. 'My parents got so freaked out they made me come home and wanted to see me well and alive,' she revealed. But the surfer said she returned to the water just a week after Nakahara's death, to honour him and try and calm her own nerves. With her best friend Leo by her side the 20-year-old said the surf was still tough, and she had flashbacks of the attack. 'When people were falling off I kept thinking they'd been taken by a shark, I have to remind myself to calm down', Ms Mason said. '(But) it was actually a really good surf and I feel like he sent a few good waves my way,' Ms Mason revealed. (It was) just as a bit of a memorial and to celebrate his life.'","Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara was killed in a shark attack last week .

"As conflict rages around Syria, rebel groups have been using a range outlandish devices as fighting continues in besieged cities. The Free Syrian Army have little access to big weapons apart from small arms such as machine guns and often have to make their own ammunition.

The gun fires 23mm calibre bullets, that are three times the size of standard rifle ammo, with huge casings from the bullets, lying on the floor next to the gunman. What sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate, however, according to firearms expert David Dyson. He told MailOnline: 'The problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we don't know for sure what the calibre is, although there wouldn't be a lot of point in building something like this if it wasn't of a significant calibre. 'Secondly, and probably of more importance, we don't know how well it is made: is the barrel accurately machined and rifled? 'The effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used. These rounds exist [23mm] fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary projectiles.They will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones.'","Fighters in Syria have been using a range of unusual guns in Syria conflict .

"The woman who set the internet on fire last year by claiming to have three breasts has broken her silence to insist she's not a hoaxer. Jasmine Tridevil became the subject of intense online scrutiny and doubt after extraordinary images suggested she had become the first woman in the world to have an artificial third breast fitted. She has now spoken for the first time about the issue - defiantly claiming: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks.' Scroll down for video . Defiant: Jasmine Tridevil has now spoken for the first time about her third breast, claiming: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks' Many commentators claim the third breast is a wearable prosthetic - especially as she reported a '3 breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014. Breaking her silence for the first time, she added: 'Getting a third breast was not always my plan - I just had the idea two years ago. 'People always have something to say. They will criticize it or will love it and ask for a picture.' Tridevil admits not all the attention she gets is complimentary, adding: 'If I go to a park where there are children, parents will give me dirty looks. 'But if I go to a bar it seems like everybody loves it.' Scrutinized: Many commentators claim the third breast is a wearable prosthetic, especially as Tridevil once reported a '3 breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014 . The aspiring pop-star claims the procedure cost $20,000 and took around an hour and a half to complete. But she admits that she had encountered difficulty when trying to find a surgeon who would perform the procedure. She added: 'There was one surgeon who hung up on me. I think that a lot of them thought I was prank calling them but I was serious they just did not take me seriously. 'There was another surgeon who told me I was crazy and said I should check myself into a mental hospital.' She finally found a doctor who would perform the surgery but claims he made her sign a non-disclosure agreement meaning she can never reveal his name. 'The reason I got a third breast is because I wanted to make my self unattractive towards men,' added the 21-year-old. Dominatrix: The 21-year-old keeps male slaves and claims to have her name tattooed on to 11 men . Compelling evidence of hoax: The above property receipt shows that Hessler's suitcase was stolen at Tampa International Aiport and returned earlier this month with a '3 breast prosthesis' inside . 'Sexually I just did not want to be approached by men anymore. So I got a third breast to make myself unattractive but I still wanted to feel pretty. 'I can still wear provocative clothing and feel pretty myself.' The world's media descended on Tridevil's home in Tampa, Florida after the revelation but she refused to give any interviews. She says: 'The world hates me I get nothing but negative comments. 'They think I'm an attention whore and it's true - I do love attention and I'm not ashamed of it because every entertainer is an attention whore whether they like to admit it or not. 'If they were not then they would not be famous.' The dominatrix - who keeps male slaves and claims to have her name tattooed on to 11 men - has not spoken to her mother since the procedure.

"There must have been occasions during the last two years when Alan Hutton wondered whether matches like this had passed him by. Cut from the Aston Villa squad, he went on loan to Nottingham Forest, Real Mallorca and Bolton. At one stage he was only getting competitive games for Scotland. Fitting, then, that his well-taken goal completed a comeback for his team as well as underlining his personal redemption.

CLICK HERE for all the stats - including Alan Hutton's goal and heat map (above) - by viewing our brilliant Match Zone . Hutton was the central figure in this fractious contest, defending well, scoring and then being fortunate to stay on the pitch following a charged altercation with Paul Konchesky 10 minutes from the end. Reacting to a jibe delivered as he lay on the turf following a sliding foul, he sprang up and pushed his forehead into the Leicester City defender, who pressed back. Referee Craig Pawson reached the surprising conclusion that Konchesky should see red and Hutton only yellow. It ensured the 30-year-old was able to fully enjoy his first Villa goal since signing in 2011, adding to Ciaran Clark’s first-half equaliser. Villa are unbeaten in five and up to 11th in the Premier League. For bottom-placed Leicester, this was their 10th match without a win since beating Manchester United 5-3 in September. It was also the third match in a week when they have scored first but lost. Leonardo Ulloa slides on his knee after scoring Leicester's opening goal in the 13th minute .

Paul Konchesky has now been sent off while playing for four different Premier League teams. Only Carlton Palmer has been dismissed for five. Villa deserved this win, and Leicester owe much to Kasper Schmeichel for keeping the deficit to one. Nigel Pearson accepted this but added that the club may appeal against the sending off. He said: ‘We were initially led to believe it was for the challenge but I think now it is about the clash of heads. He’s not the instigator. The prudent thing is to see what’s in the report. But I think it’s difficult to have a decision like that rescinded.’ Leicester fans clapped their team and manager off. ‘I do appreciate their frustrations and hope they stick with the side,’ Pearson added. ‘You can see our players are committed and do care.’ Ulloa puts the ball into an empty net after American goalkeeper Brad Guzan palmed the ball into his path .

Esteban Cambiasso  90        11.6           7.2 . In the 13th minute, Leonardo Ulloa poked in his first goal since the remarkable victory over United that is an ever-fading memory. Riyad Mahrez cut in from the right and hit a shot that deflected off Clark. Brad Guzan spilled straight to the feet of the Argentine striker. Five minutes later, Gabby Agbonlahor won a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Westwood delivered the ball into a congested six-yard box and Liam Moore allowed Clark to find space far too easily. The Irish defender headed home for his first Villa goal since September 2012. The match ended with four bookings per side. Five minutes before the interval, Jamie Vardy launched into a tackle from behind that left Ashley Westwood in a heap holding his left knee. Westwood was stretchered from the field with his head in his hands. He will undergo a scan on Monday with Lambert suggesting it could be ligament damage. Clark took immediate retribution, sliding in hard on Ulloa by the touchline. It was fair but Ulloa was replaced by David Nugent at half-time. In the second half, chances fell for Villa like confetti. Christian Benteke was put clear by Kieran Richardson in the 53rd minute but was thwarted by the excellent Schmeichel, who then stopped Agbonlahor with his legs. Substitute Jack Grealish crossed to Benteke, the Belgian connected well, but again the Leicester goalkeeper was equal to it. He also saved from Grealish and Agbonlahor again but was powerless against Hutton 19 minutes from time. Agbonlahor fed Benteke, who crossed deep. Hutton controlled on his chest then prodded past Schmeichel - the first Villa goal at the Holte End since April 5. ‘I hope it’s not such a long wait again,’ said Lambert. ‘Alan is playing as well as any right back in the country. He’s been as good as gold. I’m delighted for him. He has nothing to prove.’ Guzan stopped Jamie Vardy by getting his hand on to the ball during a Leicester attack .

"A new study from the University of Michigan psychologist Ethan Kross shows how online social media, rather than making us feel connected, contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life-satisfaction. Facebook may have 1.1 billion users across the globe, but according to the study, the technology is having a fundamentally negative effect on the way we interact with others, and the way we perceive ourselves. The study's 82 participants were text messaged five times a day over a two-week period with a link to an online survey about their Facebook use, their feelings of well-being and the amount of face-to-face social interaction they had engaged in. Missed connections: A new study shows that the more people use Facebook, the less satisfied they feel with their lives and social interactions . Kross and his team discovered that the more time participants had spent on Facebook, the less happy they felt over time. 'The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time,' reports the study. These results were not moderated by the amount of Facebook friends, the perceived supportiveness of the Facebook connections, motivation for using Facebook, gender, loneliness, self-esteem, or depression, according to the study. Kross says the study shows that Facebook was making the participants unhappy. He notes that other, cross-sectional studies have revealed positive associations with Facebook use, but notes that his is the first to study subjective well-being over time. Networking: Studies show that the more time people spend online, the less face-to-face interactions they engage in . Loneliness and social interaction in a world where we're increasingly connected is a growing problem. Increased feelings of isolation and a decreased sense of well-being seems connected with the way in which we use social media, such as Facebook or Instagram: passively or actively. A 2010 study from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh found that when interacting directly with friends on Facebook - whether posting messages or pictures on wall, tagging photos or 'liking' things, feelings of well-being and sociability increased. But when they passively consumed content on Facebook, the opposite was true. An earlier study from the same researcher found that increased internet use led to a decline in communications with friends and family, and increased depression and loneliness. Earlier this year, author Jonathan Safran Foer wrote in The New York Times on the issue. 'Technology celebrates connectedness, but encourages retreat,' he wrote. 'Each step ""forward"" has made it easier, just a little, to avoid the emotional work of being present, to convey information rather than humanity.' Isolated: Although we are more connected that ever before, we are increasingly physically isolated by technology . The Atlantic, too, weighed in on the issue in April 2012. 'We are living in an isolation that would have been unimaginable to our ancestors, and yet we have never been more accessible,' wrote Stephen Marche. The passive consumption of other people's lives over social media - their idealized pictures of holidays, work, meals and family - seem to result in a more negative perception of our own lives and social interactions. Kross' study concludes, 'On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection. Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.'","A new study shows that Facebook use can undermine well-being and increase loneliness .

It’s certainly a question he could answer with a little more authority now than Friday morning when, with a straight face, he claimed he was confident Carroll would ultimately prove he was right to snub Wilfried Bony. Of course, it came down to a straight choice between the two strikers in the summer of 2013 - an Ivorian playing in Holland and the big man who had just spent a good loan spell at the club. Allardyce went for Carroll, backed him in his press conference last week and would have been oblivious to the Twitter sniggering that accompanied Bony’s first-half opener here.

But Carroll has always leant himself to a good narrative. Perhaps it was poetic that he would respond in the manner he did, with two magnificent headers. There are no graces in those kind of goals and few mysteries. But surely there is beauty - and certainly great credit - in something so predictable being so hard to defend against? Swansea made it look impossible. His first goal, after 41 minutes, ended a stretch 797 minutes without a goal. Another statistic showed he had not scored at Upton Park since March 2013. These numbers are always at the ready with Carroll; there’s always a rod to beat him with. His second sent West Ham third in the table. But what of the original question? Where would West Ham be if Allardyce took a chance on the Ivorian, £3m less at £12m and so prolific at Vitesse Arnhem? Perhaps Allardyce should have known better than to even enter the discussion on Friday. Carroll and Bony's general match statistics show the England striker's greater potency in the air .

Swansea team-mates congratulate Wilfried Bony after his opening goal at Upton Park . Having already explained that it was a straight choice between signing Carroll and Bony, he was asked if he believed the choice he made would ultimately be vindicated. ‘I think so,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, in the end, it will be an Andy that is not picking up injuries and starts getting back to what we know he can do. His first season in the Premier League at Newcastle showed at that young age he was a massive goal-scoring threat against anyone. ‘He has done it before. Because of the injuries he had that career hasn’t blossomed as it should have done. If he gets a run without injuries, we are in for a player of his capabilities.’ Andy Carroll's heat map (above) showed he covered far more ground, especially in dangerous areas, than Wilfried Bony (below) - CLICK HERE for more stats from Match Zone .

Carroll's first goal came after right wing cross from West Ham defender Carl Jenkinson (18) The West Ham No 9 enjoys the relief of breaking his goal scoring duck this season . Sadly, it is rare these days for discussions surrounding Carroll to move beyond talk of injuries and what might be. There are hopes and possibilities and fleeting moments - like his performance here and the brilliant comeback cameo against Aston Villa on November 8 - when it is possible to wonder how much he will offer when he is fully fit. But so little of the dialogue concerns the here and now. And it is on those terms that a comparison to Bony is so hopelessly skewed in the Ivorian’s favour, even when the immediacy of this result has faded. Allardyce couldn’t possibly admit any regrets for fear of sabotaging himself, but one must wonder. The truth is that Bony has proven himself wonderfully effective. And where he really differs from Carroll is that he is a player who has sustained a level of goal-scoring brilliance that Carroll has not matched. He has 19 goals in the calendar year – more than anyone in the Premier League. He has also scored seven in his past nine Premier League fixtures after 25 in all competitions in his debut campaign. Carrol scored more goals, made more assists and created more chances than Bony . Carroll's second goal came from another towering header, this time from Stewart Downing's corner . Carroll's second goal came another header directly from a corner by Stewart Downing . Carroll is surrounded by team-mates after netting twice to send the Hammers to third in the table . Whatever way you cut it, his goals have been a consistent factor in Swansea’s performances. Not bad for a striker who cost an initial £12m, has rarely broken down injured and last month signed a new contract until 2018. More still, the contract extension is understood to have addressed the release clause that might have seen him leave for £19m in the summer, when Liverpool were most prominent among his admirers. And Carroll? He has now scored three goals in the time Bony has scored 33. On that scale, the winner is obvious. It is also fair to say Bony is more accomplished on the ground, even if it is hard to blame Carroll for West Ham's habit of going long when he is on the pitch. But, as always, there is hope that this young English talent will enjoy the kind of run of good health that has so far eluded him. With any luck, he can take the strides that Allardyce expects of him.","West Ham defeated Swansea 3-1 in their Premier League clash on Sunday .

"Caroline Reed Robertson, just 19 years old, looked calmly at the police officer who had just asked where the neighbour she had idolised for years was, and answered matter of factly that she was dead. 'Are you sure,' the policeman asked? 'Yes, I've buried her,' Roberson replied. The chilling confession in one of Australia's darkest murders is contained in a police interview with Robertson, who obsessively stalked 15-year-old Rachel Barber for four years before killing her in a bizarre attempt to steal her life. Scroll down for video . Exclusive footage of a police interview of a 19-year-old Caroline Reed Robertson, shows an unresponsive and evasive teen who refused to give any more information . Robertson had previously told Superintendent Neil Paterson that her former neighbour Rachel Barber, was dead and had been buried as police searched for the missing 15-year-old in 1999 . Victoria Police Superintendent Neil Paterson recalled the moment he received a clear and unemotional confession from Robertson, who drugged Barber before strangling her with a phone cord in her home in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran in 1999. 'I asked her where Rachel was and she responded to me that Rachel was dead. And that surprised me. I said, ""you sure she's dead?"" And she said ""yes, I've buried her"",' Superintendent Paterson told Channel Nine's Inside Story. 'I said ""listen are you sure that she's dead? Is there no way we can help her?"" She told me that she'd buried Rachel on a family country property near where she'd buried other pets'. The program will air tonight at 8.30 on Channel Nine. What emerged from the police investigation into Barber death was an incredible and tragic tale of obsession, resentment and murder. From the age of 14, Robertson watched Barber and came to be jealous of what she saw as her neighbour's perfect life compared to hers. Barber was an avid dance student, outgoing, well-liked; Robertson was overweight, depressive and had few friends. Robertson worked her way into Barber's life, using her own younger sister, who was school friends with one of Barber's, becoming a babysitter for Barber's parents. She lured Barber to her apartment on February 28, 1999, with the promise of $100 to take part in a 'psychological study'. The 19-year-old drugged and strangled her victim, then stuffed her body in a closet. Robertson went to work the next day, and when she returned she wrapped the body in a blanket and rented a truck to take it to the farm to bury it. She later applied for a loan, money police later alleged she intended to use to flee Victoria. Barber's devastated parents refused to believe their daughter had run away and launched a public campaign to find her. Police eventually discovered the link between Robertson and Barber on the day the murdered girl disappeared. When police went to Robertson's apartment, they found her semi-conscious on the floor after suffering an epileptic fit. In 2000, Robertson was jailed for 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 and a half years after pleading guilty to murdering Barber, an aspiring dancer. Rachel Barber, a 15-year-old dance student, was strangled to death in Melbourne in 1999 . Pictured with her mother, the dance student was lured to her death by Robertson who was obsessed with her former neighbour and plotted to steal her identity . She was released on parole from the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in January this year. Her victim's sister, Heather Barber, told Inside Story 'It would not surprise me in the least when she gets out, [if] she targets me or my sister.' 'I'm just like, you want to see what I look like? Go for it. I mean, I'm not scared of you, why should I have to stop my life and hide away because you're a crazy?' Exclusive footage of the  police interview, obtained by Inside Story, shows an unresponsive and evasive Robertson who refused to give any more information. 'Did you bury her at your father's property at Kilmore' a policeman can be heard asking Robertson, who responds: 'I don't want to answer any questions'. 'Caroline's very cold, very matter of fact, but just very cold. There's no emotion there whatsoever. Absolutely calculating,' Mr Paterson said. 'There is evidence of planning. Caroline clearly planned this out. This was a premeditated murder. It's not spur of the moment and it's certainly not passion,' Superintendent Paterson said . 'Some people might change their behaviour, their appearance, their job, their lifestyle, so they can be like their role model. But to actually want to kill the role model and replace them, I mean that's going really a long way,'Forensic Psychiatrist Julian Parmegiani said . 'There is evidence of planning. Caroline clearly planned this out. This was a premeditated murder. It's not spur of the moment and it's certainly not passion. 'It's unbelievable that she would not recall what had occurred or know that she involved in the murder of Rachel.' Forensic Psychiatrist Julian Parmegiani told Inside Story that cases like Robertson's, in which a teenager kills an idol in order to steal their identity, were completely 'unheard of'. 'Some people might change their behaviour, their appearance, their job, their lifestyle, so they can be like their role model. But to actually want to kill the role model and replace them, I mean that's going really a long way,' Dr Parmegiani said. 'This is clearly an extreme case. I mean you can see a bit of fantasising in most teenagers, but to see someone going out of their way to kill their victim, to replace them, that's really unique.' Caroline Reed Robertson (middle) walked free from jail in January, 16 years after strangling a 15-year-old girl to death in a plot to steal her identity . 'I think that Caroline was very unhappy with herself: she didn't like the way she looked. She did want to take on that persona of someone that was happy, that was beautiful, that was popular like Rachel was and try and live that life,' Mr Paterson said . Mr Paterson said there was no doubt in his mind about Robertson's motivation. 'I think that Caroline was very unhappy with herself: she didn't like the way she looked. She did want to take on that persona of someone that was happy, that was beautiful, that was popular like Rachel was and try and live that life,' he said. 'You and I can sit here and say well that's just not possible, but certainly that's what she wanted to do and that is absolutely my belief of why she took Rachel's life.' Following her release last month, the Barber family asked the public not to harass Robertson, but give her 'the opportunity to quietly readjust to life outside of prison'. The family hope that Robertson, who suffers from a personality disorder, will be properly rehabilitated and supervised during her parole so she is not a danger to society. Robertson had a deep-rooted self loathing, as demonstrated in this self-portrait which was used as evidence in her trial. At age 14 she drew this exaggeratedly ugly image of herself surrounded by degrading words . In another image Robertson drew of herself, it is clear that she has very low self confidence and is obsessed with her appearance. It is believed that jealousy and obsession was the reasoning for the murder of Rachel . Robertson's diary entries were used by police as evidence in the trial. 'How to change in nine weeks' was written by Robertson on the front of her journal; the pages inside detail her sick plans. They reveal the disturbed woman's terrifying obsession with the beautiful dancer as she plotted to kill and 'disfigure' the teen. The journal and emotional letters to her father also expose the intense self-loathing Robertson felt, which led her to became fixated with Rachel, a pretty, talented, well-liked dance student. Robertson had grown up disgusted by herself, frequently painting disgusting self-portraits and scribbling hateful words about herself. 'Loser, unwanted, dirty, obese, funny in the head,' she wrote around one drawing when she was 14 years old. 'I don't belong anywhere in this crazy world because I'm ugly, obese, pizza face, white worm, massive nose and just plain weird.' But later detectives found that the diary entries became more sinister as the then 19-year-old plotted to murder her former neighbour.

"A hotshot doctor who disappeared after failing to show up for work  was located in a small Texas city 60 miles from her home on Sunday afternoon. Dr Fehintola Omidele, 25, who goes by the nickname FT, disappeared after being seen by her family over dinner at their Houston home last Sunday night. KHOU reports that Dr Omidele phoned her sister around 1pm today to tell her she is in El Campo, Texas, and that she is safe. Scroll down for video . Found: Dr Fehintola Omidele, or 'FT', phoned her sister from El Campo, Texas, on Sunday to tell her where she was and that she was safe . The circumstances of her disappearance are not yet clear. El Campo is a city about 70 miles southwest of Houston. Her family became worried after she failed to show up for work on Monday at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, where she is a first-year resident. Fox News reported her family found her cell phone at her apartment in Katy, Texas, but could not locate her car or purse. An intensive search by family and friends had failed to turn up FT or her grey Toyota Camry. Dr Omidele enjoyed a glittering academic career, graduating from high school at 16 with a grade point average of 4.3, before graduating from college at the age of 20. 'She's extremely responsible, so her not showing up for work and it's been four or five days, is not like her at all,' family friend Dr Omonele Nwokolo told KHOU. Another friend, A'Lys Lawrence, told MailOnline: 'We are broken hearted and doing all that we can to bring her back home safely.' Star doctor: FT graduated from high school at 16 with a 4.3 grade point average and graduated college at 20 . Hailing from Nigeria, her family moved to New Orleans when she was eight, then to Katy, Texas, when she was 12. According to the Houston Chronicle, she graduated high school with a 4.3 grade point average - out of a possible 5.0 - at the age of 16. She was 20 when she enrolled in graduate medical school after majoring in biology and child development at the University of Texas. 'Extremely responsible': Friends claim FT's disappearance earlier this week is completely out of character . In a profile done on Dr Omidele in April, she told the Chronicle: 'I've always loved children. I'm drawn to them. Personally, I consider myself a kid at heart. In college, I worked at the child development center.' She graduated in May, when she started her three-year pediatrics placement at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston. One day, she said, she hopes to work for the French non-governmental organization Doctors Without Borders.","Dr Fehintola Omidele, 25, was seen at family dinner in Houston on Sunday .

"Tragic: Liu Yipeng, 15, died in the hospital days after the crash that killed two of her Chinese classmates . The first picture has emerged of the third teenage victim killed in the crash landing of an Asiana Airlines flight last weekend. Liu Yipeng, 15, was rescued from her seat aboard the doomed Boeing 777 jetliner on June 6. She died at San Francisco General Hospital on Friday from traumatic head injuries she had suffered when the plane plummeted to Earth. Miss Liu, a Chinese citizen, was a classmate of Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, the 16-year-olds who died on the day of the crash. All of them were part of an eastern Chinese school class that was traveling to San Francisco to attend summer camp in the United States. San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault confirmed Miss Liu's identity and said the girl was still in her seat when she was rescued last week. Foucrault said Liu Yipeng was transported to San Francisco General Hospital with head injuries after the July 6 crash. She died Friday morning at San Francisco General Hospital where she had been in critical condition. An autopsy was being conducted on Saturday, the coroner said. Liu Yipeng's identification comes a . day after her death was announced amid the official confirmation that . one of the other girls who died in the disaster had been covered on the . runway in flame-retardant foam and hit by a fire truck speeding to the . crash site, a disclosure that raised the tragic possibility she could . have survived the crash only to die in its chaotic aftermath.Police . and fire officials confirmed Friday that Ye Meng Yuan was hit by a fire . truck racing to extinguish the blazing Boeing 777. ""The . fire truck did go over the victim at least one time. Now the other . question is, `What was the cause of death?'"" San Francisco police . spokesman Albie Esparza said. ""That's what we are trying to determine . right now.""All three girls killed were from China. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing . Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport . Ye Meng Yuan's close friend Wang Linjia was among a group of injured passengers who did not get immediate medical help. Rescuers did not spot her until 14 minutes after the crash. Wang Linjia's body was found along with three flight attendants who were flung onto the tarmac. Moments after the crash, while rescuers tried to help passengers near the burning fuselage, Wang Linjia and some flight attendants lay in the rubble almost 2,000 feet away. A group of survivors called 911 and tried to help them. Survivors said that after escaping the plane, they sat with at least four victims who appeared to be seriously hurt. They believe one of them was one of the girls who died. Beyond recognition: The charred remains of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 after crash landing in San Francisco . Cindy Stone, who was in that group, was recorded by California Highway Patrol dispatchers calling in for help: 'There are no ambulances here. We've been on the ground 20 minutes. There are people lying on the tarmac with critical injuries, head injuries. We're almost losing a woman here. We're trying to keep her alive.' San Francisco fire spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said Friday that when airport personnel reached the group near the seawall, Linjia was dead. She did not know when the girl had died. Several flight attendants remain hospitalized. Miracle: Despite the cabin bursting into flames, only three people have so far been identified as dead . Talmadge also confirmed that an Associated Press photograph of a body under a yellow tarp near the burned-out jet was Ye Meng Yuan.The photo, taken from above, shows firefighters looking down at the tarp, and there are truck track marks leading up to it.Police said the teenager was covered in foam that rescuers had sprayed on the burning wreckage. When the truck moved while battling the flames, rescuers discovered her body, Esparza said.""The driver may not have seen the young lady in the blanket of foam,"" said Ken Willette of the National Firefighter Protection Agency, which sets national standards for training airfield firefighters. ""These could be factors contributing to this tragic event."" Panic: As fire trucks rushed to the scene, one may have hit and killed Liu Yipeng, 15, in the chaotic aftermath . He said fire trucks that responded to the Asiana crash would have started shooting foam while approaching the fuselage from 80 or 100 feet away. The foam was sprayed from a cannon on the top of the truck across the ground to clear a safe path for evacuees. That was supposed to create a layer of foam on the ground that is several inches high before the truck gets to the plane.The victims were close friends and top students, looking forward to spending a few weeks at a Christian summer camp in California, where they planned to practice English and boosting their chances of attending a U.S. college.Their parents were flown to San Francisco after their deaths where the Chinese consulate was caring for them. Remarkable: The tail of the Boeing 777 came completely off when the back section of the plane hit the runway's sea wall . The crash-landing occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short the runway. Dozens of passengers were hurt. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries.So far, an investigation indicates the pilots, a trainee and his instructor, failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and flying too slow.Nothing disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines, computers or automated systems.Also, San Francisco airport officials said that the runway where the jet crashed was reopened Friday evening, and all airlines would resume normal schedules immediately.","A total of three people have been publicly identified as dead .

"Two Twitter accounts belonging to the Ku Klux Klan have been taken over by hacker group Anonymous after the white supremacist group threatened protesters in Ferguson.

It went on to read: 'We will use lethal force as provided under Missouri law to defend ourselves.'

Anonymous is said to have compromised Ku Klux Klan members email accounts and is harassing members by phone. Members' personal information was also thought to have been released. The Ku Klux Klan taunted the hacker group, and had said their threats had boosted recruitment . In a video published by Anonymous on YouTube, which has since been taken down by the website, the group said it had come to their attention that the KKK had been 'interfering with Anonymous'. The hacker group said: 'We are not attacking you because of what you believe in as we fight for freedom of speech. 'We are attacking you because of what you did to our brothers and sisters at the Ferguson protest on the 12th of November.' Anonymous said they had launched Operation KKK, which it said was 'nothing more than cyber warfare'.

Abbott has be named in an enlarged New South Wales squad on Monday after telling team-mates that he wants to return to action but no final decision on his comeback will be made until the morning of the Sheffield Shield match. The 22-year-old all-rounder has been strengthened by the support of the cricket world since his pivotal role in the tragic accident, not least that of the Hughes family who have comforted Abbott and offered him their full support. Sean Abbott looks set to return to the same SCG where he bowled the bouncer that struck Phillip Hughes . The 22-year-old bowler attended the funeral of  Hughes in Macksville on Wednesday . Now it seems that Abbott, who many feared would not be able to play again, will return at the first possible first-class opportunity while the Australian team prepare to also return to action in the rearranged first Test against India. Abbott has impressed his team-mates with his courage since the incident two weeks ago with New South Wales all-rounder Moises Henriques saying: ‘He is coping pretty well and I guess from our point of view we are trying to expel his name from the tragedy a little bit. Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground days after the accident to Hughes happened . The young bowler was seen wearing a pair of sunglasses and was flanked by team-mates . ‘I don’t think he was any more at fault than any fast bowler who has ever bowled a bouncer in his career.and we have been treating him just the same as any other player.

"Nick Easter rolled back the years to inspire Harlequins to a richly deserved victory as the Londoners made a mockery of their abject domestic form. The former England No 8 produced a magnificent display at the back of a resurgent Quins scrum alongside returning Red Rose captain Chris Robshaw, scoring a vital second-half try while tackling himself almost to a standstill at a packed Twickenham Stoop. Conor O’Shea’s men — lying ninth in the Aviva Premiership — are now three points clear at the top of Pool 2 in the European Cup with three wins from three. VIDEO Scroll down for match highlights of Harlequins win over Leinster . Harlequins number eight Nick Easter stretches to score despite the attention of Rhys Ruddock (right) Leinster full back Rob Kearney (left) is smashed in a tackle by Harlequins winger Aseli Tikoirotuma . Victory over three-time European champions Leinster in Dublin next Saturday night would make Quins red-hot favourites to qualify with something to spare and, at 36, Easter is playing like a man 10 years younger. ‘It’s only half-time against Leinster and half-time in this group,’ he said. ‘It’s fantastic to win our home games but we’ve been in this position before and we know we’re going to face another war next week. If we couldn’t get up for a game like this then we really shouldn’t be here. It’s another moment in Quins history today.’ Five-and-a-half years after the Bloodgate scandal rocked the West London club, this comprehensive victory over the same opponents should go a long way to finally closing that unwanted chapter in their history. Easter was simply magnificent. The 47-cap veteran has not played for England since the last World Cup and it is stretching the bounds of probability to suggest he could feature in next year’s tournament. But on this kind of form he is surely worthy of consideration. ‘I’ve always said it,’ O’Shea said when asked if Easter could feasibly play for England again. ‘Nick is an old head who can cover a few positions. Quins scrum half Danny Care makes a surge through a gap but is stopped by Ruddock and Eoin Reddan (left) ‘Sometimes when you’re in those kind of matches you need those old people around. We have a lot of youngsters who are learning on the hoof but when he plays like that he is a very special player. I’m very fortunate I’ve been around the club while he’s been here. He’s towards the tail end of his career but he’s still got a few years left in him. Brad Thorn is still playing and he’s 40!’ Robshaw was not far behind his back-row partner as the Quins pack produced a sensationally high work-rate allied to a rock-solid scrummaging display which was light years away from last week’s embarrassing Premiership mauling at the hands of Bath. Easter and Robshaw made 13 tackles apiece but Quins will point to an outstanding collective effort which suggests they have turned a corner following a disjointed start to the season. The win was built on a phenomenal scrummaging performance which saw Joe Marler give his former team-mate Mike Ross a torrid afternoon before being forced off late in the second half with a shoulder injury. Leinster centre Ian Madigan fires over a penalty for the visitors but his six penalties would not be enough . Easter said: ‘The way the scrum is going this season it’s a real battle and hard to predict, but we got on top today. That was really pleasing after last week.’ O’Shea remained confident that Marler, whom he described as ‘battered’ after four internationals in succession, will be fit for next Saturday’s return fixture at the Aviva Stadium, although fly-half Nick Evans is more doubtful after lasting only 13 minutes before being replaced by 21-year-old new recruit Tim Swiel. ‘I thought the players showed unbelievable desire today,’ O’Shea added. ‘We just have to make sure we’re ready for the Aviva Stadium. We have to be 20 or 30 per cent better than we were today. But the players are buzzing after that. ‘Sometimes it’s about grit and we showed that in abundance.’ Quins captain Chris Robshaw hugs his team-mate Marland Yarde as his side clinched victory at the Stoop . South African Swiel, brought in on a short-term contract to cover for the injured Ben Botica, looked nervous at times but showed plenty of heart to kick three from five attempts. The sides were level at 9-9 at half-time but Easter’s 53rd-minute try — taken superbly with his hands outstretched over his head — put Quins in front and they never looked back. Quins’ Fijian winger Aseli Tikoirotuma intercepted Rob Kearney’s attempted pass six minutes later and ran the length of the pitch to score. But despite two late penalties from the flawless Ian Madigan, Leinster could not quite drag themselves back into contention. Leinster head coach Matt O’Connor said: ‘It was disappointing. We didn’t control the set-piece or get any dominance. We have to get that right next week.’ An impish left-foot drop-goal from scrum-half Danny Care, who also produced a fine all-round display, sealed victory for O’Shea’s men and set up a mouth-watering encounter in Dublin next week. Easter’s name will be the first on the team-sheet.","Nick Easter touches down for crucial try in the second half .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from Old Trafford... Sir Alex Ferguson believes it has been a case of ‘one step forward, two steps back’ for Manchester United this season – but insists Louis van Gaal will turn the club’s fortunes around. United salvaged a 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea on Sunday when Robin van Persie struck in stoppage-time. Van Gaal’s side are currently eighth in the Premier League but trail leaders Chelsea by 10 points.

And former boss Ferguson – speaking at an event in London to publicise the updated edition of his autobiography – said that injuries have undermined their progress this season. ‘It’s been a bit of one step forward and two back,’ he said. ‘It’s been difficult with injuries. I got told the team today at 3pm, and Phil Jones is injured again. ‘I said, “Are we going to get a break here?”. If the back four doesn’t play consistently together then you aren’t going to get results. New signings like Marcos Rojo (L) and Luke Shaw need time to adapt, insists Ferguson . Van Gaal shares an embrace with his former protege Jose Mourinho (L) ahead of the game . ‘People keep saying “you’re fragile at the back”, and that’s understandable. But these boys need time to adapt, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo are still young men.’ But Ferguson is certain Van Gaal is the man for the job. ‘He (Van Gaal) will get there because he’s got the stubbornness and determination to do well. I have no doubt he will get it right,’ he said. ‘I am certain they made the right choice’. Van Persie throws his shirt into the stands after rescuing a late point against the league leaders .

"Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was sent off in their 3-1 defeat at West Ham after racing from his goal to block off Diafra Sakho. Referee Chris Foy called the game back after Sakho had struck the post and showed Fabianski a straight red card. Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict on the incident at Upton Park. Sending off Lukasz Fabianski was arguably the pivotal point of the match. Fabianski raced from his goal and fouled Diafra Sakho, who was clean through and heading towards goal with an obvious opportunity to score. Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski is shown a red card by referee Chris Foy during their loss at West Ham . Fabianski raced from his goal and impeded West Ham's Diafra Sakho as he advanced towards goal . Sakho managed to keep his post and subsequently struck a shot that hit the inside of the post . The reverse angle showed how Fabianski impeded Sakho and denied him a clear scoring opportunity . To his credit Sakho stumbled on, recovered from the foul and tried to score from an acute angle but hit the post. Chris Foy called the game back to the point where Sakho had been fouled and dismissed Fabianski. First impressions were that we were seeing textbook refereeing, with Foy playing advantage: had Sakho scored it seemed that Foy’s vision would have saved the Swansea keeper from the red card as the obvious goal scoring opportunity would not have been denied. The sending off of Fabianski ended any chance of Swansea getting back into the game . Fabianski walks off after being shown a straight red card midway through the second period . Replays, however, showed Foy had blown his whistle immediately after the collision. Fabianski would have been dismissed even if Sakho had ‘scored’ and that goal wouldn’t have stood. I would have preferred Foy to have played advantage, but I can’t agree with the TV analysts who questioned the red card. It was absolutely correct and any handball by Sakho in the lead-up was accidental and only caused by the physical attention of Ashley Williams. Moments later, Foy missed Kyle Bartley’s clear two-handed shove on the dangerous Andy Carroll.","Lukasz Fabianski was shown a straight red card by Chris Foy during Swansea's 3-1 loss at West Ham .

"Andy Carroll scored twice on Sunday afternoon to send West Ham into the Premier League’s top three before declaring: ‘I’m back.’ The striker moved on from his latest injury nightmare with a brilliant performance and two leaping headers as West Ham crushed Swansea 3-1 at Upton Park. And after ending a 797-minute wait for a goal, the 25-year-old, who was playing only his fifth game following ankle surgery in the summer, said: ‘It means a lot to me to get back on the score sheet. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Andy Carroll rose majestically above the Swansea defence to head home and put his team in front . The England striker, who has spent most of the year sidelined through injury, jumps for joy after scoring . ‘I've played a couple of games and I'm back, but until you score you don't feel like you are definitely back. But now I've scored I am definitely back. ‘It is a great feeling. It is fantastic to be back on the pitch and playing as many games as I have in the last few weeks. 'There is nothing better than scoring goals as a striker, so I was desperate to get a goal and it is great feeling. ‘You always have to just think about the positives (when injured). The medical staff have helped me a lot and it is credit to them that I am back.’ The result takes West Ham into the top three for the first time since 1999, albeit only until tonight when they will be overtaken by either Southampton or Manchester United, who meet at St Mary’s. West Ham fell behind to Wilfried Bony’s 19th-minute goal, but levelled through a Carroll header four minutes before the break. Carroll headed a second and then assisted substitute Diafra Sakho for a late third shortly after Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had been sent off for fouling the striker.

When he scores two you have to say yes. 'We thought about taking him off after the second but let him try to get the hat-trick.’ Swansea manager Garry Monk was furious with his side’s performance, but indicated he will appeal the decision to send off Fabianski as he claimed Sakho handballed before being brought down by Fabianski outside the area. He also contested whether it was a goal-scoring opportunity. Carroll celebrates with James Tomkins after heading in West Ham's second goal after the break . Swansea boss Garry Monk was unhappy with his side's performance in the 3-1 defeat at West Ham defeat . He said: ‘Look at the build-up - Sakho knocks it past with his hand clearly. 'Realistically it should have been handball to us and it wasn't a clear goalscoring opportunity from the way it played out so when you look at it, it suggests it wasn't. 'You'd think we would appeal when you have the benefit of the replays.' Monk added: ‘We didn’t reach the levels we can play – that is the first time I can say that this season. ‘Some of the defending, we gifted it on a plate really. We could have done better with the first goal - a good header - but he (Carroll) lost his man marker for the second which is unacceptable. 'The third was bad defending.

"MP Tom Watson sparked the police investigation into child abuse at a guest house after a speech into the Commons . Police investigating allegations of a child paedophile network have seized a list naming  top politicians, members of the royal household and a world-renowned pop star, it was reported today. They were allegedly visitors to a bed and breakfast guest house which operated as a brothel where youngsters were abused at gay sex parties. The names were recorded on a handwritten note found by police at the North London home of child protection worker Mary Moss during a raid. She had initially declined to co-operate with the investigation. Documents and a laptop were seized and Ms Moss later handed over other 19 files she had put in a neighbour's shed. The papers include a list of men who went to sex parties in the 80s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south west London. Among them were two former Conservative Cabinet ministers, four other senior Tories, a Labour MP, a prominent Irish republican and a leading National Front member, according to the Sunday People. The note also allegedly names two members of the royal household – one a former Buckingham Palace employee – plus the owner of a multinational company and two pop stars. One of those is a best-selling musician, but like some others on the list he is not suspected of being involved in any child abuse. Linked to child sex scandals: Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith and disgraced traitor Anthony Blunt . The list emerged at meetings in 1988 . between child protection officials and the guest house’s manager Carole . Kasir, who died aged 47, two years later from a suspected overdose. The paper said that 16 boys from nearby Grafton Close council home were allegedly trafficked to the guest house and abused. Now detectives are to check social services records from Richmond, Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Hounslow. Officers will also be examining copies of cash receipts and ­the guest house’s visitor records. Famous names linked to child sex rings include Liberal MP Cyril Smith in Rochdale and disgraced traitor Anthony Blunt, the former Keeper of the Queen’s Pictures. A complaint by Labour MP Tom Watson during a speech in the House of Commons sparked Operation Fernbridge. He claimed a paedophile ring used high-level connections to escape justice. Ms Moss told the People: 'They [police] were friendly enough but I thought it was heavy handed and a complete violation of my ­privacy.. The Met confirmed their statement to the Mail Online. 'The investigation will be led by the Child Abuse Investigation Command. 'The allegations under Operation Fernbridge were initially assessed under Operation Fairbank, which was from information passed to police by Mr Tom Watson.'","List found among documents after raid at the home of former child protection worker .

"Watch out ANZ Stadium - you might be next! The model who was arrested for stripping naked at the AFL grand final has been revealed to be a huge fan of posing in sports jerseys (and little else)... so will she make an appearance at this weekend's rugby league decider? Heather McCartney, a 26-year-old Gold Coast glamour model, was arrested at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday after she stripped naked during Hawthorn's big win over the Sydney Swans. Ms McCartney, who was pictured being taken away by police, claims she was dared to strip if the Hawks won and made good on the bet. Now it's been revealed that she's not only a fan of the AFL but rugby league too - and has posted several racy snaps of herself online wearing a Queensland State of Origin jersey.

However, a photograph Miss McCartney posted before the Grand Final in Sydney Swans red and white striped socks, a white bikini top and red bikini bottoms, gripping a sherrin football, suggest she is also a fan of the losing side. After receiving complaints, police arrived to arrest her - but she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her.

'It was a bet. I said if Hawthorn win, I’m getting naked. They won, and I got naked,' she told the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video . Tom Steinfort tweeted a photo of Heather McCartney, naked in a corporate box at the MCG, captioning the snap: 'Celebrating your team winning the grand final by getting nude in a corporate box... priceless' Ms McCartney said she stripped on a bet: 'What a f---ing day, it was great' 'What a f---ing day, it was great.' McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning. She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.' One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'. Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG,who have launched an investigation. MCC spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances, and appropriate action would be taken. 'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said. An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke told the Herald Sun he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL. 'It’s a disgrace. It’s the people’s game and it’s for families,' he said. The model appeared at a Melbourne court after a night in police custody . 'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' The model was forced to the ground and cuffed in an unknown state of undress. During her arrest, she reportedly yelled ‘f*** off, I don’t have to tell you anything, you f**ing r****d,’ before hitting an officer in the face, the Sun Herald also claims. Images of McCartney cavorting naked in the MCG corporate box have gone viral on social media, with disbelieving onlookers snapped in the background. She was released from Melbourne Remand Centre after a night in custody and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday. McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time. The court was told that McCartney was dared to strip naked if Hawthorn won the Grand Final against Swans . McCartney has gained a significant number of followers on her official Facebook fan page 'Miss Lady Darling' after Saturday night's explicit stunt.

The court was told that she accepted an invitation to attend the corporate box and dared to strip if Hawthorn won. The Hawks (21.11.137) easily claimed the cup over the Sydney Swans (11.8.74). However, there are claims that Ms McCartney was hired to strip, according to Herald Sun. McCartney's lawyer told the court 'she didn’t understand at the time it could lead to police involvement'. The court also heard that alcohol and strong medication for aplastic anaemia had made her unable to control her actions. Magistrate Alan Spillane described her conduct as 'pretty nasty offending.' 'The part I think is really worrying is basically you were biting and hitting out at people who were out trying to do their job.'

"The unbearable frustration of Andy Carroll’s time at West Ham is perhaps best summed up by the red card in this fixture last season when, no sooner was he fit than he was suspended, a victim of Chico Flores’ acting prowess. That campaign was doomed to never get going, for Carroll. He came back, scored a couple, missed the World Cup and was injured again. There have been times when this season has threatened to go the same way and then there was on Sunday when Carroll lit the claret-and-blue touch-paper with his first goals of the season, two quite brilliant headers, to propel his team into the top three.

Little wonder he reacted with such exhilaration after his second, sprinting to embrace Sam Allardyce’s backroom team as a gesture of thanks to the medics who helped him through the months of injury gloom. Carroll wiped out Wilfried Bony’s opener with a giant leap and a trademark flex of the neck muscles and a flick of the ponytail in response to a cross by Carl Jenkinson, and won the game with another nostalgia-inducing climb to convert Stewart Downing’s corner, 23 minutes from time. Not since Duncan Ferguson has the elite level of English football seen anyone attack the aerial ball quite like Carroll and it was a thrill to see him once again dominating airspace, terrorising centre-halves Ashley Williams and Kyle Bartley with his physical presence. Allardyce drooled on about the lost art of heading the ball. Roy Hodgson will watch with interest over the winter months. It is more than two years since his last England cap. Diafra Sakho, back from injury, added West Ham’s third, his eighth in 10 games since signing from Metz in August, but not before he had been involved in Lukasz Fabianski’s sending off, which left the visitors a man short for the final 20 minutes. Fabianski dashed from his penalty box after Sakho had evaded Williams in pursuit of a pass from Carroll. Garry Monk later claimed it was handball as he nudged it past the ‘keeper but Sakho stumbled, but the striker kept his feet and shot from a tight angle. The ball hit a post, but referee Chris Foy had already blown his whistle for a free-kick to the home team and showed Fabianski a red card.

The build-up that led to Wilfried Bony giving Swansea the lead after 19 minutes at Upton Park from our match zone service . Monk vowed to appeal the decision. He wanted to know how it could be judged a clear goal-scoring opportunity if he didn’t score. Regardless, the damage was done, even if the visitors rallied briefly before going under. Sakho, returning from injury as a half-time sub, was a menace on the break against 10 men. He escaped Williams again to pick up a pass by Alex Song and hit the other post before he finally grabbed the third, in the 87th minute, set up by Carroll’s pass. It glossed the score-line nicely on a fabulous day for West Ham. They have won three in a row, they are third for the first time in 15 years, Carroll is fit, Sakho cannot stop scoring and they are have the look of a strong and solid squad, capable of converting this burst of form into a memorable season. Two on-loan players also impressed: Arsenal’s Jenkinson rampaging forward from right-back and Barcelona’s Alex Song dominating the ball in central areas of the pitch.

Song’s vision and passing was excellent, almost good enough to forgive his infuriating habit of throwing up his hands in dismay whenever a team-mate failed to read his thoughts or produce a finish to match his pass. The pair linked up for Carroll’s equaliser after Swansea had taken a 19th minute lead, a slick counter-attack led by Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jefferson Montero into the space behind Jenkinson and converted by Bony. Once the Ivorian applied a firm side-footer to Montero’s cross and there was never any doubt where it would end up. It was his seventh goal in nine Premier League games. His game oozed such swagger and confidence that it was a shock when he missed the target from 20 yards, a few minutes later, when Cheikhou Kouyate had been dispossessed, deep inside his own half. Carroll’s self-esteem has not been fuelled by a similar glut of goals since his permanent £15million move from Liverpool. It has been a difficult time, blighted by injuries, but he led the line well yesterday and dominated in the air from the start. When Jenkinson crossed from the right and Carroll dropped away from the centre-halves to climb high above Angel Rangel to direct a text-book centre-forward’s header back across goal, into the opposite top corner. It was his first of the season and his first at Upon Park since March 2013, when he was on loan from Liverpool. Bony rattled the bar on the break with a ferocious drive, but Carroll appeared unmarked at a corner to head West Ham into the lead. Monk fumed about his team’s defending and that fact they had failed to reach their usual levels, but Carroll can have that sort of effect on defenders, when he is fit and in the groove.

"A collection of ancient coins dating back to 500 B.C.are being returned to Greece after the New York prosecution of a prominent collector from Rhode Island. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. and Greek officials scheduled a ceremony today in New York marking the repatriation of the coins. The coins were part of a case against noted Rhode Island hand surgeon and coin aficionado Dr. Arnold-Peter Weiss, whose January 2012 arrest during a coin auction at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel roiled the numismatic world. Coins shown from the Greek colony Akragas, Circa 409-406 B.C. An orthopedics professor at Brown University's Alpert Medical School and author of a hand-surgery textbook, Weiss also had been on a coin collector and investor for 35 years and had served as on the board of the American Numismatic Society. He later pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of stolen property. Those charges involved three coins he thought were fourth century B.C. Greek pieces that had been illegally taken from Italy, but were actually forgeries, prosecutors said. Weiss was aiming to sell one of them for about $350,000 and two others for about $1.2 million apiece, prosecutors said. Rare Greek silver coins of Katane, Sicily date back to Circa 405-403/2 B.C. Weiss also forfeited his interest in about 20 other coins as part of his plea agreement, which also required him to do 70 hours of community service and write an article about the problem of trading in coins of uncertain origin. His prosecution furthered a series of court cases and disputes over collecting and trading in objects that Italy and other countries consider looted pieces of their cultural patrimony. Institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles have agreed to return various items to Italy. A former Getty assistant curator was criminally prosecuted in Rome, but the trial ended in 2010 with a judge saying the statute of limitations had expired. Other countries, including Turkey and Greece, also have taken action in recent years to reclaim antiquities.","Coins were found during Dr. Arnold-Peter Weiss's 2012  arrest during a coin auction in New York .

"A former petrol station owner has made a mint after selling the world's only 'silver' two-pence piece for almost £1,400. David Didcock discovered the bizarre coin among a roll of brand new pennies while filling the till at his petrol station in Poole, Dorset, in 1988. Intrigued by the peculiar coin, Mr Didcock researched it and discovered it had been accidentally made from cupro-nickel in a strange quirk of the striking process. Auctioneer Richard Brommel with the 2p coin that sold at auction for £1,357, 67.850 times its face value . It is thought the coin, the only one of its kind in existence, was made from a cupro-nickel blank that was accidentally left inside a machine used to mint currency. Shortly before it was made a series of South African coins had been made from cupro-nickel and it is thought the blank might have been from that batch. Mr Didcock kept the coin in a drawer wrapped in cotton wool for 26 years before deciding to list it for auction. Experts had given it an estimate of £200 but the one-off coin sold to a private collector for a £1,357, a staggering 67,850 times its face value. Mr Didcock, 74, from Poole, said: 'At the time I owned a petrol station and I was opening up for the day when I realised there were no two pence pieces in the till.' He had a lucky break when he found a unique coin . Mr Didcock, 74, from Poole, said: 'At the time I owned a petrol station and I was opening up for the day when I realised there were no two pence pieces in the till. 'I got a new roll and tipped them into the tray but spotted a silver coin in amongst all the others. I was in a rush as I was going to a funeral so I put it in my pocket. 'Later that day I took a closer look and realised what it was, I thought 'Well this is different'. 'I started asking around and realised what it was, and I spoke to a few auctioneers who said if I got the authenticity I could sell it. 'The Royal Mint wouldn't give it to me and wanted the coin back. 'It appeared in the paper and people said to me 'You could retire on that'. 'I really enjoyed watching the auction and I'm very pleased with the result, it's great.' The coin was sold at Charterhouse auction house in Sherborne, Dorset, on Friday. Richard Bromell, auctioneer, said: 'I am incredibly pleased with the result, as is the vendor. The price realised is a fantastic return on investment. 'If you can turn a humble 2p piece into more than £1,300 then clearly you have a winning formula.","David Didcock discovered the coin while filling the till at his petrol station in Poole, Dorset, in 1988 .

"For centuries, shoes have held more than just a functional purpose for women. Many a night has been marred by squeezing into a pair of sky-scraper heels that are half a size too small, meaning a toss-up between a barefoot walk home and enormous blisters. But we still insist on spending a fortune on impractical heels season after season. Now the Victoria & Albert museum is planning an exhibition that charts our love affair with footwear through the ages called Shoes: Pleasure and Pain. Scroll down for video . For centuries, shoes have held more than just a functional purpose for women. Now the V&A museum is planning an exhibition that charts our love affair with footwear through the ages. Pictured is the High & Mighty shoot for American Vogue from February 1995 featuring model Nadja Auermann . The exhibition, which starts in June next year, will explore the agonising aspect of wearing extreme shoes, as well as the euphoria and obsession they can inspire. Some of the most extreme footwear in the world will go on display in the museum's summer 2015 fashion exhibition. More than 200 pairs of historic and contemporary shoes from around the world will be on show - many for the first time. They collection spans 2000 years and includes a sandal decorated in pure gold leaf originating from ancient Egypt to futuristic-looking shoes created using 3D printing.

Footwear for men and women by 70 named designers including Dior, Manolo Blahnik, Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo and Prada will also be on display. Historic lotus shoes made for bound feet and 16th-century chopines, silk mules with vertiginous platforms designed to lift skirts above the muddy streets, will also feature. Exhibition curator, Helen Persson, said: 'Shoes are one of the most telling aspects of dress. 'Beautiful, sculptural objects, they are also powerful indicators of gender, status, identity, taste and even sexual preference. 'Our choice in shoes can help project an image of who we want to be.'

Desirable shoes like the 'Pompadour', worn by trend-setting women in the 18th-century French court will sit together with designs by top names in fashion today such as Alexander McQueen and Sophia Webster. The shoe collection will also show how footwear can represent an expression of sexual empowerment or a passive source of pleasure. Like feet, shoes can be objects of fetishism. High Japanese geta, extreme heels and tight-laced leather boots will be on display as well as examples of erotic styles channeled by recent mainstream fashion. NOVA, by Zaha Hadid for United Nude .

In contrast, another part of the exhibition will be dedicated to dissecting the processes involved in designing and creating footwear, laying out the story from concept to final shoe. The displays will show how makers combine traditional craftsmanship with technological innovation and how they unite function with art. Designer sketches, materials, embellishments and shoe lasts, such as the lasts created by H. & M. Rayne for Princess Diana, will be on show in this section, alongside 'pullovers' from Roger Vivier for Christian Dior.

"Three French workers stole 900,000 euros worth of treasure they discovered in a house they were working on in Normandy . A trio of French workers are to appear before a court on charges of theft after they stole a treasure trove of gold bars and coins from a house they were working on. The loot, which they discovered in a house in Normandy, is estimated to be worth more than 900,000 euros ($1.2m) and was hidden in jars. In a bizarre premonition, the owner of the house had jokingly told the workers: 'If you find any treasure, you tell me!' According to a report in regional daily Paris Normandie, the jars contained six gold bars weighing a kilogram (2.2lbs) each, and 600 gold $20 coins from 1924 and 1927. It is thought they may have been hidden there during the Second World War. Rather than alert the owner of the house to their discovery, the workers, aged 20, 33 and 40, decided to steal the treasure and sell it to a coin collector in the area. But tax officials were alerted when one of the men began depositing high-value cheques. When investigators caught up with them, the men confessed to their crime. Police seized several vehicles, motorcycles and hundreds of thousands of euros from the workers as part of the investigation. The three will appear at a court in Evreux, north west of Paris, at an unspecified date. The coin collector will also appear before the court on charges of trying to conceal the theft, which he denies.

David Styles was savaged by a 120kg male cat named Charlie during a public show in the Big Cat arena at the Queensland zoo in November last year.

Scroll down for video . David Styles was savaged by a 120kg male cat named Charlie during a public show in the Big Cat arena at the Australia Zoo in November last year . As a result he suffered a crushed carotid artery, nicked jugular, paralysis to the left larynx and nerve damage that 'could have resulted in fatality'. 'Mr Styles admitted that he overly excited Charlie on this occasion which encouraged the tiger to play rougher than usual,' the report stated. The tiger handler added a blue blanket to his khaki work attire and placed surgical shoes over his hands  to make himself look different when the tigers appeared unenthusiastic to be involved in the show. 'This stimulates the tiger to investigate and interact with a new 'entity' rather than their 'usual' handler,' according to the report.

While that type of behaviour is normal interaction between a handler and tiger, on the day Mr Styles was attacked he fell into the pool, which subsequently resulted in him being bit on the neck and throat. 'Styles asserts it was the action of falling into the pool which may have been the catalyst for the over-excitement of the tiger and thus the bite occurred,' the report said. Mr Styles, who returned to work a few months after the incident, denied he was trying to get better footage for a BBC documentary when he was attacked.

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday accused Russia of 'creating problems' for countries which are seeking closer ties with the EU. She suggested Russian president Vladimir Putin is trying to ensure several of his country's neighbouring states remain dependent on it, rather than leaning towards the West.

'Russia is creating problems for all three.' 'Creating problems': Angela Merkel (left) suggested Russia's Vladimir Putin (right) is trying to ensure several of his country's neighbouring states remain dependent on it, rather than leaning towards the West . She pointed to 'frozen conflicts' in breakaway regions such as Transnistria in Moldova, as well as Russian interference in eastern Ukraine. Russia has shown its displeasure with Moldova's pro-European leanings in recent months, banning imports of certain goods from the country. Last month Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a 'strategic partnership' agreement with Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, drawing strong criticism from NATO and the EU. Beyond these moves, Merkel accused Moscow of trying to make countries in the western Balkans economically and politically dependent on Russia in order to gain influence there.

"Thousands of Syrian refugees have crossed the border into Turkey to avoid the threat of ISIS occupation. Many of those forced to flee were ethnic Kurds who face being raped and murdered at the hands of the brutal terrorist organisation. The refugees waited for several days in Raqqa city the Tal Abyad region of Syria while Turkish authorities considered their fate. The border was opened around Friday lunchtime allowing thousands of refugees to leave the warzone. Scroll down for video . Thousands of ethnic Kurds fled the approach of ISIS terrorists and massed on the border with Turkey hoping to cross the frontier to safety at about midday on Friday .

Men women and children took whatever belongings they could carry and fled from the heavily armed ISIS terrorists who were advancing with tanks and artillery . Heavily armed ISIS terrorists, equipped with artillery and tanks have captured more than 20 villages in the Kurdish-controlled area of Kobani. Ibrahim Halil, a Syrian Kurd who fled across the border with 3,000 other refugees said: 'Our house was destroyed. We have no family no property left. We have nothing now. Everything is gone.' Many of those who crossed the border had been waiting for 24 hours after Turkey, which is already home to nearly 850,000 registered Syrian refugees, refused to let them in on Thursday. Turkey decided to permit them to enter the country after reports emerged that militants were closing in on their communities. Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the priority is to help those in need on the Syrian side of the border, but 'if that's not possible then of course they will be given help (inside Turkey)'. Earlier, a group of Kurds from Turkey staged a protest at the border, demanding that Kurds fleeing Kobani be allowed in. The security forces fired tear gas to disperse the group. The battle over Kobani is part of a long-running fight between the Islamic State group and Syria's Kurds that has raged across several areas of northern Syria where large Kurdish populations reside. Families pleaded with border guards for any form of assistance as people looked distressed despite only being a few steps from safety .

On Saturday, Daniel Roark, 21, posted to his Facebook wall that the search he began in September had finally located the owner, Martin Castillo of Nuevo Laredo. A commercial and recreational diver from Gloucester, Massachusetts, Roark found the gold band while diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen on the Yucatan peninsula. Scroll down for video .

The ring bore an engraving with the name Jessica, as well as the date 16 02 13 and the acronym TYYJCEM. Roark now knows that 'Jessica' is Castillo's wife Jessica Garza, and the date that of their wedding last year. TYYJCEM likely stands for 'Tu y yo juntos contra el mundo' or 'You and I together against the world.' The Boston Globe reports that Roark was unconvinced by a message he received Saturday morning from someone claiming to be Garza's cousin. Roark finally got in touch with Castillo, who confirmed the details of the ring down to the size and showed Roark his wife's matching band and a receipt confirming the purchase. Castillo had lost his band on the first day of the couple's honeymoon. The ring slipped off his finger as Castillo and his wife were scuba diving in Barracuda Point and a five-hour search failed to turn up the piece of jewelry.

Writing on Facebook with a picture of the ring, he explained: 'Ok, so while scuba diving around Playa Reef, Playa Del Carmen last week, I happened to find this ring.' 'Unfortunately there is no way for me to know whether it was lost or intentionally thrown into the ocean.' 'Assuming it was not the latter, I'd like to find the owner so I can send it to them.' 'If you know a couple who was married on February 16th, 2013, who lost a wedding band (likely while diving) near Playa Del Carmen Mexico, please have them contact me at thelostweddingband@yahoo.com.'

"Unmasked: ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London . As a schoolboy growing up in west London, he enjoyed playing computer games and was a keen martial artist who friends remember as being light-hearted. But today, he is world's most reviled killer, revealed as a bloodthirsty executioner who revels in brutally taking the lives of innocent men in the most barbaric fashion. Mohammed Emwazi was today unmasked as the cowardly killer behind 'Jihadi John', the Islamic State's most notorious figure. Born in Kuwait, Emwazi first moved to Britain at the age of six. The son of a minicab driver, he was reported to have occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, south-east London. He is thought to have gone to Quintin Kynaston Academy in St John's Wood, north London, which was also attended by the pop singer Tulisa Contostavlos. The 26-year-old was a university student from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list. It is understood he studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, and was often seen in the prayer room between classes. A source who claimed to have met Emwazi in Syria told Channel 4 News that he was a member of one of the earliest groups from London who travelled to fight for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. He is believed to have been one of more than 700 foreign fighters in the Katiba al-Muhajireen (The Migrants Brigade) who arrived in the Middle East three years ago. Video shows Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, talking through his life in Syria with fellow fighters who proclaimed themselves a band of brothers. Scroll down for video . Terror: Emwazi is believed to have been one of more than 700 foreign fighters in The Migrants Brigade who arrived in the Middle East three years ago . Band of brothers: Emwazi was one of the first foreigners to arrive to fight in Syria, and teamed up with fellow fighters who proclaimed themselves a band of brothers . The source described him as personable, sometimes light-hearted but also extremely determined to ensure that jihadi fighters were seen in the media as people that the Western world must be afraid of. They also described Emwazi as a keen video games player and a martial arts practitioner. In a chilling twist, in a school yearbook from when he was 10, Emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game ""Duke Nukem: Time To Kill"" and his favourite book as ""How To Kill A Monster"" from the popular children's Goosebumps series. He also lists his favourite band as pop group S Club 7, and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30, writes: 'I will be in a football team and scoring a goal.' Emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue, his favourite animal as a monkey, his favourite cartoon as The Simpsons and chips as his favourite food. Ominously, they also described an occasion when Emwazi - as one of the best Arabic speakers in the brigade of foreign fighters - led the interrogation of a man who was questioned before being badly beaten. A teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to Channel 4, said that she remembered Emwazi as a  'diligent, hardworking, lovely young man'. She described him as responsible and quiet, and added: 'There was never any indication of any kind of violence at all.' Emwazi has featured in the execution videos of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. Horrifying: Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto (pictured) Emwazi claimed that MI5 persistently tried to recruit him after he graduated from university and also that counter-terrorism police arrested him in 2010 and put him on a terror watch list. But despite their best efforts, he managed to slip through the net of security service and managed to flee the country for Syria in 2012. Tonight, neighbours on the estate where the Emwazi family lived told of their shock that the world's most wanted man had lived amongst them. Home: Minicab driver's son Emwazi - who has three siblings - most recently lived at a flat in Queen's Park . On the scene: Police officers near the property where Emwazi once lived in Queen's Park, west London . Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I don't know him but it is worrying that someone like that could live so close to home.' At the end of Emwazi's street is a mosque but worshippers there said they did not know him. Standing outside the North Westminster Muslim Cultural Association, student Omar Shafi, 18, said: 'I've lived here all my life, I know everyone in the community and I don't know Mohammed Emwazi. 'I've never seen him before, I've never heard of him before, the man's a ghost. I go to this mosque every day and I've never seen him and it's the mosque he would go to if he lived here.' Another man, a 26-year-old worshipper at the local mosque who asked not to be named, said: 'It's a tragic circumstance where someone without the right guidance can fall into these ideas of fanaticism like lambs to the slaughter. 'It's very worrying to have such people like that running around, and it has come as quite a shock to the system, that he could have been somewhere I go regularly too. 'I don't know him and I don't think I've ever seen him before and I'm glad I haven't. But this is a fungus in society that we need to stop.'","Mohammad Emwazi, from London, today unmasked as Jihadi John .

"Members of Kenyan police and intelligence units accused of hunting down and assassinating terror suspects have claimed the killing of a controversial Muslim cleric was planned by high ranking officers and government officials. The men, who are part of three so-called death squads, spoke out about their secret activities after more than 60 people were killed in two separate terror attacks by Al Qaeda-linked terror group al-Shabaab in the last month. Speaking anonymously, they revealed that instead of arresting suspects they 'eliminate' them, and claimed the death of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed, who was accused of recruiting 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite, was ordered by the Kenyan National Security Council. A gunman (left) and a commando (right) from the Kenyan General Service Unit  have spoken out about their roles in so-called death squads allegedly tasked with hunting down and killing terrorists . A spy from the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) (left) said his job is to find and identify the suspects, while an officer from the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (right) claimed hundreds of suspects are killed by police every year . Ahmed, who was also known as Makaburi - meaning graveyard, was shot dead in April as he walked from a court in Mombasa to a nearby mosque. Human rights activists' have previously raised fears over police brutality in Kenya and claimed that the country's government - rattled by the presence of Islamic extremists - has been behind the deaths of several terror suspects. However, the Kenyan government has denied it runs an extrajudicial killing programme. Speaking exclusively to an Al Jazeera investigation programme, which will be aired on Monday evening, the four men - all members of Kenyan intelligence and special police units - say they have all been involved in the assassination of terror suspects, with one claiming to have killed more than 50. 'We don’t arrest,' a gunman from the Radiation Unit of the Kenyan General Service Unit's (GSU) elite Recce Company told the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit. The ATPU police officer and the GSU Recce Company commando said that controversial cleric Abubaker Shariff Ahmed (pictured) had been killed by police and his death ordered by the government . 'We never. In Recce Company we are sharpshooters. Why should a sharpshooter be taken to arrest?' He added: 'I’m in Radiation. And Radiation, that thing is very dangerous.' Describing his typical day he said: 'Usually eliminations happening here and there; in Mombasa, Muslims, radicals and all that. 'We are the elimination programme.' The gunman appears in the programme Inside Kenya’s Death Squads alongside a commando from Recce Company, a member of the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) and a spy for the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS). According to Al Jazeera, which agreed to conceal the men's identities for security reasons, all of the officers play an integral part in Kenya’s counter-terrorism strategy and all have had a hand in assassinating suspects. According to Al Jazeera, which agreed to conceal the men's identities for security reasons, all of the officers play an integral part in Kenya’s counter-terrorism strategy and all have had a hand in assassinating suspects . Speaking anonymously, the four officers revealed that instead of arresting suspects they 'eliminate' them . The ATPU police officer and the GSU Recce Company commando said that Ahmed had been killed by police and his death ordered by the government. In November last year, Ahmed had told Al Jazeera that he feared for his life, and predicted that counter-terrorism police would kill him. He died on April 1 and his companion was also shot dead. Ahmed . had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Lewthwaite, dubbed the White . Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Al-Qaeda-linked terror group al-Shabab, which counts her as a member. The British Muslim convert is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabab. However, in September last year Ahmed denied ever having met Lewthwaite, who is the widow of of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay. Although described by some as charismatic and intelligent, Ahmed held radical views and notably said that the four al-Shabab gunmen who slaughtered at least 67 people in Nairobi's Westgate Mall in September 'had every right to do what they did'. Attack: Rescue workers at the Nairobi-bound bus that was ambushed by al Shabab militants who killed 28 passengers when they were unable to recite an Islamic creed . Mortuary attendants carry in the bodies of 36 quarry workers killed by insurgents in Mandera, which is around eight miles from the border with Somalia . 'Islamically it is justified. We cannot allow foreign forces entering Muslim countries, killing innocent Muslim people and then it go unpunished,' he said, citing Kenya's military presence in Somalia and the need for an 'eye for an eye' defense of Muslim life. 'Makaburi was killed by the police,' the ATPU officer told Al Jazeera. 'That execution was planned in Nairobi by very top high ranking police officers and government officials.' The  commando added: 'The government did it yeah. This is the person who’s bringing trouble here, let us eliminate and we have peace.' The ATPU officer also told programme makers that the government’s National Security Council gives the order to execute terror suspects. He said: 'It comprises of the President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, NISIS Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and the Principal Secretary Interior. 'Any decision is made within that club of people.' Kenya has been hit by a spate of terror attacks at the hands of al-Shabab, which militants say are being carried out in retaliation for Kenya taking part in UN-backed peacekeeping activities in Somalia in October 2011. Last Tuesday militants from the Somali-based group killed 36 quarry workers, most of them Christian, in Mandera, which is around eight miles from the border with Somalia. On November 22, al-Shabaab fighters stopped a bus bound for Nairobi and shot 28 passengers who could not recite an Islamic creed. Authorities say the terror group has been behind at least 135 attacks, including the assault on Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall in September 2013 in which 67 people were killed. Al-Shabaab said it was responsible for other attacks on Kenya's coast earlier this year which killed at least 90 people. The officers in the programme said they believe assassinations of terror suspects is necessary because of the threat the country faces from insurgents. 'Since I was employed, I’ve killed over fifty', said the commando from Recce Company. 'I do become proud because I’ve eliminated some problems.' Asked if human rights should be taken into account he described a terror suspect as 'a very dangerous person to our country'. 'What do you do with such a person?', he said. 'Do you spare such a person because you are observing human rights? He added: 'The first person to get rid of is the leader.' And the ATPU officer claimed hundreds of suspects are killed by police every year. He said: 'Day in, day out, you hear of eliminating suspects. We have the police itself. We have special units like GSU. So not a total, but you can say about almost 500.' He added: 'That is police work.' Speaking about one case he confessed: 'They were targeted, identified and eliminated in front of their families.' The spy told the programme that his job is to find and identify the suspects. 'We pass the right information to the right source for the right action to be taken against them,' he said. Asked if his intelligence is used to eliminate suspects he answered: 'Yes, of course. We’ve done it and that is why we are there.'","Kenyan officers speak out about their work in so-called death squads .

"Alabama, Oregon, Florida State and Ohio State have been selected to play in the first College Football Playoff. Alabama is the top seed and will play Ohio State in one semifinal at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Oregon is the second seed and will play Florida State in the other semifinal at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Both games will be played New Year's Day.

Oregon won the game, 51-13. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) Florida State wide receiver Rashad Greene catches a touchdown pass against Georgia Tech . The Big 12 co-champs, Baylor and TCU, finished fifth and sixth. A 12-member selection committee set the field, revealing its selections Sunday morning. The College Football Playoff is replacing the Bowl Championship Series this season. The BCS matched the top two teams in the country in a national championship game. The playoff contenders did not make it easy on the committee chairman Jeff Long and his colleagues on the panel by all winning on Saturday. The committee has been ranking the top 25 weekly since late October's rankings and last week had Alabama and Oregon at the top, followed by TCU and Florida State. The committee ranks teams differently than traditional college football polls, such as the AP Top 25. Instead of collecting a ballot from each member and tallying votes, the committee ranks small groups by a series of votes . And Long, the athletic director at Arkansas, has said that each week the panel starts with a blank slate. The great debate for weeks was whether TCU or Baylor would make it into the final four. The Bears beat their Big 12 rivals 61-58 in Waco back in October, but from the start the committee ranked TCU ahead of the Bears, who lost at West Virginia by 14 and played a particularly weak nonconference schedule. For weeks, Long said that the difference between the Bears and Horned Frogs was not close enough for it to come down to the head-to-head result. But when the season concluded the teams had played 10 common opponents. The Big 12 further muddled the issue by not designating a champion by a tiebreaker.The Bears and Frogs both got a trophy and are called co-champions. Ohio State has come from the farthest during the season, overcoming an early loss to Virginia Tech to make a strong run. The Buckeyes final statement was a doozy: 59-0 against Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game Saturday. Alabama offensive lineman Josh Casher celebrates after a 42-13 win against Missouri on Saturday . Florida State's unbeaten record hasn't gotten the respect the Seminoles believe it deserves from the committee. The defending national champions are the only undefeated team in FBS. But numerous close calls and comebacks have led the committee to drop the Seminoles in the rankings. Ultimately, though, the 'Noles will get to defend their championship in the first playoff.

"Dolphins are known for their playful, inquisitive nature and even for saving humans who have got into trouble at sea. But the intelligent mammals are not so kind to harbour porpoises. Marine experts are investigating after one of the small mammals was allegedly murdered by a pod of bottlenose dolphins in West Wales. Brutal: Marine experts are investigating after a porpoise (pictured being thrown in the air) was allegedly murdered by a pod of dolphins . The lifeless body of the small porpoise was found floating in Cardigan Bay by a research team on Wednesday. Days earlier, the Sea Watch Foundation had witnessed a dolphin-attack on a harbour porpoise of a similar size and it is thought to be the same as the one that was found dead. Experts watched as three dolphins preyed on their smaller marine cousin. Dr Salomé Dussan-Duque, monitoring officer for Sea Watch Foundation, claimed the attack left the porpoise unable to swim properly. A sad sight: The lifeless body of the porpoise (pictured) was found floating in Cardigan Bay, West Wales, by a research team on Wednesday . A sustained attack: Dr Salomé Dussan-Duque, monitoring officer for Sea Watch Foundation, claimed the attack left the porpoise (pictured being tossed in the air) unable to swim after the dolphins repeatedly hit its side . The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is one of six species of porpoise. It is one of the smallest marine mammals and typically stays close to the coast or in river estuaries. The creature gets its name from Medieval Latin poropiscus, which means pig fish. Harbour porpoises have been known to dive 721 feet (220 metres) and can hold their breath for up to five minutes. Up until 2008, scientists were baffled about why quite large numbers of the small marine mammals were found dead - and the U.S. navy was even blamed for scores of dead porpoises in Virginia. But then tell-tale teeth marks were identified and examinations of the harbour porpoises' bodies revealed broken ribs, imploding lungs and internal bleeding, from prolonged dolphin attacks, The Telegraph reported. Most cases of the attacks have been documented along the east coast of Scotland and off the coast of Virginia. She said: ‘We saw the much larger dolphins hitting the animal on its side.’ ‘This violent behaviour is not unusual between these two species. ‘However, the opportunity to witness it so close at hand and to be able to record it so well is quite special.’ Harbour porpoises measure almost four feet (1.2metres) and five feet (1.5metres) long when fully grown, and are dwarfed by their larger cousins, the bottlenose dolphin. Bottlenose dolphins in UK waters can reach up to 14 feet (4.3 metres) in length, which is the largest size for this species of dolphin anywhere in the world. The assault was observed by a research team from Sea Watch Foundation who were aboard a boat called the Dunbar Castle, run by New Quay Dolphin Spotting Boat Trips. Another team, who discovered the dead porpoise days later, reported their find to the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP). The group deals with all reports of dead and stranded whales, dolphins and porpoises, and conducts post-mortems where appropriate. The CSIP team will now investigate the cause of death of the porpoise but the condition of the animal looked consistent with bottlenose dolphin attacks previously observed. Examinations of some harbour porpoises after an attack have previously revealed broken ribs, imploding lungs and massive internal bleeding.

"A sickening new video has emerged showing hundreds of savage supporters of the Islamic State kicking, punching and stamping three terrified Syrian soldiers to death before dragging their bloodied corpses through the streets chained to the back of motorcycles. The barbaric footage is believed to have been filmed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa and bears all the chilling hallmarks of ISIS' professionally produced and edited propaganda films. The gruesome killing of three  Syrian soldiers is just the latest in a long line of horrific filmed murders released by the Sunni Islamists since last summer's self-declaration of a caliphate in the vast areas of Syria and Iraq they control through a campaign of rape, massacre and brutal oppression. Scroll down for video . Savage: The bloodthirsty crowd is seen being unleashed on the men, surging forward and raining down kicks, punches and beatings with whatever objects are close at hand . Gisly: After being kicked to death, the men's bodies are dragged through the centre of the city of Raqqa . Fear: The three prisoners are seen on their knees in the centre of a circle of militants, who link arms to hold back the throng of young men intent on taking part in the particularly savage triple murder . Horror: The video begins by a bearded cleric  breathlessly reading out charges against three Syrian soldiers . ISIS' latest shocking murder video begins by showing hundreds of baying, bloodthirsty supporters of the terror group gathering in central Raqqa where a bearded cleric is seen breathlessly reading out charges against three Syrian soldiers dressed in military fatigues. Laughing children are seen clambering on walls and on to the shoulders of their grinning fathers to get a better view of proceedings, while a large group of niqab-wearing women gather nearby. The three prisoners are seen on their knees in the centre of a circle of the militants, who link arms to hold back the throng of young men intent on taking part in the savage triple murder. The footage is edited so the cleric's feverish Arabic ranting reverberates and echoes as the crowd of young, T-shirt and baseball cap-wearing supporters push and shove to get closer to the victims. Seconds later the crowd is unleashed on the men, surging forward and raining down kicks, punches and beatings with whatever objects are close at hand. So dense is the crowd desperate to take part in the brutal killings, that those on the periphery are more than a dozen rows back from the victims. A capella religious singing and chanting - known as nasheeds - soundtracks the barbaric scene. Audience: Laughing children are seen clambering on walls and on to the shoulders of their grinning fathers to get a better view of proceedings, while a large group of niqab-wearing women gather nearby . Throng: So dense is crowd desperate to take part in the brutal killing that those on the periphery are more than a dozen rows back from the victims . After showing the bloodthirsty crowd let loose on the men, the footage cuts to shots of their beaten and bloodied corpses being tied to the back of motorbikes. In an act of shocking brutality, the bodies are then seen being dragged through the centre of Raqqa while cheering militants follow close behind in speeding 4x4s - a convoy of death, honking horns in support of the terror group's latest blood-soaked atrocity. The heavily armed men riding the motorbikes are seen grinning and raising their index fingers in the air in a sign of religious devotion completely at odds with the sight of a chained and bloodied corpse bouncing along the road behind their vehicles. The gruesome footage emerged as Syrian rebels captured another 32 soldiers and pro-government gunmen near the northern city of Aleppo, according to activists. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Aleppo-based activist Ahmad Hamed said the troops were seized in the village of Ratyan after it was retaken by the rebels yesterday. The Observatory and Mr Hamed say intense clashes are taking outside a third village, Bashkoy, which was also taken by the government two days ago. The fighting comes as UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is trying to broker a truce for the war-ravaged Aleppo, Syria's largest city. Filmed: While some of the young men join in the killing, others are simply keen to catch it all on camera . Savages: The bodies are seen being dragged through the centre of the city while cheering militants follow close behind in speeding 4x4s - a convoy of death, honking their horns in rabid support of the atrocity . More than 120,000 fighters supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been killed in the country's civil war since it began in 2011, the Observatory reported in December. They said some 11,000 members of government forces and loyalist militias had been killed in the five months since Assad delivered an inauguration speech for a third presidential term. In a breakdown of the casualties, the group said some 5,631 armed forces members have been killed in violence including shelling, gunfights, aircraft crashes, suicide attacks, snipers, executions and car bombs since the speech. Another 4,492 fighters from loyalist militias had been killed, as well as 735 fighters of Arab, Asian and Iranian origin, and 91 from the Lebanese Shi'ite movement Hezbollah, the monitoring group said.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A tasty royal wedding memento sold for $7,500 at auction on Friday, exceeding the auction house's expectations. Julien's of Beverly Hills had predicted a slice of fruit cake from the eight-tier cake served at Prince William and Duchess Catherine's 2011 wedding ceremony would earn $2,000 at most. The cake reportedly took 5 weeks to bake and was said to hit its peak flavor after 13 months, CNN Money reports. Scroll down for video . Legacy: At the Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, a slice of cake from the 2011 royal wedding of Prince William, and Kate Middleton is on sale . It came with a blank wedding invitation printed on royal stationery. Julien's executive director Martin Nolan said the auction house sold a piece of cake from the wedding of Princess Diana and Prince Charles a few years ago, which brought around $6,000. The cake was 27 years old at the time. This auction included bidding on other royal items as well, as five of Princess Diana's dresses were set to be auctioned off. The dresses are expected to fetch $60,000 to $100,000 each. Kate and William's cake was a bespoke creation, crafted by cake-maker Fiona Cairns. It took her five weeks to complete the confectionery masterpiece. The elaborate gateau was covered in cream and white icing and decorated with 900 delicate sugar-paste flowers. The culinary masterpiece took center stage at the Buckingham Palace reception held in the picture gallery on the day of their wedding. Fiona, 59, whose confections are sold in Harrods, Selfridges and Waitrose, was contacted by St James's Palace in February and asked if she would make William and Kate's wedding cake.

Royal wedding memorabilia is extremely collectible and hard to get hold of, the Julien's auction will offer a rare opportunity to fans, pictured - Kate and Will on their wedding day in 2011 . It appears that the humble slice of wedding cake may be worth its grand price tag as Fiona says that creating the dessert was a meticulous and exhausting task. 'We reflected some of the architectural details in the room so the garlands on the walls were reproduced loosely on the fourth tier - we've used roses, acorns, ivy leaves, apple blossom and bridal rose.' The bride wanted elements from the Joseph Lambeth technique of cake decoration, where intricate piping is used to make three dimensional scroll work, leaves, and flowers. Kate also gave Fiona detailed instructions for her to include 17 different blooms and foliage for their meaning or symbolism - known as the 'language of flowers'. Also under the hammer is a blank invitation to the same wedding, printed on Queen Elizabeth II's Buckingham Palace stationary. 'The Lord Chamberlain is commanded by The Queen to invite __ to the Marriage of His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales, K.G. with Miss Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on Friday 29th April at 11.00 a.m.,' it reads.

"These are the amazing scenes when drag racer Kelly Harvey crashes his vintage 1955 Chevy during a drag race, rolling the car several times. Harvey was racing a 1970s Camaro at the Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain, Colorado, when he lost control of his car, flipping several times. Race was ripped from the seat by the force of the crash and was thrown feet-first out through the windshield. Scroll down for video . Kelly Harvey was trying to catch up to the black Camaro, right, inside his classic 1955 Chevy, left . Mr Harvey said he had only fitted a lap belt to his 1955 Chevy which he brought to the race track . As the two cars raced down the track, the Camaro approached the centre line forcing Harvey to react . Amazingly, seconds after the car came to rest, Harvey clambered back into his car and to the surprise of the onlooking crowd, Harvey clambered out of the passenger side door. The dramatic smash was captured on video and shows how the Chevy was slightly behind the Camaro which started weaving in its lane. The Camaro approached the centre line forcing Harvey to react, who lost control of his own car sending it spinning. When the car comes to a rest, steam is pouring from its engine bay and Harvey can be seen laying face down with his legs through the car's windshield. He told 7NEWS: 'Once (the car) started tumbling, it seemed like it took forever . 'I just couldn't wait for it to stop. And I think that's why I popped out of the car so fast. I just wanted it to be over.' The father-of-four said he has drag raced possibly one thousand times but never had an accident such as this. Harvey tried to pull full opposite lock in a desperate attempt to keep it under control . Harvey overcorrects his 1955 Chevy forcing it sideways where it tumbled out of control at high speed . The car rolled over several times, with bits of bodywork and the car's hood flying off . He said he had recently fitted a lap belt to the 1955 car, which did not have a racing seat or a full racing harness. Harvey admitted he overcorrected when powering down the straight and even clipped the other car. He said: 'It's just a fun cruiser car, not a race car and therefore it was unprepared. I didn't take it as seriously as I should have as far as safety equipment goes.' He said he must have had an 'angel riding shotgun.' When the car comes to a rest, shocked onlookers can see Harvey's legs sticking out across the hood . Spectators can barely believe it as the driver's door of the car opens before emergency services arrive . Harvey, pictured, walks unsteadily from his wrecked car which was destroyed by the high speed impact . He added: 'Sunday morning when I saw the video, it really started to kind of hit home a lot more. When I saw the severity of it and how lucky I really was to have gotten out of that alive -- let alone pretty much unhurt.' Despite the major crash Harvey, who drives a tow truck for a living, said he looks forward to going back on the race track. In a statement released by the Colorado Street Outlaws Drag Racing Event, Harvey said: 'My seat belts were not mounted properly and pulled through the floor of the car. 'I'm grateful to the staff and safety crew at PPIR for such a rapid response to my situation.' Race track general manager Bob Boileau said: 'PPIR sets standards for all its events to keep drivers, crew, and spectators safe However, it is the responsibility of the car owner, driver and crews to be sure their vehicles are prepared to take to the track. We're glad there were no serious injuries.'","Drag racer Kelly Harvey destroys his 1955 Chevy in a high speed crash .

"An American probe launched eight years ago to explore Pluto has awoken from hibernation in deep space as it nears the dwarf planet and its moons. New Horizons came out of hibernation this evening and has transmitted a message back to mission control on Earth showing that all of its systems are fully working. Alice Bowman, a physicist from Johns Hopkins University, said: 'New Horizons is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space, nearly three billion miles from home, but its rest is over.' The New Horizons probe has successfully awoke from its last period of hibernation 3billion miles from Earth as it prepares to make the first detailed observations of Pluto and its atmosphere (artist's impression) The craft is currently three billion miles from this planet meaning radio messages beamed back take nearly four and a half hours to arrive. New Horizons was launched in January 2006 and drifted through space in hibernation for 1,873 days, about two thirds of its journey, while it travelled to the edge of our solar system. During its trip, NASA engineers briefly woke the craft every few months to check if its systems were still functioning. The craft's computer has also been sending a weekly message to Earth, making 267 messages since it launched. During its journey, New Horizons passed three to four times closer to Jupiter than the previous probe, using the planet's gravity to increase its speed and reduce journey times to Pluto by three years. While the probe has now awoken from its last hibernation phase, it will still take seven months to reach its closet point from Pluto, passing within 7,767miles of the planet's surface in July 2015. As it flies past, it will beam images of Pluto and its largest moon Charon back to Earth, which will be the most detailed pictures ever taken of the bodies. While there it will also examine several small, icy bodies in the Kupier Belt, the most densely populated part of our solar system which begins around 2.5billion miles from Earth. As Pluto has an elliptical, or oval-shaped orbit, it strays into this region on its 247.7-year orbit around the sun. The object there are leftover debris from the birth of our solar system 4.6billion years ago. Scientists have identified three possible objects that New Horizons could collect data from, which sit about 1.5billion miles further on from Pluto. New Horizons begins its exploration of Pluto in January at a distance of about 160million miles. This image of Jupiter and its moon Io was taken by New Horizons as it passed close to the planet in 2007, using its gravitational field to boost its speed and reduce the journey time to Pluto by three years . During its mission, New Horizons will collect data on Pluto and Charon's surfaces, giving astronomers an up-close look at the dim surfaces that are difficult to see from Earth. The craft carries onboard seven instruments including infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers - which measure UV and infra-red waves, a multicolor camera, a high-resolution telescopic camera and a space dust detector. All of the instruments aboard New Horizons draw power from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator - a type of nuclear motor - which provides less power than a pair of 100-watt light bulbs. Pluto is about 2,300 kilometers in diameter, smaller than Earth's moon, and has a mass about 500 times less than Earth. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union withdrew Pluto's status as a planet, reclassifying it as a dwarf planet and leaving the solar system with eight planets. The news that New Horizons has successfully awoken is just the latest development in what has been an exciting few weeks for space travel. On November 12 the European Space Agency made a momentous achievement in the history of space travel by successfully landing the first space probe, Rosetta, on a comet. Though the probe's harpoons failed to launch, meaning it ultimately landed in a cave with its main solar panels blocked, it managed to use all of its instruments before running out of battery. And two days ago NASA launched the first test flight of its Orion space-craft, hailed as the start of the Mars-era, it has the potential to carry astronauts to an asteroid and the red planet.","New Horizons probe has woken from hibernation 3billion miles from Earth .

"Bestiality brothels are spreading through Germany faster than ever thanks to a law that makes animal porn illegal but sex with animals legal, a livestock protection officer has warned. Madeleine Martin told the Frankfurter Rundschau that current laws were not protecting animals from predatory zoophiles who are increasingly able to turn to bestiality as a 'lifestyle choice'.

"Business Secretary Vince Cable said small companies are being starved of cash by lenders bailed out by British taxpayers . Efforts to force banks to increase lending to struggling small firms have failed, Vince Cable admitted yesterday. In an astonishing attack on one of George Osborne’s flagship policies to boost the economy, the Business Secretary claimed the ‘route of using big institutions didn’t work’ and said there was still a ‘lot of frustration with the big banks’. Singling out state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland, he said that five years after the financial crisis small companies are still being starved of cash by lenders which were bailed out by British taxpayers. ‘The restriction on credit that followed the financial crisis is a problem that has persisted to this day,’ he said. ‘Five years after the crisis, we still have more money being taken out [of small business lending], by Royal Bank of Scotland in particular, than being put in by Lloyds, Santander and some of the new challenger banks.’ Mr Cable’s comments came at an event to promote the Government-backed British Business Bank, which provides state support for ‘challenger banks’ and other alternatives to the main High Street lenders. The damning verdict on the Government’s efforts to provide a lifeline to small firms represents a direct challenge to the Chancellor, who launched the Funding for Lending scheme in August 2012 and has consistently hailed it as a success. It was designed to boost the economy by halting a downward spiral of lending and borrowing since the onset of the financial crisis. Under the scheme, the Bank of England has provided lenders with billions of pounds in cheap funds on condition that they increase lending. But while the banks have benefited from a glut of cheap cash, net lending to small and medium-sized firms continues to fall. Net lending is the amount lent minus repayments. Latest figures from the Bank of England also show net lending under the Funding for Lending Scheme slumped by £1.2billion in the first half of the year. This has been driven by a £1.1billion fall at RBS, which received a £46billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008. Mr Cable said many small firms have become so exasperated they have ‘walked away from the banks’ because they were ‘given a bad deal’. George Osborne launched the Funding for Lending scheme in August 2012. It was designed to boost the economy by halting a downward spiral of lending and borrowing since the onset of the financial crisis . He continued: ‘Ever since I got into government I’ve been having conversations with George Osborne about how we get small business lending going. 'Our initial instincts were, we have these big banks who have been rescued by the state, why on earth don’t they do it? For a variety of reasons, it never happened.’ Mr Cable said: ‘There is a lot of frustration with the big banks which have failed to prioritise lending to SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises].’ Banks face an inquiry from the Competition and Markets Authority into their failure to lend. This marked a major victory for the Daily Mail’s Make the Banks Lend campaign launched in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms, which need money to grow. Last night the Treasury hit back, describing Funding for Lending as ‘hugely successful at improving credit conditions for businesses’. It added: ‘The biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that’s providing economic security for hard-working people.’ An RBS spokesman said: ‘RBS is the biggest lender for UK SMEs. We are on target to boost new lending by at least 10 per cent to over £9billion this year, and we continue to support thousands more businesses with their expansion plans, having contacted 290,000 SME customers offering over £11.5billion in additional funding.’","Liberal Democrat said efforts to force banks to increase lending have failed .

"A British-born photographer kidnapped by Al Qaeda could have been saved if US special forces hadn’t attempted a rescue operation, his family said yesterday. US Navy SEALS - with the help of British special forces - mounted a dramatic rescue bid to save Luke Somers but he was shot dead by his captors as they moved in to the compound in Yemen. His heartbroken family were kept in the dark about the operation and were against a rescue mission because they believed he would have been freed through negotiations. British-born photographer Luke Somers, kidnapped by Al Qaeda, could have been saved if US special forces hadn’t attempted a rescue operation, his family said yesterday . A South African teacher being held prisoner alongside Mr Somers was due to be released by the terrorists yesterday but he too was killed in the raid as it emerged forces in the botched rescue attempt were not aware he was there. Speaking from her home in Deal, Kent, Mr Somers’s stepmother Penny Bearman, 55, told the Mail: ‘At no point were we told of the plans. ‘The FBI have been keeping Luke’s dad informed of developments, but only after they have happened.’ She said, had they been told, ‘certain family members would have been very much against it’. ‘There was every chance his release would have been secured by a negotiation as the South African’s captive had been. Elite: Navy SEALs carry out training missions in preparation for real-world combat (file image) ‘As a family we believe, like we think Luke would have, negotiation would have been the way forward.’ US Navy Seals crept within 100 yards of the compound in a remote mountain hideout in Yemen where the hostages were being held on Saturday. The raid was thwarted when the advancing forces were spotted by a lone insurgent. The mission was ordered by Barack Obama after terrorists on Thursday had threatened to kill photographer Mr Somers, 33, if the US did not meet the group’s unspecified demands or if another rescue was attempted. Mr Somers, who spent most of his childhood in London but later became a US citizen, was killed shortly after the dawn raid began in Shabwa province, a stronghold of the terrorist network Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). It is understood a British force of 10 SAS and intelligence operatives based in the region provided key information to their US counterparts. Pierre Korkie was shot dead by the terrorist group alongside Mr Somers after mediators had been working on an ‘arrangement to take him out’. Begging for mercy: Luke's brother, Jordan (left), and his mother, Paula Somers (right), released a video onThursday asking his Al Qaeda captors to release him . A charity working with Mr Korkie said they had expected his release on Sunday, and that the US rescue attempt had ‘destroyed everything’. Gift of the Givers’ Yemen project director Anas Hamati said: ‘His passport was ready, everything was ready. ‘In that time the attack happened by US special forces in Yemen and that has destroyed everything.’ A senior official in the US administration said that the rescuers were not aware that Mr Korkie was being held with Mr Somers. It is understood that a payment had been made to enable the release of Mr Korkie. Mr Korkie was abducted with his wife Yolande in May last year in Taiz, Yemen. She was freed on 10 January without ransom and returned to South Africa. The charity said in a statement: ‘The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al-Qaeda tomorrow.’ Mr Somers was kidnapped in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 by an Al Qaeda affiliate . Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times . Mr Somers had moved to Yemen in 2011 to teach English but soon began photographing protests in the capital. He was taken hostage in 2013 and sold to AQAP by local criminals. Mrs Bearman told the Mail how Mr Somers’ family members were kept in the dark about what was happening. She said: ‘It has all been very hush hush. The individual family members are not supposed to get involved with political decision making. ‘It has been very frustrating but not at all surprising.’ She added: ‘The more publicity these cases get the more they seem to end badly.’ Asked if the family were supportive of the rescue operation, she responded: ‘No. We think Luke would have believed that talking to them would have led to his release.’ His sister Lucy, 25, said: ‘Luke was a loving, creative and curious person. A charity working with Mr Korkie said they had expected his release on Sunday, and that the US rescue attempt had ‘destroyed everything’ ‘He found a way of life and people that he loved in Yemen, and worked tirelessly to raise awareness where he saw suffering around him, to join people together, and help change situations for the better. ‘The tragedy of his death, and injustice of how he was used, must be undone by the warmth, strength, and humanity in his images.’ The dramatic raid was launched under the cover of darkness following a desperate search for the terrorists’ hideout. A team of up to 20 Navy SEALS then watched the Al Qaeda compound in the village of Wadi Abadan for 24 hours, fine-tuning their preparations. On Friday evening, up to a further 80 Navy SEALS and Yemeni troops were flown from a US ship in the Arabian Gulf and touched down at a secret landing zone near the village. According to US and Yemeni reports, a dramatic firefight took place after an insurgent spotted their advance and raised the alarm just as the Navy SEALS were poised to snatch the hostages. The heavily armed SEALS sprinted from house to house, surrounding the compound and shooting up to ten suspected terrorists. US commanders appealed for the terrorists to surrender but they shot the two hostages which prompted the forces to open fire. US forces pulled Mr Somers and Mr Korkie on to V-22 Osprey aircraft and medical teams began performing surgery in mid-air. One hostage died during the short flight and the second died after the Ospreys landed on the USS Makin Island, a navy ship in the region.","US Navy SEALS mounted a dramatic rescue bid to save Luke Somers .

"Republicans will hold at least 246 House seats come January, according to election results on Saturday, giving the GOP a commanding majority that matches the party's post-World War II high during Democratic President Harry S. Truman's administration. The GOP retained control of two seats in runoffs in Louisiana, expanding the advantage for Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who can afford defections from his increasingly conservative caucus and still get legislation passed.

The latest count gives the GOP a 246-188 majority. One race, in Arizona, is still outstanding. In Louisiana's 5th Congressional District, which extends from the state's northeast into parishes bordering Mississippi, physician Ralph Abraham defeated Jamie Mayo, the Democratic mayor of Monroe. The incumbent, Vance McAllister, had failed to advance to the runoff. Elected less than a year ago, the married McAllister saw his career undermined after a video surfaced earlier this year showing him kissing another woman. In the 6th Congressional District, in the Baton Rouge area, former state coastal restoration chief Garret Graves turned back Democrat Edwin Edwards, a four-term governor and ex-congressman who had to overcome his 2000 corruption conviction and subsequent prison term.

In a Democratic-held district in the Tucson, Arizona-area, an automatic recount will determine whether Rep. Ron Barber keeps his seat or Republican challenger Martha McSally prevails. McSally led by fewer than 200 votes. If McSally wins, Republicans would have 247 seats, the largest majority since 1929-31 when the GOP controlled 270 seats in President Herbert Hoover's administration. In the midterm election rout, House Republicans prevailed on Democratic turf, netting 12 seats and winning in New York, Illinois, Maine, New Hampshire and Iowa. Republican challengers knocked out long-term Democratic incumbents in Georgia and West Virginia, seats that the GOP now could hold for generations as the party maintains its stranglehold on the South.

The 246 seats match the total the GOP had in 1947-49 when Truman occupied the White House. Obama suffered an ignominious distinction.

"Comedian, journalist and disability advocate Stella Young has died aged 32. Young died on Saturday evening, according to a statement released by her family. 'With great sadness we acknowledge the passing of Stella Young, our much loved and irreplaceable daughter and sister. Stella passed away on Saturday evening, unexpectedly, but in no pain,' the statement said. Her family said they will hold a private funeral, followed by a public event in Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Comedian, journalist and disability advocate Stella Young died on Saturday evening aged 32 . In a statement Ms Young's family said she passed away unexpectedly but in no pain . In a statement ABC managing director Mark Scott said Ms Young was an unforgettable communicator and a passionate advocate. 'Stella helped us understand disability issues by sharing with a raw honesty about her own life and forcing us to reconsider how we think about disability and create an environment where those with disability can best get on with their own lives,' Mr Scott said. 'She took great delight in challenging conventional wisdom and lazy thinking. 'It is so hard to believe we have all lost Stella at such a young age. She was so talented, so widely loved and respected.' Just a few weeks ago, Ms Young vowed to do all she could to meet her 80-year-old self. But the comedian, writer and high-profile disability activist was painfully aware she might not make it. ABC managing director Mark Scott said Ms Young was an unforgettable communicator and a passionate advocate . She was described as taking great delight in challenging 'conventional wisdom' and 'lazy thinking' 'I can't tell you for certain that you and I will ever meet,' she said in a letter to her octogenarian self, published in the book Women Of Letters. 'Perhaps that thing I always say flippantly, usually with a third glass of wine in my hand - that I'm here for a good time not a long time - perhaps that's true. 'But on my path to reach you, I promise to grab every opportunity with both hands, to say yes as often as I can, to take risks, to scare myself stupid, and to have a s***load of fun.' Three days before she died, the comedian, journalist and activist was still busy trying to change people's perceptions of disability. Ms Young was the headliner at the NSW government's comedy cabaret night No Offence, But! in Sydney last Wednesday to celebrate international day for people with disabilities. Ms Young is being remembered for the way she confronted stereotypes, especially during a TEDx talk she gave in Sydney in April. In her address, Ms Young hit out at able-bodied people who use disabled people as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves. The comedian said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a 'great injustice' and actually makes life harder for disabled people . 'I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember by own name,' she said. The comedian and writer said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a 'great injustice' and actually makes life harder for disabled people. 'Lots of disabled people have said that they've always felt like this and never been able to put their finger on why it makes them feel uncomfortable,' Ms Young told Daily Mail Australia following her talk this year. 'Almost as many have disagreed and that's fine! We're a wildly diverse mob.' Young was born in Stawell, Victoria in 1982 with Osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition that causes bones to break easily. She set out as a teenager to change the world, auditing businesses in Stawell's main street for their accessibility. At 17 she 'came out' as a disabled woman and started calling herself a 'crip' - 'a word that makes me feel strong and powerful', she explained. Ms Young made her start as a journalist on community television station Channel 31 and most recently worked for ABC Radio and TV. Ms Young was born with the condition Osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease . She was the founding editor of the ABC's Ramp Up website dedicated to news, opinion and discussion about disability. The website launched in 2010 but was shut down this year after its funding was cut in the Federal Budget. Ms Young stayed working with the ABC as regular contributor to The Drum, online, radio and television. She was a two-time state finalist in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival's Raw Comedy competition. Her debut show Tales from the Crip won the Best Newcomer Award at the 2014 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and she was preparing to tour it nationally and to the Soho Theatre in London in 2015. Ms Young was a member of the Victorian Disability Advisory Council, Ministerial Advisory Council for the Department of Victorian communities and Women With Disabilities Victoria. She recently toured the United States at the request of the US government, who saw her as a future world leader on disability and other issues. Fellow comedians, columnists and disability advocates including Josh Thomas, Charlie Pickering, Kurt Fearnley and Adam Spencer have led the outpouring of tributes to Ms Young on Twitter.","Stella Young died on Saturday evening, her family said in a statement .

Sales have risen rapidly – around 2,000 a month are being bought – and electronics retailer Maplin said they are currently one of its biggest sellers. The most sophisticated designs cost up to £3,000. A plane had a near miss with drone as it landed at Heathrow (pictured) on July 22 in the first recorded incident . They can include cameras and are usually used for recreational purposes – although increasingly they are being considered for commercial uses, such as carrying deliveries and monitoring farmers’ crops. The Airprox Board will publish a report later this week into the Heathrow incident, which involved an Airbus A320 that can carry up to 180 passengers. The jet was flying at an altitude of 700ft on the afternoon of July 22 this year when the pilot spotted the drone. He reported the near miss and an inquiry was launched by the board. Worryingly, investigators were unable to identify the drone and it disappeared after the sighting. It is the latest in a series of incidents involving unmanned planes. In May, the pilot of a 74-seat plane reported that a quadcopter drone flew within 80ft as he was approaching Southend airport and in December 2012, the crew of a Boeing 777 coming in to land at Gatwick said they saw ‘two white or silver discs’. Drones (file picture) are priced from just £35 and sales have jumped thanks to extra pre-Christmas demand . In April this year, the owner of a remote-controlled plane was ordered to pay £4,340 in fines and costs after his machine crashed in a no-fly zone near a shipyard in Cumbria for defence company BAE Systems, where nuclear submarines were being built. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) has demanded better protection for the public against the risk of drones. There are currently few rules on operating drones. But Balpa wants them to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft, including only being flown by operators with pilot-equivalent training. Balpa general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘The UK should become a “safe drone zone” so we can make the most of the major business and leisure opportunities offered by remotely piloted aircraft, while protecting passengers, pilots and residents.’ The device was spotted by the pilot but was not detected by air traffic control radars at Heathrow  (pictured) He added: ‘The technology is developing quickly and we could see remote aircraft the same size as a Boeing 737 being operated commercially in our skies within ten years.’ In October, intelligence experts warned of the misuse of drones and called for ‘urgent’ measures to safeguard British airspace to cope with commercial use, which is expected to be more widespread by 2035. Their research for a University of Birmingham report said that the ‘hazards presented by inadvertent or accidental misuse of [drones], or the consequences of their malfunctioning, are becoming better understood’. And a conference on unmanned craft in London last month heard that police were worried about injuries on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones.","Incident was rated as risk rating of A - the most serious of near-collisions .

"Everton defender Bryan Oviedo is ready to make his return from an horrific double leg break in Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie at Swansea. The Costa Rica international suffered the injury against Stevenage in an FA Cup fourth round game in January and was forced to miss the World Cup. Everton boss Roberto Martinez said: 'The really good news is that Bryan Oviedo is in the squad for the first time since breaking his leg.' Everton defender Bryan Oviedo trains at Finch Farm, Liverpool last week ahead of his return to action . Striker Aroune Kone could also play at the Liberty Stadium following an 11-month layoff with a knee injury, but Seamus Coleman and Steven Pienaar are definitely out. Everton are looking to bounce back from Sunday's 3-2 home Barclays Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace. The result means that, ahead of Saturday's derby trip to Liverpool, the Toffees have conceded 13 goals in the opening five games of their league campaign, the worst defensive record in the division. But Martinez insists there is no problem with his players' attitude towards defending. 'We had two very good performances defensively (a 4-1 Europa League home victory over Wolfsburg and 2-0 Premier League win at West Brom) previous to that (the Palace match), so it is not that there is a problem that has been developing,' Martinez said. Oviedo suffered a double leg break in January but is now ready to return against Swansea on Tuesday . 'I do think that the performance and clean sheet against West Brom brought our defensive intensity back to our play. 'I think it was back against Wolfsburg as well, and yesterday was just a bit different. 'Unfortunately we made a couple of bad decisions and errors which cost us goals. But I don't think it's the case of a lack of a defensive attitude of the team. 'It was a very rare game. The spooky side of it was that we replicated against Crystal Palace the performance we had in April, with the same scoreline. But we will learn from it.' Everton manager Roberto Martinez (left) watches on as his side lose 3-2 to Crystal Palace . Martinez once again dismissed the idea that his side had any kind of Europa League hangover following their clash with Wolfsburg on Thursday. He said: 'No, it wasn't that. If it had been that we couldn't find our rhythm or our normal way of playing because we were tired or didn't have the energy, I would say that was down to the fact we played an extra game on Thursday. 'But that wasn't the case at all - if anything, it was the opposite. If you watched the first 15 or 20 minutes, we were the ones with the real intent on the ball. We looked fresh and were penetrating. 'All in all, I felt the players who came in were ready.'","Bryan Oviedo is back in the Everton squad for Tuesday's Capital One Cup match away to Swansea .

"President Barack Obama is prescribing time and vigilance to tackle problems as entrenched in American society as racism and bias. He also is urging patience, saying progress usually comes in small steps. In an interview with BET, the president described his conversation with a group of young civil rights activists, including a leader of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, he hosted last week in the Oval Office. Obama said he told them that 'this is something that is deeply rooted in our society, it's deeply rooted in our history.' America has made gains, and that 'gives us hope' of making more progress, he said. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama is prescribing time and vigilance to tackle problems as entrenched in American society as racism and bias . Obama told BET 'What I told the young people who I met with, that we're gonna have more conversations like this over the coming months, is this isn't gonna be solved overnight. This is something that is deeply rooted in our society. It's deeply rooted in our history. 'But the two things that are going to allow us to solve it. Number one: is the understanding that we have made progress. And so, it's important to recognize, as painful as these incidents are, we can't equate what is happening now to what was happening 50 years ago. And if you talk to your parents, grandparents, uncles, they'll tell you that things are better. Not good, in some cases, but better.' He continued, 'And the reason it's important for us to understand progress has been made is that then gives us hope that we can make even more progress. The second thing that I insisted to these young people is, we have to be persistent. Because, typically progress is in steps. It's in increments. 'You know, when you're dealing with something as deeply rooted as racism or bias in any society, you gotta have vigilance, but you have to recognize that it's going to take some time and you just have to be steady - so that you don't give up when we don't get all the way there.' The full interview is set to air Monday night. A video excerpt was released Sunday. BET announced that 'President Obama discussed his strategy not only to investigate the various incidents, but ways in which he believes that the country can come together during this time.' Obama (seen Monday) said he told a group of young civil rights activists that 'this is something that is deeply rooted in our society, it's deeply rooted in our history' A splinter group reportedly broke off from a peaceful demonstration Saturday night, and officers attempting to get the crowd to disperse used smoke and tear gas, a police spokeswoman said . A Berkeley police officer received hospital treatment for a dislocated shoulder after being hit with a sandbag, while another sustained minor injuries, police spokeswoman Jenn Coats said . Mostly peaceful protests of a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man continued around the country, but authorities said a march in California turned violent when a splinter group smashed windows and threw objects at police. A Berkeley police officer received hospital treatment for a dislocated shoulder after being hit with a sandbag, while another sustained minor injuries, police spokeswoman Jenn Coats said. She said several businesses were looted and damaged when a splinter group broke off from the peaceful demonstration Saturday night, and officers attempting to get the crowd to disperse used smoke and tear gas. Protesters threw rocks, bricks, bottles, pipes and other objects at officers, and some squad cars were damaged. At least six people had been arrested by the time the unrest ended early Sunday morning, Coats said. Thousands of demonstrators have protested peacefully in New York and elsewhere since the announcement Wednesday that a grand jury declined to indict a white officer in the death of Eric Garner, a black man who gasped 'I can't breathe!' while being placed in a chokehold as he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. The decision closely followed a Ferguson, Missouri, grand jury's choice not to indict a white officer in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. The scope of the demonstrations and the lack of violence were moving to Garner's mother and widow, they said Saturday. 'It is just so awesome to see how the crowds are out there,' said Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, who added that she ended up stuck in her car after protests shut down traffic. 'I was just so proud of that crowd,' Carr said. 'It just warmed my heart.' Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, said she saw demonstrators from her apartment window and told her son, 'Look at all the love that your father's getting.' Activist Sabra Wazwaz leads protesters across the Hennepin Bridge in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday . Josheynah Fields, a student at North Central University participates in a 'die in' on Government Plaza in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday . Officers have said the outcry over the grand jury decision has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street. 'Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,' said Patrick Lynch, president of the police union. Garner's family members joined the Rev. Al Sharpton later Saturday as Sharpton laid a wreath at the site on Staten Island where Garner died July 17 in a confrontation that started when police tried to arrest him. An amateur video seen by millions showed Garner gasping, 'I can't breathe' during the fatal encounter. 'All we're concerned about is justice from the police,' said Garner's stepfather, Benjamin Carr, who wore a T-shirt with the words, 'Enough is enough.' Protests continued in New York City for a fourth day with several dozen people lying down on the floor of Grand Central Terminal and marching into stores in Times Square. There were no reports of arrests. Protests have also been held in Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas and a number of other cities. In Seattle, several hundred people marched downtown to police headquarters Saturday. Authorities said a group then split off from the main protest and tried to get onto a roadway. Police say some protesters threw rocks at officers who blocked them from entering it. Seven were arrested. Sharpton announced plans this week for a march in Washington, D.C., next Saturday to protest the killings of Garner, Brown and others and to press for change at the federal level.","The president said in a television interview that he had a conversation with a group of young civil rights activists .

"Despite a stunning performance yesterday, Lindsey Vonn's hopes of returning to the ski world on top were crushed on Sunday when she lost an event at the Lake Louise World Cup. The champion skier, who nabbed gold in the Vancouver Olympics and is currently dating golfer Tiger Woods, placed second to Switzerland's Lara Gut, 23, in the Super-G competition. This weekend's competition marked the 30-year-old's return to skiing after a knee injury which caused her to sit out the Sochi Olympics. 'What Lindsey did was truly phenomenal. I know what it's like to celebrate your first win after a long injury,' said Gut, who identifies with Vonn, having been forced to miss the Vancouver Olympics over a hip operation. 'But I'm also very proud to have beaten her on her favorite terrain,' she added. Second place: Lindsay Vonn's return to skiing competition was slightly disappointed Sunday, when she placed second in the Super-G at the Lake Louise World Cup . Top three: Switzerland's Lara Gut (center) beat-out the American Olympian (left), and Tiger Woods' girlfriend, on Sunday. The two pictured above with third-place skier Tina Maze of Slovenia (right) Winner: 'What Lindsey did was truly phenomenal. I know what it's like to celebrate your first win after a long injury,' said Gut (pictured) While impressive again on a course where she has collected 15 titles, Vonn, the four-times winner of the overall World Cup big globe, could not match Gut's flawless performance, finishing 0.37 seconds behind her. 'I felt like I was skiing aggressively and was pretty clean on the top,' Vonn told reporters. 'But my timing wasn't quite right. I was late on some turns.' However, Vonn had plenty reason to celebrate this weekend, after placing first in the  downhill competition on Saturday. Her weekend was certainly  better than boyfriend Woods, who vomited twice on the golf course at Florida's World Challenge and finished last place on Sunday. He summed up the weekend in a tweet: 'I competed and Linds won'. Tale of two halves: Lindsay Vonn (left)  bagged her 15th career win at the Lake Louise World Cup today. Her boyfriend Tiger Woods (right) was not so spritely, vomiting twice and coming last in his Florida tournament . Under the weather: Woods, 38, vomited during practice and during play at the Hero's World Challenge . Recovering: Woods, like Vonn, recently endured a lengthy spell in rehab for an injury that set him out of play . The pair recently endured lengthy spells in rehab for injuries which sidelined them from their respective sports for months - and Vonn credits Woods with inspiring her to push through the grueling physiotherapy. Vonn has been out of action since tearing her right knee ligament in a high-speed crash in early 2013 which forced her to miss the Sochi Winter Olympic Games. But she reclaimed her champion reputation on Saturday by leading the American team to an historic one-two-three finish at Lake Louise in Canada. 'I risked a lot more and I skied a lot better,' said Vonn. 'I am extremely happy to be on the top of the podium against and also with my two teammates. It couldn't be a better day.' Vonn, who is racing with a brace on her right knee, confessed she was disappointed with her performance in the season-opening slope on Friday, where she finished eighth. Record: Vonn, 30, screamed as she learned she had led the U.S. team to an historic one-two-three finish . Celebrations: Lindsey Vonn, center, celebrates after winning the second women's downhill race with second place Stacey Cook, left, and third place Julia Mancuso, right, during the World Cup at Lake Louise, Canada . She said: 'I made the adjustment today. I tried to sit lower in my tuck and to be more aggressive in some turns. It paid off. I was just faster all the way down. 'Every day has gotten better here. I'm pushing the limits and I want more speed. I haven't had that yet until today.' Her ecstatic demeanor was a far cry from her 38-year-old boyfriend's appearance on the third day of play in Windermere, Florida. Woods has not played since August while he recovered from a back injury. In last place in the 18-player field, he coughed repeatedly into a towel and vomited along the third fairway, but carried on in his return to competition after an absence of some four months due to back pain. The 14-time major winner closed with three consecutive birdies to the delight of the large gallery following him at the layout that was his longtime home course. Working together: Vonn credits Woods with helping her to recover as they went through rehab together . 'I wasn't doing too good. But I thought I could hang in there,' Woods whispered to reporters after the round, explaining he had lost his voice. 'I wasn't in pain. I just was a little bit under the weather,' said Woods, who played on Friday after running a 102-degree fever. Today marked the 15th career win for Vonn in her event dubbed 'Lake Lindsey'. Vonn won her first race in Lake Louise in December 2004. She said her experience at the course helped her in conditions made difficult by poor light. 'There's been some changing terrain here over the last couple days,' she said. 'Every day is a little bit different. I tried to pay a little more attention to that because obviously you couldn't see it today. The light was really bad, but I know this course really well.'","The American skier, who has spent the last 22 months healing from a knee injury, came in second Sunday at the Lake Louise World Cup .

"It was once considered bulky and too primitive to compete with slim touch screen music players and smartphones that could play videos at the same time. But just three months after Apple discontinued the iPod classic in favour of more advanced models, demand for the music player with the traditional click wheel has risen, causing prices to soar. The latest versions of the classic with the maximum storage of 160GB - more than any other portable music player - are currently selling on eBay for more than £550 as music fans clamour to get hold of the latest models before they are all disappear. Scroll down for video . Prices of the iPod Classic have soared to more than £500 on eBay for some models in recent months as they become the 'must have' present for Christmas, after Apple discontinued them in October this year . Apple discontinued the iPod classic in October following a slow but steady drop in sales as people began to favour the iPod touch and using their phones and cloud devices to store music. But the large capacity of the Classic, which allows people to store thousands of songs without having to sign up to a website and pay a subscription fee, has made it the must-have present this Christmas. Music experts began advising experts to get hold of an iPod Classic as early as last year, before they were discontinued and demand, and prices began to increase. And its value is likely to continue to rise after Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said it was unlikely the model would be revisited because they lacked access to the components and a redesign would be too expensive, the Observer reported. Early last year Will Dunn, editor of Stuff magazine, advised people to buy a version of the Classic, predicting prices would double. He said: 'There's still a huge affection for the iPod Classic and it's not hard to see why - Spotify might offer 20 million songs, but 120GB of music is more than most people need, and your iTunes library doesn't carry data charges or a subscription fee.' Customers are paying £550 for 6th generation iPods and around £350 for 7th generation, with 160GB storage . eBay has been selling versions of the iPod Classic 6th generation, with 160 GB storage for between £350 and £550. The latest, 7th generation version, is currently listed on the site with a £350 price tag. The iPod Classic was first launched in 2002, with storage increasing to 160GB with the sixth and generations produced from 2007. It began to be replaced by slimmer more advanced models, such as the nano, first launched in 2005 and the iPod touch in 2007 as the popularity of the touch screen began. The iPod Touch is now the only model being produced with the most capacity, but at 80GB this is still only half of the Classic version. 2001 - The first iPod, capable of holding 1,000 songs was created and later became known as the first generation iPod Classic. 2002 - The second generation was unveiled and made available for Windows, rather than just Apple, users for the first time. The iPod shuffle was launched in 2005, giving people the chance to store songs on a much smaller device . 2003 - The iTunes music store was released along with a slimmer third generation iPod, capable of selling 7,500 songs. In its first week iTunes sold 1million songs. 2003 - The millionth iPod is sold. 2004 - iPod mini is launched and iTunes is made available in the UK. Sales of iPods tops 10 million as the iPod Classic fourth generation goes on sale. The iPod nano replaced the iPod mini in 2005 . 2005 - Apple launched the smaller iPod shuffle and the iPod nano replaced the iPod mini.

"Parents who were saved from a sinking sailboat in Texas along with their seven children have been revealed as federal fugitives wanted in connection with $1million wire fraud. Donald Brian Winberg, 43, Karlien Richel Winberg, 33 and the youngsters aged from one to 12 were rescued from Galveston Bay after their yacht flipped over in October. They were brought safely to shore, lucky to be alive, but gave rescuers fake names and used aliases while they were being treated in hospital. Their one-year-old child and the mother were admitted overnight and released the next morning. The FBI noticed them on local Houston TV reports, including dramatic footage of a baby being carried out of the water, and identified them as two suspects wanted for stealing millions from customers who believed they were investing in hay fields. On the run: Donald Brian Winberg, 43, Karlien Richel Winberg, 33 and their seven children aged from one to 12 were rescued from Galveston Bay, Texas, after their yacht flipped over in October . A trial date had been set for January but it was cancelled when the pair left the area. Officials now believe they have left the country and could have travelled to Mexico. According to the Houston Chronicle, warning signs started to appear when authorities noticed the pair had bought the yacht with $20,000 cash the week before it sank. The vessel was left in the water for a month before it was retrieved to regulations stipulating it must stay in the place it submerged for 20 days to allow the owners to return. They had been staying on the boat at the Watergate Yachting Center, but had been asked to leave due to disturbances. The boat was left in the water for a month after the incident and when detectives searched it, they reportedly found enough supplies for a long trip. The parents had told officers that they were heading off on a long vacation to Mexico. Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset told the paper: 'We're just thinking of the kids and what will happen to them if the parents get arrested.'

San Leon Volunteer Firefighter Chief Scott Lyons was involved in the rescue on the night. He told the station that the baby was blue and 'wasn't breathing'. According to the indictment in Colordao, the couple claimed they were running successful hay-making companies in Texas and Idaho. They would even show potential investors around the fields, but were in fact cheating them out of their money. The Winbergs were last seen in a 2004 Nissan SUV with Texas plates.

"Police descended on a Roma camp today in France to evict its residents in a new crackdown agasint illegal immigrants. Men, women and children were carrying out their belongings as they are were removed from the camp in Lille, northern France. In the past year France has shut down many illegal camps full of Roma gypsies which have sprung up around the country. Eviction: People from the Roma community carry their belongings into a bus as they are expelled from their camp in Lille, northern France . Destroyed: Earth moving equipment is used to destroy the makeshift homes . Removed: A child sits on his belongings as police move in to clear the camp . Determined: Diggers moved in to make sure that the Roma community could not return to their temporary homes . With an estimated population of about 15,000 Roma in France, and the government seems determined to expel as many as it can. In August there were similar raids and hundreds of Roma gypsy families being forcibly sent from France back to their countries of origin in Romania and Bulgaria. Those evicted from camps in France were . herded together under the watchful eye of CRS officers (the French . equivalent of the riot police) wearing military-style blue outfits and . black leather boots, then taken to airports and put on flights to their . home countries. Leaving: The residents were shipped out of the area on coaches . Final: A girl looks out the coach as the site is destroyed. There is an estimated population of about 15,000 Roma in France . The French are so determined to move on the Roma that they offer them financial incentives. In addition to covering the cost of the trip home, the French government pays 300 euros (£235) to every expelled Roma adult and 100 euros (£80) for every child. Reports of Romanian gangs perpetrating organised crime, such as cashpoint fraud, are common in France — as in the rest of Europe — and this only serves to whip-up anti-Roma sentiment. In total, nearly 1,000 Roma have been deported following at least six raids last summer. The exact figures are hard to establish because the French authorities are not allowed to define those they have ejected as ‘Roma’, because this would suggest that their actions are potentially racist and therefore illegal under EU law. Battle: France has shut down illegal camps full of Roma gypsies which have sprung up around the country . Reports of Romanian gangs perpetrating organised crime, such as cashpoint fraud, are common in France — as in the rest of Europe — and this only serves to whip-up anti-Roma sentiment . Herded: People from the Roma community are expelled under the watchful eye of the authorities . Packed up: Roma residents put their belongings in the back of the coach before being driven away . Only the vulnerable — pregnant women, the frail and the elderly — are given housing by the French social services. However, healthy young men have been seen fleeing into nearby woods, or through the streets to avoid being rounded . Marine David, mayor in Saint-Priest, admits the French authorities are playing a game of ‘ping-pong’ with the gypsies. ‘We are going round and round in circles,’ she says. ‘We can’t offer them a permanent housing solution, and I know there’s a risk they will just set up another camp. We just don’t have the means to deal with this kind of situation.’ This game of human ‘ping-pong’ began under the previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who ordered the ejection of around 9,000 gypsies, only for many of them to return. He introduced the deportation crackdown in 2010 after linking the Roma community to begging, prostitution and petty street crime. Despite promising tolerance and humanitarian assistance if elected, Sarkozy’s successor, Socialist President Francois Hollande also approved the eviction programme after he and interior minister Manuel Valls said the camps were adversely affecting the lives of the French working class living near to them. Local councils’ court orders to destroy camps are all approved by the national government.","Roma community were seen carrying out their belongings during eviction .

If Alan Irvine thought he may be able to gain his first win as West Bromwich Albion head coach by exposing weaknesses in the team he knows so well, he was left with the realisation that deficiencies at his current club require urgent attention. Everton left The Hawthorns with three points, collected in relative comfort from the moment — one minute and 40 seconds in — that Romelu Lukaku scored his first goal since signing permanently for Roberto Martinez.

Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, having spent a loan spell at West Brom, chooses not to celebrate too much after firing Everton ahead with a fine strike . West Brom keeper Ben Foster couldn't do anything about Romelu Lukaku's magnificent strike after just two minutes but should have saved Everton's second goal . Everton won for the first time in the Premier League this season as Kevin Mirallas celebrates scoring their second to secure the three points in an easy away win . It meant a first win and first clean sheet in the Premier League this season for Martinez, who now sets his sights on Wolfsburg in the Europa League on Thursday. Irvine still awaits victory and his focus remains on top-flight survival. Albion have seen 13 players leave the club this summer, with 11 new faces arriving and the difficulty in knitting such a changed squad together is clear to Irvine. Many missed pre-season but the lack of fluency or creativity in their play on Saturday alarmed supporters still scarred by last season’s turmoil to such an extent a vocal minority booed at the final whistle. Everton boss Roberto Martinez and West Bromich Albion manager Alan Irvine greet each other before kick-off at the Hawthorns on Saturday . England international Josh Stones tries to gain possession from West Brom striker Saido Berahino during Everton's first league win of the season . West Brom midfielder James Morrison fends off a challenge from Everton striker Steven Naismith but couldn't help his side to a possible first win this season . Everton's Gareth Barry battles with West Bromwich Albion's Andre Wisdom and Craig Dawson during the easy 2-0 win for the Merseyside club . England Under-21 international Saido Berahino keeps his eye on the ball as Everton captain Phil Jagielka attempts to keep up with the lively forward . West Brom: Foster 6, Wisdom 6, Dawson 6, Olsson 4, Pocognoli 5.5 (Gamboa 77, 5), Dorrans 6, Morrison 6, Gardner 6, Brunt 6 (Blanco 70, 5.5), Ideye 5 (Samaras 70, 5.5), Berahino 6. Subs not used: Baird, Yacob, Gamboa, Daniels, McAuley. Bookings: Gardner, Wisdom. Everton: Howard 6.5, Coleman 7, Stones 7.5, Jagielka 7, Baines 7.5, Barry 7, McCarthy 7, McGeady 7 (Besic 88), Naismith 6.5, Mirallas 7, Lukaku 8 (Osman 68, 6.5). Subs not used: Robles, Gibson, Atsu, Garbutt, Alcaraz. Goals: Lukaku 2, Mirallas 66. Bookings: McCarthy, Naismith, Besic. Referee: Anthony Taylor . ‘I understand it,’ said Irvine. ‘We’re all frustrated, we all wanted a really good result. You talk about two international players and they don’t normally make those mistakes. They are devastated and will be hurting for next few days. ‘It’s important we get good results while building a team. They are working extremely hard to try to get that.’ Irvine was facing the club he had called home for eight years over two spells. By his own admission he could have had a job for life but chose to leave the comfort behind to step back into the harsh world of football management. After 100 seconds he felt that brutal edge. Leighton Baines’ low cross looked harmless until Olsson cleared straight to Lukaku. The Belgian striker, on the edge of the area, took one touch then bent a devastating shot into the far corner beyond Foster’s despairing dive. The Swedish defender’s slip against Swansea in West Brom’s last game granted Nathan Dyer an opener inside 90 seconds and Irvine can be forgiven for wondering whether his pre-game plans will always have to be torn up so soon after kick-off. Lukaku, who scored 17 goals during a loan spell at The Hawthorns in 2012-13, almost apologised to the home faithful after the ball hit the net. Interestingly, his strike was his first Premier League goal for a club that owns him. His previous 32, for West Brom and Everton, had all been on loan. Martinez called his £28million fee ‘money well spent’. ‘As a player he is everything expected in a striker,’ he added. Six minutes after the interval it should have been 2-0. Lukaku unleashed a fearsome shot with his left foot that Foster saved well with a strong wrist. The ball fell straight to Steven Naismith but he ballooned the ball over rather than into the open goal. Left-back Leighton Baines, back from englad duty, evades a tackle from James Morrison and was as lethal as ever for Everton with his distribution play . West Brom's club record signing Brown Ideye tries to get past Everton cetre-back Josh Stones but couldn't find the back of the net at the Hawthorns . Right-back Seamus Coleman and goalkeeper Tim Howard manage to regain possession for Everton under pressure from West Brom striker Saido Berahino . West Bromwich Albion's Cristian Gamboa battles for the ball with Everton's Kevin Mirallas as the Belgian forward went on another marauding run . The visitors established a two-goal cushion in the 66th minute. It was another shocker defensively. Baines passed inside to Mirallas, who had time to turn and shoot for goal under little pressure from Olsson. The Belgian’s effort did not look the deadliest until Foster allowed the ball to slip under his body. Irvine flung a water bottle to the turf in fury. He must work hard to ensure it is not one of those seasons. West Bromich Albion's striker Georgios Samaras came off the bench to make his debut for the club but failed to find a way past Everton's impressive Tim Howard . Tim Howard collects the ball under pressure from approaching West Brom players as the American held on to secure a clean sheet at the Hawthorns .

During a report this morning about a woman who sleepwalked off a subway platform, MSNBC accidentally put up the caption, 'Kimye Engaged'. Punters questioned whether the premature headline was really an accident, while media outlets described the gaffe as 'one of the more disturbing cable news images in recent history' and a 'chyron fail'. Scroll down for video . Awkward: MSNBC announced the engagement of Kayne West and Kim Kardashian but showed footage of a woman who fell off a train platform . Unaware: The woman reportedly said she was sleepwalking when she fell onto the tracks of a Boston subway . Ouch! The footage showed the woman teetering on the edge of the platform before face planting onto the tracks . Kimye Engaged! Social media users are questioning whether MSNBC deliberately overlaid the playful caption about the celebrity engagement on footage of a dangerous fall . The News Now reported the 31-year-old woman was sleeping on a bench on a platform at Red Line T at Davis Square Station in Boston when she started sleepwalking. The woman fell face first onto the train tracks, narrowly missing the third electric rail which was live. Passersby helped the woman before a train arrived. A Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) spokesman said she was never in danger of being hit because a train wasn't nearby. The woman was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital where she was treated for an injury to her lower left arm.

"My name is Wendy. I am 56 years old. And I cannot swim. Worse, I am petrified of water. There. I’ve said it. That’s why I felt a twinge of sadness earlier this month when I read that nearly half of British children will leave school unable to swim. I can only hope their lives won’t be blighted as mine has been. There is a reason for this fear. When I was five, at a summer camp in Bournemouth, my parents went for a walk, while I played on the beach with children from the camp. Wendy read about Jan Jordan, of Aqua Vie, who has a revolutionary way of teaching swimming . Scroll down for video . I decided to paddle out into the sea, but my father, spotting his small child from afar, raced across the sand, yanking me violently from the water. I screamed in shock. At that moment, my lifelong fear of water was born. No matter how hard I tried, or how much money was invested in swimming lessons, I never got over it. Years later, I learned why my father behaved as he did. When he and my mother lost my older brother in a cot death, my father had to go to the morgue — and there saw the tiny body of a child who had drowned. He was so traumatised by the sight, compounding his grief for my brother, that he was forever after petrified that I would drown. As an older child, I spent most summers learning to swim — and failing spectacularly. My stepfather would patiently stand over me as I struggled. I was given every opportunity: he taught me on holiday in the shallow water of the beautiful island of Rab, Croatia, and paid for lessons in a luxury hotel spa. I couldn’t even conquer my fear when a hunky South American took great pains to teach me in a Miami swimming pool in the complex where I was then living. Beach holidays were ruined. Even walking alongside a canal brought a twinge of fear, in case I slipped and couldn’t stay afloat. I simply gave up. By the time I hit 50, I had long since resigned myself to being unable to swim and spent holidays reading by the pool, done up in a bikini, but dry as a bone. Sobering statistics, such as there being 400 drowning deaths a year, made me unwilling to even dangle my feet in the water. But every so often, I’d get a nagging feeling. Was my failure to learn a sign of weakness? I’d always been proud of my ability to conquer adversity. This had defeated me. Then I read about Jan Jordan, of Aqua Vie, who has a revolutionary way of teaching swimming: the Shaw Method. Named after Steven Shaw, the former competitive swimmer who devised it 25 years ago, it uses the principles of body awareness and natural balance to radically change a pupil’s relationship with water. While most swimming lessons are adapted for children or adults, this method is purely for grown-ups, so it’s especially good for those with a long-held fear. It’s based on the Alexander Technique, a way of correcting posture, which is usually taught on land and is particularly popular with City workers suffering from the stresses of bad posture. Celebrity aficionados of the Alexander Technique include John Cleese and Sarah Ferguson. But in water, I’m told, it works just as well, transforming the body’s reaction to water — and the mind’s, too. Could this finally be my answer? LESSON ONE . I meet Jan in a heated, shallow pool in the Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel, London. Although I’m assured I will never be out of my depth, I am terrified. I start by kicking off from the pool wall (one of the few things I’ve managed to learn over the years), but Jan immediately stops me. Apparently, that’s a bad habit. Instead, she shows me how to start with both feet on the ground, so I don’t wobble or feel out of control. She is perfectly nice about it, but I feel like a schoolgirl being ticked off. And then — disaster! — I make the most basic of errors by taking a deep breath before putting my face in the water. ‘That’s a common mistake by beginners,’ says Jan. ‘All that breath makes you too buoyant, as you have too much air in your mouth.’ I’m aware of how pathetic I seem, but am determined to persevere. When I’m running out of breath, Jan tells me to drop my nose down, put my feet on the bottom of the pool and stick my head out of the water. I follow her advice and glide a foot or two — which, to my surprise, I find easy. I haven’t panicked at all and leave thrilled. LESSON TWO . Today, we do everything again, but this time, as I am doing my underwater glide it suddenly dawns on me that I’m doing it, and I stop out of terror, swallow a mouthful of water, and come up spluttering. My nerves have got the better of me. I feel sick with frustration. But Jan remains upbeat. ‘You’re getting calmer in the water and I think you are making progress,’ she says. LESSON THREE . This time, Jan tells me to try to glide on one side, then the other. I hate every second of it. I feel as if I am sinking and drowning. Now I really have hit a wall. Jan asks whether I’ve ever had any kind of health issue to do with balance. I remember a terrible bout of labyrinthitis, an acute inner-ear infection, when I was 19. ‘That explains everything,’ she says. ‘You have the memory of a traumatic event and, when you turn sideways, that triggers it and terrifies you.’ She concludes it will take a huge amount of time for me to overcome this and master the side crawl. Instead, we decide I should try to learn the ‘Old-Fashioned Back Crawl’. I’m to start in ‘the armchair position’: knees bent, arms resting on the surface in front of me. ‘Then, when you lean back to do the backstroke, you will go into a pendulum swing, which means you move down into the water, and your hips go back,’ says Jan. It sounds frightening, but I do it. Within seconds, I find myself on my back, staring at the ceiling — a triumph! Then, just as I’m starting to believe I’ve got it nailed, I feel myself toppling to one side. Jan tells me that if I move my eyes around, I’ll automatically become unstable, so my gaze must be fixed to one point. I follow her advice and, with her hand supporting me lightly, float the length of the pool. LESSON FOUR . We go to a different pool, with a temperature of 31 degrees, which means my muscles will relax. Jan spends the lesson giving me Water Shiatsu — a subtle form of massage manipulation excellent for loosening the spine and replacing bad memories of water with good. She holds my head in the crook of her arm, supports my shoulders and legs while afloat and slowly turns my body. I’m not sure how this is helping me swim, but it’s so relaxing, I almost fall asleep! LESSON FIVE . We discover a problem. As I’m a writer, and spend hours at the computer, the muscles in my arm are shorter than most. As a result, I have difficulty stretching my arms out fully in the water — no good for performing actual strokes. Jan’s solution is to imagine I’m holding on to a bar in front of me. Amazingly, this simple visualisation changes everything. ‘It really is all about your thoughts,’ she says. Rather than flail and panic, I’m using my brain to understand my movements. It’s a revelation. I build on it. By the end of my seventh lesson, I manage to swim four lengths, unaided, on my back. I’ve never felt more proud. At last, in my fifth decade, I can swim. I may not be winning medals, but I know next time I’m on holiday, I won’t be sitting at the side of the pool, but slipping into the water. And, who knows, maybe I’ll even swim a few lengths.","Wendy Leigh, 56, is petrified of water .

"Sam Allardyce was mournful in tone after watching Andy Carroll hit the heights for the Hammers. The West Ham boss said: ‘The technical ability of heading is lost in the game somewhat today. People don’t talk about the technical ability of meeting a ball at the right time to get it in the back of the net.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see Sam Allardyce speak about Andy Carroll's heading ability . Andy Carroll rises to plant a superb header beyond Lukas Fabianski to level the scores at Upton Park . Hammers' boss Allardyce congratulates the Geordie striker and praised his technique in the air . His side have scored 12 headers this season — six more than Everton, who have the next highest tally. Sakho back in the picture . Diafra Sakho was superb after coming off the bench to complete his return from a mysterious back injury suffered on international duty with Senegal. After scoring West Ham’s third — his eighth in all competitions this season — he lifted his shirt to reveal a tribute reading: ‘RIP Happy!’ It relates to his niece Amy, who died last week. Diafra Sakho showed a shirt commemorating his niece Amy, who died last week, after he scored for West Ham . It says plenty about West Ham’s wonderful season that Swansea striker Wilfried Bony’s opening goal after 19 minutes yesterday was the first time the Hammers have trailed in a fixture at Upton Park since losing 3-1 against Southampton on August 30. Graziano Pelle scores for Southampton at Upton Park in August, the last time West Ham trailed at home . In that five-game run before facing the Welsh outfit they hosted Liverpool, Queens Park Rangers, Manchester City, Aston Villa and Newcastle. Many Hammers make light work . They certainly share the wealth at West Ham — they can boast 12 different scorers in the Premier League this season. That’s a marked difference to yesterday’s opponents Swansea, who have only had seven, led by Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony. Wilfried Bony, who scored against West Ham on Sunday, has been crucial for Swansea this season .
