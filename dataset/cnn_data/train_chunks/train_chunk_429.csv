"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order Monday repealing a Bush-era policy that limited federal tax dollars for embryonic stem cell research. President Obama signs the executive order on stem cell policy Monday at the White House. Obama's move overturns an order signed by President Bush in 2001 that barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time. Obama also signed a presidential memorandum establishing greater independence for federal science policies and programs. ""In recent years, when it comes to stem cell research, rather than furthering discovery, our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values,"" Obama said at the White House. ""In this case, I believe the two are not inconsistent. As a person of faith, I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research -- and the humanity and conscience to do so responsibly.""  Watch as Obama announces he's lifting the funding ban » . The president pledged to develop ""strict guidelines"" to ensure that such research ""never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction."" Such a possibility, he maintained, is ""dangerous, profoundly wrong and has no place in our society or any society."" Obama's order directs the NIH to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days, according to Dr. Harold Varmus, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and co-chairman of Obama's science advisory council. ""The president is, in effect, allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it's permitted by law -- that is, work with stem cells themselves, not the derivation of stem cells,"" Varmus said in a conference call with reporters Sunday. While conceding that ""the full promise of stem cell research remains unknown"" and ""should not be overstated,"" Obama nevertheless expressed hope that the order will help spur faster progress in the search for cures to afflictions such as Parkinson's disease, cancer and spinal cord injuries.  See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research » . Researchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body. Stem cells have this ability for a short time. A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus, it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus.  Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important » . When the embryo is 4 or 5 days old, scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish. With the removal of these stem cells -- of which there may be about 30 -- the embryo is destroyed. Twenty-one of the 60 stem cell lines authorized for research under the Bush policy have proven useful to researchers. Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research. At the time, Bush maintained that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos. Conservative leaders echoed Bush's rationale in their criticism of Obama's decision. ""Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C., and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Sunday. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said the Bush policy imposed proper ethical limits on science. ""My basic tenet here is I don't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth,"" Shelby said Sunday. ""I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it."" The issue of whether to lift the ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research has, however, exposed a clear rift between the more moderate and conservative factions of the GOP. In February, a group of six moderate GOP congressmen sent a letter to Obama urging him to lift the funding ban. Former first lady Nancy Reagan also issued a statement Monday thanking Obama for lifting the ban. ""These new rules will now make it possible for scientists to move forward,"" Reagan said. ""Countless people, suffering from many different diseases, stand to benefit from the answers stem cell research can provide. We owe it to ourselves and to our children to do everything in our power to find cures for these diseases."" President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after leaving office -- an affliction that many scientists say eventually may be cured with the help of embryonic stem cell research. Obama's presidential memorandum, however, may turn out to have a broader impact than his executive order. The memorandum is expected to create a clear change of tone from the Bush administration on a broad range of scientific issues. Bush's critics argued the former president allowed political factors improperly to influence funding decisions for science initiatives as well as to skew official government findings on issues such as global warming.  Watch a GOP congressman say Obama is 'behind the times' » . Obama's memorandum directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy ""to develop a strategy for restoring scientific integrity to government decision-making."" In a thinly veiled criticism of his predecessor, Obama reiterated a promise to base ""public policies on the soundest science"" as well as to ""appoint scientific advisers based on their credentials and experience, not their politics or ideology.""","NEW: Former first lady Nancy Reagan thanks President Obama for lifting funding ban .

"(CNN)One would expect that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the best interests of the public in mind, but its recent decisions have cast serious doubt upon this assumption. One in particular could have a dramatic impact on the safety of the U.S. food supply: It is the mandate of the EPA to regulate the use of agricultural chemicals like insecticides and herbicides, as well as to determine their allowable limits in food and drinking water. Herbicides (weed killers) are mixtures of chemicals designed to spray on weeds, where they get inside the plants and inhibit enzymes required for the plant to live. The active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide is glyphosate, while some herbicides contain 2,4D.  2,4D is best known as a component of Agent Orange, a defoliant widely employed during the Vietnam War. Until the introduction of GM crops about 20 years ago, herbicides were sprayed on fields before planting, and then only sparingly used around crops. The food that we ate from the plants was free of these chemicals. In stark contrast, with herbicide resistant GM plants, the herbicides and a mixture of other chemicals (surfactants) required to get the active ingredient into the plant are sprayed directly on the crops and are then taken up into the plant. The surrounding weeds are killed while the GM plant is engineered to resist the herbicide. Therefore, the food crop itself contains the herbicide as well as a mixture of surfactants. To accommodate the fact that weeds are becoming glyphosate resistant, thereby requiring more herbicide use, the EPA has steadily increased its allowable concentration limit in food, and has essentially ignored our exposure to the other chemicals that are in its commercial formulation. As a result, the amount of glyphosate-based herbicide introduced into our foods has increased enormously since the introduction of GM crops.  Multiple studies have shown that glyphosate-based herbicides are toxic and likely public health hazards. Of equal importance in terms of health is the fact that herbicides are now being used to rapidly kill non-GM grain crops at the end of their growing season in order to speed up harvesting.  So, a product can be labeled GM-free but still contain high levels of herbicide. The fact that agricultural chemicals are now inside the food crops that we eat is a fundamental shift in both our food production system and human exposure to toxic chemicals.  Unfortunately, it is about to get even worse. Since 2,4D has been used for over 50 years, its toxicity to farm workers and neighboring populations is well documented. EPA sponsored studies have shown that those repeatedly exposed to 2,4D have an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, cancer and birth defects.   Its nonagricultural use is banned in some European countries. Despite this information, and warnings from many knowledgeable organizations, scientists and doctors, the EPA has recently concluded that the commercialization of corn and soy genetically modified to be resistant to both 2,4D and glyphosate will have no adverse effects on human health and has allowed the introduction of these crops in many states.  The summary statements used to justify this decision are on the EPA website, but the scientific data and discussion to support it are not available to the public. Some predict that because of these GM crops and the inevitable increase in weed herbicide resistance, the amount of 2,4D entering our environment could soon increase up to 30 fold over the 2010 levels. As a medical research scientist, I consider this EPA allowance a grave error and believe that it will ultimately lead to a public health disaster.  This conclusion is based upon the following considerations: . 1) 2,4D, glyphosate, and surfactants are inside the plant and cannot be washed off.  Recently shipments of soybeans to Asia have contained 50-fold the amount of glyphosate allowed in Europe, and high levels are in U.S. GM soybeans while none is detected in conventional and organic beans. 2) 2,4D is toxic, and safety testing of glyphosate formulations has shown that they are endocrine disrupters and cause liver and kidney damage.  Moreover, it appears that the specific formulation of 2,4D and glyphosate that will be applied to the new GM crops has not been tested for health safety. Because soy- and corn-based foods will contain these chemicals, they should be considered food additives and fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA, which would require extensive safety testing.  Currently none are required. 3) Glyphosate and 2,4D accumulate in the environment, and the amounts will increase in our food and drinking water as their combined use becomes widespread and weeds become more resistant.  Glyphosate is already found in the blood and urine of people, and in a soy rich nutrient mix given to infants. 4) While the producers of the new, doubly herbicide resistant crops and the U.S. regulatory agencies have some control over the production and use of herbicides in this country, they cannot control those made or used abroad.  The relatively uncontrolled use of glyphoshate-based herbicides in South and Central America has lead to significant increases in birth defects, kidney toxicity, and cancer.  It will be much worse if 2,4D is thrown into the mix. What does this all mean? Consumers should consider purchasing certified organic soy and corn products until the EPA withdraws its allowance of food crops that contain herbicides, and every effort should be made to prevent the introduction of additional herbicide resistant crops.  These food additives are not good for you or your children.","EPA has steadily increased the allowable concentration limit of herbicides in food  supply .

"Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday. Fighter jets struck the vehicles because they were carrying SA-17 missile parts, a Russian-made, medium-range delivery system, and other equipment that could have been used to attack Israel, another source told CNN. Lebanon's state-run NNA news agency dismissed the report. ""The news circulated by media about an Israeli raid on the Lebanese-Syrian borders are sheer rumors,"" it said. Syria, meanwhile, reported an Israeli strike targeting a research facility near the capital city of Damascus. State-run media said the attack killed two workers and injured five others. ""Israeli warplanes penetrated our airspace at dawn today and directly bombed one of the scientific research centers responsible for raising the level of resistance and self-defense in the area of Jimraya in the Damascus countryside,"" the military said in a statement aired on state-run TV Wednesday. ""This comes after multiple failed attempts over months by terrorist groups to enter and seize the mentioned site."" It was not certain whether the U.S. and Syrian accounts of Israeli attack referred to the same or different incidents. Israeli military and government officials declined to comment. World leaders seek $1.5 billion in aid for Syrians . A former high-ranking Israeli Intelligence official told CNN that Hezbollah likely wants to take hold of all the weapons it can in the event that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is forced to flee. Should al-Assad ultimately decide to leave, he may choose to further arm Hezbollah ahead of time so that militants could better attack Israel, the official said. On Thursday, Hezbollah's TV station aired a statement condemning Israel's attack and calling it ""barbaric."" ""But, as usual, the international community has their tongue tied ... and will stay silenced without taking any further steps to condemn the attack or taking any serious position when Israel is the aggressor,"" the statement said. In recent years, Syria transferred Scud missiles to Hezbollah that are capable of carrying chemical weapon warheads. But the senior U.S. official said American authorities do not believe the strike was linked to growing concerns about chemical weapons. ""We see no nexus,"" the official said Wednesday. The strike is thought to have hit a ""target of opportunity,"" he said. ""Whether it was an attack against a supply convoy or a terrorist leader, it's not particularly surprising,"" senior Brookings fellow Michael O'Hanlon said. ""At first glance, it likely won't be seen as a large escalation -- though there's still a possibility for retaliation."" Envoy calls for Security Council to act . The move came days after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said al-Assad's hold on power was ""slipping away."" Russia, a power broker in the nearly 2-year-old conflict, has criticized Western powers, including the United States, that have recognized the opposition as Syria's rightful leadership. There have been concerns about the security of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, as well as the security of its larger conventional weapons. Last month, NATO said Syria's government was ""approaching collapse"" and urged al-Assad to stop fighting and accommodate a political transfer of power. The United States has provided more than $200 million in humanitarian aid and other funding to the Syrian opposition. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama approved another $155 million in aid. The United States has pressed the Syrian opposition to establish a leadership structure amid a conflict that has claimed the lives of about 60,000 people, according to a United Nations estimate. But Washington has been circumspect about its involvement in Syria. ""We want to make sure that not only does it enhance U.S. security, but also that it is doing right by the people of Syria and neighbors like Israel that are going to be profoundly affected by it,"" Obama told CBS News' ""60 Minutes.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans kept the pressure on the president's Supreme Court pick Friday, pushing the idea that Judge Sonia Sotomayor is an activist judge who will bring a leftist agenda to the bench. Judge Sonia Sotomayor in the White House with Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama. Meanwhile, the White House tried to soften remarks Sotomayor made in 2001 that have rankled conservatives, who say her assertion that her experiences as a Latina woman might make her judgments more sound than those of a white man brands her as a racist. ""I'm sure she would have restated it, but if you look at the entire sweep of the essay she wrote, what's clear is that she was simply saying that her life experiences will give her information about the struggles and hardships that people are going through that will make her a good judge,"" President Obama said in an interview with NBC's Brian Williams. Sotomayor, a U.S. District Court judge who would be the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court if she is confirmed, spoke on her reflections as a Latina judge during a 2001 speech at the University of California-Berkeley Law School. Different perspectives brought on by individual experiences, she said, create a ""diversity of opinion"" even within groups, and those perspectives will especially differ from the majority in a white male-dominated society. Pointing out that studies show ""women and people of color ... report in significantly higher percentages than white men that their gender and race has shaped their careers,"" Sotomayor said that the idea of ""impartiality is an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others."" Thus, she said -- in the remarks that have offended conservatives -- ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" ""Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice [Benjamin] Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society,"" she said. ""Until 1972, no Supreme Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that Sotomayor's ""word choice in 2001 was poor."" ""She was simply making the point that personal experiences are relevant to the process of judge,"" he said, ""that your personal experiences make you have a tendency to make you more aware of certain facts and certain cases, that your experiences impact your understanding. I think we all agree with that and that on a court that is collegial, that it can help others that are trying to wrestle with the facts of those cases."" Gibbs took issue with a former congressman's comparison of the Hispanic civil rights group that sponsored that speech with the Ku Klux Klan. ""It's sort of hard to completely quantify the outrage I think almost anybody would feel at the notion that you are being compared to somebody who used to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan,"" Gibbs said, referring to remarks made by former Republican Rep. Tom Tancredo, who condemned Sotomayor on CNN Thursday for her membership in the National Council of La Raza, an organization he called ""a Latino KKK without the hoods or the nooses."" On CNN Friday, La Raza president Janet Murguia disputed Tancredo's statements about the 40-year-old group. The motto, she said, is not ""All for the race, nothing for the rest,"" the organization is very much ""mainstream,"" the group's name does not translate to ""the race"" as understood in English. Our name has a long history to it, but the bottom line is that words in English and in Spanish, have different meanings,"" she said. ""Race in Spanish, la raza in Spanish, has a broader meaning. It means the people, the community. And it really is meant to be a very inclusive term. It comes from the term 'la raza cosmica,' the cosmic race, which is a very inclusive term."" Sotomayor's remarks drew charges of racism from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, radio talker Rush Limbaugh and others, although Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said such language about the nominee was ""terrible."" And former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, also of Texas, slammed La Raza and another Hispanic civil rights organization, the League of United Latin American Citizens, as ""a bunch of radical leftists that try to make the world believe that they speak for Hispanics,"" but said the debate about Sotomayor's background ""is racist in itself."" ""I am disgusted that we are considering her nomination because she is Hispanic,"" he told CNN. ""She has a world view. She has a judicial temperament. She has a record. And that's what we ought to be looking at. It's racist in itself to have this debate."" DeLay add that ""in my mind"" Sotomayor is not qualified for a seat at the Supreme Court. ""She's an activist,"" he said. ""She's a judicial activist, and I've worked my entire career against judicial activism. And if Obama -- Obama couldn't have appointed a more activist judge, and, therefore, I don't think she's qualified. I don't want somebody writing law from the bench."" Most conservatives oppose what they call ""judicial activism,"" which they define as enacting legislation through rulings, although it generally refers to reaching beyond the U.S. Constitution to bring rulings in line with contemporary values. Many support a ""strict constructionist"" judicial philosophy that requires judges to apply the text of the Constitution as written to the matters at hand, although there are differences of opinion about what the term actually means, even among conservatives. The true opposite of judicial activism, however, is not strict constructionism, but rather judicial restraint, which urges judges to defer to Congress whenever possible.","Republicans kept pressure on Obama's Supreme Court pick, calling her ""activist""

"Following talks with the Pakistani government, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States is making progress in the war on terror, and hopes to end the use of drone strikes ""very soon."" The secretary of state told a Pakistani television station that President Barack Obama has a ""very real timeline"" for ending the strikes. He did not provide specifics on the timeline. ""We hope it's going to be very, very soon,"" Kerry said Thursday, according to a transcript provided by the State Department. ""I believe that we're on a good track.  I think the program will end as we have eliminated most of the threat and continue to eliminate it,"" Kerry said. He added that the cessation depends on ""a number of factors"" and that Washington is working on it with the Pakistani government. A State Department statement  later addressed Kerry's remarks. ""Today, the secretary referenced the changes that we expect to take place in that program over the course of time, but there is no exact timeline to provide,"" the statement said. However, it said, the goal is to get to a place where threats are eliminated and drones are not needed. ""Now, we're all realistic about the fact that there is a threat that remains and that we have to keep up ... the fight in this and other places around the world,"" Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said. ""So this was in no way indicating a change in policy.  It's really been reinforcing things I think we've said for months on this."" The United States ramped up strikes in the tribal region in the first few years of Obama's presidency. But the number of strikes in Pakistan has since dropped partly because of al Qaeda's decline in the country and more U.S. focus on threats from al Qaeda groups in other countries, such as Yemen. In May, Obama defended the use of drone strikes as a necessary evil, but one that must be used with more temperance as the United States' security situation evolves. America prefers to capture, interrogate and prosecute terrorists, but there are times when this isn't possible, Obama said in a speech at the National Defense University in Washington. Terrorists intentionally hide in remote locations and putting boots on the ground is often out of the question, he said. However, he urged caution and discipline. ""To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance,"" Obama said at the time. ""For the same progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it."" Increased oversight is important, but not easy, Obama said. Drone strikes in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan have drawn heated opposition in Pakistan because of civilian casualties. The drone strikes have further roiled relations between the two nations, which flared following a 2011 raid by U.S. commandos on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.","Obama has a ""very real timeline"" for ending the strikes, Kerry says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A century ago, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes described Supreme Court deliberations among his colleagues as ""nine scorpions in a bottle,"" fiercely protective of their own agendas and power bases. Justices on the Supreme Court say they are like a family, and change is sometimes difficult. The ideological tensions these days have not lessened on a court almost evenly divided along conservative and liberal lines, but the mood may have brightened considerably, with the justices likening their relationships to a family. ""You will be surprised by the high level of collegiality here,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal juror, says in a new C-SPAN documentary on the court. ""This term, I think we divided five-to-four in almost one-third of all the cases. One might get a false impression on that degree of disagreement."" But in fact, she and conservative Justice Antonin Scalia are the best of friends, sharing dinners and holiday celebrations together with their families. The justices say their family atmosphere is so embedded in the court's culture that when change occurs, such as the appointment of the newest member Justice Sonia Sotomayor, it can be difficult. ""To some extent, it's unsettling,"" Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. said. ""You quickly get to view the court as ... composed of these members, and it becomes kind of hard to think of it as involving anyone else. I suspect it's like how people look at their families."" He is beginning his fifth term as ""the first among equals"" on that court. ""You're bringing in a family member,"" said Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined the bench in 1991. ""It changes the whole family. It's different. It's different today than it was when I first got here. And I have to admit, you grow very fond of the court that you spent a long time on."" Thomas has lamented that his good friend David Souter is no longer on the court. The two men joined the court within a year of each other, and both were nominated by President George H.W. Bush. Sotomayor replaces Souter, and neither talked to C-SPAN. Sotomayor had not yet been confirmed, and Souter rarely grants interviews. ""This will be a very different court,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""And it's stressful for us because we so admire our colleagues. We wonder, oh, will it ever be the same?"" Until recently, the high court had enjoyed an unusual period of stability. Between Justice Stephen Breyer's nomination in 1994 and Roberts' nomination in 2005, the bench remained unchanged. Breyer said his colleagues' differences on hot-button issues reflect society at large in the current political climate and emphasized the importance of considering all views. ""What I see every day in my job -- which amazed me the first day and continues to amaze me -- is sitting up in the bench I see in front of me people of every race, every religion, every nationality, every point of view imaginable,"" he said. ""And we have 300 million people, probably have 900 million points of view. I mean, people in this country don't agree about a lot of things. And despite enormous disagreement, they've decided to resolve their differences under law."" Several justices acknowledge changing the dynamic on the court can be a good thing. ""It gives us the opportunity, again, to look at ourselves to make sure that we're doing it the right way so that the new justice will be able to take some instruction from our example if we are doing it the right way,"" Kennedy said. ""And I'm sure a new justice can always ask the question, 'Well, what are you doing this for?' Then we have to think about whether or not we should continue to do it.'"" Sometimes change is forced upon the justices, especially in the area of fashion. ""There were very few robes available,"" said retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who joined the court in 1981 as the first female justice. ""I didn't know anybody who made robes for women justices, and I think most of what was available was something like a choir robe or an academic robe often used for academic processions and graduations from universities. ""I was given a note that had been written by someone sitting in the audience one day in the courtroom, and it said, 'Dear Justice O'Connor, I've been in the audience watching the court today, and I noticed that you did not have a judicial collar. Now, all your colleagues were wearing white shirt collars, and they showed under the robe, and you just looked like a washed-out justice to me. What's happening here?' ""And so I took that note to heart. I thought, well, maybe I should try to find some kind of a white judicial collar of some kind that I could wear because I didn't always have a white shirt under the robe, and it was hard to find. Nobody in those days made judicial white collars for women. I discovered that the only places you could get them would be in England or France."" When Ginsburg joined her in 1993, the newest justice improvised. ""This one, the robe is from England, but the collar is from Cape Town, South Africa,"" she told C-SPAN host Brian Lamb in her chambers. ""You know the standard robe is made for a man because it has a place for the shirt to show and the tie. So Sandra Day O'Connor and I thought it would be appropriate if we included as part of our robe something typical of a woman. So I have many, many collars.""","Supreme Court justices liken their relationships to that of a family .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lengthy questionnaire filled out by Judge Sonia Sotomayor was delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday in preparation for Sotomayor's expected U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings this summer. Judge Sonia Sotomayor has delivered her required questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary committee. The questionnaire, required of all federal judicial nominees, covers a range of topics, including a summary of an individual's net worth and legal career. Sotomayor has assets worth almost $1.16 million, including a home valued at almost $1 million, according to her responses, which were posted online by the Judiciary Committee. Her financial liabilities total almost $420,000, including a mortgage totaling slightly less than $382,000, she wrote. Asked to list the 10 most significant cases over which she has presided, Sotomayor cited, among other things, her backing of the players' union in a ruling that ended the 1994-95 Major League Baseball strike. Sotomayor indicated in the questionnaire that she was first contacted by the White House about possibly filling a Supreme Court vacancy on April 27, four days before Justice David Souter publicly announced his intention to step down. ""I was [first] contacted by Gregory Craig, White House counsel ... with respect to the possibility of a future Supreme Court vacancy,"" Sotomayor wrote. Since that time, she noted, she has had ""near daily phone calls"" with the White House counsel's office. Sotomayor said she was interviewed over the phone on May 21 by Craig, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, senior presidential adviser David Axelrod and vice presidential chief of staff Ron Klain, among others. She also met with President Obama in person on May 21, and had a phone interview with Vice President Joe Biden on May 24. Obama announced her nomination two days later. Sotomayor said she was never asked by anyone to give any assurances or opinions on specific issues pending before the court. The questionnaire was delivered as Sotomayor spent her third day on Capitol Hill, meeting with senators who will ultimately decide whether she will become the first Hispanic to sit on the high court. The Supreme Court nominee was again questioned about her ""wise Latina"" comments, made in a 2001 speech that has drawn sharp criticism as racially insensitive. In that speech, Sotomayor said, ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, questioned Sotomayor about her remarks. ""The judge explained to me that she intended it to be an aspirational moment,"" Collins said. ""She assured me that when deciding cases she needs to put aside any personal experiences that might color her decisions and, as she said it, 'the law is the law.' I was pleased to hear that."" When asked whether the issue had been to put to rest, even though Sotomayor made similar comments in another speech in 1994, Collins said she was still uncomfortable that the remarks were made by a sitting judge. ""I can understand her explanation that it was intended to be a statement to inspire young people and that it does not reflect how she approaches cases before her,"" Collins said. ""But that's why I want to read more of her cases to make sure that is the case."" Sotomayer's questionnaire arrived nine days after her nomination -- the fastest completion in recent history, according to the administration. Chief Justice John Roberts' questionnaire was delivered 13 days after his July 2005 nomination, while Justice Samuel Alito's was delivered 30 days after Alito was tapped in November 2005, the White House noted. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said Sotomayor had advanced the confirmation process with her promptness. He said the Senate should return the favor and quickly schedule hearings to consider her nomination.","NEW: Questionnaire returned on same day Sotomayor addresses Latina remark .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Police are investigating the death of the former chief fundraiser for ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich as a ""death-suicide,"" an Illinois mayor said Sunday. Christopher Kelly, 51, was former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's chief fundraiser. Financier Christopher Kelly told police shortly before he died Saturday that he took an ""overdose of drugs,"" said Dwight Welch, mayor of Country Club Hills, Illinois. Country Club Hills police found several drugs in Kelly's black 2007 Cadillac Escalade, but they were not sure yet whether they were prescribed, Welch said. Country Club Hills is about 27 miles south of Chicago. Kelly had recently undergone surgery and was taking drugs following the operation, Welch said. Welch said he did not know which drugs Kelly was taking. Kelly, 51, of Burr Ridge, Illinois, was pronounced dead at Stroger hospital in Cook County at 10:46 a.m. Saturday, hospital spokesman Marcel Bright told CNN. Autopsy results were expected Sunday afternoon, Welch said. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office did not comment on the results, but said that a ruling on Kelly's death was ""pending further studies."" Toxicology results won't be available for ""some time,"" Welch said. Blagojevich blamed the government for Kelly's death. ""I don't know any more than you know, except that a friend of mine took his life because he refused to submit to the pressure by the government to lie about me,"" Blagojevich told CNN. ""And to think that it comes to something like that begs a lot of questions."" Blagojevich said his statement that Kelly ""took his life"" was based on what he had read in news reports. Earlier this year, Blagojevich, who was impeached and removed from office, pleaded not guilty to federal corruption charges. A federal grand jury in April indicted him on 16 felony counts, including racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud and making false statements to investigators. The indictment also named Kelly. On Tuesday in a separate case, Kelly pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud ""in a kickback scheme to bring in $8.5 million in business at O'Hare International Airport to his roofing company,"" the Chicago Tribune reported on its Web site Sunday. Kelly was to begin a prison sentence this week, the Tribune reported. Kelly was transferred to Stroger hospital after first receiving care at Oak Forest Hospital, near Country Club Hills, where police spoke to him at about 3:30 a.m. CT Saturday, Welch said. Police described Kelly as being ""very hesitant, very ill"" during that interview, Welch said. As part of their investigation, police want to talk further with Kelly's girlfriend, Clarissa Flores-Buhelos, Welch said at a news conference Sunday. Kelly and Flores-Buhelos, 30, communicated via text messages before she drove from Chicago to pick him up, Welch said. She found him ill and drove him in his car to Oak Forest Hospital, he said. She told police that Kelly had attempted suicide, Welch said. But since then, Flores-Buhelos has retained a lawyer and is not talking to police, Welch said. Police plan to use the text messages and the GPS device in Kelly's car to determine where the two were prior to arriving at the hospital. Police also want to talk to a man who came to Oak Forest Hospital to pick up Kelly's car, Welch said. He has keys to the vehicle but the car has been confiscated by the police as evidence, Welch said. Chicago police and the FBI are also involved in the investigation, Welch said. CNN's Jesse Solomon and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","NEW: Police want to talk to Kelly's girlfriend, who took him to hospital, mayor says .

"One of the many disturbing aspects of the NSA spying revelations is how much joy they have brought to the world's chronic violators of human rights and political freedoms. On Thursday in Moscow, where former NSA contractor Edward Snowden awaits his asylum papers, a Russian court removed a major critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin from the Kremlin's list of worries, sentencing the charismatic opposition leader Alexei Navalny to five years in jail on theft charges. Amid intense anger at the verdict and fears that it would raise Navalny's profile, the court agreed on Friday to release him pending appeal. The trial and the predictable verdict, as the European Union foreign affairs chief said, ""raises serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia."" That's putting it mildly. Navatny is the most prominent, but just one in a long series of politically-motivated prosecutions in a country where the courts seldom make a move that displeases Putin. Navalny was particularly worrisome to the Russian president. He had gained an enormous following by speaking out against corruption and cronyism, labeling Putin's United Russia ""a party of swindlers and thieves"" and using social media to help mobilize the president's critics. He had just announced he would run for mayor of Moscow. But, like other Putin opponents with any possible chance to loosen the president's complete hold on power, he will likely go to prison instead. Now that he's released, Navalny is considering whether to stay or withdraw from the race for mayor. Meanwhile, Putin and his backers are having a field day. They claim it is Washington that leads the world in violating human rights, even as dozens of people who dared protest against Putin's rule face trial or languish in jail, in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances. When Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the wealthiest man in Russia, decided to turn his attention from business to politics, the tax authorities turned on him. He was sent to prison in Siberia, and when he became eligible for parole, the state filed another case, winning another conviction which extended his sentence. Then there's the case of Sergei Magnitsky. The government auditor was sent to investigate the investment firm Heritage Capital, which was charged with tax evasion. When Magnitsky concluded the tax fraud was actually coming from the government side and became a whistleblower, naming a network of corrupt officials, he was accused of working for Heritage and thrown in jail, where he became ill, was denied medical treatment and died in 2009, when he was just 37. The United States responded with the Magnitsky Law, imposing sanctions on those involved in his death. Death didn't save Magnitsky from Russia's courts, which found him guilty of tax fraud just last week. Many others, including the performance group Pussy Riot, have seen even small scale political activism land them in jail. For Putin, having Snowden in Russia creates many complications, but he has hardly managed to conceal his glee at having America's top critic under his protection. He has made it clear that he wants Snowden to refrain from harming U.S.-Russian relations, and as a former KGB spy himself, the Russian president would risk ridicule if he ventured too far in criticizing NSA actions. Still, Putin derived visible satisfaction from having Snowden land in Russia's lap, armed with material to discredit the United States. Conflicted by the need to preserve a needed relationship with Washington while wanting to maximize the benefit of Snowden's presence, Putin did his best impression of a protector of human rights. Snowden and Wikileaks' Julian Assange, Putin said, consider themselves ""human rights activist ... fighting for the spread information."" ""Ask yourself,"" he said, affecting the pose of a defender of oppressed activists, ""should you hand these people over so they will be put in prison?"" The implied answer was of course not. How could Putin possibly help send a human rights activist to prison?! The Kremlin's media apparatus, in what is undoubtedly an effort to give America a black eye and take away Washington's power to criticize Russia's abuses, launched a campaign to put Snowden on a pedestal with programs that tore apart the United States, while glorifying the former NSA contractor who drew the curtain on U.S. government surveillance. After that carefully crafted media operation, America's voice in the Navalny case lost its edge. After the verdict, the U.S. ambassador wrote a tweet decrying the ""apparent political motivations in this trial."" But Russian democrats and human rights activists have a weaker supporter in America now. Snowden's days in Hong Kong brought a similar reaction from China. That was particularly ironic, considering that no country on Earth has a more elaborate machine to monitor and manipulate what its citizens do online than does China, where the Communist Party also has complete control of the political system. China Daily, the government mouthpiece, gloated ""This is not the first time that U.S. government agencies' wrongdoing have aroused widespread public concern."" This, from a state that, in the words of Human Rights Watch, ""imposes sharp curbs on freedom of expression, association ... openly rejects judicial independence and press freedom; arbitrarily restricts and suppresses human rights defenders..."" Even if you agree with Snowden that the NSA spying is going too far, as I do, it's hard to argue with the negative impact Snowden's revelations have had on human rights activists in other countries. Today, dictators and authoritarian rulers are basking in a viscous moral relativism, feeling their abuses are somehow justified by criticism of America's spying. There are, however, many meaningful differences between America's surveillance excesses and those of Russia, China and their ilk. The most important of all is that Russia and China's behavior is motivated by a desire to suppress internal dissent, to protect the people and the organizations in power. Nobody believes that is Washington's motivation. The United States may have gone too far, or far adrift, in pursuit of national security, but its spying machine is not built to destroy domestic opposition to the government. When people say, ""the Americans are just as bad,"" they are not only clearly wrong, they are also hurting the cause of political and personal freedom around the globe. Snowden's revelations are a legitimate subject for discussion and criticism. But advocates of Internet privacy, free expression and human rights should not allow abusive authoritarian regimes to use American actions as a cover for their egregious misdeeds.","Frida Ghitis: NSA spying revelations have brought joy to world's violators of human rights .

"With one 16-year-old now in custody, authorities in Washington state late Friday hunted for another teen suspected of beating an 88-year-old World War II veteran to death. Delbert Belton was in the parking lot outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane on Wednesday night, waiting for a friend to pick him to go bowling, when the two teens robbed and assaulted him, leading to his death, police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said. Both suspects have been arrested and convicted in the past, including on assault charges, according to the chief. ""We have somebody who served his country during World War II, was injured during his service, was a distinguished veteran,"" Straub said. ""...I don't really care, to be perfectly honest with you, what their motive was. We're not going to tolerate that type of behavior."" Spokane police arrested one suspect Thursday night and charged him with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. The other alleged 16-year-old culprit  was still at large Friday evening. Straub identified him as Kenan Adams-Kinard, naming him even though he's a juvenile because ""he represents ... an actual danger to the community."" ""We're hoping that he surrenders,"" the police chief said. ""But, if not, I can assure the community that he'll be in custody pretty quickly."" 'A wonderful angel' A retired aluminum company worker who served in the Pacific arena, Belton took a bullet in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa, friends say. Decades after that, he was well at home in Washington among his many friends, who affectionately called him ""Shorty"" because of his diminutive height. ""He was awesome,"" Lillian Duncan told The Spokesman-Review newspaper. ""Anybody that didn't get to know him missed out on a wonderful angel in their life."" One who did was Ted Denison, who called himself ""mechanic buddies"" having worked on cars alongside Belton for over 20 years. The two also would go dancing and eat breakfast together. The Eagles Lodge was one of Belton's favorite places, going there two or three times a week and playing pool even though, by his own admission, he wasn't very good at it. According to the 42-year-old Denison, Belton never had problems outside the lodge before -- no threats, no altercations, nothing -- until Wednesday night. ""If he had, I would made sure I was there,"" Denison said. Family says attack 'didn't seem real' Police found Belton prone in the parking lot, with the Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office determining he'd died Thursday of blunt facial and head injuries. His daughter-in-law, Barbara Belton, told CNN's Alina Machado that she couldn't fathom the reason for and viciousness of the attack. ""He didn't drive a big fancy car. He didn't didn't dress in expensive clothes. He didn't have a lot of money,"" she said. ""What did they think they were going to get from this man?"" After the incident, police scoured surveillance videos, wiped a nearby chain link fence for fingerprints and used dogs to hunt for clues. Meanwhile, the veteran's family is trying to make sense of his sudden death. Barbara Belton -- who broke the bad news to the victim's 65-year-old son, William, who is suffering from cancer and happened to be in the hospital -- said that ""it didn't seem real."" She said: ""It's a terrible way to have to die.""","Police chief vows wanted suspect ""will be in custody pretty quickly""

"Thirty miles from Hong Kong's Disneyland park, a small fishing village offers a contrasting view of the city's past. Located in the southwest corner of Lantau, Hong Kong's largest island, Tai O is connected to the outside world via a narrow mountain road.  It has a view contrary to expectations for one of the world's most crowded cities: There are no skyscrapers, no neon signs or real estate companies. The few shops in village close at 5 p.m., when the nightlife on Hong Kong Island has yet to spark. In recent years, tourists have been flocking to Tai O to glimpse this part of Hong Kong's rapidly disappearing past. But when they arrive, they are greeted by a placard at the bus station decrying: ""Mass development will destroy Tai O."" It's a sign of the times: Even as tourists boost the coffers of a local economy once dependent on fishing, villagers are deeply ambivalent about the hordes of visitors encroaching on their seaside hamlet. ""We are going to lose our distinctive way of life and identity if no one protests against the government plan,"" said lifelong Tai O resident Wang Waking, 51, who runs the Tai O culture workshop. ""I am afraid that the commercially-driven plan is going to turn Tai O into another resort."" Villagers like Wang are torn by government plans to add fountains, sculptures and a stage next to the temple to Tin Hau, where generations of fishermen prayed for safety before sailing. The government's US$100 million ""Revitalize Tai O"" project will also replace patches of wetland by boardwalks and a new plaza will rise near the dock. The project is scheduled to be completed later this year, according to the Hong Kong's Civil Engineering and Development Department spokesperson Carol Ho. Original plans called for tearing down all the village's distinctive stilt houses, but was curtailed after protests by villagers. While the redevelopment celebrates Tai O's seafaring heritage -- in 1960, villagers caught 30% of all seafood sold in Hong Kong, according to the book ""Tai O History"" -- it comes in the wake of a 2012 Hong Kong law banning of commercial trawling. That move was applauded by environmentalists but decried by local fishers. ""It wrecks my heart to see fishermen forced to sell their large trawlers,"" said a local fisherman surnamed Wong, who says he catches 70% less after the ban.  Wong, who sells homemade shrimp paste, now must import shrimp from mainland China. Tai O is separated from the rest of Hong Kong by steep, rocky hills. Before 1990, the only way to get to Tai O was by boat. Permits to drive on the town's single road are only granted to villagers and public buses. A sense of isolation still pervades the village's tight-knit community, which many locals say they are keen to keep to themselves. As visitors are drawn to the Venice-like village with homes largely built on stilts, the pathways are dotted with signs warning ""Private Property"" and ""No Entry."" To circumvent the signs, tour guides now row tourists on boat down the river and having a look at the houses from the water. Besides tourism, real estate development could change the fortunes of the town, as Hong Kong has one of the world's most expensive real estate markets. Yet villagers say they are actively working to keep property among themselves. ""I can't tell you how many people are interested in our house,"" said resident Ines Wong. But villagers do all their real estate business by word of mouth to keep outsiders out of the property market, Wong said. ""The fact is that outsiders don't know where to buy property at Tai O. And even if demand for Tai O property is high, local people tend to sell to locals,"" she said. Wong, 24, grew up in Tai O, but like many other young people here, was forced to find work in other parts of the city. She eventually moved to Kowloon, which sits across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island, where she started working for a large bank. While she found it hard to leave her home, she said she had little choice. ""Tai O has no job market at all. I don't see what I can do. Selling salt fish with a degree in marketing?"" While Wong decries the impact of tourism, many of her peers who still live in Tai O welcome the government tourism plan. ""We are one of the oldest communities in Hong Kong. If Tai O has nothing to offer to its young residents, it may become a dead town in a few years,"" said Paul Lieu, 30-year-old local resident. Lieu landed on a job as a tourist guide last year. He makes 30% less than a similar job in other parts of Hong Kong, but he enjoys the commute-free work. Before tourists poured in, the only local job Lieu could find was temporary construction work. Now young people start small business like transforming their stilt homes into guesthouses or waterfront cafés. ""I think Tai O has lost part of its unique character with all the development going on. But that the price we pay to get a better life and to help this community to survive,"" he said. For Wang, the changes are attacking a way of life. ""Tai O people have deep feeling for the mountains, rivers and wetlands surrounding us, because we live so close to nature,"" she said. ""With the boardwalk, children lose a good place to find clams.""","Tourists have been flocking to Tai O to glimpse part of Hong Kong's rapidly disappearing past .

"Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among 81 people killed in a suicide bombing at a Protestant church in northwest Pakistan. It was one of the deadliest attacks ever on the Christian community in Pakistan. The attack took place at the All Saints Church of Pakistan, in the violence-plagued city of Peshawar, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the country's capital, Islamabad. A congregation of about 500 people was attending the church. Two attackers struck right as services concluded. ""Suicide bombers entered the church compound from the main gate and blew themselves up in the midst of the people,"" a statement posted on the diocese website read. The outside of the church was peppered with debris. Crowds of men and rescue officials were covered in blood. The attack left 120 people wounded, with 10 of them in critical condition, Dr. Arshad Javed, chief executive of Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital, said Monday. Militant attack kills 5 police officers . 'Total failure' The Rev Humphrey S. Peters, Bishop of Peshawar, expressed condolences and called for prayers, but he also struck a defiant tone. In a statement, Peters condemned the local government, calling the attack a ""total failure"" of official efforts to protect minorities. His criticism was echoed by hundreds of people who took to the streets in largely Christian areas of Pakistan, calling for better protection of minority groups. The All Saints Church was built in 1883 inside the old walled city of Peshawar. It was built to resemble a mosque from the outside, not for security reasons but to symbolize unity. Christians make up less than 3% of the population in the South Asian nation of 193 million. Militant groups have also targeted other minorities including Shiite Muslims, who are significantly outnumbered by Sunnis in Pakistan. Pakistan released Afghan Taliban's former second-in-command . Attack claimed by Taliban offshoot . A splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the church attack, blaming the U.S. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of Pakistan. ""Until and unless drone strikes are stopped, we will continue to strike wherever we will find an opportunity against non-Muslims,"" said Ahmed Marwat, a spokesman for TTP-Jandullah. The main Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), distanced itself from the attack. ""We refuse to take responsibility for the church blast. This is an attempt to sabotage peace talks between the TTP and the government,"" said spokesman Shahidullah Shahid. Earlier this month, Pakistani officials announced plans to pursue peace talks with Taliban militants and withdraw troops from parts of the volatile northwestern region, which borders Afghanistan. 'No religion' Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Sunday condemned the church attack and in a statement said he was praying for the recovery of those injured. Sharif said terrorists have ""no religion"" and that targeting innocents is against Islam. But Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which Peshawar is the capital, is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. Earlier this month, a roadside bomb in the province killed a top Pakistani general, just a day after the announcement of the plans for peace talks.","The death toll rises to 81, a hospital official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- First lady Michelle Obama vowed Monday to ""take no prisoners"" as she and her husband launch an unprecedented bid for Chicago's 2016 Olympic bid. First lady's attitude about the effort to secure Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics: ""Take no prisoners."" ""It's a battle -- we're going to win -- take no prisoners,"" the first lady said with a smile at a roundtable discussion with reporters in the White House State Dining Room. She compared the intense lobbying effort to the 2008 presidential campaign, noting that in the election campaign, a lot of voters made their decision in the final days. She said members of the International Olympic Committee may do the same. ""And our view is, we're not taking a chance,"" she said. ""We're just not going to assume that the bids -- that the decisions are made, and so that no matter what the outcome is, we'll feel as a country, as a team, that we've done everything that we can to bring it home."" The White House confirmed Monday that President Obama will fly on Thursday to Copenhagen, Denmark, where the International Olympic Committee will be reviewing bids from several countries on Friday. It will be the first time that an American president has lobbied the IOC in this manner. Mrs. Obama arrives in Copenhagen on Wednesday with White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and other top aides. ""What a dynamic duo they will be,"" Jarrett said. ""I think it will be high impact, I think their presentation will be both very personal, given that they know and love Chicago so well."" Mrs. Obama said she and Vice President Joe Biden have been lobbying IOC members by telephone in recent days, and that she plans a packed schedule once she lands in Denmark. ""I think I'm talking to everybody,"" she said of the dozens of IOC members who will decide the victor. She will also make a formal presentation to the IOC, before the president makes his own pitch on Friday. ""We're each going to do our own proposal,"" she said. ""I think we have as good a chance as any country."" She joked, however, that there are limits to how far they will work together.  Watch Ed Henry's full report on the Obamas' Olympics effort » .

"Democrats will probably not force votes on proposals meant to shine an unusually ugly spotlight on Louisiana GOP Sen. David Vitter's alleged past solicitation of prostitutes, a Senate Democratic aide acknowledged to CNN Tuesday. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and other top Democrats have been considering holding the votes in response to Vitter's attempt to force a politically tough vote on whether to strip federal healthcare support from lawmakers and staff. The Senate aide said the Democratic plan was hatched in response to years of mounting frustration with the Louisiana senator. Among other things, Democrats have been loudly floating an alternative amendment to strip federal healthcare contributions from any lawmaker found to have likely solicited prostitutes. They've also considered a vote on an amendment stripping federal healthcare contributions from lawmakers whose actions more generally reflect poorly on Congress, as well as an amendment cutting off healthcare subsidies from any senator who votes for Vitter's proposal. Vitter was famously linked to the so-called ""D.C. Madam"" prostitution scandal in 2007.  The conservative Republican admitted to committing a ""very serious sin,"" and won a second Senate term in 2010. As far as Democrats are concerned, Vitter was the one who first crossed a line by going after congressional staffers. ""For Senator Vitter and his Republican allies to end the contribution for 16,000 hardworking federal employees -- even after years of accepting the subsidy themselves -- is hypocritical and mean-spirited,"" Reid said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. ""If Senator Vitter opposes the employer contribution to congressional staffers, does he oppose it also for the 150 million other Americans whose employers help pay their health insurance premiums?"" Vitter -- a fierce critic of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act -- caused an uproar on Capitol Hill when he first proposed to end federal contributions to healthcare coverage provided to lawmakers and legislative staffers. Vitter's plan would save nearly $1 billion over the next decade, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Under Obamacare regulations crafted by the administration, legislators and staffers will continue to receive federal healthcare contributions while participating in insurance exchanges set up under the law.  But Vitter says Washington politicians and staff shouldn't receive what he views as special subsidies denied to other Americans. Democrats -- quietly joined by a number of congressional Republicans -- insist the federal government's contribution to its employees' health care is no different than the contribution provided by other large employers to millions of Americans in the private sector. ""All that we are asking is that this group of individuals be treated the same as every other American with health insurance through their employment,"" said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat. ""My fear is that this isn't the end of Senator Vitter's crusade against health insurance by employers.  I think this is the first step.  The next step could be to eliminate the employers' contribution for health insurance across the board."" Vitter's plan is ""a step back in time,"" Durbin declared. Vitter lashed back on Twitter, writing, ""So many employees will lose their employer contribution because of #Obamacare. Anyone think @SenatorReid deserves to be exempt?"" Later, Reid told reporters he may allow a vote on Vitter's proposal, which is virtually certain to be defeated. Vitter then took to the Senate floor to praise reports of a possible resolution to the embarrassing showdown. It ""certainly sounds like the discussion at the majority (Democratic) lunch today was, let's just say, more appropriate and more productive than the discussion"" last week, Vitter said. But ""what is good for America is good for Washington,"" he added.  ""The rule for America should certainly be the rule for those who have the particular honor and responsibility to help govern.  And that should be the case across the board."" Last week, Vitter argued that Reid and other Democrats, by shining an uncomfortable spotlight on his past, engaged in unacceptable congressional behavior. On Friday, he requested an ethics investigation into whether Reid, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, and their staff violated Senate rules by publicly proposing legislation which ""ties members' personal healthcare benefits to their performance of specific acts and votes."" ""This is attempted bribery, and the exact sort of behavior that the Senate Ethics Committee has previously condemned,"" Vitter wrote. Democrats dismissed Vitter's accusation, calling it baseless.","Senate Democrats backing off votes meant to embarrass Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana .

"(CNN) -- The set-up is simple. A beautiful woman looks directly at a camera and does short, jokey skits about relationships, pop culture and whatever else is on her mind. The woman is Jessi Smiles, a young Cuban-American from Miami. Smiles was a struggling 20-year-old juggling two jobs when, about a month ago, she started posting videos to Vine, beginning with remakes of popular Vines other people had created. Now she has more than 1.9 million followers on the social-video network, has started and ended a public relationship with an equally ""Vine-famous"" guy, and has quit jobs as a makeup artist and receptionist to pursue her dream of acting full time. Vine is a mobile app from Twitter for sharing videos that are no more than six-seconds long. The videos are created on smartphones and tablets using a single button to start and stop recording, and clips can't be imported, edited, reordered or deleted. Even with those limitations, or possibly because of them, Vine has become a hit since its January debut. The medium has even created a vibrant online subculture and its own cast of cult stars, called ""viners."" They are not household names like Robin Thicke, Bruno Mars or Beyonce (though many real stars do have large Vine audiences). But Vine celebrities like Smiles, KC James and Curtis LePore have millions of followers. Some say they are recognized on the street daily, with fans asking if they can get a picture with them and a signed autograph. Josh Darnit makes cute and funny Vines with his kids and has half a million followers. The most popular comedian on Vine is Josh Peck who has 3 million followers. Peck was already famous from his television show on Nickelodeon, ""Drake and Josh."" KC James is another Vine-grown superstar. He writes and produces mini-comedy bits, usually pulling in friends to act them out with him. The 22-year-old now has 2.5 million followers on Vine, which makes him No. 5 on the list of most popular Vine users. (For reference, One Direction's Harry Styles is No. 18.) Like Smiles, KC said he is recognized in public regularly. How does he explain the explosion of interest in his videos? ""I'm just being myself and being goofy. I like to make my Vines relatable,"" said James. James has also parlayed his Vine celebrity into a career. He said he has a TV show in the works as a direct result of his Vine posts, and is excited to finally have the opportunity to follow his dreams of comedic acting and writing. Vine itself is not profitable, but posters with big followings can make money by plugging brands on their own channels or appearing in Vines for companies. Both James and Smiles are represented by a company called Collab, which has licensing rights to all of their YouTube content. James also has appeared in Virgin Mobile ads on that company's Vine account, which were arranged by GrapeStory, another Vine talent agency. ""My life has completely changed. I've had the most amazing opportunities and such great exposure because of Vine,"" said Smiles. ""None of this would have been possible without it."" Their followers have created fan pages and imitation accounts, and the comments on their videos are typically things like, ""Please follow me!!! I will do anything for you to notice me."" Smiles is still adjusting to the attention. She said she is flattered by the knock-off accounts, though she is unsure why anyone would spend the time to do that. ""My mom still has to remind me that I can't leave my house without makeup and wearing pajamas,"" Smiles said. ""People recognize me everywhere, no matter what state I'm visiting. It's surreal."" When Smiles arranged to meet her then boyfriend, fellow Vine star Curtis Lepore, in real life for the first time in New York City, they invited all their followers. The result was a ""Super Vine,"" when thousands of fans show up in person to meet a Vine star and then film the mass gathering to post on Vine. How do normal, everyday people catch the attention of so many strangers? What is it about this simple app that pushes people into celebrity status? ""It's kind of an escape for a couple of minutes. If people are having a bad day they can go to our Vines and see these people that are saying it's OK to be goofy,"" James said. One reason some of these Viners say they are growing a devout following is their relatable nature. The Vines often tackle real-life scenarios and common pet peeves. The top Viners also tend to have one thing in common: comedy. People connect, and even become a little obsessed, with their down-to-earth, funny personalities. ""When people tell me that I changed their life because they were in a dark place and I helped to make them laugh -- that is the coolest thing,"" Smiles said. Finding fame through an app is a new phenomenon unique to this generation. Though the videos are short, standing out is no easy feat. With over 13 million active users posting on the service, how does someone become a Vine star? James advises, ""Just be original. Spend time writing. A lot of people think it just happens, but it takes a lot of time and I work hard at my Vines."" ""With only 6 seconds to shine, your creativity is pushed to another level,"" Smiles said.","Vine stars have gained millions of followers for 6-second videos .

""You just don't realize how much time you give up when you have kids,"" says Jenny Triplett, 45.  While their three boys lived at home, the entrepreneur and her husband would make sure to head out for date nights at local restaurants -- just the two of them.  And they always have time for pillow talk. Here's what experts say all couples need to keep the spark alive.  Whether you're facing an emptier nest once the kids go back to school, or even if you don't have children, you can take tips from the three ""T's"". 1) Time . Finding time together is key to making a marriage work.  That becomes especially important when couples become parents. Too many think having kids is all about sacrifice. ""The happiest parents are those who are disciplined about integrating their old life with their new life,"" says relationship expert and psychologist Seth Meyers. That means booking a babysitter, or enlisting family members to watch the kids, while you and your spouse go out. ""Be disciplined about getting a sitter on a regular basis and taking time for just the two of you outside the home,"" says Dr. Seth, ""and don't be shy about returning to some of the favorite places you used to go as a couple before kids."" Finding a shared hobby can also help couples connect. Charly Rok and her husband Jason take a cooking class together, because they share a love of food, as well as cooking.  The New York-based couple has been married for 14 years. ""I married him, and he married me, because we actually like each other, and we like spending time with each other,"" Charly says. Cooking is a hobby that's allowed them to focus on each other, rather than other distractions, when they're together.  Charly commutes to her job in public relations near Philadelphia, where she lives five days a week.  Her husband works in New York City.  So they cherish the time they spend together on weekends. ""When you go into a kitchen on a Saturday, and you're spending the day cooking, you really tend to let go of a lot of other things,"" Jason Rok says.  ""The phone isn't ringing for you. You're not off running errands.  You're not paying bills. You let go of a lot of things, so you're very focused on what's at hand."" But spending time together is only part of the process.  Experts say what you do with that time is key. 2) Talk . Communicate about everything -- even the stressful stuff. ""You have to communicate,"" says Jenny Triplett, the author of ""Surviving Marriage In the 21st Century: 13 Easy Tips That Can Help You Get To 20 Years and Beyond.""  ""You have to carve out that time."" Her husband of 24 years points out that learning to communicate when the kids live at home paves the way for a harmonious empty nest. ""Once the kids go ... it's going to be you and her,"" Rufus Triplett says. ""If you don't learn how to communicate then (when the kids live at home), it's going to be challenging when they go."" Experts say that talking about potential causes of conflict -- like money -- is especially important.  And don't wait until you're about to miss a mortgage payment. Getting together with a partner once a week to talk about financial decisions, big and small, can help keep couples calm. Jacquette M. Timmons, author of ""Financial Intimacy: How to Create a Healthy Relationship with Your Money and Your Mate,"" suggests what she calls ""money dates."" ""That gets people out of the pattern of only talking about money when there is a crisis,"" she says. Money is often a cause of friction. ""The reality is that most of us will attract someone who is financially opposite,"" Timmons says.  Spenders often attract savers; the thrifty tend to attract to the lavish.  So to make sure you and your spouse are one the same page, experts advise -- keep talking. 3) Tenacity . ""Marriage is not a sprint,"" says Jenny Triplett.  ""It's a marathon.""  She says that couples need to realize that they'll be in their relationship for the long haul. Kayla DeLano got married when she was 19.  She is now 34 years old, and still married to Michael, 38.  They live in Long Beach, California, with their 11-year-old son. In addition to honesty, communication and kindness, she says spending time with her husband, despite work demands, is their key to longevity.  So is understanding that partners evolve during the course of a marriage. ""I think you need to be realistic about the fact that you and your spouse will both change,"" she says.  ""You can't say that the person you are right now is going to be the same person that you're going to be in five years."" She says their secret is learning to ebb and flow together, rather than apart.  When her husband wanted to shed some weight he had gained, he turned to Kayla.  A personal trainer, she helped him lose 70 pounds over two years.  ""It's pretty awesome,"" she says. They started biking together.  Now, they play a range of sports, from running relays, to trampoline jumping.  They stay active, and above all, have fun. ""When we are together, we're really together,"" she says.  ""We really focus on each other, and try to tune everything else out."" How do you carve out time to solidify your relationship?

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A pharmacist testified that he warned Anna Nicole Smith's doctors and boyfriend that a list of medications intended for Smith a week after her son's death could be ""pharmaceutical suicide."" Anna Nicole Smith, with Howard K. Stern, was found dead in her hotel room in February 2007. The former Playboy model and reality TV star died five months later of what a Florida medical examiner ruled was from ""acute combined drug intoxication."" Ira Freeman, the chief pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in Los Angeles, testified on the seventh day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith's lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, and the doctors were charged with six each. They are not charged in her death. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, came just five months after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn, and the sudden death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel, on September 10, 2006. Freeman testified that Kapoor faxed to him a list of six drugs that Eroshevich wanted to be sent to the Bahamas, where Eroshevich was treating Smith for anxiety and depression in the days after her son's death. ""The more I thought about it, the more concern I had that if she got hold of those medications, it could have fatal consequences"" Freeman said. The pharmacist said the dosages of the drugs were ""not appropriate."" Freeman said he consulted Dr. Greg Thompson, a pharmaceutical expert, who agreed with him and who offered to talk with Eroshevich about the dangers. Freeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be ""way out of her league"" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith. At the time, Smith was holed up in her home in the Bahamas mourning her son's death. Her bodyguard said in earlier testimony that the home was under siege by photographers, keeping Smith inside with her windows covered. Thompson recommended to Eroshevich that she ""forget the paparazzi and get her to a hospital"" if she needed all of those drugs, Freeman said. Freeman said the stress of the publicity after Smith's death affected his own health, especially after the celebrity Web site TMZ.com published a copy of the faxed list of medications in question. Under questioning by the defense, Freeman said that over the previous five years he had filled prescriptions for Smith, he never saw any ""red flags"" that she was getting dangerous amounts of drugs. Charges against the three defendants also include the use of false names on prescriptions. Freeman said he always understood that prescriptions written under the pseudonym ""Michelle Chase"" were intended for Smith. It was a practice begun in 2001, three years before Kapoor or Eroshevich began treating her, to prevent ""trouble for her in terms of her celebrity status,"" Freeman said. After the preliminary hearing, which could last about three weeks, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry will decide whether a trial will be held. In earlier testimony, Smith's part-time bodyguard Maurice Brighthaupt said ""she just didn't want to deal with life after the death of her son."" Brighthaupt described Smith as ""manipulative"" when she wanted something. ""She manipulated Dr. Eroshevich,"" he said. Eroshevich, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, traveled to the Bahamas five or six times in 2006 to attend to Smith, he said. They had a mother-daughter friendship, not a doctor-patient relationship, Brighthaupt said. The doctor sometimes substituted placebos for the tray full of pills Smith regularly took for her complaints of pain and depression, he said. ""She was very concerned that we needed to wean her off the medications,"" Brighthaupt said. California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago testified that investigators found 12 prescription drugs, including dangerous opiates, in Smith's hotel room after her death. Seven of them were prescribed using Stern's name, although spelled ""Stearn,"" he said. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2½-year inquiry was unsealed last month, revealing many details of the prosecution's case.","Testimony given at preliminary hearing for model's doctors, lawyer .

"(CNN) -- Why waste your time futilely shaking your fist at the driver who cut you off on the country road when you can take him to task on the information superhighway? Molly Hutchins says the Twitter feed gives people an ""outlet to vent your frustration"" over bad drivers. AKBadDrivers is a month-old Twitter feed that takes road rage into the information age. It lets aggrieved motorists in Alaska fire off 140-character vents about drivers who follow too closely, park too tightly, drive too fast or flout other vehicular etiquette. When ""you yell out the window or give them the finger, you really don't get any vindication,"" said the Twitter feed's co-creator, Molly Hutchins. ""This gives you an outlet to vent your frustration to others and feel like you've gotten a little justice."" Hutchins hatched the idea after she found her mother's instant messages, or tweets, were increasingly becoming rants on bad driving. Her parents commute 50 miles each way from their home in Wasilla to Anchorage every day. Her mother, Annette Mullen, would unleash her fury over aggressive or annoying driving antics from the passenger seat, via the micro-blogging site Twitter. ""I kept seeing more and more angry ones, and I said, 'Why don't I set one up just for that?' "" Hutchins said. ""Then we said, 'Why can't we let other people post to it, too?' "" That was three weeks ago. Thanks to an appearance on a morning radio show and a feature in the Anchorage Daily News, the feed now has 648 followers -- and climbing. They send their rants privately, and the mother-daughter duo posts them anonymously. ""Geek Squad bug on Northern Lights -- does your car come with turn signals? Let's use 'em,"" said one post. Another urged the use of mud flaps: ""GET SOME you're killing the rest of us with cracks and chips in our windshields!"" Some post pictures of offending vehicles: ""Really, Highlander? No one is this skinny. I so do not love climbing in my passenger door."" And some include license plate numbers, which Hutchins sees nothing wrong with. ""We're not trying to be hurtful. The license plate is stuck on the front of your car,"" she said. ""Anybody can do anything with it. We're not posting names or anything."" Hutchins and her mother edit the rants, but do not post any of their own. Nor do they text and drive, she stressed. ""Why would I be part of the problem? That seems silly to me,"" she said. ""I find myself driving more carefully because I'm scared -- 'Oh God, what if someone catches me?' "" They're not out to change the world, Hutchins said. They just hope that the next time you're on the receiving end of an errant honker, you can resist the urge to tap into your inner beast -- and use your fingers to tap out a tweet instead. After you pull over, of course.","Mom, daughter create Twitter feed for Alaska drivers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Security contractor Blackwater said any guards who acted improperly in a deadly 2007 shooting in Baghdad should be held accountable, but believes its team acted in self-defense, a company spokeswoman said. A woman walks past a burned car in September after an incident involving Blackwater security guards. Officials familiar with the case said Sunday that six Blackwater contractors have been told they face possible charges in the September 2007 shootings in Baghdad's Nusoor Square. All six received ""target letters"" from the Justice Department, which has convened a grand jury to hear evidence in the case, the officials told CNN. No final decisions have been made, but target letters often signal that criminal charges are in the works. Iraqi authorities have accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the shootings. But Blackwater has repeatedly said its guards were acting "" in response to a hostile threat,"" company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said in a written statement late Sunday. ""Since the September 16, 2007 incident, we have said that, based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved, we believe those involved acted appropriately,"" Tyrrell said. ""If it is determined that an individual acted improperly, Blackwater would support holding that person accountable. But at this stage, without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation, we will not prejudge the actions of any individual."" The company has given its full cooperation to the grand jury, which was seated in November, Tyrrell said. Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under fire in Nusoor Square in western Baghdad. But an Iraqi government commission that investigated the shootings accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately. The first U.S. soldiers who arrived on the scene also told investigators they found no evidence the guards were fired upon, sources familiar with the investigation previously told CNN. An estimated 25,000 private security contractors protect diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials there. Security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq . The Nusoor Square shootings led to angry protests from Iraq, as well as demands that the contractors face trial in Iraqi courts. CNN Justice Correspondent Kelli Arena contributed to this report.","Blackwater says any guards who acted improperly should be held accountable .

"U.S. officials were pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the initial declaration that Syria has submitted to the world's chemical weapons watchdog outlining its inventory of the munitions, a senior administration official said Saturday. The official said the declaration was more complete than what the officials had expected the Syrians to put forth. The news came hours after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced that  Syria had handed over a list of what it says is its chemical arms stockpile. ""The Technical Secretariat is currently reviewing the information received,"" the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The handover occurred a day before the organization is to meet at The Hague in the Netherlands to discuss Syria. The timing meets the terms set in a deal forged last week between the United States and Russia in Geneva to begin destroying Syria's chemical arsenal. Under the fast-tracked Geneva deal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to declare the weapons no later than Saturday. The normal 60-day process for declaring arms was expedited to seven days ""because of the extraordinary concern about Syria's weapons,"" said Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the organization. ""Until now, each country has been typical. The United States, Russia, Libya, India, none have been in a state of war or conflict,"" Luhan said Friday. His organization planned to begin reviewing Monday, he said. ""We have to go through it in detail and plan how to conduct the on-the-ground inspection mission, to verify the accuracy of the declaration and put seals on all the materials to make sure they are secure,"" Luhan said. The stakes over halting the Syrian civil war heightened after an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people. The United States and other Western nations blame the regime for the attack. Russia and Syria say they think rebels used the weapons. Citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons, U.S. President Barack Obama called for authorization from Congress to use military force in Syria. As the United States threatened force to degrade Assad's ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, a diplomatic opportunity arose between Russia and the United States to put Syria's stockpile under international control. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out a deal in Geneva last week compelling Syria to accept the agreement. Syria has agreed to it. Speaking ahead of next week's U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, Kerry said Thursday that while ""the complete removal of Syria's chemical weapons is possible here, through peaceful means,"" urgency is needed. The U.N. Security Council must be prepared to act next week, Kerry said, citing a U.N. chemical weapons report about the attack. While the report did not assign responsibility for the attack, Kerry said it offered ""crucial details,"" making the case implicating Assad ""only ... more compelling."" Russia called the report ""distorted"" and said it was based on insufficient information. Even as diplomatic efforts were continuing, U.S. officials have not dropped their threat to use force and are wary, saying Syria could be using the diplomacy as a stalling tactic. ""Time is short,"" Kerry said. ""Let's not spend time debating what we already know."" Also on Saturday, the Syrian opposition coalition rejected an offer made by Iran to broker a peace deal between rebels and the government, calling it ""ridiculous and desperate."" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is also planning to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting, said he can help bring peace to Syria, a long-time Iranian ally torn by civil war. In a Washington Post op-ed on Thursday, the recently elected Iranian president called for an end to ""the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart."" And he signaled his desire for better engagement with the West. Syria's opposition fired back, saying it didn't consider him an independent broker. ""The Syrian National Coalition considers Iran's offer as ridiculous amid all the bloodshed that Iran participated with the (Bashar) al-Assad regime, through political, economic support and military support during the past two and a half years."" Rouhani, 65, has promised more positive engagement with the world. But the Syrian opposition coalition said Iran is part of the problem. ""There is no doubt that Rouhani's offer is a desperate attempt to prolong the crisis and increase the complexity,"" the coalition said in a statement. The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011, a period in which harsh government crackdowns against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war. Another 2 million people have fled their homeland, and more than 4.25 million have been displaced within Syria, the United Nations says. More violence . Government forces killed at least 26 people Saturday in Hamas suburbs, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees. CNN could not independently verify the claim.","U.S. officials are surprised and encouraged by the list's completeness, an official says .

"A Massachusetts grand jury has indicted an associate of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in a shooting death, Bristol County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Sam Sutter said Friday. Carlos Ortiz, 27, of Bristol, Connecticut, was indicted on a single count of accessory to murder after the fact in connection with the June 17 killing of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez pleaded not guilty this month to first-degree murder in Lloyd's death. The indictment comes after a bail reduction hearing Thursday for another co-defendant, Ernest Wallace, in Fall River, Massachusetts, revealed new details in the murder case against Hernandez. Bristol County prosecutors, according to spokesman Gregg Miliote, told a judge that Hernandez was the only one who got out of a car with Lloyd in a deserted industrial park on June 17, before Lloyd was allegedly shot multiple times, execution-style, by Hernandez. That's different from an earlier scenario laid out by investigators. At first, Ortiz allegedly told investigators that Wallace and Hernandez got out of the car with Lloyd before shots were fired. Since then, prosecutors say, Ortiz changed his story. ""Initially Mr. Ortiz's statement was Mr. Wallace got out of the car and now his statement is that Mr. Wallace stayed in the car,"" Sutter said outside of court Thursday. When asked by a reporter if he was concerned about the fact that Ortiz had changed his story, he replied: ""Not at all."" Ortiz's lawyer, John Connors, said it is not uncommon for a witness's story to change. ""Almost every case I've ever been involved in, the story changes during interrogation,"" Connors said. ""When a professional interrogation takes place, at the end of it sometimes you have trouble remembering your own name."" Connors stopped short of using the word credible to describe his client. ""He's a young guy who got caught up in a situation, and when all this came about, he was frightened and confused, as you can imagine anyone would be,"" Connors said. ""I believe he's an honest guy."" Ortiz will enter a plea of not guilty to the new charge, his attorney said. Wallace also has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact to murder. Man suing Hernandez says there's no reason to delay the suit . At the Thursday hearing, a judge refused to reduce Wallace's $500,000 bail, despite attorney David Meier's insistence that his client has ""every intention"" and ""every incentive to appear at every court hearing."" In court, the district attorney's office also disclosed that Hernandez allegedly made several phone calls to Wallace after Lloyd's body was discovered. ""Mr. Hernandez ... immediately makes cell phone telephone calls to Mr. Wallace upon police arriving at his house,"" Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg told the judge. Hernandez was not arrested until 10 days after the slaying. Wallace turned himself in to police in Miramar, Florida, at his family's home more than a week later after taking a bus to Florida from Georgia. During Thursday's bail hearing, prosecutors told a judge that Hernandez's cousin, Tanya Singleton, drove Wallace to Georgia, and when her car broke down, bought him a bus ticket to the go the rest of the way. Singleton remains jailed after being indicted for contempt of court. She's been charged with refusing to testify before a grand jury.

"I met a woman named Yvonne in Greenville, South Carolina, where the CNN Express was reporting on the rollout of Obamacare. Yvonne had a big smile and was very excited -- you couldn't miss her. I first noticed her standing in line, waiting patiently to ask a few questions about health care. Most of the questions I had been asked up until that time revolved around the logistics of signing up, whether they could pick a particular doctor and how much all this was going to cost. Yvonne, who didn't give her last name, started by telling me that she had been able to get off Medicaid in the past year. Before that, she had been living in her car, intermittently staying with friends. Now she has a place to live, and she's excited about the prospect of finally being able to get private health care insurance for the first time in her life. Yvonne, 35, told me she works part-time as a hairstylist assistant. She said she makes $9 an hour, which at 20 hours a week works out to about $9,360 a year. She is still impoverished, but considers herself lucky because she's never had a major illness. As we spoke about South Carolina's sign-up process, I realized I was explaining some unwelcome news: Yvonne is not eligible for any assistance toward buying health insurance. Let me try to explain: In a state that has chosen not to expand Medicaid, Yvonne is in the staggering position of now making too much money to qualify for Medicaid, and too little to obtain subsidies through the Affordable Care Act. This wasn't how it was supposed to go down for Yvonne and others like her all over the country. When you imagine the people likely to benefit the most from the Affordable Care Act, you probably think of someone just like her. By obtaining a real job with enough income, Yvonne has disqualified herself from her state's Medicaid program. But in order to qualify for subsidies in South Carolina, she needs to get above the poverty line, and she is not quite there. Yvonne and an estimated 7 million others now find themselves in a coverage gap. The tax subsidies available through the health exchanges were intended to make private insurance coverage affordable for those between the poverty line and four times as much -- people who now shoulder the responsibility, by law, of purchasing their own coverage. Last year, in its landmark ruling that left most of the ACA in place, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Medicaid expansion is optional for states. South Carolina, and 25 other states, turned it down. As a result, a big swath of the uninsured will stay that way when new coverage options kick in January 1. I asked Kentucky Senate hopeful Matt Bevin, a Republican, who was against the expansion in his state, about this. Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear has been a proponent of the law, and Kentucky has expanded Medicaid to cover anyone making up to 138% of the poverty line. When I described Yvonne's situation to Bevin, he was sympathetic but immediately replied, ""Where is the money going to come from?"" His is a common sentiment among leaders of states that have refused Medicaid dollars from the federal government. For the time being, the money comes from the federal government. In the states that accepted Medicaid expansion, the federal government will pick up 100% of the tab for four years. For the next three years, it will pay for slightly less. Beyond 2020 it will cover 90% of the cost. The man who oversees the health insurance expansion in Maryland, Dr Joshua Sharfstein, was stunned that so many states turned the money down. According to the analysis in Maryland, the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion would be in the billions. As I walked with him, I asked if he could give a single reason -- medically or financially -- for a state not to accept the Medicaid dollars. He thought about it for a moment, and said ""none."" ""This is just politics,"" he added. Yvonne doesn't have many options. She can't get subsidies, Medicaid or health insurance. One small solace is that she won't be forced to pay any tax penalty for not having insurance. ""Oh well, I guess that is good,"" Yvonne replied when I told her. She had worked so hard to come off Medicaid, but asked me at the end of the day for a list of states where she might move to get back on the Medicaid program once again.","Some earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to obtain ACA subsidies .

"(CNN) -- A federal court on Wednesday struck down two provisions of the Patriot Act dealing with searches and intelligence gathering, saying they violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures with regard to criminal prosecutions. ""It is critical that we, as a democratic nation, pay close attention to traditional Fourth Amendment principles,"" wrote Judge Ann Aiken of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon in her 44-page decision. ""The Fourth Amendment has served this nation well for 220 years, through many other perils."" The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, set up to review wiretap applications in intelligence cases under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, ""holds that the Constitution need not control the conduct of criminal surveillance in the United States,"" Aiken wrote. ""In place of the Fourth Amendment, the people are expected to defer to the executive branch and its representation that it will authorize such surveillance only when appropriate."" The government ""is asking this court to, in essence, amend the Bill of Rights, by giving it an interpretation that would deprive it of any real meaning. The court declines to do so,"" Aiken said. The Justice Department was reviewing the decision, said spokesman Dean Boyd. The ruling was a response to a lawsuit filed against the federal government by Brandon Mayfield, a Portland, Oregon, attorney who was wrongly arrested for alleged involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The federal government later apologized to Mayfield and settled part of Mayfield's lawsuit for $2 million. But Mayfield was permitted to keep pursuing the portions of his lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Patriot Act. Mayfield claimed in the suit that his home and law offices were secretly broken into by the FBI, his clients' files at his office were searched, his business and personal computers were secretly copied, his telephone was wiretapped and his home was bugged. Mayfield said he was ""excited and happy"" with the ruling. ""This, to me, is not so much personal,"" he said. ""I think it's just the right thing to do. It was the right thing to continue to challenge the constitutionality of the Patriot Act."" ""This is an example of the judicial branch doing what it should do, and that's to be a check and balance for the legislative and executive branch of government,"" he said. ""I feel wonderful today, because the Fourth Amendment has been restored to its rightful place, and the balance between liberty and security is balanced again."" Mayfield's attorneys -- Gerry Spence, Elden Rosenthal and Michelle Longer Eder -- lauded the ruling. ""Judge Aiken, in striking down the challenged provisions of the Patriot Act, has upheld both the tradition of judicial independence and our nation's most cherished principle of the right to be secure in one's own home,"" they said in a written statement. ""We are relieved that the Bill of Rights can be honored and preserved even in times of perceived crisis."" Aiken ruled that FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, permits the government to conduct surveillance and searches targeting Americans without satisfying the probable-cause standard in the Fourth Amendment. ""Prior to the amendments [to FISA], the three branches of government operated with thoughtful and deliberate checks and balances -- a principle upon which our nation was founded,"" Aiken wrote. But the Patriot Act, she said, eliminated ""the constitutionally required interplay between executive action, judicial decision and Congressional enactment."" ""For over 200 years, this nation has adhered to the rule of law -- with unparalleled success. A shift to a nation based on extra-constitutional authority is prohibited, as well as ill-advised,"" she wrote. Aiken noted that FISA does not require that the subject of a search be notified, although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily does. In addition, she said, the Fourth Amendment requires particularity -- authorities seeking a search warrant, for example, must list what they are looking for and where they are looking for it. Named to the bench in 1997 by President Clinton, Aiken is considered one of the more liberal judges on the federal bench in Oregon.

"(CNN) -- An Iranian naval commander Monday said his forces are willing to carry out suicide missions when facing enemy forces in the Persian Gulf, according to Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. An Iranian soldier leans against a wall decorated with a military mural. ""If necessary, we will use the element of martyrdom-seeking and we will become people of Ashura,"" Fars quoted Gen. Ali Fadavi as saying. Ashura refers to the day marking the death of Imam Hussein, Prophet Mohammed's grandson, who is revered by Shiite Muslims. Fadavi said volunteer forces of theIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps naval division have long emulated the role of Hossein Fahmideh, a 13-year-old suicide bomber during the Iran-Iraq war. Fahmideh strapped himself with explosives and blew up an Iraqi tank during the 1980-88 war, sealing his fate as a national hero in Iran. ""The Basiji (volunteer) forces, by following the steps of the martyr Fahmideh ... have always been martyrdom-seeking and willing to give their lives before God,"" Fadavi said, according to Fars. ""This is one of the secrets of the success of the sacred defense campaign (during the Iran-Iraq war) and even now, this spirit is prevalent throughout the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps."" Fadavi noted that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is undertaking various operations to upgrade the combat abilities of the volunteer forces in naval warfare, Fars reported. His comments come amid an increase in tensions with the United States. Last week, the United States announced it was imposing stiff sanctions against Tehran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Force -- which was designated a terrorist-supporting organization -- as well as a number of Iranian banks and companies, accusing them of supporting nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities. Earlier this year Iran held captive a group of British sailors and marines it accused of violating its territorial waters. The 14 men and one woman were eventually released after being forced to apologize on Iranian television.

"RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated Thursday outside a large gathering of her supporters where a suicide bomber also killed at least 14, doctors and a spokesman for her party said. Benazir Bhutto greets her supporters at the rally that was hit by a suicide attack. While Bhutto appeared to have died from bullet wounds, it was not immediately clear if she was shot or if her wounds were caused by bomb shrapnel. President Pervez Musharraf held an emergency meeting in the hours after the death, according to state media. Police warned citizens to stay home as they expected rioting to break out in city streets in reaction to the death. Police sources told CNN the bomber, who was riding a motorcycle, blew himself up near Bhutto's vehicle.  Watch aftermath of the attack. » . Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital -- less than two miles from the bombing scene -- where doctors pronounced her dead.

""We condemn the acts of violence which took place today in Pakistan,"" said a spokesman. The number of wounded was not immediately known.

The attack came just hours after four supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif died when members of another political party opened fire on them at a rally near the Islamabad airport Thursday, Pakistan police said. Several other members of Sharif's party were wounded, police said. Bhutto, who led Paksitan from 1988 to 1990 and was the first female prime minister of any Islamic nation, was participating in the parliamentary election set for January 8, hoping for a third term.

Bhutto had been critical of what she believed was a lack of effort by Musharraf's government to protect her. Two weeks after the October assassination attempt, she wrote a commentary for CNN.com in which she questioned why Pakistan investigators refused international offers of help in finding the attackers.

"(CNN) -- The husband of a Saudi rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison said his wife is ""a crushed human being,"" but blamed a judge -- not the Saudi judicial system -- for treating her as a criminal. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. Saudi society is respectful of women, he said, adding that he had faith his wife would get justice. The ruling relates to an incident in March 2006 when the woman, then 18 and engaged to be married, and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif, Saudi Arabia, by a group of seven men. She was later raped. In October, the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years in prison for the assault. She was convicted of violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall. ""From the outset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime,"" said her 24-year-old husband. ""She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes."" The husband, who asked to remain unnamed, spoke to CNN senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr. His wife, who he said is ""a quiet, simple person who does not bother anyone,"" is ill and too fragile to speak about the case, he said. As her guardian under Saudi law, he is standing up for her publicly.  Watch the victim's husband speak out » . The attack, trial and sentencing have taken a heavy toll on his wife's already-poor health, he said. She suffers from anemia, a blood disorder and asthma, and will have surgery next month to remove her gallbladder, he said. ""Since the attack, she's been suffering from severe depression."" The events ended her pursuit of an education past high school, he said. ""Her situation keeps changing from bad to worse,"" he said. ""You could say she's a crushed human being."" ""The court proceedings were like a spectacle at times,"" he said. ""The criminals were allowed in the same room as my wife. They were allowed to make all kinds of offensive gestures and give her dirty and threatening looks."" Of the three judges at the trial, one of them ""was mean and from the beginning dealt with my wife as guilty person who had done something wrong,"" he said. ""Even when he pronounced the sentence, he said to her, 'You were involved in a suspicious relationship, and you deserve 200 lashes for that,' "" he said. The judge dismissed her lawyer, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, after the two clashed in court, he said. ""The judge took things personally and was reacting to our lawyer, who's a known human rights activist,"" the husband said. ""The judge undermined the lawyer, decreased his role and then dismissed him from the case altogether. The judge simply couldn't work with our lawyer."" The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes. But when she appealed, the court more than doubled her sentence. The husband said the judge was pursuing ""a personal vendetta."" ""We were shocked when the judgment changed and her sentence was doubled,"" the husband said. ""We were looking for pardon; instead, she got double the whipping and more jail time."" A court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper, that the woman's sentence was increased after the woman spoke to the media about the case. But a Saudi Justice Ministry statement said the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. ""If this sentence is based on the law, then I would've welcomed it,"" the husband said. ""But it is harsh, and the Saudi society I know and belong to is more sympathetic than that. I do not expect such harshness from Saudis, but rather compassion and support of the victim and her rights."" Saudi society is very respectful to women in general, he said. The case, which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system, has drawn a strong international reaction. Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ""to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer."" Under law in Saudi Arabia, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition on driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken steps to better the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law and the creation of a human rights commission.

"(Real Simple) -- Here are some tips for keeping your plants healthy, plus suggested flowers and plants for container gardens. 1. Choose the pots . Make certain there are one or more holes in the bottom of your container to allow water to flow out freely. Insufficient drainage can cause roots to drown, and the plant to die prematurely. Almost anything can be used as a container for plants, so what type of pot you choose depends upon your style preference and budget. If you prefer lightweight containers, which are easy to move around and can weather winter temperatures, look for resin, fiberglass, and plastic. Added bonus: These materials are not porous, so they absorb less moisture than unglazed clay or wood -- leaving more for the plant. 2. Choose the potting mix . Do not use soil from the yard or garden. It can be filled with weed seeds, insects, and fungal diseases. Buy potting soil at your local garden center. It is a loose and light mixture of materials like peat moss, vermiculite, and, often, decomposed organic matter. If you are planting succulents or cacti, use a mix especially formulated for them. To reduce plant maintenance, buy potting mix containing a time-release fertilizer and moisture-retaining polymer crystals. If that type of mix is not available, buy a time-release fertilizer (such as Cockadoodle Doo) and a jar of water-retaining crystals (like Soil Moist) and follow the package directions for adding to the potting mix. 3. Choose the plants . Make ""Right plant, right place"" your motto. You must take into consideration the conditions of your space. Don't try to grow a flower like a rose -- which requires six hours of full sun -- on a porch that gets only an hour in the early morning. Do your homework (read books and plant tags), ask for advice at the garden center, and determine which plants will thrive in the available sun or shade. When deciding what to buy, the simplest approach is to use one kind of plant per pot. If you choose to combine multiple types of plants, make sure they all like the same light and moisture conditions. Don't put a cactus and a pansy together in one pot and expect them to get along. 4. Prepare the pots . If your containers are large, place them where they'll ultimately go before filling them. Once they are full and watered, they may be too heavy to move. Put a basket-type coffee filter or a shard of broken pot over the hole(s) in the bottom of the empty pot. This will prevent the potting mix from washing out but will still allow water to escape. Before pouring in the soil, check its moisture content. Read directions on the bag for wetting it properly. Generally, you need to add water a little at a time and knead the mixture with your hands. A good rule of thumb is to wet the mix until it feels like a damp sponge. Fill the container with the soil. Put in enough potting mix so the base of the plant (where the stem sprouts from the soil's surface) is about 1 inch from the top of the pot (to help visually estimate, position your plant while it's still in its nursery container). Before planting, pat down the soil lightly with your fingers to eliminate any big air pockets. Don't pack it down too hard. 5. Pot the plant . Remove the plant from its nursery container. (It's a good practice to water plants in their original containers at least an hour before transplanting. This will ease their removal and diminish transplant shock.) Support the top of the ""root ball"" (the semisolid mass of soil and roots) by placing a finger on each side of the stem; then tip the pot and let the plant fall gently into your hand. Never pull a plant out by its stem. If it is stuck, tap the sides of the pot to loosen it. If the roots are circling around and around, the plant is ""root-bound."" Gently tease the ends of the roots free before planting. Set the plant on top of the mix. If you are potting more than one plant, leave at least an inch or so around each root ball so you can add mix in between them. Carefully fill in with small handfuls of soil. Pat gently to eliminate air pockets. Do not pile soil on top of the plant -- make sure the stem is completely above the surface. Leave about an inch between the soil surface and the rim of the pot. Water the container. This will settle the roots into their new home. If the soil level drops below the top of the root ball, add additional mix to bring it back up. Watering . If you plant in the spring and the weather is mild, you can probably get away with watering about once a week. As the summer continues, plants need more water. Not only is the warm weather evaporating the moisture before the plant can use it, the plants need more water as they grow larger. Hanging plants and small pots may need watering twice a day (best times are morning and evening); once a day is enough for large pots. Water your plants until the water comes out of the drainage holes. That way you know the soil is getting moisture all the way to the bottom. Water the soil, not the leaves and flowers. Wetting the foliage can lead to fungal diseases and sometimes scorched spots on leaves. Don't worry if plants and flowers look wilted in the hottest time of the day. As long as the top of the soil is moist, you probably don't need to water. Wilting is a self-protective mechanism to prevent too much moisture loss from the root area. Wait and see if the plants perk up after the sun goes down. Don't let pots sit in water; this can cause root rot and death. If you are using saucers, empty them after you water and after it rains. Feeding . Plants growing in containers need more fertilizing than those in the ground. The more you water, the more quickly you flush the nutrients out of the soil. It's good to use a time-release fertilizer when planting (see Step 2 on the previous page), but it's the bare minimum. If you want really healthy and happy plants, feed them a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer every couple of weeks according to package directions. Deadheading . Pinching or cutting off faded blooms, known as deadheading, is essential. It encourages a plant to keep producing more flowers. Some plants have so many tiny flowers and stems, it would be too time-consuming to snip or pick off individual flower heads. For those types, it's best to shear the whole plant back to about one-third of its size. It will look ""whacked"" for about a week, but you will soon be rewarded with a flush of new buds and blooms. Some flowering plants are ""self-cleaning,"" meaning they don't generally require deadheading or shearing. These are usually prolific bloomers covered in smallish flowers, which just shrivel up and almost disappear on their own. Some examples are impatiens, mini petunias, diascia, and browalia. If they start to flag late in the summer, cut back the plant by one-third to rejuvenate blooming. Good container flowers for sun Angelonia African daisy (Arctotis) Dahlia Purple fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum 'Rubrum') Lantana Verbena Zinnia . Good container flowers for shade Tuberous Begonia Fuchsia Impatiens Browallia Torenia . Good colorful foliage plants for sun and shade Caladium (shade) Coleus (sun and shade, depending on variety) Phormium (full sun to part shade) Canna (full sun to part shade) Ferns (various types, filtered sun to shade) Persian shield (Strobilanthes dyerianus, full sun/part shade) Ornamental sweet potato vine (Ipomoea batatas, full sun/part shade) Ornamental grass (various types, full sun) Good container flowers for sun and shade Twinspur (Diascia, full sun/part shade) Mini petunia (Calibrachoa, full sun/part shade) Nemesia (full sun/part shade) Scaevola (full sun/part shade) Salvia (Salvia guaranitica, full sun/part shade) Note: Where only one name is listed, the botanical and common names are the same.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton formally ended her presidential campaign Saturday, saying to a packed house of thousands of supporters, ""I will continue to stand strong with you every time, every place and every way that I can."" Sen. Hillary Cllinton thanks her supporters Saturday in a speech in which she endorsed Sen. Barack Obama. She urged the cheering crowd to support Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in his bid for the White House, saying she and supporters should ""take our energy, our passion and our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama ... I ask all of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me."" Her endorsement was met with a scattering of boos and thumbs downs from the crowd at the National Building Museum in Washington. Clinton's campaign said 6,000 people signed up on the New York senator's Web site to attend the speech.  Watch Clinton endorse Obama » . Shortly after the speech, Obama released a statement praising Clinton's presidential run. ""Obviously, I am thrilled and honored to have Sen. Clinton's support. But more than that, I honor her today for the valiant and historic campaign she has run. She shattered barriers on behalf of  my daughters and women everywhere, who now know that there are no limits to their dreams. And she inspired millions with her strength, courage and unyielding commitment to the cause of working Americans."" Obama watched the speech over the Internet, a campaign aide said. He put in a call to Clinton afterward but was told by a Clinton assistant that she was speaking with supporters. During her speech, Clinton encouraged party unity, acknowledging that the fight has been hard, but saying ""the Democratic Party is a family, and now it's time to restore the ties that bind us together.""  Watch more of Clinton's speech » . ""To all those who voted for me, my commitment to you is unyielding. You have inspired and touched me. You have humbled me with your commitment,"" she said. ""Eighteen million of you from all walks of life -- women, and men, young and old, Latino and Asian, African-American and Caucasian, rich and poor, middle-class, gay and straight ... you have stood with me,"" she said. Clinton has battled Obama in a primary season that stretched over nearly 18 months and 57 contests, culminating in Obama's winning the 2,118 delegates needed to clinch the party's nomination Tuesday. A Clinton supporter told Gloria Borger, a CNN senior political analyst, shortly after the rousing speech that ""this was the Hillary I worked with and supported. I suspect I'll never understand why this Hillary wasn't visible more often.""  Interactive: Analysts weigh in on Clinton's speech » . Clinton noted that both she and Obama had made history in their campaigns. ""When I was asked what it means to be a woman running for president, I always gave the same answer: I was proud to be running as a women, but I was running because I thought I'd be the best president,"" she said. ""But I am a woman, and like millions of women, I know that there are still barriers and biases out there, often unconscious. And I want to build an America that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us. ""We must make sure that women and men alike understand the struggles of their grandmothers and their mothers and that women enjoy equal pay and equal respect,"" she said. ""Let us resolve and work toward achieving some very simple propositions: There are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the 21st century in our country."" ""I wish she was going on the ticket instead,"" one supporter said. ""But I think she's making a good stand down. She's a lady. She's doing it well."" Clinton was accompanied by her husband, former President Clinton; their daughter, Chelsea; and her mother, Dorothy Rodham. CNN contributor Donna Brazile, Al Gore's campaign manager in the 2000 election, offered a strong message for the Illinois senator. ""The work begins tomorrow for Sen. Obama to go out there, rally her supporters, earn their respect and win with them this November,"" she said. Clinton said that as she spoke, America's 50th woman in space was orbiting Earth in the space shuttle Discovery. If the nation can put 50 women in space, it can launch a woman into the White House, she said to loud cheers. ""Although we weren't able to shatter this highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before,"" she said.  Watch Clinton discuss the race » . ""It is this belief and optimism that Sen. Obama and I share,"" Clinton said, ""that has inspired so many millions of supporters to make their voices heard. So today, I am standing with Sen. Obama to say, 'Yes, we can.' "" A CNN poll released Friday shows that the party is divided after a primary season that stretched over nearly 18 months and 57 contests. Sixty percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for Obama, but 17 percent said they would vote for Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee and Obama's rival in the general election. Nearly one-quarter, 22 percent, said they would not vote at all if Clinton were not the Democrats' nominee.

"The driver of a train that derailed in northwestern Spain last week, killing 79 people, was on the phone with railway staff when the train crashed, court officials announced Tuesday, citing information from data recorders. The train was going 153 kph (95 mph) when it derailed, the superior tribunal of Galicia said. That's nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened. Authorities have charged the train's driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. A court has granted Garzon conditional release, but his license to operate a train has been suspended for six months. He also was required to surrender his passport and report to court weekly. CNN efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful. Spain train crash victims mourned at memorial mass . The train, nearing the end of a six-hour trip between Madrid and Ferrol, derailed Wednesday evening as it hurtled around a bend in Santiago de Compostela. Minutes before the derailment, Garzon received a call on his work phone, apparently receiving instructions on the way to Ferrol from a Renfe staff member, the court said Tuesday. Background noise suggested he was looking at or shuffling papers, the court said. On Spain's railroad system, command and control posts can communicate with drivers at any point during a journey, a spokeswoman from Renfe -- the Spanish railroad company -- told CNN's Karl Penhaul. Drivers communicate via radio-telephones known in Spanish as ""tren-tierras"" or train-to-land. But drivers also use mobile phones if radio-telephones are not working or ""when it's considered necessary,"" the spokeswoman said. Steve Harrod, a railroad transportation expert at Ohio's University of Dayton, said he was stunned by the report that the driver may have been speaking on the phone shortly before the crash. In the United States, Harrod said, railroad drivers are not allowed to use cell phones to prevent dangerous distractions. Shortly before the train crashed, according to reports, the Spanish train had passed from a computer-controlled area of the track to a zone that requires the driver to take control of braking and acceleration, Harrod said. ""It's possible that the driver's phone conversation -- which apparently was part of his official capacity as a driver -- distracted him and he missed the transition from automatic to driver control,"" Harrod said. He may have been unaware he was in control of the train and realized, 'oh, no, we're headed for a curve.' If that's true, I really don't think it was his fault."" The Renfe spokeswoman told CNN that command and control posts have real-time systems to show each train's precise location at a given time. If this were the case, a controller who would have phoned the train driver might have known the train was approaching a curve. According to an interview in state-owned Efe news service with the president of the state-owned Administrator of Railway Infrastructures, the train should have started slowing down about 4 kilometers (2.48 miles) before the curve. At 192 kph, the train would have been traveling about 3.2 kilometers a minute. He hit the brakes seconds before the crash, bringing the speed down from 192 kph (119 mph), according to the court. He was still on the phone when the train flew off the tracks. Of the 79 who died in the ensuing wreck, 63 were from Spain. Others were from the United States, Latin America and Europe. The victims were remembered Monday in a memorial Mass at a Catholic cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. ""Our brothers lost their lives ... when they had so many plans,"" said Archbishop Julian Barrio."" It is not easy to understand and accept this reality,"" he said, ""but I say to you, let our pain not be wasted. Everything has meaning in our lives. We are not shouting in a vacuum.""

"(CNN)  -- As millions head to the polls Tuesday, history will be made. Either Barack Obama will become the first African-American president, or Sarah Palin will become the first female vice president. The 2008 presidential election will have a historic outcome, whichever ticket wins. But what about all the other history and trivia from the past 219 years? Check out some tidbits to quench any political junkies' thirst, impress friends and maybe even win a few bar bets. Election 2008 . • Either John McCain or Obama will be the first incumbent member of Congress to be elected president since John F. Kennedy in 1960. • Either McCain or Obama will become only the third senator to move directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House. The other two senators: Warren G. Harding (1920) and John F. Kennedy (1960). • This year's contest marks the 25th presidential election without an incumbent president on the ballot. • This is the first election in 24 years without a Bush or a Clinton heading a major party's presidential ticket. McCain/Obama scenarios . • If McCain wins, he will be the first president from Arizona. • If McCain wins, he will have headed the first successful GOP presidential ticket in 80 years that did not include someone named Bush or Nixon. • If McCain wins, Palin will become the first vice president from Alaska. • If Obama wins, he will be the third president from Illinois. The first two: Abraham Lincoln (elected in 1860 and 1864) and Ulysses S. Grant (elected in 1868 and 1872). • If Obama wins, he will be the 27th lawyer to become president. Bill Clinton was the last lawyer elected president, and the first was John Adams. • If Obama wins, Joe Biden will become the first vice president from Delaware. Past presidential races . • Nineteen of America's 43 presidents have been Republicans; 14 have been Democrats. • The first Republican president was Abraham Lincoln, who was elected in 1860 and 1864. Andrew Jackson, elected in 1828 and 1832, was the first presidential candidate to run (and win) as a Democrat. • The House has twice decided the presidential election because no candidate received a majority in the Electoral College (Thomas Jefferson in 1800 and John Quincy Adams in 1824). • The most states ever won by a presidential candidate is 49. In 1972, Richard Nixon carried every state except Massachusetts; in 1984, Ronald Reagan carried every state except Minnesota. Both lost the District of Columbia. The most states ever won by a Democratic presidential candidate is 46. In 1936, Franklin Roosevelt carried 46 of 48 states, failing to capture only Maine and Vermont. • Four presidents have won the presidency while losing the popular vote: John Quincy Adams (1824), Rutherford B. Hayes (1876), Benjamin Harrison (1888) and George W. Bush (2000). In the House and Senate . • Democrats controlled both houses of Congress from 1955 to 1981. This 26-year stretch is the longest any single party has controlled both chambers of Congress. (The GOP took control of the Senate in 1981.) • The last time the Democrats won the White House while maintaining control of the House and the Senate was in 1992. • The last time the Republicans won the White House without electing a majority in either the House or the Senate was in 1988. • Sixteen women currently serve in the Senate. Three -- Susan Collins, Elizabeth Dole and Mary Landrieu -- are up for re-election this year. Seventy-one women currently serve in the House as voting members.

But most of the world is just baffled, mystified at the sight of the world's most powerful country tangled in a crippling web of its own making.

The democracy that once inspired the world now leaves observers perplexed. Read more . Bob Greene: Taxpayers, you deserve your money back . If we had paid for an airline ticket, and in the middle of our trip the airline informed us that one leg of our journey had been canceled, we would justifiably demand a refund. If we ordered an annual subscription to 52 weeks of a magazine, and then, a few months into it, the magazine told us that its new policy was to publish only 26 issues a year, we would, with good reason, ask for half of our money back. If we paid for a one-year membership in a health club, and the club announced that it would have to close for repairs for three months, we would expect a 25% refund. So ... exactly when can we expect to see our refund checks from the federal government? Read more . David Gergen: Shutdown could be shock therapy . Yes, conservative hard-liners have chosen the wrong place to fight; arguments over Obamacare are no excuse to shut down the government. Yes, hard-liners like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are creating deeper partisan divides. But Democrats can ill afford to continue rejecting any talks or negotiations. Now that the shutdown has happened, Obama has a fresh opportunity -- indeed a fresh responsibility -- to seize the mantle of leadership and get us out of this mess.  Instead of just blaming the Republicans, he should call in the leaders of both parties and in Lyndon Johnson fashion, keep 'em talking till they get a deal. Read more . Marian Currinder and Josh Huder: Boehner's bad choices . No House speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party. And no speaker wants to go down in history for presiding over one of the most unproductive Congresses in history. But these are Boehner's choices. While [former Speaker Dennis] Hastert relied on a majority of the majority, Boehner has had to rely on a minority of the majority, together with a majority of the minority, to pass important legislation.

"The Gulf of Mexico's annual spring-summer ""dead zone"" is the size of Connecticut -- slightly smaller now than in recent years but nowhere near the trim scientists had sought, researchers said this week. Scientists' annual survey found an area of 5,052 square miles of ""low oxygen water,"" or hypoxia, off much of Louisiana's coast and part of Texas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. The zone is formed by nutrients that wash into the Gulf's waters -- largely agriculture fertilizer and wastewater coming down the Mississippi River. These boost algae blooms that suck up the oxygen in deep water, according to NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey. Marine life struggles to find enough oxygen to survive within the zone. Fish and shrimp can migrate to areas with oxygen-rich water, but some life forms in the deep water and ocean floor -- including those that serve as food for the fish and shrimp -- can't get out of the zone and eventually die. That hurts biodiversity and makes food hard to come by for the fish and shrimp when they return, said the survey's leader, Nancy Rabalais, executive director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium. Scientists first discovered a dead zone in these waters in 1972, and it has appeared ever spring and summer since, with varying sizes. This year's dead zone, measured from July 27 to August 2, is smaller than the five-year average of 5,550 square miles, and well under 2002's record 8,481 square miles. But scientists had set a goal of reducing the zone to 1,900 square miles by 2015 -- and this year's measurement likely means that target won't be met, Rabalais said. ""The average we're targeting against is three times the goal. ... There hasn't been any progress in reaching that goal,"" she said. Ways to shrink the zone, she said, would include changing agricultural practices, including the timing of fertilization -- ideas that have worked well on the small scale but not, so far, on the large. There's been no evidence to show that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of 2010 had any contribution to that year's dead zone or any subsequent one, Rabalais said. The survey is supported by NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is the world's second-largest caused by humans, Rabalais said. The largest is in the Baltic Sea. ""The number of dead zones throughout the world has been increasing in the last several decades and currently totals over 550,"" Rabalais said. Dead zones amount to an expensive hit for America's fishing industry. NOAA estimates the annual cost of algae blooms to U.S. seafood and tourism industries at $82 million or more. Can oxygen pump breathe life into ocean 'dead zone?'","The Gulf of Mexico ""dead zone"" is caused by an algae blooms that suck up oxygen .

"A series of high-profile rape cases involving girls, foreign tourists and a physiology student who died following a brutal gang rape in December  has hit India's reputation. In response, the nation's lawmakers have introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment. Despite such action, India continues to see episodes of sexual violence. The latest case to draw outrage involved a 7-year-old girl who was raped in a train's toilet compartment in central India last weekend. Why is rape and sexual violence getting such attention in India? A robust public dialogue on sex crimes in India emerged in December after the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a bus in New Delhi. The physiotherapy student died in a Singapore hospital. An outcry quickly grew over her death and expanded to include widespread concerns about women's safety and inequalities, triggering demonstrations in India's capital. Advocates criticized the world's largest democracy for failing to protect half of its population. Protesters demanded better treatment of women and decried the apathy of police and the judicial system. ""The truth is, when most women report sexual harassment in India's cities, towns and villages, they are typically met with a shrug,"" Anjana Menon wrote in an opinion piece. ""Slowly, but firmly, the onus of remaining safe seems to have shifted to women, instead of being shared by society and law-keepers."" The country has continued to see several high-profile cases of rape and sexual violence. A Swiss tourist and her husband were attacked while they had set up camp near a forest in the state of Madhya Pradesh. A group of men beat the husband and raped the wife in March, according to police. Last month, a court sentenced six men to life in prison in the gang rape case. In April, a 5-year-old girl was abducted and raped repeatedly, until she was found semiconscious three days later. In May, a 4-year-old died after being abducted and sexually assaulted. Is rape more common in India than other countries? Official data in India show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011. But campaigners say this is the tip of the iceberg. Statistics concerning rape and sexual violence tends to be underreported because of stigma and cultural factors. It's an inexact science to compare one country's rape statistic to another, because of the tendency to underreport. In 2010, women in the United States experienced 270,000 completed, attempted or threatened rape or sexual assaults, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that the global toll of sexual or physical violence in women is 35.6%, which is likely to be an underestimate. Dr. Margaret Chan, the WHO's director-general, described violence against women as a ""global health problem of epidemic proportions."" Why is this happening in India? Some observers say violent acts against women stem from the country's largely patriarchal social setup. Some blame pornography and Bollywood for objectifying women, and a culture that values chastity. Many women's rights activists say the issues of violence and inequality start before birth. Sex-selective abortions continue, despite being illegal in the country. The sex ratio in the 2011 census dwindled to 940 females to 1,000 males. Parents prefer boys, because many don't want to pay dowry (which is also illegal). Girls are seen as a burden, while boys are viewed as contributing to their families, advocates say. ""Often they get less food than their brothers, they're pulled out of school early to help at home or get married,"" said Ruchira Gupta, the founder of ApneAap, a women's organization. Women's rights advocates point to an entrenched societal view that values men more than women. What's being done? The government passed tougher anti-rape laws, introducing the death penalty for repeat offenders, and imprisonment for acid attacks, human trafficking and stalking. It also punishes public servants, such as a police officer, who ""knowingly disobeys"" the laws required in an investigation. It has prompted an increase in the number of women working in New Delhi police stations. But some say while the laws have changed, the mindset and enforcement haven't. Some advocates are taking the situation into their own hands, with groups of girls patrolling their local streets to protect women from harassment, educating boys on how to properly treat girls and men holding campaigns to challenge the patriarchal views.","Rape of a 7-year-old on a train draws outrage in India .

"Three speeches, three days. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is starting to look a lot like someone who is picking up the pace of a presidential campaign -- complete with the perks and the challenges that come with it. On Wednesday, she spoke to the University of Buffalo. Thursday, she returned to Washington for her place in the lineup of high-profile public figures at a conference the Center for American Progress was hosting. Friday night she did Colgate University's ""distinguished speakers"" series in upstate New York. Asked in Buffalo what her ideal presidential candidate in 2016 would look like, she said: ""I'm not as interested in what the candidate looks like as what the candidate stands for and what the candidate really believes needs to be the agenda for America's future, particularly as it relates to young people like students at this great university."" Three big takeaways from Hillary Clinton's return to politics . And in what could be interpreted as either a slight dig at President Barack Obama -- or at least a way of differentiating herself -- she added, ""and what the candidate brings to the table in terms of being able to not only present the agenda but have a very specific set of plans of implanting the agenda and bringing the country along."" Candidate Obama, of course, was viewed by critics as a powerful speaker with less experience and less of a vision to implement, and Clinton could be playing on buyer's remorse. But the tests she might face on the left and the right were in play this week. Clinton on possible presidency . She didn't veer far to the left in her remarks before the wonky liberal crowd at the St. Regis in Washington for the Center for American Progress gathering, but her presence was notable. CNN contributor Ron Brownstein cautioned that if she faces a challenge in a Democratic primary, it's likely to be from the liberal left. ""It is very hard to imagine somebody beating Hillary Clinton from the center of the party,"" he said. ""If there is going to be anybody who could even give her a tough time, it would be somebody coming from more of a fringe of the party, something kind of a tangent of the party -- either a generational argument or a populist argument."" Brownstein specifically mentioned Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has become a hero to the populist wing of the party, as a potential challenge to Clinton. How long can Hillary wait? And yet, advantages come for politicians who are considered overwhelming frontrunners like Clinton. Just this week, liberal billionaire George Soros said he's jumping on the bandwagon to draft Clinton into the 2016 race by becoming a co-chair of the ""Ready for Hillary"" super PAC's finance team. Even though Clinton is not exactly lining up donors and bundlers for her own campaign just yet, the commitment to her is a significant one in what could be a quest to sew up her left flank. But she'll have other issues on the right, if she reaches the general election. On Wednesday, a protestor in Buffalo heckled her over the biggest black mark on her record, the death of four Americans at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, during her tenure as Secretary of State. Democrats and Republicans alike say it could be her biggest weakness if she becomes her party's nominee. ""Benghazi. You let them die,"" the protestor said. And that weakness leads some to wonder why Clinton is sticking her neck out so far so soon. Brownstein said he's surprised by how visible and vocal she's been this fall. ""I think a lot of people thought that she would basically go under the radar for as long as possible to stay out of the fray, kind of shorten the race,"" he said. ""So it is a somewhat different strategy -- maybe they are trying to sort of avoid the sense that she is kind of an imperial candidate who believes that this is hers by birthright or succession."" Opinion: Hillary, don't run for president .","Hillary Clinton has made a series of public appearances in the past week .
Moves are fueling the speculation of a possible White House bid in 2016 .

"Watching the season 4 premiere of The Walking Dead, it was easy to imagine you had fallen into a Rick Grimes-esque coma and missed a few shows. When did Andrew Lincoln's much-tortured cop become so handy with a hoe? When was David Morrissey's depth perception-challenged maniac The Governor going to make an appearance? And, perhaps most bewilderingly, when did it become okay for Carol to call Daryl ""Pookie""? To address these questions — and many more! — we spoke with Walking Dead comic writer and Walking Dead TV show executive producer Robert Kirkman. Entertainment Weekly: How much time has gone by in-between the end of season 3 and the start of season 4? Robert Kirkman: We say ""a few months."" Some people think a few is two, some people think a few is three. It's a vague answer. EW: What's up with Rick and the gardening? Kirkman: Well, we like to change things up. I have to say that is my favorite opening of any season thus far — just the fact that it's the Walking Dead but it's about a guy who comes out and starts hoeing a garden. I was thrilled about that from the moment that (Walking Dead showrunner) Scott Gimple suggested it. We always like coming in and showing that there's been a passage of time and these aren't the exact same characters that we last saw. I've always been willing to push the envelope with that. I feel that's a really cool thing to do, to come in and reintroduce the show to people, and set the stage for all the new things that are going to be coming. The fact that every season of the Walking Dead has been somewhat different thematically has been a really cool evolution and is something we hope to continue every season. EW: What would you say is this season's theme? Kirkman: It's a lot of what comes from that woman [in the woods] in the first episode: It's ""Aren't these people too far gone?"" And ""Can these people retain a little bit of humanity?"" We're going to be dealing with those questions a lot more intensely than we have thus far on the show. It's all about Rick coming from this place where he kind of went off the deep end in season 3. Rick feels like he failed at everything he was trying to do and so this is him trying a different path and seeing if he can make that work. EW: Maybe this a foolish thing to say based on having just seen the premiere. But this was the first ever Walking Dead show I couldn't at least roughly place in the chronology of the comic. Have you made a decisive break with that mythology? Kirkman: There's a lot of new elements at play here but we're definitely still dealing with a lot of things from the comic book. You'll see, starting with the second episode, there's some very big moments from the comic book that are being worked in in a different way. There will always be moments where you're like, ""Oh, that's exactly like the comic book!"" A lot of that stuff is coming up in future episodes. EW: I'm not a doctor — I just play one on TV — but I'm assuming there's some sort of nasty, swine flu-type virus abroad in the prison. Kirkman: Well, it's definitely some kind of nasty illness. Something that can make a guy go from cough-cough-I'm-not-feeling-well-can-I-go-lay-down? to essentially bleeding out in the shower after a few hours is  something on the swine flu level — possibly a little bit more deadly. EW: And that kid Patrick coughed all over the water supply! Kirkman: Well, that shower water supply is fairly contained. That's like a bag that they fill up. I don't know how this works, I'm getting a little too technical here. All the water is contaminated! It's very dangerous! Be careful! EW: What did you name your family pig when you were a child? Kirkman: [Laughs] I find it offensive that you think because I'm from Kentucky I grew up with pigs. But ""Samuel"" is the answer. EW: Presumably Michonne is hunting the Governor, right? Kirkman: Yes, that is who she is after. The story there is that, after the events of season 3 and the death of Andrea, Michonnne and Daryl spent some time out in the wilderness looking for the Governor and eventually Daryl decided, ""Look, this is a futile effort and we're not going to find this person."" And Michonne kept it up. EW: She's heading to Macon. Is there any chance of her catching an Allman Brothers Band show while she's there? Kirkman: We can only hope that they are still performing shows. If that's where the Governor is and that's what she's doing I don't know how Michonne's going to handle that. She's gonna want to watch the show, she's gonna want to get revenge. She'll be be torn. EW: Here's a question you're not going to answer: How long before we see the Governor? Kirkman: [Laughs] Is this the question your boss makes you ask? EW: No one's the boss of me! Kirkman: He's definitely going to appear at some point this season. It's possible there are elements of his return that have already been set up in some ways you might not have noticed. But when he returns it will be at a time when you least expect it. EW: Is Woodbury now a ghost town? Kirkman: That will be dealt with in an upcoming episode. EW: The zombie hanging from the store ceiling by his intestines was a very nice touch. Kirkman: Look, if they ever need to rappel down something they're able to do that. EW: On the other hand, I'm not very happy with anyone referring to Daryl as ""Pookie."" Kirkman: [Laughs] Yeah, Norman asked for that. He makes everyone on set call him Pookie. We worked that into the show. EW: Judging from the premiere, I got the impression you will be exploring the character of Beth more this season than you have done previously. Kirkman: I think that to a certain extent we will be exploring all characters more than we have. This show has been doing a lot of world-building for the first three seasons. Now that we've got that out of the way, this season we're going to be intensely focused on the characters themselves. You'll learn a lot more about Beth, you'll learn a lot more about Daryl, you'll learn a lot more about Rick. We're going to be doing a lot of character work this season. EW: You're both world-building and empire-building. What's the status of the Walking Dead spin-off show? Kirkman: It's currently, quote unquote, ""in development"" so there's not really a lot to say about that. But I can say that it's going to be awesome!

"An alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania pleaded not guilty Tuesday to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York. As Abu Anas al Libi walked into court to face the charges, his hands were shackled, his hair was short, and he sported a red, bushy beard, graying around his face and chin. He moved slowly and appeared unsteady. He told the court he was 49, but he looked 10 to 15 years older. His family told CNN he suffers from hepatitis C. Judge Lewis Kaplan signed a medical order for care. Wearing gray sweatpants, a black, long-sleeved shirt and black flip-flops with beige socks, al Libi walked from the holding area into the stately wood-paneled courtroom. In response to a question from Kaplan, al Libi said he preferred to be addressed by his proper name, Nazih Abdul Hamed al Ruqai. Abu Anas al Libi is the name he was known by within al Qaeda. Al Libi means ""from Libya."" Who are the world's 10 most dangerous terrorists? Al Libi answered the few questions posed to him by Kaplan through a translator. ""Yes,"" he said, he understood the charges against him; and ""No, I can't,"" he said, when asked if he could afford a lawyer. He will be appointed a Criminal Justice Act attorney trained in handling federal terrorism cases. He is being held without bail, since Kaplan agreed with prosecutors that he poses a flight risk and is a danger the community. That lawyer, David Patton, issued a statement Tuesday stressing that ""the presumption of innocence is not a small technicality here."" Patton notes his client is mentioned in the 150-page indictment ""in a mere three paragraphs relating to conduct in 1993 and 1994 and nothing since."" In those paragraphs, authorities allege al Libi met with al Qaeda members about bombing the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, which ended up happening five years later in 1998. ""There is no allegation that he had any connection to al Qaeda after 1994,"" Patton said, ""and he is eager to move forward with the legal process in this case."" U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers seized him on October 5 from outside his house in Tripoli, Libya. U.S. officials say he was taken initially to a Navy ship for questioning before he was brought to the United States over the weekend. Prosecutors say he worked as a senior aide to Osama bin Laden during al Qaeda's formative years. Among the charges, he is accused of taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in preparation for the attack. A truck bomb detonated, destroying a nearby building and killing more than 200 people, among them a handful of embassy employees. A second coordinated attack on the U.S. Embassy in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, took place at virtually the same time on August 7,1998, killing embassy personnel there. His arrival in the U.S. has reopened a debate over whether international terrorist suspects should be tried in U.S. courts. U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was ""unfortunate"" that al Libi was on U.S. soil. ""It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try in the U.S., because once you arrive on U.S. soil, that ends the interrogation of these high-value detainees,"" King said. He added that that wouldn't have happened had al Libi been sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and faced a military commission there. Wife: Captured 'most wanted terrorist' al Libi had left al Qaeda . U.S. or military court . President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try people such as al Libi in American courts. In 2009, Holder said five detainees with alleged ties to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks would be transferred from Guantanamo Bay to New York for trial in civilian court. Holder then reversed course, announcing that accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others would be tried by a military commission at Guantanamo. Al Libi was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week that there was no chance that al Libi would end up at Guantanamo. ""The administration's position on Guantanamo is clear: Our goal is not to add to the population, it's to reduce it, which we've done,"" she said. ""Our policy is not to send any new detainees to Guantanamo."" What the terror raids say about an 'Obama Doctrine' Family wants a lawyer . Al Libi's family members said they had received no news about him from the U.S. or Libyan governments and were shocked to learn that he had arrived in the United States. His son, Abdullah, said the family hoped to get a lawyer who would ""work with him, for him."" ""We don't want him talking to just anyone,"" Abdullah said. ""We don't want just any lawyer asking him questions."" Some terrorism experts have questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide. A former jihadist associate told CNN last week that it was unlikely that he still had an active role with the terrorist network. His wife said he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan Oil Ministry. A U.S. official said al Libi received care at a medical facility in New York for a pre-existing medical condition and is ""doing better."" The official did not detail the medical issue. His wife told CNN this month that al Libi has a severe case of hepatitis C and that she was worried about his health. The Libyan government has protested that it hasn't been able to see al Libi yet, in accordance with international law that allows countries to stay in contact with their citizens who are accused of a crime in a foreign nation. A senior Obama administration official said it wasn't possible to give Libya consular access to al Libi until he had arrived in the United States. ""We have every intention of allowing this; it just hasn't happened yet,"" the official said.

Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga laid a wreath at the memorial site, at the spot where the embassy building used to stand.

A decade later, many victims say the U.S. government owes them compensation. The U.S. Congress allocated $40 million to rebuild parts of Nairobi and provide ""humanitarian assistance"" to victims, but no financial compensation.

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian military intelligence used the Red Cross emblem in a rescue operation in which leftist guerrillas were duped into handing over 15 hostages, according to unpublished photographs and video viewed by CNN. What seems to be part of a red cross is seen on a bib worn by a man involved in the rescue in this official image. Photographs of the Colombian military intelligence-led team that spearheaded the rescue, shown to CNN by a confidential military source, show one man wearing a bib with the Red Cross symbol. The military source said the three photos were taken moments before the mission took off to persuade the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  rebels to release the hostages to a supposed international aid group for transport to another rebel area. Such a use of the Red Cross emblem could constitute a ""war crime"" under the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law and could endanger humanitarian workers in the future, according to international legal expert Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association. ""It is clear that the conventions are very strict regarding use of the symbol because of what it represents: impartiality, neutrality. The fear is that any misuse of the symbol would weaken that neutrality and would weaken the [Red Cross],"" Ellis said. Watch possible misuse of emblem » . ""If you use the emblem in a deceitful way, generally the conventions say it would be a breach. [Based on the information as explained to me,] the way that the images show the Red Cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime, "" he added. The unpublished video and photos of the mission, hailed internationally as a daring success, were shown to CNN by a military source looking to sell the material. CNN declined to buy the material at the price being asked; it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and his top generals have categorically denied that international humanitarian symbols were used in the July 2 rescue mission that freed the prized hostages, who included former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and soldiers. The hostages had endured years of harsh captivity and deprivation in jungle camps since being captured or kidnapped. Some were held for as long as 10 years. The rescue ruse also included bogus communications, sent electronically and by human couriers, to convince FARC rebels that superiors were ordering them to hand over hostages to the group posing as aid workers for transfer to another rebel camp. On Monday, government and military spokesmen reiterated that all logos and emblems used in the operation had been invented and that no genuine symbols had been used. Misuse of the Red Cross emblem is governed by articles 37, 38 and 85 of Additional Protocol One to the Geneva Conventions, the international rules of war. The articles prohibit ""feigning of protected status by the use of ... emblems"" of neutral parties and say that such misuses are considered breaches of international humanitarian law that qualify as a ""war crime."" Colombia signed the Geneva Conventions in 1949. That prohibition was put in place to protect the neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations in an armed conflict and to guarantee their access to all sides. Use of those emblems by one side of a conflict, for example, could endanger aid workers because those on another side might no longer trust that symbols they see really represent those humanitarian organizations. An ICRC spokesman in Bogota said the organization had been in ""an ongoing confidential dialogue"" with the Colombian government about the report that the emblem may have been used in the operation. Among the photos shown to CNN are some bearing a date stamp of July 2, taken at an unidentified landing site in the jungle alongside a farm house. In one of those photographs, about 15 members of a Colombian military intelligence-led team pose for a photo alongside a helicopter. One of the members, dressed in a dark red T-shirt or polo shirt, khaki cargo pants and a black-and-white Arab-style scarf, also wears a bib of the type worn by Red Cross workers. The bib bears the Red Cross symbol in the center of two black circles on a white background. In the space between the two black circles appear in capital letters the French words ""Comite International Geneve"" (International Committee Geneva). The same man is standing in the doorway of the helicopter, a Russian-made MI-17 painted white and orange, in another photo. In a third photo, he is pictured walking near the helicopter still wearing the bib. The same man pictured in the photos can be seen fleetingly in a heavily edited video of the rescue mission issued to the media by the Defense Ministry two days after the hostages were freed. In one frame, part of what appears to be the Red Cross bib is visible as the man wearing it stands in a jungle clearing alongside guerrilla commanders Gerardo Antonio Aguilar, alias Cesar, and Alexander Farfan, known as Enrique Gafas, who were captured in the operation. The red blur of a Red Cross can be seen and part of the two black circles of the emblem and the capital letters ""EVE"". Those are also the last three letters of word Geneve (Geneva), which appears on the official ICRC emblem and bib. In two other frames of the officially released video, the same man, dressed in the same clothes as in the pre-departure photos, can be seen still wearing the predominantly white bib tied at the sides. In those shots the ICRC logo is not visible. The unpublished video also reveals an emblem that bears the Spanish words ""Mision Internacional Humanitaria"" (International Humanitarian Mission) and a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two curved branches of blue leaves. In the 3½-minute video of the operation issued by the military, emblems pasted on the side of the rescue helicopter cannot be seen. But in the unpublished video and photos shown to CNN, emblems measuring about one square meter (one square yard) are pasted onto the outside of the chopper. The same emblem appears on the Web site for Mision Internacional Humanitaria, which describes itself as a non-governmental organization based in Barcelona, Spain, that ""works to improve the processes of development to guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals and peoples."" Although the site says the group is registered with the Spanish Interior Ministry and the regional Department of Justice, the site is littered with misspellings, and the telephone number that's listed is 000000000. CNN was unable to contact the group to verify its existence. The group's Web site could not be accessed early Tuesday. Additional video clips show how the emblems on the side of the helicopter were stripped off and burned once the rescue mission had been completed. The fate of the bib is not clear from the clips. In a brief statement Monday, the media spokesman for the Red Cross mission in Bogota reiterated that the group had not been officially involved in the rescue operation. ""The International Committee of the Red Cross cannot confirm that its logo and/or the Red Cross emblem were used,"" the spokesman said. ""The ICRC maintains an ongoing confidential dialogue with the Colombian authorities on a variety of humanitarian issues, including news reports that the Red Cross emblem may have been used in this operation."" Uribe, Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, armed forces chief Gen. Freddy Padilla and army chief Gen. Mario Montoya all categorically stated immediately after the rescue operation that no genuine international humanitarian emblems had been used or misused. In a nationally televised news conference, Uribe asked Betancourt whether she had seen any emblems on the helicopter that came to pick her and the other hostages up. She replied that she had not and that the lack of markings had puzzled her. ""After all these years of guerrilla war, we have become experts in identifying who is before us,"" she answered. ""That's why I said it was very strange to me. I said, 'Well, what is this? A helicopter, a white helicopter. Red Cross? No. France? No.' There was no flag. There was nothing; there was no sign anywhere."" In the official video released by the military, the man wearing what appeared to be a Red Cross bib is standing alongside Betancourt and another rescued hostage just before they board the rescue helicopter. That is in the part of the video in which the logo is blurred and not readily identifiable. Both of Colombia's two main guerrilla armies, the FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army, have been known to misuse the Red Cross symbol, sometimes transporting fighters in ambulances. The Colombian government frequently makes international denunciations of rebel violations of international humanitarian law. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world are highly respected international and national organizations, especially for their work in combat zones. Their statutes establish a position of strict neutrality in a conflict, which guarantees their ability to bring humanitarian aid to all sides in a conflict. Other national and international aid organizations do not have such strict rules on neutrality and operating procedures. International humanitarian law, partly enshrined in the Geneva Conventions, is seen as a systematic attempt to establish certain rules of war and limit the savagery of conflict. The laws seek to set clear distinctions between warring factions, neutral parties and civilians and what rights and responsibilities each of these has in a combat zone. Additional Protocol One and the articles referring to the misuse of international emblems technically refers to international armed conflicts. But signatory nations as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross also consider it a benchmark for internal conflicts, such as the four-decade-old war in Colombia. Other photos shown to CNN indicate how little was done to disguise equipment used in the rescue. The two military MI-17 helicopters used in the rescue were repainted white and orange without removing armor-plated panels positioned around the outside of the cockpit. Another shot shows the pilots wearing what appear to be military pilots' helmets that have been repainted white with orange or red V-shaped stripes. The helmets still have prominent mounts on the front used for attaching night vision goggles. One other video clip shows the two guerrilla commanders, who had boarded the helicopter with their hostages, carried out of the chopper over the shoulders of two men the CNN source identified as plain-clothes military personnel. The rebels were blindfolded and partially stripped. As they were dumped on the ground, they appeared groggy and stunned. Before the departure of the operation, two soldiers in camouflage uniforms can be seen on the farm where the helicopters were staged, chasing a chicken and stunning it with a stun gun.","Photos from miltary source show man wearing bib with Red Cross logo .

"(CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reversed plans Wednesday to hold a test vote on an automakers' bailout bill on Thursday. Reid had planned to move on legislation that would have taken $25 billion from the $700 billion already approved for Wall Street and diverted it to the big three automakers. Filmmaker Michael Moore says the collapse of General Motors could mean the loss of millions of jobs. CNN's Larry King talked Wednesday with Michael Moore, a filmmaker with deep ties to the auto industry. Moore's father worked for General Motors for 35 years. In 1989, Moore became an international figure for his film, ""Roger and Me,"" which centered on the declining auto industry in his hometown of Flint, Michigan and the ripple effect on the town's residents. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Michael, was (the movie) prophetic? Michael Moore: When I made that film, there were still 50,000 people working at General Motors in Flint. I mean they had eliminated 30,000 jobs, but there were still some jobs there. Today, I think there's less than 12,000 working in the area, so it has devastated Flint. Flint was one of the first towns to go. When I made that movie almost 20 years ago, I hoped that the film would be a warning to other cities that this corporation was intent upon removing jobs from this country and taking them to Mexico and Brazil and other places. When I made that movie that year, General Motors made a profit of over $4 billion, and they were still laying off people simply to make a bit more money, the people who helped to build the company, the workers in their hometown of Flint, Michigan, they just forgot about them and took the money and ran. King: Since the principle was, 'We'll have the cars built elsewhere and many of the cars are built elsewhere now,' what went wrong if they were paying less out of the country to build them? Moore: Well, what really went wrong is that General Motors has had this philosophy from the beginning that what's good for General Motors is good for the country. So, their attitude was we'll build it and you buy it. We'll tell you what to buy. You just buy it. Eventually, the consumer got smart and said, 'You know what, I'd like a car that gets a little better gas mileage. I'd like a car that's safer on the road,' so they started to buy other cars. General Motors still wouldn't change. They still kept building the wrong cars, and more and more people stopped buying them.  Watch how Moore feels about auto bailout » . At a certain point, you know, General Motors lost such a large part of the market share that there probably was a point of no return. Now, here we are on the verge of this collapse. If General Motors collapses, then there goes hundreds of thousands of jobs, if not millions of jobs of the ripple effect of this. King: And the same is true of Ford and Chrysler? Moore: Absolutely. I'll tell you, it was hilarious just watching these CEOs there (Tuesday) and (Wednesday) testifying in Congress, saying that, you know, that the problem wasn't theirs, you know, the cars they were building. It was the financial situation that we're in now.  Watch automakers get grilled on Capitol Hill » . The problem is the cars they've been building. They've never listened to the consumers. They've just gone about it their own wrong way. I'll tell you, you know, I'm of mixed mind about this bailout, Larry, because I don't think these companies, with these management people, should be given a dime, because  that's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries. GM is currently building a $300 million factory in Russia right now to build SUVs, right outside of St. Petersburg. That's where your money's going to go, no matter what they say. King: Why (do you have) mixed feelings? Moore: Well, because we can't let all these people lose their jobs because of the bad decisions, the stupid decisions made by the management of these auto companies. I think what has to happen here is that Congress needs to pass some legislation, and our president-elect needs to do what Roosevelt did. When Roosevelt came in and when World War II faced the country, Roosevelt said to General Motors and Ford, you're not going to build cars anymore. You're going to build airplanes and tanks and guns and the things that we need for this war because we have a national crisis. General Motors had to do what Roosevelt told them they had to do. King: What do you want them to do now? Moore: President-Elect Obama has to say to them, yes, we're going to use this money to save these jobs, but we're not going to build these gas-guzzling, unsafe vehicles any longer. We're going to put the companies into some sort of receivership and we, the government, are going to hold the reigns on these companies. They're to build mass transit. They're to build hybrid cars. They're to build cars that use little or no gasoline. iReport.com: New emissions standards, other improvements needed . We're facing a national crisis, not just an economic crisis, but a crisis of the polar ice caps are melting. There's only so much oil left under the Earth. We're going to run out of that, if not in our children's time, our grandchildren's time. There's got to be a plan set out to find other ways to transport ourselves in other ways than using fossil fuels.","Michael Moore: Automakers ""took money and ran""

"On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration released its ""Road Map"" to integrate drones into civilian airspace by 2015, and it provoked strong reactions from privacy advocates. I've been a vocal critic against the creation of lethally autonomous combat drones, so you might expect I'd be concerned about the vague civilian privacy protections the FAA proposed for their six domestic drone test sites. But actually I think their approach is a good one. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta rightly pointed out that his organization is focused on maintaining aviation safety and not proposing new privacy regulations. The 74-page FAA civilian drone road map focuses a lot on developing ""sense and avoid"" technology to enable civilian drones to operate safely in skies already crowded with manned aircraft. But each of the test sites will come up with its own drone privacy policies and make them public, to (as the FAA put it) ""help inform the dialogue."" Consider that last statement the starting gun for what promises to be a vociferous and active debate on robotic vehicles in an open society. This is a debate that needs to happen, and with the FAA establishing these six ""sand boxes"" in which to practice various drone privacy approaches, we'll see the good, the bad and the just plain ugly well before regulations are more widely adopted. That might sound messy, but this is how an open society should ingest revolutionary technologies -- by arguing like hell about them. And make no mistake, there will be a constituency speaking on behalf of drones. That's because in the next three years, civilian drones -- that is Unmanned Aerial Systems -- could be a $10 billion industry (with part of that presumably spent on public relations). And on both sides of this struggle, the first combatants will be legions of lawyers arguing drone law and establishing legal precedents in local, state and federal courts. This has happened before. Few will remember that at the birth of aviation, property laws were such that landowners owned the air above their heads, too-- theoretically all the way up into space. And landowners were not happy with the idea of aircraft noisily ""trespassing"" over their property, and yet it was difficult for aviators to fly only over public right-of-ways, especially in poor weather conditions. What followed were legal battles, with one railroad trying to stop rival airmail by claiming ""aerial trespass"" if aviators followed their rail lines. There was aviation litigation about wrongful deaths, noise pollution, canceled flights, air crew working conditions, deferred maintenance, etc. Eventually all that debate, legal precedent and working knowledge was boiled down into a regulatory framework that became the Federal Aviation Administration. Few would argue that FAA regulation has harmed the aviation industry or society. Just ask yourself if you'd be willing to step on an unregulated commercial aircraft. I thought so. Those regulations made a level playing field for airlines and allowed the entire industry to prosper while simultaneously benefiting the public. But getting there wasn't pretty. And so it will be with civilian drones. It will take the passionate debate of civil rights activists, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, aerospace engineers, farmers, environmentalists, ethicists and many more for society to arrive at a stable legal framework to safely and equitably integrate robotic aviation and autonomous vehicles into our society. There is no agency or bureau that will do this for us, and these are thorny issues. For every privacy activist I agree with on the subject of drones, there is also someone with a compelling vision of how they could be used for good, such as entrepreneurs who envision precision agriculture drones that could reduce pesticide use through surgically precise and infinitely patient ministering to crops. Agriculture alone could represent 80% of the civilian drone industry. And as one drone industry executive put it: ""corn doesn't mind if you watch it."" In case you missed the starting gun for the civilian drone privacy debate, it's just been sounded.","Daniel Suarez: FAA releases road map for drones in civilian airspace by 2015 .

"A magnified image of marine plankton has won a prestigious international photography contest for tiny works that exist, in the words of the winning photographer, in the ""limbo between art and science."" Wim van Egmond, a freelance photographer from the Netherlands, took the top prize in the annual Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition, for his magnified image of marine plankton. It was the 11th year he had entered the contest, which draws entries from professional photographers as well as scientists, who generally produce the images in the course of their work. The winning entries are judged on their scientific and artistic merits. PHOTOS: See high-res gallery of Nikon contest winners . ""For 20 years, I've been looking through a microscope, and every time I see things I haven't seen before,"" said van Egmond, who has had 19 images recognized as finalists in the competition over the past decade. ""It's such an endless world -- there are so many species and so many different life stages of these organisms. It's all so strange and wonderful that it's become a bit of an addiction."" The view through the microscope was like ""exploring a different world, or exploring space, with these strange unknown organisms,"" he said. Recognized as one of the contest's top photomicrographers, Van Egmond runs a website devoted to photomicrography called the Micropolitan Museum. He said he approached his subjects as if he were producing a portrait, trying to ""capture their personalities."" ""I don't invent things, I try to make it as naturalistic as possible, but these organisms are such a strange shape that it almost looks like an abstract painting,"" he said. ""You don't have to make much of an effort to make something that is weird."" He had long been intrigued by the Chaetoceros debilis, a plant-like plankton with a corkscrew form and bristles. ""It's very hard to capture because it's so 3-dimensional and so fragile. It was a bit of a challenge to make a good portrait of the organism."" The winning entry was created using software to combine various images focusing on different areas of the plankton. ""The difficulty of microscopy is that when you have a ... magnification of an image, you have hardly any depth of field,"" he said. By combining images where some areas were in focus and others were blurred, he could create a 3-dimensional effect, he said. Previous entries in the contest, now in its 39th year, have included a mosquito's heart, a flea's head, and a pregnant aphid.

"A top Virginia politician lay in a Charlottesville hospital with multiple stab wounds Tuesday evening after what state police called a fight with his son, who appears to have killed himself shortly afterward. A cousin found state Sen. Creigh Deeds, the 2009 Democratic nominee for governor, walking down a road near his home Tuesday morning, bleeding from multiple stab wounds to his head and chest, state police reported. State troopers who came to Deeds' home in Millboro, about 150 miles west of Richmond, then found 24-year-old Austin ""Gus"" Deeds with a gunshot wound, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said. The troopers were unable to save him. ""Based on the evidence we have, we are looking at this as an attempted murder and suicide,"" Geller told reporters Tuesday afternoon. No one else was in the house at the time of the altercation, and investigators are not seeking any other suspects, she said. Deeds' cousin called 911 and took the senator to a nearby farm, where a helicopter airlifted him to the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, Geller said. His condition was upgraded from critical to fair Tuesday afternoon, spokeswoman Angela Taylor said. The senator was able to talk with investigators before he was flown to the hospital and afterward, Geller said. CNN affiliate WTVR: Deeds stabbed multiple times . Deeds, 55, is well known in Virginia political circles. A Democrat, he ran for attorney general in 2005 and for governor in 2009, both times against Republican Bob McDonnell, who is now Virginia's governor. Gus Deeds withdrew from The College of William & Mary last month after being enrolled off-and-on since 2007, according to a statement from the school. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that he had been given a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order Monday but was released because no psychiatric bed could be located across a wide area of western Virginia, Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, told the newspaper. Geller said she was unable to comment on that report, citing medical privacy laws. ""Obviously, the motive and the absolute circumstances that led up to this altercation is still very much the focus of this investigation,"" she said. In a statement issued to other news organizations later, Cropper said he could not comment on a specific case. But he said that if a patient is brought in under an emergency custody order, they can be held for four hours for an examination -- and if a doctor determines they need to be hospitalized, a bed has to be lined up within that period. ""In certain conditions, a two-hour extension is granted by a magistrate, but under no circumstances can a person be held beyond six hours involuntarily under an ECO (emergency custody order),"" Cropper said. ""We ask that the community respect the family's privacy while they grieve the loss of their son and brother."" CNN affiliate WSLS: Updates on Deeds after stabbing . Friend says family was trying to find help . Cory Jessee, who attended high school and college with Gus Deeds, said it was common knowledge that the family was trying to get the senator's son help. ""He took a semester off to help his dad in the campaign. Then he came back to school, and he was pretty happy to be back in school,"" Jessee said. ""I didn't know the details of his illness, but he seemed on the right side of it."" Jessee also dismissed any suggestion that Gus Deeds had an alcohol problem despite reports that he had been arrested on a misdemeanor charge of underage alcohol possession in 2009. ""There was a party at someone's house. He was one of a dozen kids who got a citation for drinking,"" Jessee said, adding the incident was ""blown out of proportion."" Democratic state Sen. Chap Petersen, who has known the Deeds family for more than 15 years, said Deeds ""had a lot of concerns about his son."" ""Just issues of dropping out of school and things of that nature,"" Petersen said. Deeds had moved his son in with him in recent months. ""That was a conscious choice to help his son get back on his feet, to get some stability in his life. I just know that Creigh made a commitment to his son in that way,"" Petersen said. ""... As shocking as these events are today, the pieces kind of come into place now that we know a little bit more about the history."" Virginia politicians react to stabbing . McDonnell, the governor, called Tuesday's events ""heartbreaking."" ""In this tough and sad time, our thoughts and prayers are with the Deeds family. The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,"" he said. ""Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service. He cares deeply about Virginia, and the people of Virginia care deeply for him."" And in a post on Twitter, Virginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe --  who lost the Democratic nomination to Deeds in 2009 -- said he and his wife, Dorothy, ""are praying for the Deeds family at this difficult time."" Also via Twitter, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner called the report ""stunning news."" ""I am praying for @CreighDeeds and his family at this very, very difficult time,"" he tweeted.

"Reactions to the drowning of nearly 400 migrants in the seas off Lampedusa and Malta earlier this month demonstrate three important reasons why Europe will not resolve its immigration crisis any time soon. First, the polarization of public, media, and political reaction has been striking. For some these were humanitarian tragedies, made all the more harrowing by dramatic language about divers 'unpacking a wall of bodies' in a trawler's hull, and the Mediterranean becoming  a ""watery graveyard.""  For others in contrast they represent a failure of border security that jeopardizes the integrity of the EU and is a harbinger for mass uncontrolled migration. INFOGRAPHIC: How illegal immigrants enter the EU . The policy responses that flow from these conclusions are equally divided. There is a strong case to strengthen border controls. But an equally convincing argument is that more restrictive policies will only narrow options for desperate people and drive more of them into the arms of migrant smugglers and traffickers. The former is clearly the predominant view among most policy-makers in Europe. Friday's Summit of the European Council in Brussels, while acknowledging the need to provide more development aid to some of the countries migrants are leaving, has mainly emphasized stepping up surveillance and sea patrols through the EU's Frontex border patrol agency. But experience around the world demonstrates that border control is not a silver bullet. A portfolio of policies is required to reduce irregular migration, certainly including border control, but combined with addressing the root causes of conflict and poverty, combating smuggling and trafficking, effective migration management and return, and the regulation of labor markets. Second, the capsizing has also exposed deep divides within the European Union. Countries on the front-line -- especially Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, and Spain -- are calling for the rest of Europe to share out the burden of asylum seekers and irregular migrants who arrive there by sea, by relocating some of them at least temporarily. But this challenges a fundamental EU law, the Dublin Regulation, which determines that dealing with asylum requests is the responsibility of the first EU state through which asylum seekers pass. And countries like France, Germany, and the UK, point out that they already receive the lion's share of asylum applications in Europe. As a result they have indicated a willingness to support capacity-building in states on the southern periphery, and to provide them limited financial assistance, but not to accept more migrants. OPINION: Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning . In the absence of a coordinated EU approach, migrants -- and their smugglers -- will continue to target countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain as entry points; they will remain clandestine even if they may have a strong asylum claim; they will continue to work in the informal labor market or turn to crime to survive; and their rights will not be recognized or respected. Third, the response to Lampedusa in particular could be described as an over-reaction in this sense: At least 1,500 people drowned or went missing while attempting to reach Europe via the Mediterranean in 2011, according to the U.N. The only unusual aspect is that large numbers died in the same incident in Lampedusa, and that they drowned close to European shores. In other words while a one-off event has attracted attention, the systemic problem has been largely ignored. Now that the funerals have taken place the deaths are fading from view, and the issue has become quickly sidelined. OPINION: EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize . Indeed the Brussels Summit has put off policy decisions on immigration to the forthcoming December 2013 and June 2014 Summits. The reasons are clear. Immigration has become a toxic political issue; especially as high levels of unemployment and the economic crisis have fuelled a growing anti-immigration sentiment across Europe. The downside of making policy on immigration in this environment strongly outweighs the upside. There is no political space to promote liberal policies on migration; while politicians at least behind closed doors know that restrictive policies are unlikely to work. On Friday Italian authorities reported that they have intercepted as many as 800 migrants on three separate boats in the Mediterranean. OPINION: What's the place of outsiders in Europe? An acute crisis in Eritrea, from where many of those who drowned earlier this month and have been intercepted since came; combines with chronic instability and poverty in many sub-Saharan African countries, unpredictable transitions in North Africa, and the unfolding Syrian disaster, to translate into growing pressure on Europe's borders. In the not-too-distant future Afghanistan's transition is likely to push even more people towards Europe. And in the longer term disparities in development, demography, and democracy, as well as the effects of climate change, will drive still more migrants into Europe. In the absence of a reasoned debate, a comprehensive policy response, a coordinated EU approach, and the political courage to confront irregular migration, Europe's immigration nightmare has only just begun.","Deaths of more than 300 migrants near Italy in early October put immigration in spotlight .

"A cache of 1,500 works of art -- including masterpieces by Picasso, Matisse and Chagall -- confiscated by the Nazis and missing for more than 70 years has been found in Germany, according to German media reports. The huge haul of paintings, estimated to be worth more than $1 billion, was discovered in an apartment in Munich in the spring of 2011 during a raid by Bavarian tax authorities, but its existence has only just come to light with an article in the German news magazine Focus. The collection is said to include works by Modernist masters Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka, Franz Marc, Max Beckmann, Emil Nolde and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, many of which had been believed destroyed during World War II. Focus reports that the pictures were found when customs police raided a rundown apartment in the Schwabing district of Munich during an investigation into suspected tax evasion. The recovered paintings are said to have been kept in storage in a secure warehouse in the city ever since. German authorities have refused to confirm or deny any details relating to the discovery. Polish art stolen by Nazis repatriated . ""The German government is supporting the state prosecution in Augsburg by supplying advice from experts in the field of so-called degenerate art and the entire issue of Nazi-looted art,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. ""But we cannot comment any of the issues of the ongoing investigation."" The full extent of the find is expected to be revealed by art historian Meike Hoffmann, an expert on ""degenerate art"" from the Freie Universitaet Berlin, at a news conference in Augsburg on Tuesday. Thousands of pieces of art labeled ""degenerate"" by the Nazis were looted from private collections and confiscated from galleries during the 1930s and 1940s; other works were stolen from Jewish families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country. Many paintings remain missing decades later. Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register, said the discovery was ""very encouraging in some ways, but there are tens of thousands of these artworks still under dispute, so this is really just a drop in the ocean."" ""This case shows the extent of organised art robbery which occurred in museums and private collections,"" said Ruediger Mahlo, representative of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany. ""Private collections were almost all in Jewish possession."" Feds seize Nazi-plundered painting . The relatives of many of those families whose art collections were stolen are now waiting to find out whether their property forms part of the Munich treasure trove -- and whether they can get it back. ""We demand that the paintings be handed back to their original owners,"" Mahlo said. ""It cannot be that like in this case, a sort of moral handling of stolen goods is continued."" Radcliffe said improvements in technology and wider public knowledge about works looted by the Nazis mean the tide is turning against those in possession of stolen art. ""The risk/reward is going against them. It may have been far easier to do it decades ago, but as more databases are set up and there is an increasing focus on the Holocaust, there is less chance for anyone taking part in such transactions."" But art experts have questioned why it has taken so long for the Munich discovery to be revealed. Christopher Marinello of Art Recovery International said the details of the paintings should have been published online as soon as they were found ""so that the entire world could stake a claim."" ""We were told they they were worried about the number of claimants that would come forward, but two years is a long time to wait,"" he said. ""People died. Claimants of this era are in their 80s and 90s, and records are disappearing."" ""There seems to be a problem with transparency here,"" Mahlo said. ""The case was discovered in 2011; in 2013, it became public. The question is, what happened during those two years?""","Reports: 1,500 works of art found in raid by German tax authorities .

"The latest round of peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) remains the Turkish government's best bet not just to solve the country's 29-year old ""Kurdish problem"" but also to feed its energy-hungry population and wean it off costly and politically risky Russian and Iranian energy imports. To cope with a fast-growing economy and an increasing demand for energy, Turkey must ensure an adequate energy supply. So far, its power generation has largely relied on Russian and Iranian imports. The Syria crisis, however, has created a rift between Turkey and these energy suppliers, leaving the Turkish economy vulnerable to regional dynamics and price shocks. To fuel its growing economy and reduce its account deficit driven by high prices of oil and gas, Turkey has been scrambling to find alternative energy resources. To that end, the Turkish government has quietly been building up its energy presence in the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) oil and gas industry. On March 25, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani negotiated a framework deal that included Turkish stakes in exploration blocks and terms for the direct pipeline export of oil and gas from the KRG. The pipeline will allow Kurdish crude oil to be transported from the KRG directly into Turkey, bypassing Baghdad and setting up the KRG as a competitive supplier of oil to Turkey. In an effort to stave off political tension with Baghdad and Washington, the parties did not sign a government-to-government deal; instead, they turned the KRG energy portfolio over to public and private energy companies. In the spring of this year, Turkey established a state-backed firm to explore for oil and gas in northern Iraq. In January, Genel Energy, an Anglo-Turkish exploration and production company, was awarded the right to ship oil directly from the area. Since then, the company has been exporting crude oil from the KRG's Taq Taq fields to Turkey's Ceyhan port by truck. The amount of oil exported from Taq Taq will grow significantly when the construction of the pipeline is completed by the end of this year. The KRG's gas resources are even more appealing to Turkey. In 2012, Turkey's daily gas demand was 125 million cubic meters; this figure is likely to double this winter. As such, Turkey is expected to be one of Europe's biggest gas consumers in a decade. Kurdish gas is attractive to Turkey because the framework agreement between Turkey and the KRG includes specific terms on the price of gas. Turkey thus has leverage over pricing. Some experts have said the KRG's supplies could be three times cheaper than Russian and Iranian sources due to this leverage. This energy cooperation between the KRG and Turkey has been expanding rapidly. About a dozen Turkish companies have applied to Turkey's energy watchdog to obtain licenses to import gas from and construct oil pipelines in the KRG, and the KRG recently granted six Turkish companies permission to explore for oil. Last month, news leaked that a Turkish company was issued a license to import natural gas directly from the KRG. The Turkish state company Botas has also started construction of a gas pipeline from the KRG to Turkey's southeastern city of Mardin. Through this energy partnership, Turkey can secure an alternative low-cost supplier and realize Erdogan's goal of promoting Turkey as an energy hub, and the KRG can ensure its economic independence from Baghdad. But the success of the Turkey-KRG energy partnership hinges on the peaceful resolution of Turkey's Kurdish problem. The PKK has used pipeline attacks as a means of targeting Turkey's strategic assets. Until very recently, PKK attacks on pipelines knocked out oil and gas flows, forcing Turkey to buy Russian and Azeri gas at higher prices and keeping the Iraq-Turkey route mostly idle. In order to assure pipeline security and investment confidence, Turkey must finish what it started a year ago. In an effort to end three decades of fighting between Turkey and the PKK, Turkish intelligence started negotiations with the imprisoned PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in 2012. As part of settlement talks, the PKK declared a ceasefire in March 2013 and started its withdrawal from Turkey toward its camps in northern Iraq in May. No serious fighting has been reported since, but that could change. Last month, the PKK announced that it halted its pull-out as both sides accused each other of failing to respect their part of the deal. Late last month, the Turkish government unveiled a reform package that allows the use of Kurdish language in election campaigns, lifts restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language in private schools, abolishes the requirement to recite the pledge of allegiance that forced schoolchildren to declare that ""I am a Turk,"" and allows Kurdish towns to use their Kurdish names. For the Kurds, however, the reform package seems to only move forward halfway. Kurds have long asked for the right to public education in Kurdish, and the package only applies to private schools. The democratization package also does not offer concrete steps to address the Kurdish demand to lower the 10 per cent electoral threshold, which has mainly been used to keep pro-Kurdish parties out of parliament. After the announcement, the PKK warned that it may end the unilateral ceasefire. After a visit by Kurdish politicians to the prison island of Imrali where Ocalan has been held since 1999, the Kurdish leader also relayed a message asking the government to lay the legal groundwork to address all Kurdish demands or risk a breakdown in talks. But for the Turkish government, there is no easy way forward. With the 2014 local and presidential elections looming and no end in sight for the Syrian civil war, political uncertainty seems guaranteed. In the highly charged pre-election atmosphere, the Turkish government has to operate such that it does not alienate nationalists while at the same time keeps the peace process moving. Yet the bigger challenge facing Turkish decision-makers is the regional fallout from the war in Syria. Turkish media is reporting that in retaliation to Turkey's stance in Syria, Iranian intelligence has been talking to the PKK leadership in northern Iraq's Qandil Mountains to convince it to abandon the peace process, promising support for Kurdish demands for autonomy in northern Syria in return. For Turkey, the stakes are higher than ever. Finding a peaceful resolution to its Kurdish problem will not only remove a strategic vulnerability; it will also ensure a less costly and politically less risky energy alternative to Russia and Iran and will realize Erdogan's dream of making Turkey one of the world's ten largest economies by 2023—the hundredth anniversary of the Turkish Republic.","Syria's war has created rift between Turkey and energy suppliers Iran and Russia .

"Arne Duncan, the U.S. secretary of education, set off a firestorm last week when he suggested that most of the opposition to the Common Core State Standards for education was coming from ""white suburban moms"" who have suddenly discovered from standardized test results that their children aren't as ""brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn't quite as good"" as they thought it was. Duncan later apologized for the remarks, made at the annual meeting of the Council of Chief State School Officers. But the damage was done.  Opponents of the Common Core academic standards seized on his remarks as a sign that the Obama administration was unwilling to acknowledge legitimate concerns about the standards and that it would insult anyone who criticized its education agenda. Unfortunately, the way Duncan framed his comments -- and the backlash they've created -- are just more distractions in what should be a serious conversation about the very real education problems we face, and about the role the Common Core might play in increasing rigor and improving opportunities for American students. Education Sec. Duncan under fire for comment about 'white suburban moms' I can't presume to know exactly what Duncan meant, but I suspect he was hinting at the notion that pushback from parents to reform driven by standards and accountability was fairly muted when those policies shined a spotlight on achievement gaps and the relative low achievement of our nation's most disadvantaged students. But it began to explode when test scores in states implementing Common Core-aligned tests showed that our typically high-performing students were also failing to meet expectations. The truth is that the backlash against the Common Core has grown strongest in areas where state tests results showed many previously ""proficient"" students failing to meet expectations. We've seen this most clearly in New York, where anti-Common Core sentiment reached a peak after the release of results from the latest state reading and math tests, which showed less than one-third of students across the state met grade-level expectations. The question, though, is not whether Duncan's comments were ill-advised -- they were -- or insulting. Focusing on his gaffe distracts us from the very real and important conversation we should be having about the educational challenges we face in an increasingly competitive world, where school quality matters more than ever. The evidence suggests that for too long, the expectations we have set have been too low for far too many of our students. Too many students, for instance, simply don't have access to the rigorous courses they need to propel them forward. And even within courses, expectations can and do vary so that some students are being fed a watered-down curriculum while others are being exposed to rigorous content. We see expectation gaps not just within states but across states. Year after year, the gap between the number of students deemed ""proficient"" on state assessments and the number meeting proficiency standards on the Nation's Report Card is unacceptably large across all grade levels and in most states. Even more critically, far too many of our nation's high school graduates, students who've been told they successfully completed requirements necessary to move from K-12 to the postsecondary level, have been ill-prepared for the rigors of college-level coursework and careers. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, between 28% and 40% of four-year college students have to enroll in at least one remedial course to learn content and skills they should have learned before earning their high school diplomas. It goes up to more than 50% at community colleges. Worse, according to a U.S. Department of Education study, only 27% of students who needed a remedial math course completed college. For those who took remedial English, only 17%  eventually graduated. Although these challenges are most obvious in schools and districts that serve our nation's most disadvantaged youth, Common Core implementation in at least a few states has shown, perhaps uncomfortably, that may well be reaching beyond our urban centers. In the end, the most unfortunate consequence of Duncan's gaffe is that it suggested a division where instead urban and suburban schools and parents could have found unity in talking about the school and classroom changes we need to give all students access to the rigorous content and skills they need to succeed.","Education secretary caught flak calling opponents of standards ""white suburban moms""

"In the U.S. Capitol basement, an auditorium full of congressional staff grapples with the consequences of how their bosses upstairs wrote the Affordable Care Act. Starting Monday, they will have to choose a health care plan. ""A lot of employees are planning to separate because of this,"" one man stood up and declared at the first-ever congressional orientation for Obamacare. By ""separate,"" he meant quit. It was one of many sharp moments of concern at the two information sessions set up by House administrators Thursday. Both were closed to the press, but CNN was able to watch on an in-house TV channel. The camera faced the stage, not the audience and staff members who spoke could only be heard, not seen in the broadcast. They did not identify themselves and as a result, we cannot name them. Several expressed doubts and fears about leaving their familiar federal employees plan and switching to the exchange, including a little-known but potentially costly issue. ""I think the federal government needs to seriously look at whether it is contributing to age discrimination (by forcing staff onto the exchange),"" one women said. ""The monthly formula for older workers is a serious, serious hit,"" she went on. ""In addition to what I'm paying now, it will be another $300 to $400 a month."" Under the federal employee health plan, premiums do not vary by age. That's possible because the federal benefits system includes millions of employees and negotiates with insurers for that massive group, spreading out the costs widely. But in the exchange, Congress acts as a small business and insurers view it more by individual health needs, charging different premiums for higher-risk staff, like older employees. Example: Under one BlueCross BlueShield plan available to congressional staff, the premium for a 20-year-old is $262.48 a month, versus $842.41 a month for a 60-year-old. That's not unique to congressional workers. But it is new for them. Compounding the ""hit"" they feel is how much Congress kicks in to help with the premium, its employer contribution. It maxes out at $426 a month. The Office of Personnel Management official told CNN that those two things result in much higher premiums for older workers in the exchange than they are paying now under the federal health plan. Of course it also means lower relative premiums for younger workers. ""You should look into that,"" one man said at Thursday's orientation. The issues for congressional workers are not just financial. Some staffers want to select a plan that excludes abortion, ""but we've had difficulties figuring out (which one that is),"" said one staffer in Thursday's first session. ""Which plans are more pro-life?"" asked another at the second session later in the day. In response, insurance company representatives pointed to one multistate plan with BlueCross BlueShield and all eight plans offered by Aetna. More than 100 plans in total are offered to congressional staff. Those forced into the exchange have just under a month to pick one, starting Monday when the enrollment window set by congressional administrators opens.","Starting Monday, congressional staffers will use the Obamacare health care exchanges .

"It's been a rough week for Alec Baldwin. Not only did he give very emotional testimony against an accused stalker, but he also raised the ire of GLAAD after using an anti-gay slur he didn't realize was one. According to TMZ, the ""30 Rock"" star chased after a photographer outside his Manhattan apartment on Thursday and called the man a ""c**ksucking f*g."" ""Get away from my wife and the baby with the camera,"" Baldwin can be heard yelling on video taken of the incident. ""What f***ing language you want that in?"" On Friday Baldwin posted a statement on MSNBC's website saying, ""I did not intend to hurt or offend anyone with my choice of words, but clearly I have -- and for that I am deeply sorry. Words are important. I understand that, and will choose mine with great care going forward."" The incident occurred hours after Canadian actress Genevieve Sabourin was found guilty of stalking and harassing Baldwin. ""What I said and did this week, as I was trying to protect my family, was offensive and unacceptable. Behavior like this undermines hard-fought rights that I vigorously support."" The statement came after MSNBC announced a two-week suspension for Baldwin's Friday evening show ""Up Late With Alec Baldwin."" ""I understand 'Up Late' will be taken off the schedule for tonight and next week. I want to apologize to my loyal fans and to my colleagues at MSNBC -- both for my actions and for distracting from their good work. Again, please accept my apology,"" wrote Baldwin. Following reports of the incident, the activist organization GLAAD expressed its disappointment on Twitter. ""Mr. Baldwin can't lend his support for equality on paper, while degrading gay people in practice,"" GLADD tweeted. The organization later added via Twitter, ""It's clearly time Mr. Baldwin listens to the calls from so many LGBT people and allies to end this pattern of anti-gay slurs."" Baldwin responded with his own series of tweets. ""Anti-gay slurs are wrong,"" he said. ""They not only offend, but threaten hard fought tolerance of LGBT rights. I'm grateful to all of the ppl I meet + hear from who recognize that I would never say something to offend my friends in the gay community."" He also said ""1-Rich Ferraro from @glaad informs me that c'sucker is an anti-gay epithet. In which case I apologize and will retire it from my vocabulary."" On Friday TMZ featured video of Baldwin asking his male hairdresser if he thought he was a homophobe, to which the stylist jokingly responded, ""Yes. Big time."" This is not the first time Baldwin has had a run-in with paparazzi. In August, Baldwin was photographed holding a paparazzi's arms behind his back and pinning him over the hood of a parked car. Both Baldwin and the photographer called 911 but no charges were filed. In 2012, a New York Daily News photographer accused Baldwin of assault. Baldwin said the photographer bumped him with his camera.","Alec Baldwin yelled a slur at a photographer .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Turkey and Iraq signed an agreement Thursday that tightens and streamlines their working relationship in a range of areas, including the volatile issue of border security and the promise of a fruitful trade relationship. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, left, welcomes Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Baghdad on Thursday. The signing comes as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan begins a two-day visit to Iraq, which Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called historic. The two signed a joint political declaration on the establishment of a ""high-level strategic cooperation council"" between the governments that will help forge a ""long-term strategic partnership"" and then spoke to reporters. ""As much as history and mutual interests bring us together, challenges also bring us together as well,"" al-Maliki said. Erdogan said, ""Iraq's future is our future."" ""There is a mutual determination to form a security area in order to eliminate the terrorist threats between the two countries and an economic work area and an energy passage in order to provide better services for the two countries,"" he added. The council is to meet once a year under the co-chairmanship of the prime ministers, three times a year at the ministerial level and once every three months by senior-level officials. The effort -- based on what Iraq says is an ""initiative"" in March by Iraqi President Jalal Talabani -- will help both countries reach ""bilateral agreements in a speedy and timely manner."" Ministers who head energy, trade, investments, security and water resources will be the council members. Turkey and Iraq have had an awkward relationship in recent months due to issues of border security. Turkey has taken the war against militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, into the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, where the PKK has bases. The Turkish military has launched airstrikes against militant targets, and it conducted a weeklong ground offensive this year. The declaration doesn't mention the PKK, but it calls for respecting each other's territories and ""supporting the joint efforts of Iraq and Turkey to prevent the transit of terrorists and illegal arms to and from Iraq and emphasizing the importance of strengthening cooperation between Iraq and Turkey to control their common borders and prevent all kinds of illicit trafficking."" Erdogan, however, discussed the PKK in his remarks. ""When it comes to the terrorism of PKK, we found the support from the Iraqi government headed by Prime Minister [al-]Maliki and from the regional government in northern Iraq,"" he said, referring to the Kurdistan Regional Government. ""In reality, this terrorist organization is not only an enemy of Turkey but an enemy to Iraq. We do not allow for these kinds of attempts to harm the relations in the region and between the two countries."" The declaration also calls for completing a military framework agreement, concluding a pact on combating terrorism and fostering trade relations in both countries' defense-related industries. Along with military and border security issues, the relationship also focuses on economics and energy. The declaration calls for the conclusion of ""strategic economic cooperation and integration agreements"" between Iraq and Turkey before the end of the year. The plan also calls for cooperation in the areas of tourism, free trade, reconstruction, water resources, agricultural needs, investment, small business development, exchange programs in the banking sector, the promotion of Iraq's transition to free enterprise and expedition of ""the opening of new border gates between Turkey and Iraq."" For energy, the plan calls for establishing partnerships between the countries ""as well as transporting Iraqi natural resources to the world markets through most viable export routes."" The latter refers to ""upgrading and expanding"" the existing capacity of Kirkuk-Yumurtalyk oil pipeline and building ""a pipeline network to transport natural gas from Iraq to international markets via Turkey."" In his remarks, al-Maliki noted that Iraq's security strides have paved the way for a ""phase of reconstruction, rebuilding and investment."" ""Since we already have a great relationship with Turkey, we hope that the Turkish companies and investments play a role in supporting the process of rebuilding and reconstruction and come to the Iraqi field to participate in all projects of rebuilding that we decided here in Iraq that we will be in a new phase of revitalization in that field."" Erdogan is the second leader of Iraq's six neighboring countries to visit Baghdad. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad traveled to Iraq in March. The Turkish prime minister's visit comes during a relative lull in violence across the capital, but there were a couple of attacks Thursday in Baghdad, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. A suicide car bomb exploded near an Iraqi army patrol in western Baghdad, killing two civilians and wounding 11 people, including seven Iraqi soldiers. A roadside bomb targeting traffic police officers in eastern Baghdad killed a civilian and wounded five others, including three police officers.

"One of the basic tenets of Obamacare is that the government will help lower-income Americans -- anyone making less than about $45,900 a year  -- pay for the health insurance everyone is now mandated to have. But a CNN analysis shows that in the largest city in nearly every state, many low-income younger Americans won't get any subsidy at all. Administration officials said the reason so many Americans won't receive a subsidy is that the cost of insurance is lower than the government initially expected. Subsidies are calculated using a complicated formula based on the cost of insurance premiums, which can vary drastically from state to state, and even county to county. That doesn't change the fact that in Chicago, a 27-year old will receive no subsidy to help offset premiums of more than $165 a month if he makes more than $27,400 a year. In Portland, Oregon, subsidies for individuals making just $28,725 a year phase out for those younger than 35 years old. The subsidies situation is adding another layer of complications and calculations to the already-complex picture of Obamacare. And Obama administration officials had promised that the threshold for government assistance would be higher. Subsidies are based on a formula set by law, applying to individuals with annual incomes of one to four times the poverty level -- or $11,490 to $45,960. A subsidy calculator . The percentage people have to pay for insurance increases on a sliding scale, with those making $11,490 paying no more than 2% of their income, and those making $45,960 paying no more than 9.5% unless they choose to select a more expensive plan. Back in April, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional subcommittee that any individual making under that $45,960 threshold -- or four times the poverty level of $11,490 for an individual -- would qualify for ""an upfront tax subsidy."" ""Somebody who's making $25,500 would definitely qualify for a subsidy if he or she is purchasing coverage in the individual market,"" Sebelius added. Despite the secretary's assurance, a 25-year-old living in Nashville, Tennessee, making $25,500 will not qualify for a subsidy, for example. An administration official, presented with the data that many low-income Americans would not receive a subsidy, argued that lower premium costs meant the market was working. ""In some instances, because of the competition that the marketplace creates, premiums have come in so low that the premium is below the ceiling in the law,"" said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. ""This means that, in some places, people will pay less than they would with a tax credit."" Cancer survivor: Obamacare got me covered . To calculate premium subsidies, the government sets a maximum amount that low-income customers will have to pay for insurance as a percentage of their income. That cap is then subtracted from the cost of a mid-level insurance plan in the individual's region, and the difference is their subsidy. The insurance companies knock that amount off the price of premiums before the customer pays. But if the baseline plan is cheap enough, the formula is thrown off and the subsidy is zero. ""The way the subsidy works is by capping the percent of your income that you'd have to spend on a silver premium,"" said Cynthia Cox, a policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, referring to the medium-level insurance plan the government uses as the baseline. ""But if the premium before subsidies is already so low that it falls below your income cap, then you wouldn't qualify for a subsidy even if your income would otherwise qualify for one."" This means that in places like Minneapolis, Minnesota, where premiums are especially low, a 40 year old making $28,725 a year would get no help from the government to purchase insurance. In that case, this individual would be earning just 250% of the federal poverty level, far below 400% where the subsidies are supposed to end. ""While you don't qualify for subsidies your premiums are already lower,"" Cox pointed out. ""So in this example, this person is only going to be paying $154 a month whereas the same person living somewhere else would be paying $193 a month after subsidies."" Still, because of what government officials have been saying about who would get subsidies, many low-income consumers are counting on subsidies to lower their costs, no matter how small those costs may initially be. The actual age and income level where subsidies phase out differs depending on the cost of insurance, which are often lower in cities than in more rural areas. Opinion: Generation Y should opt for Obamacare . But no matter where a person lives, premiums increase based on a customer's age, meaning this problem will disproportionately affect younger customers. Two exceptions are in New York and Vermont, where state laws require insurance companies to charge younger customers the same as older customers. ""There's a lot of interest in getting young people to enroll in coverage because that helps bring down the average cost,"" Cox said, but these younger, healthier consumers might stay out of the exchange it they ""don't have subsidies to incentivize them to enroll."" As incomes increase, the age cap gets even higher. Part of the reason for the sizable difference between the actual subsidy caps in certain cities and the intended cap under the law is that actual premiums came in below what the government and the Congressional Budget Office estimated. ""The CBO projected premiums to be approximately 16% higher than they turned out to be,"" Cox said. Because Kaiser based its estimates on the CBO's, much of its projections turned out to be slightly off. The actual subsidy caps only became clear after October 1, when the foundation was able to compile the cost of the second-lowest silver plan from every coverage area in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

"Income inequality is going up, up, up in America. In Brazil, meanwhile, it's been dropping for years. The likely outcome? ""Perhaps both countries will meet halfway,"" said Pedro Ferreira de Souza, a researcher at Brazil's Institute for Applied Economic Research. Brazil, while still incredibly unequal, has realized something the United States hasn't: That wealth and income inequality are threats to democracy, and that smart policies can help narrow the gap between rich and poor. We would be wise to adopt the cash transfer programs and minimum wage policies that economists say have helped Brazil reduce its income inequality. But many U.S. politicians are reluctant to deal with this issue. ""I think that is perhaps the most important lesson from Brazil ... that inequality IS a legitimate political matter,"" Ferreira de Souza wrote in an e-mail to me. ""That it does affect people's lives and that at the end of the day, inequality begets inequality ..."" To deny that, he said, would be ""ludicrous."" Related: You pick it, CNN will cover it . Here are five unexpected tips for how the United States can and should curb its rising income inequality, pulled from Brazil and other foreign shores, as well as our own history books. Adopting policies from other countries always raises eyebrows. None will be a perfect fit. But the bottom line is that we need to do something before we turn into a society where, as Ferreira de Souza put it, ""rags-to-riches stories become increasingly unlikely."" 1. Scandinavia: Equality is safer ... and skinnier . Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway are the gold standards for economic equality and justice. It's not that everyone is equal -- it's that the gap between rich and poor is small enough that it doesn't cause all sorts of other problems. Violence, mental illness ... even obesity. All of these are associated with economically split societies, according to decades of research that went into the book ""The Spirit Level,"" by two epidemiologists. Another outcome of income inequality is that it's harder to move up in a society. This has been proved by data, but it's also logical. When the gap is wider, a person has further to go. ""If you want to live the American Dream,"" said Kate Picket, one of the researchers, ""you'd better go to Denmark or Finland."" Their rates of economic mobility are much higher. They achieve this with higher tax rates and better social services. Norway, for example, provides 10 weeks of paid paternity leave. College and health care are free in Denmark. When these tools exist and are available to everyone, it matters less how rich you are at birth. You have the same tools for success as everyone else. 2. Iceland: Publish the names of the rich . Economic inequalities are somewhat invisible in the United States. They're masked by credit, as Harvard's Michael Norton explained it to me, and we tend to surround ourselves with people from the same tax bracket. We also don't tell each other how much money we make. An Esquire writer tested this idea by running around the country asking people, ""How much do you make?"" ""You mean money?"" one man responded. Money isn't something Americans discuss. And maybe that's holding us back. Iceland clears up all mysteries about the size of the rich-poor gap by making individual income tax records public, said Stefán Ólafsson, a professor at the University of Iceland. ""It reveals the differences,"" he told me. In the lead up to the financial crisis, ""people could see how the bankers earnings were galloping ahead of everybody else ..."" 3. Australia: McDonald's pays $15 an hour . Fast-food workers in the United States have been protesting for a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum is $7.25 per hour, which is worth less than the minimum wage was in the late 1960s, when you adjust for inflation. Australia, meanwhile, manages to pay all of its workers $15 per hour -- and the economy, fast-food and otherwise, hasn't collapsed. The country also maintains a lower level of income inequality. 4. Brazil: Income inequality isn't forever . In 2001, Brazil's Gini index rating, one measure of income inequality, was 59.4, according to a government source. By 2009, it had dropped to 53.9. A score of 100 means one person earns all income in the country. Zero means income is perfectly distributed. Related: Is class the new race? Brazil is still more economically divided than the United States, which had a rating of 45 in 2007, according to data compiled by the CIA, but Brazil's downward trajectory is encouraging, and it's at least partly the result of policies designed to lift people out of extreme poverty and to encourage equality of opportunity. One much-touted program, Bolsa Familia, provides direct cash transfers to poor families on the condition that their children attend school. The program only costs 0.5% of GDP per year, Ferreira de Souza said. ""It certainly will not solve all our problems,"" he told me, ""but it has played an important role in bringing down inequality."" The country also adjusts its minimum wage for inflation and pegs social support programs to that amount. The minimum wage has increased in recent years, making it possible for people to work their way out of poverty. 5. United States: Clues from a time capsule . Finally, we in the United States need look no further than our own history for tips about how to run a country where prosperity is broadly shared. Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich told me he's often asked which countries the United States should try to emulate to try to narrow the rich-poor gap. He always says 1950s or 1960s America. Back then, unions gave workers a voice; college was affordable; CEO pay wasn't off the charts; and the minimum wage was higher in relative terms. Reinstating some of those policies might stop America from becoming more unequal than it already is. We're (barely) beating Zimbabwe. Let's keep it that way.","America has a higher level of income inequality than any developed country .

"The mother of Rebecca Sedwick, a Florida girl who jumped to her death after being bullied by classmates, on Tuesday urged parents of potential victims to pay attention to the signs of bullying. ""When I looked at my child I saw a normal, happy, productive child,"" Tricia Norman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""Apparently not. Inside, behind the scenes, there were other things going on with the bullying. Even though your child may seem normal, there may be something else going on."" The interview comes one day after Norman and her lawyer announced plans to sue those they believe responsible for the 12-year-old's suicide. Authorities last week dropped criminal charges against two girls accused of cyberbullying Rebecca Sedwick. The civil wrongful death lawsuit has not yet been filed, and Norman did not specify the targets of the future legal action. In addition, Norman's attorney, Matt Morgan, is pushing Florida lawmakers to enact ""Rebecca's Law"" -- legislation that would allow the state to file bullying charges against minors and their parents, and make parents liable in civil court. ""For the parent, I think civil responsibility,"" Morgan told New Day on Tuesday. ""If parents know they can be held financially responsible for the acts of their children then ultimately that might provide a deterring effect for them to monitor their child's behavior."" Rebecca, 12, died after jumping from the top of an abandoned concrete plant in September. Norman said all her efforts to halt the bullying -- including counseling, reporting the harassment to school officials as well as other parents, even removing her daughter from school -- failed to deter the alleged bullies. ""It just wouldn't stop,"" she said, ""no matter what we did to try to eliminate it."" Norman said the abuse was unrelenting and had nothing to do with her daughter not having ""thick skin."" ""I think her skin was thick enough,"" she said. ""I think (the bullying) was so much and so often."" Authorities said Rebecca killed herself after months of cyberbullying from fellow students. The abusive behavior that authorities say prompted her suicide grew from a dispute between Rebecca and a former classmate over a boy they had both dated, police said in October. Should parents be criminally liable for kids' cyberbullying? Authorities initially charged two girls, ages 12 and 14, with aggravated stalking, but the charges were dropped last week. The state attorney's office declined to comment about the dropped charges and referred CNN to the girls' defense lawyers, who praised the decision and said there was no evidence of stalking. Police said the abuse included messages such as ""nobody cares about u,"" ""i hate u,"" and ""you seriously deserve to die."" Rebecca had already cut open her wrists months before the jump, but survived that suicide attempt. ""I think people should know what was done to my daughter,"" Norman said Tuesday. She said parents need to take the signs of bullying seriously.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed Wednesday that Israel's air assault on Gaza would not end until Hamas militants quit firing rockets into Israeli territory. A man plants a Palestinian flag Wednesday in the rubble of a mosque in Gaza City. ""We did not enter this operation in order to end it with the firing still continuing,"" Olmert said in a security cabinet meeting, according to a senior government official. ""Hamas broke this cease-fire,"" Olmert said. ""If the conditions ripen"" and if there is a solution ""that promises a better security ... we will consider it, but we are not there yet,"" he said, according to the official. Despite a French proposal for a humanitarian truce, Israel earlier Wednesday decided to continue the operation, saying Israelis must have a ""real and sustainable solution,"" Olmert spokesman Mark Regev said. Israeli airstrikes have pounded the territory since Saturday in an effort to halt the firing of rockets into southern Israel. More than 390 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian medical sources, and some 1,900 people have been wounded, including 400 women and children. Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, whose office in Gaza was struck overnight, said Israel needed to ""stop attacking and killing our children, women and men."" ""The aggression must stop, the crossings must open and the blockade must be lifted and then we can talk about all other issues,"" he said in televised comments Wednesday. ""Then we can start a national dialogue without any preset conditions."" Israeli sources say four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire. The Israeli air force carried out about 40 airstrikes Wednesday, and Palestinian militants fired about 70 rockets into Israel, the IDF said. More than 30 rockets landed in southern Israel on Wednesday, including at least four in Beer Sheva, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. Beer Sheva, about 25 miles away from Gaza, is the farthest that rockets from Gaza have ever landed inside Israel. ""Israel will not accept a 'Strip of Terror' alongside us, and accordingly Hamas operatives have tasted the flavor of Israel's response in the last few days,"" Israeli President Shimon Peres said.

""Mashaal said in response to [Lavrov] that they are ready to end the armed confrontation, but only if these measures are linked to steps intended to remove the Gaza Strip's blockade,"" the ministry said.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia's finance minister made a rare admission of responsibility Monday for the country's severe economic crisis. Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin says his country's economy has been set back by five years. The Russian government overspent its vast oil revenues in recent years, fueling inflation, and did not do enough to reduce the economy's reliance on oil, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said in an exclusive CNN interview. ""Of course, I too bear the responsibility for not managing to diversify the economy as much as we wanted,"" Kudrin said. ""We were spending more money than we could afford, which is why we had a rapid strengthening of the national currency [and] a high inflation rate. ""I think the government should have been more conservative in its financial policy and save more money that it received from the high global oil prices,"" he said. Kremlin officials usually blame the West, and specifically the United States, for the global economic crisis. Kudrin, who is also a deputy prime minister, said the financial crisis had set back Russian shares -- but added that the United States had fared even worse. ""If we are talking about the Russian stock market, it had been growing quickly over the past few years and then dropped rapidly. But we only retreated back five years, as far as I know, U.S. stock markets have fallen back 10 years."" Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Russia's finance minister » . The Dow Jones index of leading shares hit lows not seen since 1997 on Monday. Kudrin confirmed Russia would have a budget deficit of 8 percent in 2009 -- its first for a decade -- and will spend more than it takes in for the next two years as well. He predicted a deficit of 5 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in 2011. Russian government budget forecasts assumed oil would cost $95 a barrel -- more than twice as much as it costs at the moment. The lower price hurt Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters. But Kudrin said Moscow would not cut spending, though it would change its priorities. ""In general, the volume of spending will remain the same, and even slightly increase, which is why the deficit will go up to 8 percent,"" he said. ""We need to optimize our spending and cut certain programs,"" he added. ""First of all, we halted all brand new programs and all new projects. In some cases we've also cut government institutions and government employees' payroll. Besides, we've decreased funding for less important projects by 50 percent and more. But by and large social spending and important infrastructure projects remain untouched."" Russia's stock markets plummeted by nearly 70 percent in 2008, and the country spent one-third of its gold and foreign currency reserves -- or $216 billion -- defending its currency, the ruble. The Kremlin has also committed vast sums to bail out big business in Russia, which is heavily in debt to foreign banks. Kudrin -- who is attending a global investment forum in Moscow -- said there were signs the Russian economy was stabilizing. He confirmed that investors pulled $40 billion out of Russia in January, but said that enormous outflows of cash had stopped. The flight of capital was related to the much-anticipated fall in the value of the currency, he said. ""People have been expecting a devaluation of the Russian ruble, there were a lot of expectations of new devaluation to take place. That's why, before the end of January, before the devaluation was actually completed, there was a very strong incentive to take capital out of Russia. However, in February, such capital outflow practically ended.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two suicide vehicle bombers struck a U.S.-Iraqi military outpost in Taji on Wednesday night, the U.S. military said in a statement. U.S. Black Hawk helicopters fly over Baghdad in June. A Black Hawk chopper crashed Wednesday in Iraq. The attack killed four Iraqi soldiers, the military said, and wounded 11 U.S. soldiers and four Iraqi soldiers. The incident occurred at 8:45 p.m., according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry official. Eight Iraqis suspected of having information concerning the attack have been detained, the U.S. military said. Taji is 14 kilometers, or more than 8 miles, north of the capital, but still in Baghdad province. Police in Taji said the base is in the Haw al-Basha area. Police said that when they responded, U.S. troops fired on them and would not allow them near the base. Earlier Wednesday, 14 U.S. soldiers died when their helicopter crashed in northern Iraq, the U.S. military said. Separately, at least 37 people were killed and 81 wounded when a suicide car bomb detonated outside a police building in the Iraqi town of Baiji, north of Baghdad, in Salaheddin province, police said. Also Wednesday, a U.S. soldier was killed and three others wounded in combat west of Baghdad, the military said. The helicopter crash occurred near Kirkuk, according to a U.S. military intelligence source.  Watch the initial report of the copter downing » . ""Two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters were on a night operation when one of the aircraft crashed,"" the military said. ""Initial indications are that the aircraft experienced a mechanical malfunction. There were no indications of hostile fire."" The dead were all members of the Army's Task Force Lightning and comprised four Black Hawk crew members and 10 passengers. The task force typically operates in the Tikrit area, north of Baghdad. The military has launched an investigation into the crash, the deadliest since January 2005, when a helicopter went down in western Iraq and killed 31 Marines. Since the start of the war, 3,715 U.S. troops have died in Iraq; seven civilian contractors also have been killed. There have been a string of helicopter downings in Iraq this year. In January, 12 U.S. soldiers were killed when a U.S. helicopter went down northeast of Baghdad. The Brookings Institution's Iraq Index, a regularly updated compilation of facts about the war, said in its latest update Monday before this crash that 67 American military helicopters have gone down since May 2003 and that enemy fire had downed at least 36. Meanwhile, police in Baiji said an explosives-packed truck drove into the police directorate's compound in the center of town and detonated. A number of homes in the compound were destroyed. The police building was badly damaged, and 15 vehicles were destroyed. On the political front, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responded to U.S. criticism of his government, calling such comments irresponsible and saying they ""overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy."" President Bush and the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, on Tuesday expressed frustration with an ineffective Iraqi political process dominated by constant governmental squabbling. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Monday called on Iraq's parliament to turn al-Maliki's ""nonfunctioning"" government out of office when it returns in two weeks. He said al-Maliki's government was ""too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders"" to reach a political settlement that would end the country's sectarian and insurgent violence. ""Everyone knows that the Iraqi government is one elected by the Iraqi people, and no one puts timetables or restrictions other than the Iraqi people who elected the government,"" al-Maliki said Wednesday during a visit to Syria's capital, Damascus. Government spokesman Ali Dabbagh said al-Maliki was specifically referring to Levin's comments. White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe on Wednesday said media reports had overblown differences between the Bush administration and al-Maliki. Johndroe said al-Maliki is Iraq's elected prime minister, and the Iraqi government is working to achieve political reconciliation. Other developments .

"Hours after a lone gunman murdered 20 school children in Newtown, Connecticut, last December, President Barack Obama took a vow. ""We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,"" he said. In the year since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, gun control advocates have seen their primary legislative objective fall short in Congress. They have, instead, turned to states in an effort that has yielded some success. Officials in Connecticut released a report on Monday summarizing the investigation of the Newtown shooting, but whether it will advance the gun-control agenda is unclear. The school tragedy has faded further from the national conversation, especially in Washington where Obama has lost political clout following his reelection and everything going forward will be seen through the prism of next November's congressional midterms. Following the shooting, the debate in Washington centered on expanding background checks, which failed in the Senate. Related: Sandy Hook report looks at shooting . The Obama administration then announced limited executive reforms in place of tougher laws. And a number of states, such as New York, California and Connecticut, put in place new background check limits as well as other measures restricting magazine capacity and types of firearms legally available. But other states, mostly controlled by Republican legislatures, took the  opposite approach. For example, Alaska pursued a so-called ""nullification"" law that would, in theory, make it illegal to enforce any federal firearms regulations in that state. Looking for momentum . Both sides in the gun control debate remain energized and have vowed to continue to fight for their own priorities and to vociferously oppose the other. Proponents of stricter gun laws still back Obama's calls for a new national status quo. Related: Haunted by the Newtown massacre, police officer faces firing over PTSD . Advocates for tougher gun laws look to build on last April's Senate vote on a bipartisan proposal to expand background checks. It won majority support, but failed to gain the 60 votes necessary to break a Republican filibuster. ""Our job is to continue to apply persuasion and pressure,"" said Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group backed by outgoing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spent millions backing gun-control candidates. For the nation's most established group advocating stricter gun laws, expanding background checks from sellers with a federal firearms license to all purchases -- including private sales at gun shows -- is the one and only priority. Brian Malte, senior national policy director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, noted that several states have passed background check bills, including Nevada. Key to expanding the field of states enacting tougher gun regulations, Glaze said, is highlighting that most gun murders in the United States -- more than 11,000 in 2010 -- are not national events but killings that never make news. Among those trying to create a grassroots effort to force change is Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Established one day after the Newtown shooting, founder Shannon Watts said  her group is the only one with an established grassroots network, one pushing for background check bills in states like Washington, Minnesota and Oregon. ""There are a lot of states to look at in this next legislative session,"" Watts said. Second Amendment defense . But to those who frame the argument around the Second Amendment, Obama symbolizes an anti-gun liberal focused on taking away their constitutional right to self-defense. Erich Pratt, an official with Gun Owners of America, criticized the President as the single biggest threat to the Second Amendment, but added that gun owners are more motivated because of Obama's vow for new restrictions. The response of the National Rifle Association, the most visible gun rights advocacy group, to efforts to expand background checks is firmly rooted. ""We will fight them every step of the way,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. When it comes to gun-control advocacy, ""none of their proposals will make us safer,"" Arulanandam said. The NRA argues that existing laws should be enforced and that the United States should improve mental health treatment rather than seek to restrict constitutionally protected rights. Gun rights activists postulate that something like background checks would not have stopped many of the high profile mass shootings in recent memory where weapons were obtained legally, with a background check. Groups advocating for stricter laws counter that hundreds of thousands of firearms sales have been stopped at the point of purchase because of a failed background check. One of the most common solutions to gun violence offered by Second Amendment supporters is the phrase championed by NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he has said. For schools, that means proposals for armed guards in every facility as well as other security measures. Also key to preventing mass shootings and a priority in the near future, said Pratt of GOA, is eliminating so-called ""gun free zones,"" places like schools where firearms are not allowed. They believe if teachers at Sandy Hook or office personnel at the Washington Navy Yard -- where a dozen people were killed in a mass shooting in September -- were armed, then they would never have been targeted in the first place because gunmen go after ""soft"" targets. ""The first responders are the ones that have a gun pointed at them,"" Pratt said. For Pratt, hand in hand with allowing more guns in more places is preventing federal intrusion -- especially through nullification laws that seek to stop federal interference in state gun rights. Moreover, Pratt said the group is working to help convince the Senate not to approve the United Nations arms treaty signed in September by Secretary of State John Kerry. ""We think we have the votes to stop it,"" Pratt said. Gun rights advocates worry that the treaty's recommendation to track gun sales would lead to a national database of firearms owners, what they fear to be a slippery slope away from gun confiscation, the ultimate Second Amendment rallying cry. Political calculation . The biggest chilling factor politically appears to be the successful recall elections of two Colorado Democrats earlier this year after they helped pass legislation enacting tougher gun measures. Both were in Democratic-leaning districts, which gun control activists illustrate as proof positive that the Second Amendment is not a partisan issue. Advocates for stricter gun measures point out that despite the recalls, the Colorado law still stands. Regardless of the setback in the Senate last spring, Malte said history is on the side of advocates of stricter gun measures, noting that it took years and multiple votes to finally pass the first background check bill. He noted that most public opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans favor expanded background checks. ""We don't have to convince the country. We have to convince the lawmakers,"" said Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was severely wounded in an Arizona shooting. Just as they lament one loss in recent months, advocates of stricter gun laws are also celebrating a victory, hailing the campaign win of Terry McAuliffe as the next governor of Virginia. ""He actually won on it,"" Malte said of McAuliffe's platform that included gun control. The prospects for McAuliffe to pass any gun control bills in the state remains in doubt, however, in a state that is largely rural and steeped in gun culture.","Newtown shooting killed 20 elementary students, jolted the nation .

"(CNN) -- ""The Sound of Music Live!"" has become the new definition of ""hate-watching."" Anyone with a Twitter account has noticed the tidal wave of tweets about NBC's TV event, which aired for three hours on Thursday night, but that can't exactly be taken as a good sign. (You know a TV show isn't going well when live tweets from DiGiorno Pizza are considered one of the best parts.) From the moment NBC announced its live TV version of the Broadway classic, a number of ""Sound of Music"" fans responded with a resounding ""why?!"" So when the network unveiled its one-take-only ""Sound of Music"" on Thursday -- starring Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer in the untouchable roles of Maria and Captain Von Trapp -- it seems viewers were primed to tear the production to shreds from its opening note. And shred it they did. Critics have commended country star Underwood for attempting live theater without acting experience, but they haven't been able to ignore the result. ""As her multiple Grammys and her legion of country music fans will attest, the quality of Underwood's singing voice is not the problem,"" said USA Today's TV critic Robert Bianco. ""It's that she doesn't know how to use that voice to sing in character, or what to do with her face when she's trying."" Even though it's been repeated that NBC was re-creating the stage version of ""Sound of Music,"" rather than the beloved 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, the comparisons between the TV musical and the movie were inevitable. At one point, Underwood had to go on the record to tell her critics that she's completely aware she is not Andrews. ""I would never pretend that I was,"" the ""American Idol"" champ recently told Entertainment Weekly. ""I know my place."" Yet that place may not have been in such an iconic role. There are some things that are so revered in pop culture it's nearly criminal to try to re-introduce them (see: the widely reviled plan to create a sequel to ""It's A Wonderful Life""). Underwood is an undeniable talent, but the singer is now facing complaints for even attempting to portray the young nun. ""When Carrie Underwood stepped out on the (wooded, not grassy) hills and started singing, I wished the hills were alive with the sound of hungry mountain lions,"" said Time magazine in a review. ""Why wasn't she Julie Andrews? Is being Julie Andrews so much to ask for? No chic pixie cut either. Heidi braids."" The Hollywood Reporter wondered if it was ""perhaps unfair to ask so much of Underwood, to have to make Maria's journey in three scant hours."" And, to make matters worse, ""True Blood's"" Moyer -- so familiar to audiences as vampire Bill that some viewers found it difficult to see the actor as anyone else -- didn't live up to expectations, either. ""Moyer is a better singer than Russell Crowe,"" said THR. ""But he's no Hugh Jackman. Or Neil Patrick Harris. Or Taye Diggs. Or even Nathan Fillion. His attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness just reads as mildly constipated, his furrowed eyes and pursed lips doing all the work. He doesn't look stoic, he just looks clenched."" So it wasn't a home run. But that's not to say that there weren't highlights, with Audra McDonald's spectacular performance being chief among them. Some have emerged has defenders of the show -- the first attempt at a live TV musical production in almost 50 years -- while a few more have tweeted their hope that the intense criticism of the production won't stop NBC or other major broadcast networks from giving live theater in primetime another try. As for Underwood, it sounds like she slept well after going off the air Thursday. ""Glory to God tonight...I couldn't be more proud,"" she tweeted. ""What a tough thing to pull off and we did it! I am so blessed!!!""","""The Sound of Music Live!"" has been eviscerated on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Acts of kindness will help pull the nation through its economic crisis, according to the woman who came to the rescue of a homeless Floridian who publicly appealed to President Obama. Henrietta Hughes, left, and Chene Thompson talk on the lawn of the home Thompson is letting Hughes use. Chene Thompson, the wife of state Rep. Nicholas Thompson, R-Fort Myers, is letting Henrietta Hughes and her son stay in a house she owns in nearby La Belle rent free until they get back on their feet. ""You don't have to be a politician to put forth a stimulus package,"" Chene Thompson said during a joint interview with Hughes Thursday on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""This is our own little mini-stimulus package for a person who was a stranger and now is a friend. ""Anybody can help anybody at any time. It doesn't need to be something that comes from Washington; it can come from your own home and from your heart, even if it's for a little bit."" Hughes emerged from the crowd at Tuesday's town hall meeting in Fort Myers to tell Obama she and her son were living in a car and needed immediate help. The president asked her name, kissed her on the cheek and promised his staff would work with her.  Watch Hughes' emotional plea to Obama » . Thompson, who was in the audience, stepped forward afterward to offer Hughes her vacant house, which the Thompsons had to leave because it is outside her husband's legislative district. ""She was sincere and direct and to the point, and she needed help,"" Thompson said. ""And it actually touched me and I started to tear up and I started to cry. ... It sort of broke my heart."" Hughes feels ""overwhelming gratitude,"" she told CNN in the front yard of the house, ""because no one would do that."" ""Oh, yes they would! Yes they would!"" Thompson interjected, wrapping an arm around Hughes' shoulders. ""I was just in the right place at the right time."" Both women beamed. The house has remained unsold in southwest Florida's depressed market, Thompson said. She continues to be responsible for paying the mortgage, property taxes, insurance and utilities, so it benefits her to have someone occupying it to keep it from becoming run-down, she said. According to the White House, the Fort Myers-Cape Coral area had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation last year, with 12 percent of housing units receiving a foreclosure-related notice. Median housing prices in the Fort Myers metropolitan area have plummeted from $322,000 in December 2005 to less than $107,000 in December 2008, the Obama administration said. Nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost in Fort Myers in the past year. White House spokesman Joshua Earnest said Wednesday that the administration connected Hughes with local housing officials in the crowd. On Wednesday, the head of the local housing authority, Marcus Goodson, said he met with Hughes and is working on finding her a subsidized housing unit with a short waiting time. Hughes on Thursday urged Congress to approve legislation to deal with the housing crisis. ""If that would pass, that would help many other -- hundreds and thousands of -- low-income persons to receive housing,"" she said.

"Below is an excerpt from CNN commentator Jack Cafferty's new book, ""Now or Never."" Jack appears daily in ""The Situation Room"" on CNN from 4 to 7 p.m. ET. In his new book, ""Now or Never,"" Jack Cafferty says parenting might be on the decline more than schools are. I never presumed to have any more answers about being a parent than anybody else. There are no perfect parents, perfect kids, perfect families -- only degrees of dysfunction. You get up in the morning and do the best you can. At the end of the day you say, ""Okay, that wasn't so bad, let's try it again tomorrow."" Some of my instincts were pretty good and some of them were awful. I did stay engaged and didn't say to hell with being a father when my first marriage ended. With the younger girls, I eventually made the choice to clean up my alcoholism before I pushed things to the point of no return. But most of the credit does to my second wife Carol; to the girls; and to God Almighty. Ultimately, I've just been very fortunate. I don't know the status of parenting in America. But I know a little about the status of education in America. Parents' growing inability to impose manners and limits on their kids when the kids are in school is reflected in record dropout rates, as well as teen drug and alcohol abuse, teen sex, and unwed pregnancies. Maybe it's parenting that's on the decline, more than the schools.  Watch Jack Cafferty talk about ""Now or Never"" in The Situation Room"" » . Exhibit A: My wife and I have just been seated for dinner when the maitre d' walks over and seats a young family at the table next to us and the kids start carrying on like orangutans on a leash. The parents are going, ""Timmy, that's not nice, don't throw your food, stop stuffing your mashed potatoes up your nose."" Are mom and dad having fun yet, picking food up off the floor, apologizing to people like us, and wiping food flung across the table off their faces? Some parents still have this attitude that their kids are too special to be burdened by discipline. And the rest of us are supposed to put up with their little mutants. That attitude really pisses me off. I hate to break it to them, but the kids aren't special, and I don't have to put up with their behavior. If you can't control your obnoxious little brats, leave them home. They don't belong out in public annoying other people, period. I don't remember a generation of kids ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly. What's going on? I remember as a kid I was expected to behave myself out in public or suffer the wrath of one very angry father. And of all the things that used to piss him off, those expectations didn't seem unreasonable. Something's gone terribly wrong here. My guess is it has to do with the breakdown of authority, the collapse of strong family structure, and the abdication of parental responsibility, dictated in part by the necessity that both parents work. Plus, we have a whole generation of Baby Boomers who are too busy feeling entitled to prolong their own self-indulgent, self-absorbed adolescences to rein in their own kids. Just a theory.","Jack says there's no such thing as the perfect family, only degrees of dysfunction .

Michelle Obama is more compelling than her husband. He's good, but she's utterly fascinating. Mrs. Obama has blown away the stale air in a White House musty from eight years of the Bushes. It's like the sun came out and a fresh spring breeze began wafting through the open windows. It's the people's house, and Michelle Obama totally gets it.

Watch her when she visits a local school and you see the warmth and affection she instantly triggers in people. Kids are pretty much totally honest with very good BS-detectors. If they sense you're a phony, forget it. But around the first lady, they want to hug her and laugh with her and tell her stories. You can see the same qualities these kids recognize in her daughters. She is the consummate mother as evidenced by the poised, polite smiling children she and her husband are raising. I have four daughters, and trust me -- they don't turn out like the Obama children without devoted parents. New to the Washington neighborhood, Michelle Obama has taken it upon herself to go around and introduce herself to the people in the various agencies of government. When's the last time a first lady did that? I don't ever remember it before. And during her visits she listens rather than lectures. And people respond to her. She was raised on the south side of Chicago by blue-collar parents. She went to Princeton University, and Harvard Law School. But in many ways she's still a kid from the south side of Chicago, and that's what makes her special. She knows exactly who she is. The Obamas bring a humanity and humility to their tasks which sets them far apart from the run-of-the mill phonies who populate Washington. It's exactly what the doctor ordered for this wounded nation. Michelle Obama's unassuming, but dead-on, sense of style has the fashion press gushing all over itself. Her arms are becoming the stuff of legend. Who appears sleeveless on the cover of Vogue, let alone in front of a joint session of Congress while her husband delivers one of the most important speeches of his life? And the reviews were rave. Cindi Leive, the editor of Glamour magazine gushed, ""Oh my god! The first lady has bare arms in Congress in February at night!"" If she keeps it up, Seventh Avenue will soon stop making women's clothes with sleeves. Ok, I admit it. When it comes to the first lady, I'm smitten. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack Cafferty.","Jack Cafferty: Michelle Obama is blazing a new path as first lady .

"NFL star Adrian Peterson pleaded no contest Tuesday in a Texas court to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault, avoiding jail time for whipping one of his children. Peterson appeared in a Montgomery County court in Conroe after prosecutors and his attorneys reached a plea deal. Judge Kelly Case agreed to the terms of the deal, in which Peterson pleaded to a lesser charge. The Minnesota Vikings star was sentenced to two years of probation, a $4,000 fine and 80 hours of community service, half of which will be taken care of by a public service announcement. He also will take parenting classes. Peterson gave a brief statement outside the courthouse. ""I truly regret this incident,"" he said. ""I stand here and I take full responsibility for my actions. I love my son more than any one of you can even imagine."" He didn't address a question about when he will return to the NFL. ""We will review the matter, including the court record, and then make a determination on his status. We cannot provide a timetable,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, called the plea deal ""fair and just."" Opinion: Spanking isn't child abuse; it's common sense . Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said Peterson wasn't treated any differently because he is one of the NFL's marquee players. Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million and is considered one of the NFL's best running backs, if not the best -- left the Vikings in September after the team deactivated, then activated and then deactivated him again. He was accused in Texas of whipping his 4-year-old son with a ""switch,"" or slender tree branch, and had originally been charged with felony child abuse. He faced up to two years in prison and a fine. Opinion: Does spanking harm the black community? Ligon said the punishment was about behavior modification. ""I believe that Mr. Peterson is accepting responsibility (for hurting his child),"" Ligon said. ""I'm looking forward to him ... taking a role as a responsible parent.""","Adrian Peterson says he loves his son and regrets the incident .

"Gay-rights activists in Uganda warned Monday of mounting violence against homosexuals after parliament passed controversial legislation last week that would make some gay acts punishable with life in prison. ""The witch hunt had already started, and now it has been legitimized by the parliament of Uganda, which is very scary,"" said Clare Byarugaba, coordinator for the Ugandan Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law, an umbrella gay-rights group. ""We don't know how brutal the police will be now that the bill has passed. With this legitimization, it's going to get worse."" Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. Currently in Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying the Western lifestyle risks destroying Ugandan family units. Gay activists in Uganda are regularly detained, blackmailed and harassed in what they say has been an ongoing campaign led by religious and political leaders in the conservative East African country. ""What we are convinced and sure of is that nobody can in one's right conscience and consciousness choose to be homosexual,"" said Simon Lokodo, Uganda's minister for Ethics and Integrity. ""This must be under pressure or conditions because we know that the natural tendency is always for a male to go for a female and vice-versa."" The moral fervor has even impacted the expatriate community in Uganda. A retired British man is facing up to two years in prison over the possession of a gay sex video. The man says the images were stolen along with his laptop in a break-in at his home. Images from the video were later published in a local tabloid newspaper notorious for outing gays. Bernard Randall, 65, was scheduled to appear in an Entebbe court last week, but his case has been postponed until January 22. Randall was arrested and released on bail last month and is charged with ""trafficking obscene publications,"" which carries a sentence of up to two years. His partner, Ugandan Albert Cheptoyek, was arrested and will stand trial alongside him, facing a more serious charge for ""gross indecency,"" which carries a sentence of up to seven years. ""There certainly seems to be a ramping up of pressure from the state here against homosexuals,"" said Randall, citing a string of arrests and trials against gay activists in recent months. ""I'm still very concerned if they drop the case or if I'm found not guilty."" Early this year, another British national, David Cecil, faced up to two years in prison for staging a play with a gay character without government permission. Though the charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence, he was deported from Uganda one month later. Cecil has since filed an appeal against his deportation at the High Court in Uganda, but those proceedings have also stalled. The bill, which in its original form prescribed the death penalty for cases of ""aggravated homosexuality"" -- for instance if someone is infected with HIV -- was reduced before the vote to life imprisonment. Clauses that criminalize the ""promotion"" of homosexuality could cause activists and even doctors treating gay patients with HIV to face prison time. Member of parliament David Bahati praised the bill's passage on Friday, thanking the speaker ""for the courage and defending the children of Uganda and the cause for humanity, to protect our marriages, to defend culture and to defend the future of our children."" The International HIV/AIDS Alliance said in a statement that the bill will have a ""disastrous impact on the country's HIV response."" Uganda is one of only two countries in Africa with a rising AIDS rate, after being hailed for its early success in fighting the epidemic in the 1990s. President Yoweri Museveni still has to assent to the bill for it to become law -- ""So our only hope now is with the president of Uganda -- and we plan to put as much pressure as necessary to ensure that this bill doesn't pass into law,"" said Byarugaba, who is also a winner of the U.S. State Department's 2011 Human Rights Defender Award. To become law, it requires Museveni's signature within 30 days. Human rights groups are also on high alert and outspoken about the recent measures. ""President Museveni must veto this wildly discriminatory legislation, which amounts to a grave assault on human rights and makes a mockery of the Ugandan constitution,"" said Aster van Kregten, deputy Africa director at Amnesty International. ""Passing the Anti-Homosexuality Bill was a retrograde step for Uganda's Parliament, which has made some important progress on human rights in recent years, including criminalizing torture. It flies in the face of the Ugandan government's stated commitment to ensure all legislation complies with human rights."" Gay activist Frank Mugisha said that he has been verbally and physically attacked since the bill's passing and that  many Ugandans think the bill has already become law. The 2011 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award winner told journalists at a news conference in Kampala Monday that gay-rights activists will be challenging the bill in constitutional court. The activists say they will contest the lack of a quorum in parliament, which Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi has also noted, saying the House did not have the necessary number of MPs for the bill to be passed. According to a parliamentary statement, the Prime Minister tried to defer consideration of the bill, saying that government was involved in ""negotiations"" over the proposed legislation. ""I was not aware that this bill was coming up for debate. There are some issues on which we are still consulting,"" Mbabazi was quoted as saying. However the bill has public backing from the parliamentary speaker, Rebecca Kadaga, who last year had promised to pass the bill as a ""Christmas gift"" to Ugandans, but it was carried into the current session. The bill has also brought condemnations from the international community, which could lead to Uganda losing millions in donor aid. Last year, Germany cut off aid to Uganda, citing the bill as one of the reasons. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has also threatened to cut aid to Uganda over the bill. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton last week urged the Ugandan government ""to ensure respect of the principle of non-discrimination, guaranteed in the Ugandan Constitution, and to preserve a climate of tolerance for all minorities in Uganda.""","The bill calls for life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality""

"Justine Sacco, a former PR executive who sparked a firestorm of controversy on Twitter, apologized Sunday for her ""needless and careless tweet"" about AIDS in Africa. In a written statement. Sacco apologized ""for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus, I am ashamed."" She added that she is a native of South Africa and was upset that she had hurt so many people there. ""I am very sorry for the pain I caused,"" she wrote. Media company IAC ""parted ways"" Saturday with Sacco after the tweet, which read: ""Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!"" ""The offensive comment does not reflect the views and values of IAC. We take this issue very seriously, and we have parted ways with the employee in question,"" an IAC spokesman said in a statement. ""There is no excuse for the hateful statements that have been made and we condemn them unequivocally,"" he said. ""We hope, however, that time and action, and the forgiving human spirit, will not result in the wholesale condemnation of an individual who we have otherwise known to be a decent person at core."" The tweet Sacco sent before she left Friday for Cape Town, South Africa, went viral and created a social media firestorm. The incident -- Boing Boing called it ""the tweet heard round the world"" --  was a glaring reminder that every word uttered on the Internet can be heard by seemingly everyone on the Internet, sometimes with serious consequences. Sacco was the head of corporate communications for IAC, the media company chaired by Barry Diller that operates websites such as The Daily Beast, About.com, CollegeHumor and Match.com. Her whole job revolved around communicating with reporters -- which made her Twitter comment about Africa all the more shocking. Sacco was in London and about to begin a long vacation in South Africa when she wrote the message. Her Twitter account was relatively obscure when she posted it -- fewer than 500 people were following it. But the message went viral on Friday, unbeknownst to Sacco, who apparently did not have Internet access on her flight. Websites such as Valleywag and Buzzfeed highlighted Sacco's account, and soon it had thousands of followers -- and thousands of harsh replies directed at it. Some were downright hateful. Others said they felt sorry for Sacco, regardless of how offensive her Twitter message was, because she hadn't had a chance to defend herself during the 12-hour flight. As Twitter observers parsed through her public posts, many were disturbed by her previous messages. (""I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night,"" she once wrote.) Her account was a laundry list of banal complaints about poor customer service and other apparent indignities. ""It seems she has left a trail of casual racism across social media on her various travels,"" Chris Taylor, a writer for Mashable, opined. Still, Taylor wrote, ""it was hard to ignore a disturbing feeling in the mob's response"" to the Twitter messages ""and something creepy in the trial by social media that was going on in her absence."" On Friday afternoon, with hours to go before she landed, another corporate communications representative for IAC issued a statement that tried to address the online controversy. ""This is an outrageous, offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of IAC,"" the company said. ""Unfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action."" The statement led many to believe that Sacco would be reprimanded or even terminated when she landed in South Africa. Parody accounts started to appear on Twitter and Facebook that portrayed Sacco as a mean, bitter person. On Friday evening a Twitter hashtag, #HasJustineLandedYet, became a running commentary about Sacco; some people observed that she'd have to put her crisis communications expertise to the test to save her own career. Meanwhile, other Twitter users started scoping out Sacco's past messages and flagged other questionable comments she'd made before, like this one: ""I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?"" All of those messages disappeared, though, early on Saturday, when someone -- presumably Sacco -- deleted her Twitter account. IAC had no immediate comment about how or why her account was removed. Some good does seem to have come out of the incident, at least. Advocates for AIDS relief set up websites to encourage donations; one of the sites read, ""The AIDS epidemic is bigger than a tweet from a person in PR. If we want real change, we need to think beyond Justine. Let's turn that anger into something tangible.""","Top PR executive says she is very sorry and ashamed .

"Please, Mr. President, don't leave me behind. That's the gist of former U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross' plea to President Barack Obama in a letter on the fourth anniversary of Gross' imprisonment in a small military prison cell in Cuba. In the letter, Gross, convicted by a Cuban court of ""acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state,"" says he spends 23 hours a day in a small cell with two other inmates, is in poor health and is largely cut off from the outside world. ""With the utmost respect, Mr. President, I fear that my government -- the very government I was serving when I began this nightmare -- has abandoned me,"" wrote Gross, a former subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development.  ""Officials in your administration have expressed sympathy and called for my unconditional release, and I very much appreciate that. But it has not brought me home."" His wife, Judy Gross, told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" that she's fed up with apparently empty promises from government officials who have said they'll help. ""It's emotional. ... It causes me a lot of anger. I have to say right now I'm angry at the U.S. government. I'm angry at the Cuban government,"" she said Tuesday. ""I'm totally frustrated for this lack of action, that Alan is still in the same situation that he was four years ago."" Cuban authorities arrested Gross in 2009, holding him for more than a year before formally accusing him of illegally distributing prohibited satellite communications equipment to Cuban dissidents. After a brief trial in 2011, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. According to USAID, Gross was in the country to work on a U.S. government-funded project to set up individual satellite-based Internet connections in Cuba. His family has said he was working to help Jewish groups set up Web access. Despite saying that it plans to provide Cubans with Internet access, the country's government restricts the ability of everyday citizens to access the Web. The White House did not immediately comment on Gross' letter, but Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday in Brussels that the administration is ""currently engaged in some discussions"" regarding Gross' imprisonment. He said he was not at liberty to go into any detail. ""We will do everything we can and will continue to, but these things are often best resolved in quiet diplomacy, under the radar screen, behind the scenes, and that is exactly what we have been pursuing."" Numerous U.S. representatives have tried to bargain for the former contractor's release, including former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and former President Jimmy Carter, but to no avail. On Monday, the State Department released a statement calling Gross' continued imprisonment ""gravely disappointing."" ""Mr. Gross is a 64-year-old husband, father, and dedicated professional with a long history of providing aid to underserved communities in more than 50 countries,"" the State Department said. ""We reiterate our call on the Cuban government, echoing foreign leaders and even Cuba's allies, to release Alan Gross immediately and unconditionally."" Judy Gross said Tuesday that assurances from Kerry that discussions are ongoing aren't enough. ""This is something that I've heard for four years. It hasn't changed. I don't know what that means, 'doing something.' We have not been told what they're doing,"" she said. ""So at this point we feel that we have to step it up a notch, and we are asking President Obama to get personally involved in the situation and do what needs to be done to get him out."" Obama, she said, has the power to jump start the process and give Cuban officials what they've repeatedly told her they want: a chance to talk with an envoy from the U.S. government. ""I want Obama to take Alan seriously, to take the situation seriously,"" she said. ""He's the leader of the nation. He's the one that could go to the State Department, go to the Justice Department and say, 'Let's make this work.' He could do this tomorrow if he wanted to. ""How can you improve any situation without sitting down and talking? It just doesn't work that way,"" she said. At a rally across from the White House on Tuesday, she said U.S. calls for her husband's ""unconditional"" surrender would amount to a ""death sentence"" for her husband, intimating that the United States will need to bargain with Cuba for her husband's release. ""He tries so hard to hold on to hope, but it is fading fast,"" she told protesters. Gross' family says that he has lost nearly 100 pounds, has developed degenerative arthritis in his leg and has battled depression since his arrest. In a statement read to demonstrators on Tuesday, Gross said his treatment at the prison is ""stressfully demeaning and my environment is oppressive."" He does not speak Spanish and so cannot communicate with his guards or the other two inmates jailed with him, Gross said in the statement. Gross says he is allowed out of his cell for one hour a day, which he spends in a small courtyard with high walls and limited views of the sky and nothing else. ""I don't sleep much, between my arthritis and the lights in my cell, which are kept on 24 hours a day. With the exception of a few phone calls and visits, I am completely isolated from the outside world,"" he wrote. ""I have lost almost everything in the last four years, most of all time with my family -- my wife, Judy, and my daughters, Shira and Nina. I have had to ask my daughters not to visit because I cannot bear them seeing me like this, a shadow of my former self, surrounded by men with machine guns,"" he said in his letter to Obama. ""My heart is broken from acute homesickness, loneliness and disappointment from my government,"" Gross said in his statement to protesters. Gross, a longtime international development worker, said he was pleading for his release not only for his own benefit and that of his family but also for all Americans working, living or traveling abroad. ""There are countless Americans all over the world, some serving in uniform, others serving in diplomatic or civilian capacities, still others private citizens studying or traveling abroad, and they must not harbor any doubt that if they are taken captive in a foreign land, our government will move heaven and earth to secure their freedom,"" Gross wrote.","""I'm angry at the U.S. government,"" Alan Gross' wife says .

"Speaking out for the first time since nude pictures of her were leaked on the Internet, actress Scarlett Johansson defended the right to privacy, even for high-profile celebrities such as herself. Asking why protecting privacy is important is a redundant question, she told CNN's David McKenzie. ""Who doesn't want to protect their own privacy?"" she said. ""Just because you're an actor or make films or whatever doesn't mean you're not entitled to your own personal privacy. If that is sieged in some way, it feels unjust. It feels wrong.' Johansson sat down for an interview with CNN in Nairobi, Kenya, following a visit with the humanitarian group Oxfam to see first-hand the impact of the drought and famine that has hit the Horn of Africa. Her trip came after hackers allegedly stole nude photos from Johansson's cell phone and posted them online earlier this month. The 26-year-old actress has never appeared fully nude in any of her films. She told CNN that she traveled to Kenya to highlight the depth of human suffering. The ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" star has been an Oxfam ambassador since 2004. ""What struck me the most is the fact that people are just surviving,"" she said. ""They are in sort of a state of limbo."" She said she was touched by the harrowing stories of many of the people she met at refugee camps, including a woman who was forced to leave her handicapped child behind in her search for food. She said the world was increasingly becoming a smaller place and urged people to get involved with helping others.

"Actress Karen Black's long and public battle with cancer has ended with her death, her agent said Thursday. Black, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the 1970 film ""Five Easy Pieces,"" was 74. ""She was a stellar person in every area of her life,"" agent Sarabeth Schedeen wrote.  ""Smart funny talented tenacious supportive and loving.  Everyone who knew her will miss her."" Black took her fight to overcome her illness to a crowd-funding website earlier this year, raising thousands of dollars to pay for treatments she hoped to get in Europe. Her husband posted a message to donors Wednesday -- just hours before her death -- explaining that over the last months her ""health continued to deteriorate at an alarming pace."" ""She became bed-bound: the spreading cancer having eaten away part of a vertebra and nerves in her lower back,"" husband Stephen Eckelberry wrote.  ""Her left leg stopped functioning.  We could not go to Europe as we had hoped. It would have been almost impossible to travel to the airport.  So we brought alternative treatments to her bedside."" Black survived weeks longer than doctors predicted, he said.  ""I can't tell you how many times doctors and nurses have pulled me aside and told me that I better start hospice, as she was about to die."" She was placed in a nursing facility by the Motion Picture Television Fund recently, he said. Eckelberry, a filmmaker, said he captured her struggle over the past three years on film. ""I hadn't planned on doing anything with the footage, until a few weeks ago, Karen reached out to her old friend, Elliot Mintz,"" he wrote.  ""Elliot is considered a media guru who has offered advice to dozens of famous clients over the years including Karen."" As a result, Black filmed a ""deeply moving and candid conversation"" with Mintz at her bedside on June 21, which could be released on ""the right platform for some kind of presentation."" Black studied under famed acting coach Lee Strasberg in New York early in her career, while she acted on stage in off-Broadway productions in the early 1960s.  She made her Broadway debut in ""The Playroom"" in 1965. Her big screen career began with Francis Ford Coppola's ""You're a Big Boy Now"" in 1966, but it was her acting opposite Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in ""Easy Rider"" that brought her attention in 1969.  She was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her work with Jack Nicholson in ""Five Easy Pieces"" a year later.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Protesters of a tuition hike at University of California campuses stood their ground into Friday night, with 41 demonstrators at UC Berkeley cited for trespassing after their takeover of a campus building. Nearly 100 protesters at UC campuses have been arrested over the past two days in the demonstrations over a 32 percent tuition increase. The demonstrators, students and nonstudents alike, were cited for trespassing, spokeswoman Claire Holmes told CNN. Holmes said those arrested would be cited and released rather than taken to jail, per agreement with student leaders. Three students were arrested earlier at Berkeley in the wake of protests across several campuses that have shaken up the University of California system a day after officials approved a tuition increase to be enacted over the next two school years. University officials said the $505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made because of California's persistent financial crisis. Protesting students said the hike will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education. The first tuition hike, which takes effect in January, will raise undergraduate tuition to $8,373. The second hike kicks in next fall, raising tuition to $10,302, said university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka. Students who live on campus could pay up to an estimated $17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing, according to the system's July 2008 finance guide. The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition hike last year. On average, tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent, or to $7,020, since the previous school year, according to data from College Board. Students eligible for financial aid and whose families make under $70,000 will have their tuition covered, the university said. Caitlin Lawrence Toombs, a UCLA student, told CNN she'd have to request additional loans to pay for school and that with her brother starting at Berkeley soon the cost would place a heavier burden on her family. She, too, participated in the student outcries against the increase, she said. And many other students had yet to back down Friday. On the Santa Cruz campus -- where building occupations began last week with a library sit-in -- about 100 students staged a sit-in in the second-floor lobby of Kerr Hall soon after hearing the tuition hike had been approved, according to UC Santa Cruz Provost David Kliger. Many remained there Friday afternoon. The demonstrators made demands, Kliger said without listing them. They would not keep exits clear and broke into some parts of the building, he said, adding they are trespassing and could be arrested. In addition, the students could face suspension or expulsion. ""We cherish the principle of free speech,"" Kliger said. ""Regrettably, these actions go well beyond that."" At UC Berkeley on Friday morning, students occupied the second floor of Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said. Campus police broke through a barricaded of furniture and office equipment on the ground floor and arrested three students, she said. The protesters demanded the reinstatement of 38 custodial staff members recently laid off, according to a Berkeley news release. The demonstrators also asked for amnesty and for a drop of charges against any protesters. Are you there? Share your images, video . An additional 250 demonstrators remained outside Wheeler Hall into the night, according to Holmes. Authorities arrested dozens of angry students on the campus late Thursday after they refused to vacate the school's administration building. The 52 students were taken into custody by the Davis Police Department and deputies from the Yolo County Sheriff's Department, according to Claudia Morain, a UC Davis spokeswoman. The arrests at Mrak Hall, the campus' main administration building, came about four hours after the normal 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) closing time. At one point, as many as 150 students were at the building protesting the tuition increase, Morain said. UCLA's Campbell Hall was occupied for several hours Thursday evening, a school spokesman said. The takeover was not planned or sanctioned by the main protest organizer -- the United State Student Association, according to USSA representative Gabby Madriz. The same building was briefly occupied Wednesday night by several dozen student protesters, according to a UCLA news release. The building was the site of the 1969 shooting deaths of two Black Panther Party members during an internal dispute, according to the release. The UCLA campus was the scene of the largest and loudest demonstrations Thursday. ""We're fired up. Can't take it no more,"" students chanted as they marched and waved signs at UCLA. ""Education only for the rich,"" one sign read. Some faculty members and campus workers -- worried about furloughs and layoffs to come -- joined the protesting students. ""Stop cuts in education and research,"" a sign carried by a teacher said. After the regents voted, students rushed to parking decks to stage a sit-in to block regents' vehicles from leaving. Campus police and California Highway Patrol officers in riot gear stood nearby. As one regent member walked out, students lining his path shouted, ""Shame on you, shame on you."" The situation ended without incident as students gradually left the scene. University executives told the regents the fee hikes are needed because they've already made deep spending cuts in the past two years -- cuts forced by the state budget. About 26 percent of the $20 billion spent each year by the system comes from the state's general fund coupled with tuition and fees paid by students, according to a summary on the regent's Web site. The fee increases are to be balanced by a raise in ""the level of financial assistance for needy low- and middle-income students,"" according to a statement from the Board of Regents. The tuition hike is expected to raise $505 million for the university system, and about $175 million of that money is to go toward student financial aid, the board said. CNN's Alan Duke, Augie Martin, Greg Morrison and Lynn Lamanivong contributed to this report.","NEW: Nearly 100 have been arrested at UC campuses over the past two days .

"(CNN)U.S. teenager Mikaela Shiffrin successfully defended her slalom title at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado, Saturday by the slimmest of margins. The hometown favorite edged out Sweden's Frida Hansdotter by just 0.34 seconds, securing a combined time of 1 minute 38.48 seconds over two runs. Shiffrin scored the fastest first run time by 0.4 seconds but had to make up 0.38 seconds in the closing stages of her second outing to take gold and ensure she matched her medal-winning achievements of Schladming in 2013. The 19-year-old, who is also the reigning Olympic slalom champion, becomes the first woman to successfully defend a world title in the discipline since Croatia's Janica Costelic did so in 2005. Sarka Strachova of the Czech Republic finished 0.43sec back of Hansdotter to claim the final podium spot. Shiffrin's win marked the second gold for the U.S. at the championships following Ted Ligety's giant slalom victory Friday. ""It's pretty crazy now that I think about it,"" Shiffrin told the official U.S. ski team website. ""Just before my second run, I started to convince myself how much I wanted to win this race. It's about the process; it's about the turns. I'm happy."" Sunday saw the conclusion of the championships with the men's slalom and gold for France's Jean-Baptiste Grange, who regained the title he won in 2011.

"(CNN) -- Five Americans arrested this week in Pakistan were ""wholesome,"" devout young men who participated in a youth program at a community mosque in suburban Virginia, representatives of the congregation said Friday. ""I have always known these kids as fun-loving, career-focused children that had a bright future for themselves,"" said Mustafa Abu Maryam, youth coordinator at the I.C.N.A. Center, an affiliate of the the Islamic Circle of North America, in Alexandria, Virginia. ""As far as I know they were wholesome kids. Very goofy. You know, talked about girls. Very wholesome."" Portraits of Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan, and Ramy Zamzamand -- whom police say were transferred Saturday from the small town where they were seized to a more secure location in Lahore -- are slowly emerging. A sixth man -- the father of one of the five -- also was arrested, police said. Pakistani authorities described the men as college students who ""were of the opinion that a jihad must be waged against the infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world,"" a report states. Abu Maryam said members of the community are struggling to come to terms with news of their arrests in Pakistan amid suspicions they were plotting terror attacks and seeking a way to fight American troops abroad. ""I hope all of this is not true. I hope it is not what it seems,"" Abu Maryam said. Representatives of the mosque -- a modest, one-story brick house on a residential street --expressed surprise over the arrests and described the community as a small, tight-knit, patriotic congregation. ""Our youth group has always focused on community service, community involvement and community oriented events. Our main focus is to be a positive force of good in our young men's lives, Abu Maryam said . Next to the mosque is a home surrounded by a tall white fence listed in the name of the mother of Umar Farooq, one of the men arrested. The accounting student at George Mason University was born in 1985 in Sargodha, Pakistan, the city where the five Americans were arrested on Wednesday, according to a report released by Pakistani authorities. His mother said she and her husband were already in Pakistan looking for a wife for their son when she received news that her son was in the country. She said she assumed that he was there to surprise her, but he was arrested before she could meet him. She defended her son's innocence, insisting that he was in the country to visit her and to look for a wife. Down the street from the mosque is a house listed in the name of A. Minni, a 20-year-old American born in Virginia who is believed to be Ahmed Abdullah Minni, the focus of the Pakistan report. Minni regularly went online to watch attacks on the U.S. military in Afghanistan, leaving comments praising the actions, the report said. That caught the attention of militants and he was eventually contacted by a person named Saifullah, the report said. Without commenting directly on the arrests, Abu Maryam defended the mosque's activities, saying discussion of jihad had no place in the congregation or the youth program. ""Our group discussions never talked about politics, never talked about fighting against anyone, indirectly or directly. On the contrary, we always promoted being compassionate toward others and good stewards for humanity."" A few blocks south of the mosque is the housing complex where Ramy Zamzam, 22, rose from humble beginnings to Howard University's College of Dentistry. On campus, Zamzam was known as a cheerful, engaging student who enthusiastically took part in Muslim student activities. He was a member of several Facebook groups, including the Muslim Doctor Network, Tooth, FASTING MONDAYS AND THURSDAYS and Every Substitute Teacher On Earth Has Butchered My Last Name. News of his arrest set Howard's campus abuzz with speculation over why the student would leave campus before finals were set to begin. ""If Ramy was not here to take his exams it means he's throwing away this academic year,"" former university chaplain Imam Johari Abdul-Malik said. ""If he does not comes back not only does he risk this year but perhaps he's thrown away his hopes of having the life, the American dream that his family sacrificed [for].""

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel moved to defend itself in the face of international criticism Monday over its eviction of dozens of Palestinian families from a neighborhood of Jerusalem they have lived in for generations. Left-wing Israeli activists protest against the eviction of Palestinians from their homes in east Jerusalem. ""I think a lot of the criticism is simply not fair,"" said Mark Regev, a government spokesman, who described the dispute as a legal one between two private parties over who had title to a property in East Jerusalem. In the court action, a settler group sued claiming the Palestinians had violated an agreement under which they were allowed to live in the houses. ""As you know, the Israeli court system is independent and professional,"" Regev said, referring to the Supreme Court's decision that paved the way for the evictions. ""Many times it goes on the Palestinian side if they think that's where the justice is and, in this case, they ruled in favor of the Jewish side.""  Watch Regev defend Israel's actions » . After the Palestinians were moved out, two Jewish families moved in. Regev's comments came a day after the evictions drew widespread condemnation. ""Israel, the occupying power, once again has shown its commitment to the settler organizations by evicting more than 50 Palestinians, many of them children, from the houses where they have lived for more than 50 years,"" chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement. ""Tonight, while these new settlers from abroad will be accommodating themselves and their belongings in these Palestinian houses, 19 newly homeless children will have nowhere to sleep."" Regev said he understood the plight of those Palestinian families who slept Sunday night on the streets, but suggested they should have made other plans. ""They chose for this political statement,"" he said. ""Really, they should have known this was coming and made correct preparations."" And he denied the suggestion that the evictions were part of any systematic effort to move Palestinians out of East Jerusalem and move in Jewish families. ""There is no such government policy,"" he said. ""On the contrary, here you see a situation where private people bought private property and that's what it is, and the court dealt with a land dispute between two private groups of people."" The United States, the United Nations and the European Union condemned the move. ""We are all, in the international community, very upset,"" U.N. Special Envoy Robert Serry said as he surveyed the scene. None of the new Jewish residents wanted to talk with CNN. In the United States, a State Department spokesman urged Israel to refrain from ""provocative actions."" ""As Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton has stated previously, the eviction of families and demolition of homes in East Jerusalem is not in keeping with Israeli obligations under the Roadmap,"" said Robert Wood, referring to the 2003 ""Roadmap for peace"" plan. ""We urge that the government of Israel and municipal officials refrain from provocative actions in East Jerusalem, including home demolitions and evictions. Unilateral actions taken by either party cannot prejudge the outcome of negotiations and will not be recognized by the international community."" Senior State Department officials told CNN that Acting Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Feltman had conveyed the United States' concern to the Israeli ambassador in Washington. Israel has claimed East Jerusalem as part of its sovereign capital since taking the eastern part of the city from Jordan during the Six-Day War in 1967. Also condemning the evictions were British diplomats. ""We are appalled by the eviction in East Jerusalem this morning,"" the British Consulate said. ""These actions are incompatible with the Israeli professed desire for peace. We urge Israel not to allow the extremists to set the agenda."" The evictions happened as Israel and the United States have been increasingly at odds over U.S. President Barack Obama's insistence that Israel's government freeze all settlement activity as a necessary step toward advancing negotiations with Palestinians. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took strong public exception to American requests that an Israeli building project in the disputed and mostly Arab East Jerusalem be stopped. The Bush administration had no problem with such projects as long as Israel built within the construction lines of existing settlements in the occupied West Bank.","Israel incurs international criticism over eviction of Palestinian families .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Brad Blauser lives in war-torn Baghdad, where he doesn't earn a paycheck and is thousands of miles from his family. But he has no intention of leaving anytime soon. Since 2005, Brad Blauser's Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids program has distributed nearly 650 free wheelchairs. For the past four years, the Dallas, Texas, native has been providing hope to hundreds of disabled Iraqi children and their families through the distribution of pediatric wheelchairs. ""Disabled children -- they're really the forgotten ones in this war,"" said Blauser, 43. ""They are often not seen in society."" Blauser arrived in Iraq as a civilian contractor in 2004, but quit that job last year to devote himself full time to his program, without compensation. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""There's no paycheck. It's not really safe here. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" he said. An estimated one in seven Iraqi children ages 2 to 14 lives with a disability, according to UNICEF. Illnesses such as Spina bifida, palsy and polio leave them unable to walk. Some parents carry their children every day. For these children and their families, limited access to health care has taken a toll. ""A number of families don't know what's wrong with their kid. There's not a doctor available for help [and] there's no pediatric wheelchair source in this country,"" Blauser said. Blauser first learned about this situation in 2005 through Maj. David Brown, a battalion surgeon. His friend shared heartbreaking accounts of helpless children pulling themselves along the ground, or living motionless in back rooms, too big to be moved long distances very often. ""So I asked him, 'What do you need?' "" Blauser recalled. ""And he surprised me by his answer: 'I need children's wheelchairs.' "" Blauser began researching and campaigning for help from friends and family in the United States. In 30 days, 31 pediatric and small adult wheelchairs arrived in Mosul for distribution to children in need. Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born. ""The experience for me in the first distribution was awesome,"" said Blauser. ""To see the smile come across their face and [to] look over at the mothers and fathers -- they've definitely been changed."" That's the case for 3-year-old Ali Khaled Ibrahim and his family. At 8 months old, Ali was struck by a mysterious fever that left him partially paralyzed. He cannot speak and experiences increasingly frequent and violent convulsions. ""Ali's handicap affected the family a lot,"" said his father. His mother said she couldn't carry out her daily chores and her ""psychological state worsened."" ""When I heard the news of the distribution of these advanced wheelchairs, I was very happy deep down,"" she said. ""I thought maybe that will ease my work as a mother in the way I deal with my son.""  Watch Ali and other children receive their wheelchairs from Blauser's group » . Today, Ali smiles at home as he sits in his new wheelchair. His siblings giggle and sprinkle his face with kisses. The toddler's parents are thankful for the relief it has brought not only to Ali, but their entire family. The boy is among hundreds of disabled Iraqi children to benefit from Blauser's generosity. Since 2005, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids has distributed nearly 650 pediatric wheelchairs. To obtain the specialized chairs, Blauser partnered with Reach Out and Care Wheels, a nonprofit pediatric wheelchair organization in Montana. The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations, making the devices ""perfect for this environment,"" said Blauser. Through sponsor donations, his group purchases the chairs from ROC Wheels for about $200 apiece, and USAID donates shipping. Members of the the U.S. and Iraqi armies, Iraqi police and border patrol work together to carry out the distributions. Blauser and his group help adjust the children into their wheelchairs, which fit their bodies as they grow.  Watch Blauser demonstrate the specialized wheelchair » . For Blauser, who provides part-time safety consulting in exchange for room and board, an initial plan to stay for one year has become a dream to get wheelchairs to every Iraqi child who wants one. And he's determined to see it through. ""By providing what they need, I'm hoping to start a movement to change the way people think about disabled children,"" said Blauser. ""They are not a curse, they are a blessing and they deserve to have their needs met."" Want to get involved?

"The engineer who was involved in Sunday's New York train derailment apparently ""was nodding off and caught himself too late"" before the accident that killed four people and injured 67 others, a union representative who has been meeting with the man told CNN on Tuesday. Anthony Bottalico, the union representative, said engineer William Rockefeller Jr. recognizes his responsibility in the incident. ""I think most people are leaning towards human error,"" Bottalico said. Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, characterized what happened as ""highway hypnosis."" He said his client had had a full night's sleep before the crash, and that Rockefeller had no disciplinary record. In a brief conversation with investigators, Rockefeller said that moments before the derailment of the Hudson Line train in the Bronx he was ""going along and I'm in a daze. I don't know what happened,"" according to a law enforcement official familiar with that conversation. Asked by investigators what he was thinking when he said he was dazed, the engineer said he couldn't say. Rockefeller spoke to Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York Police detectives at the crash site before he was taken to the hospital Sunday. National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener told a news conference that Rockefeller would have had a chance to get the necessary sleep prior to his 5 a.m. shift the day of Sunday's accident, echoing comment from Rockefeller's lawyer. According to NTSB representatives, results from alcohol breath tests for the train engineer were negative, and both the brake and signal systems in the deadly Metro-North accident appeared to be working. Other toxicology results have not yet come back. Fatigue is a factor being investigated, according to a separate New York law enforcement source.  But Rockefeller also told investigators on site that the brakes had failed, as CNN reported previously.  Officials noted the train had been able to stop nine times at stations ahead of the crash. Weener told reporters that the train was equipped with a ""dead man's pedal,"" designed to stop the train if the engineer becomes incapacitated. But it was unclear whether that emergency system was activated. ""We don't know what that sequence was at this point,"" Weener said. ""It's too early to comment on that. But yes, there was a dead man's pedal."" Late Tuesday, the NTSB said the rail union has been kicked out of its investigation of the derailment for violating confidentiality rules. The agency specifically cited Bottalico's comments as a violation. Additional safety system urged for years . Railroad safety officials have long pushed for a system known as positive train control technology, which combines GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding or derailing. But the railroad industry has opposed the technology because of the high cost. Steven Harrod, a University of Dayton professor and expert on railway operations, said the transportation safety board has urged railroads to install PTC in some form since 1970. In 2008, Congress ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by December 2015. ""PTC would have sounded an alarm as soon as the train exceeded the speed limit,"" said Harrod. ""Technology will help. PTC will help. But there will be some other thing in the future, other ways that somebody will find to defeat the system or screw up."" On Tuesday, Weener said it's possible that PTC could have prevented a derailment involving a high-speed train such as the Metro-North accident. ""What I can say is that for more than 20 years the NTSB has recommended the implementation of PTC technology,"" Weener said.  ""These systems provide a safety redundancy by slowing or stopping the train that isn't being operated in accordance to signals, speed limits or other operating rules. PTC is proven technology that can prevent train-to-train collisions, over speed derailments and incursions into work zones."" Salvatore Arena, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the agency began work to install PTC on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad in 2009, budgeting nearly $600 million for PTC installation, including $428 million last month for a system integrator. Full implementation is estimated at $900 million. But, Arena said in a statement, implementing PTC by the 2015 deadline will difficult because much of the technology is still under development, untested and unproven on commuter railroads the size of Metro-North and LIRR. ""The MTA will continue its efforts to install PTC as quickly as possible and will continue to make all prudent and necessary investments to keep its network safe,"" Arena said. The locomotive and all seven coaches jumped the tracks while barreling into a curve at 82 mph, nearly three times the 30-mph limit for the curve, according to the NTSB. Expert: ""Twilight"" common among train crews . Harrod said the early hour of the derailment, along with the decreased rail traffic on the post-Thanksgiving weekend, also could have played a role in Rockefeller's ""daze."" Harrod called it a ""twilight"" of inattention or distraction common in transport crews on late-night and early-morning shifts. ""If he was dead, dead asleep, his hands would have come off the controls and ... some of the 'dead man' stuff would have come into play,"" said Harrod, referring to ""dead man"" mechanisms that automatically stop trains when the engineer is incapacitated. ""But if it was kind of that twilight where you're just there and still kind of gently holding onto to things but not quite really aware, which in my mind is still sleeping. That's still sleeping."" In the culture of railroad workers, Harrod said, admitting to falling asleep at the controls is almost as bad as admitting to being drunk or on drugs. ""It's very realistic that he, in fact, really did fall asleep,"" he said. ""Falling asleep at the controls of a locomotive is a horrible evil. You're not supposed to do that. He really doesn't want to come out and say, 'I fell asleep.' It's emotionally embarrassing. It's not just a rules violation. There's a psychological component. If you come out and say, 'I fell asleep,' it's just purely beyond embarrassing. It's a violation of the sacred understanding of what a train crew should do."" Rockefeller is not working or getting paid, according to Meredith Daniels, MTA spokeswoman. ""He is out of service. This is an unpaid status,"" said Daniels, adding that Rockefeller is presumed innocent until disciplinary procedures are completed. NTSB officials would not comment on Rockefeller's reported comments, but they have said fatigue is routinely investigated as a possible cause in such cases. ""We don't have the work history at the moment,"" Weener told Wolf Blitzer Monday on CNN's Situation Room. ""We will be developing what we call a 72-hour timeline, so that we have a good understanding of what sort of activities preceded this accident. That's part of our normal investigation."" Harrod said the rail and signal hardware date to World War II and, if Rockefeller was dazed or momentarily distracted, there was no system in place to alert him that he was traveling at 82 mph. ""It's a perfect-storm kind of thing,"" he said. ""You can look back in the history books of railroad accidents and there are plenty more where this came from. Events and things that happen that in and of themselves are not supposed to be bad but they turn into bad things."" Engineer cooperating with authorities . The train was about 10 miles short of its destination, Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal, when it derailed on the approach to the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx. The NTSB's interview Monday with Rockefeller was cut short because of his emotional state, Weener told CNN. The interview resumed Tuesday and was expected to continue Wednesday. ""I think it was basically emotional issues with the engineer,"" Weener said.  The crash, which took four lives, was ""a very traumatic experience for him."" Weener said Rockefeller was cooperative but was ""not up to it."" NTSB officials said it is not unusual for those who have survived fatal accidents to be emotional during interviews. Nor is it unusual for the board to allow participants additional time to complete the interview. Botallico said Rockefeller is cooperating. ""There's a lot of quotes coming from him, but when you're in a crash like this, anything you say in the beginning has to be taken with a grain of salt,"" Botallico said.  ""Bill is very distraught. I've been with him, and he really hasn't had a lot of sleep and he's just crushed by everything. I know how sincere he is and he'll be very forthcoming very shortly."" ""Billy is fully cooperating with the NTSB,"" Botallico added.  ""He needed to get some rest. He's very traumatized by the loss of life. It's best that it comes from him what happened. He's a quality human being. I know him personally. I've been a conductor and representative, and I'd be proud to have him as my engineer."" Botallico said Rockefeller started out as a janitor at Grand Central and ""worked his way up."" ""He's been in operations for quite a while,"" he said. ""He used to change the time of the trains in Grand Central. He was volunteer fireman. He's just a guy who's always gone out of his way for everyone else. It brings me to tears because the loss of life is something that -- it's the hardest thing to deal with. When you lose life it's difficult for all."" Said Harrod: ""This engineer, I'm sure, as the evidence comes out, I think we're really looking at a sad, really basic kind of inattentiveness. Nothing fancy: No alcohol, no drugs, maybe not even a cell phone. Just plain vanilla inattentiveness.""","NTSB kicks rail union out of investigation for violating confidentiality rules .

"It had been almost a century since a Japanese man made the semifinals of the U.S. Open, but world No. 10 Kei Nishikori dug deep to ensure that unfortunate milestone was not reached. The 24-year-old reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time in his career after a grueling 3-6 7-5 7-6 6-7 6-4 victory over third seed Stan Wawrinka. Nishikori has endured an energy-sapping run to the semis. Before Wednesday's arduous battle with the Swiss star, he beat Canadian fifth seed Milos Raonic in a four-hour, 19-minute marathon, which equaled the latest finish to a match at Flushing Meadows, ending at 2:26 a.m. Following his second four-hour-plus match, an exhausted Nishikori said, ""My body was OK. I got more confidence, but I don't know how I finished the game."" Noted for his speed and footwork, the rising Japanese star moved the Australian Open champion around the court, despite a stuttering start, and played brightly at the net to hold out for a historic victory. Nishikori breaks a long line of Japanese men's tennis disappointment, becoming the country's first U.S. Open semifinalist since Ichiya Kumagae's in 1918, when players were amateur and wore long pants. He's Japan's first male grand slam semifinalist since Jiri Satoh made it this far at Wimbledon in 1933. Kimiko Date Krumm, beaten in the first round last week with her 44th birthday looming, was a women's semifinalist in three grand slams in the mid-1990s, but not the U.S Open. Next up is world No. 1 Novak Djokovic on Saturday. ""Hopefully I can play 100% tennis next round,"" Nishikori told reporters. Djokovic avenged his 2012 U.S. Open final defeat by Andy Murray as he triumphed 7-6 (7-1) 6-7 (1-7) 6-2 6-4 against the British eighth seed in Wednesday's late match. Nishikori's rise has been understated, still featured as ""one to watch"" on the U.S. Open website, despite his high seeding in the tournament. Masaki Kashiwai, Head Coach of the Green Tennis School in Matsue, in Shimane prefecture, trained the nascent star until his move to the U.S.. Kashiwai said that Nishikori was obviously exceptionally talented. ""I am very proud of him,"" Kashiwai told CNN. ""He came from the countryside to make this big in the world. He gives a dream, hope and courage to Japan's young players, professional players as well as coaches that (they) might be able to reach the top."" He first picked up a racket aged five and, at the age of 14, moved to Florida to hone his considerable talent at the IMG Academy. He couldn't speak English but, just like his wins so far in New York, he gritted his teeth and set himself to the challenge. Former Japanese pro Shuzo Matsuoka, who ""discovered"" NIshikori at a tennis camp for young players in 2001, hailed his victory as ""amazing"" considering he wasn't in peak condition following his match against Raonic. Matsuoka hailed Nishikori's mentality and likened the young player to his coach, former U.S. Open finalist Michael Chang. Nishikori's result caused Matsuoka to gush: ""Nothing better than having met Kei in my life. Thank you, Kei, Congratulation(s), and let's go till the end, Kei."" The ATP Newcomer of the Year from 2008 had already made history by becoming the first Japanese player to be ranked inside the ATP Tour's top 10, with a high-water mark of 9th in May of this year. Djokovic has lost in the past three U.S. Open finals following his 2011 success, and was beaten in five out of six grand slam finals before winning Wimbledon for the second time in July. ""It's great for Kei and Japan for him to be in the semifinal. He serves and moves very well,""  the Serbian said after beating Murray in three and a half hours. Serene Serena . Meanwhile, women's No. 1 Serena Williams continued the defense of her title by reaching the semifinals with a 6-3 6-2 win over Italian 11th seed Flavia Pennetta. She came back from 3-0 down in the opening set to keep alive her bid to become the second woman in the Open Era after Chris Evert to win the tournament three years running. The American will next face Russian 17th seed Ekaterina Makarova, who defeated former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka 6-4 6-2 to earn a last-four spot for the first time at a grand slam. Makarova's only win in four clashes with Williams was at the 2012 Australian Open, but the 32-year-old -- seeking to join Evert and Martina Navratilova on 18 grand slam titles -- is wary of her younger, left-handed opponent. ""Makarova moves well. She doesn't care who she plays, she gives 100%. Those types of players are often difficult to play because it makes them better,"" Williams said. ""She also has that serve that can go out wide, or you never know where it's going to go. She has a great backhand and she's improved her forehand."" Doubles delight . Date-Krumm, meanwhile, earned a place in the semifinals of the women's doubles on Wednesday -- the first time she has done so in her long career. The Japanese veteran, who reached a quarterfinal in 1992, made the breakthrough in partnership with Czech Barbora Zahlavova -- 15 years her junior -- as they beat eighth seeds Andrea Hlavackova of the Czech Republic and Zheng Jie of China. They will next take on Makarova and her fellow Russian Elena Vesnina, the fourth seeds who knocked out the Williams sisters in their quarterfinal on Tuesday. ""I cannot believe it myself,"" Date-Krumm said. ""Recovery is difficult at my age, but I'm enjoying every moment with Barbora."" The other semifinal will feature former world No. 1 Martina Hingis, who with Pennetta will be seeking the ninth women's doubles title of her career -- but the first since 2002. They will take on third-seeded Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Sania Mirza of India.","Kei Nishikori the first Japanese man to make a grand slam semifinal in over 80 years .

""Our principle has been to share what we have and not to give what we don't,"" said Dr. Jorge Perez Avila, the director of the Pedro Kouri Institute for Tropical Medicine in Havana. ""The little we have, we share. Our principle resource is human capital."" Down the hall from Perez's office is Cuba's Ebola ""boot camp,"" an intense training program where for a minimum of two weeks, doctors and nurses are drilled on how to treat patients while not exposing themselves to the deadly virus. CNN is the only international news outlet that has been allowed to observe the preparations of the Cuban health workers before they depart for Africa. Already, 165 doctors and nurses from the island have been sent to Sierra Leone. More health workers will be dispatched to Liberia and Guinea. ""They have the courage and valor to volunteer and have signed consent forms,"" Perez said. ""We have instructed them how not to get sick, but they are at great risk. It is our hope that none of them get sick."" ""We have the conviction that perhaps a few will fall ill but the majority will not,"" he said. According to Cuban state media, more than 15,000 health workers on the island have volunteered for the risky mission. Officials said they decided to send only male doctors and nurses after seeing reports of attacks on local health care workers in hard-hit and increasingly desperate communities. ""More than one person has been attacked and even murdered,"" Perez said. The Cuban doctors and nurses will work under the supervision of the World Health Organization. If they contract Ebola, the Cubans have been told they will not be brought back to Cuba for treatment, said Dr. Jose Luis Di Fabio, who represents the WHO and Pan American Health Organization in Cuba. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . Di Fabio told CNN that while medical equipment and money are pouring in from around the world, what the region needs most are qualified medical personnel. ""You have to identify patients, diagnose patients and treat patients. If you don't have the human resources to do that, you don't have anything,"" Di Fabio said. ""Human resources in Africa is the major thing that's lacking."" In a mock field hospital, the Cuban health workers run through mass triage of Ebola patients. They are working in a M.A.S.H. unit, open-air tents. and with the afternoon sun burning high in the sky, their makeshift ER feels like an oven. CDC director on Ebola: 'Only thing like this has been AIDS' An Italian doctor training the Cubans barks orders seemingly without pausing to take a breath or drink from the bottle of water sloshing in her gesticulating hand. ""Here's how you take their blood, here's how you give them water,"" she commands. ""If the patient is unresponsive you need to move onto the next one."" Dr. Osmany Rodriguez listens intently. A veteran of Cuban medical missions to Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Rodriguez said nothing he has faced in those countries compares to the task of fighting Ebola. ""This is the biggest challenge I have confronted in my life,"" he said. In the coming days, Rodriguez will join colleagues in West Africa and, after more training there, go to the front line of the fight against Ebola. ""My family, they are a bit worried, but they know I will be taking care of everything. They will trust in my daily habits and routines in order to avoid the disease,"" Rodriguez said. ""To break the transmission is important,"" he said. ""Not for the Cuban people, not for the African people. For the whole world.""

"Steve Jobs hated Flash. Hated it. And not just a little bit. ""Flash is a spaghetti-ball piece of technology that has lousy performance and really bad security problems,"" he said, according to biographer Walter Isaacson in his book published earlier this month. On Wednesday, Adobe announced it will no longer be developing Flash, its media-player tool, for mobile devices. More than a few bloggers have noted the news would have been vindication for the late Apple co-founder, who felt betrayed by Adobe more than a decade ago. In a post on the Adobe blog, company vice-president Danny Winokur said  Flash has enabled the Web's richest content for a decade. ""However, HTML5 is now universally supported on major mobile devices, in some cases exclusively,"" he said, apparently a nod to Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod. ""This makes HTML5 the best solution for creating and deploying content in the browser across mobile platforms."" HTML5 is the emerging Web language that many developers are using. The Apple vs. Adobe standoff over Flash has been one of the tech world's most visible, and at times nasty, disputes. As the company shifts away from developing software for smartphones and tablets, it is impossible to ignore the part that Apple's steadfast refusal to use Flash on its popular mobile products may have played in the decision. Under Jobs, who died October 5 after a long battle with cancer, the iPhone became the industry's leading smartphone and the iPad emerged to virtually dominate the tablet space. While there are more phones running Google's Android software (many of them pointedly advertising their Flash compatibility), no products captured the public's imagination, and attention, quite like Apple's. As such, when Jobs blasted Flash, people listened. And blast it he did. He called it ""buggy,"" a battery hog and a product created by lazy developers. ""Allowing Flash to be ported across platforms means things get dumbed down to the lowest common denominator,"" Jobs said, according to Isaacson. ""We spend lots of effort to make our platform better and the developer doesn't get any benefit if Adobe only works with functions that every platform has."" Adobe fired back. Last year, the company bought multiplatform ads which, perhaps appropriately, flashed this message: ""We love Apple ... . What we don't love is anybody taking away your freedom to choose what you create, how you create it, and what you experience on the Web."" According to the biography, Jobs' longstanding animus toward Adobe helped form his vision for Apple's tightly controlled mobile environment. In 1999, he was flatly denied when he asked Adobe to create a version of its popular Adobe Premiere digital-graphics software for the Mac. Adobe also wouldn't rewrite Photoshop for the Mac's operating system, even though Macs were popular with designers. ""My primary insight when we were screwed by Adobe in 1999 was that we shouldn't get into any business where we didn't control both the hardware and the software, otherwise we'd get our head handed to us,"" Jobs said, according to Isaacson. The two companies go back together even further. Apple invested in Adobe in 1985 and they worked together early on. But Jobs, who in Isaacson's book comes off sometimes as vindictive and brusque as he was innovative and inspirational, told Isaacson that Adobe went downhill after founder John Warnock retired. ""The soul of Adobe disappeared when Warnock left,"" he said. ""He was the inventor, the person I related to. It's been a bunch of suits since then, and the company has turned to crap."" On Wednesday, Adobe said  its upcoming release of Flash Player 11.1 for Android and the BlackBerry PlayBook will be the platform's final mobile update. Moving forward, Winokur said, Adobe plans to work with ""key players in the HTML5 community, including Google, Apple, Microsoft and RIM.""","Steve Jobs hated Adobe's Flash, which will quit developing for mobile devices .

"Propelled by fourth-quarter attendance, SeaWorld expects an estimated $1.46 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2013, the company announced Monday. The results, while preliminary, are expected to be a record for the 50-year-old company. SeaWorld reported total revenue in 2012 of $1.42 billion, according to SEC filings. Strong attendance numbers at its flagship locations in Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas, among others, helped boost the marine park's gains, despite criticism sparked by a recent documentary that raised questions about killer whales in captivity. ""Blackfish,"" directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite and acquired by CNN at the Sundance Film Festival, first aired on October 24. Since then, at least nine musical acts, including Trace Adkins, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Heart, Cheap Trick and Barenaked Ladies, have canceled planned concert appearances at the park while other artists, such as Joan Jett and Edgar Winter, have asked that their music no longer be used in shows featuring the sound-sensitive orcas. SeaWorld has said ""Blackfish"" focuses on only a handful of events from the park's history and ignores its contributions to education, preservation and animal research. In a news release, the company noted SeaWorld's animal rehabilitation program has rescued more than 23,000 animals as of late last year. ""We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance, particularly for the SeaWorld-branded parks in Orlando and San Diego, which helped us to achieve record revenue for the year,"" said SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. President and CEO Jim Atchison in a news release. ""The success of the SeaWorld parks in 2013 suggests that the extraordinary experience offered in these parks is as meaningful today as at any point in our history. But as strong as last year was for us, we are looking forward to another great year in 2014.""","Preliminary results suggest SeaWorld will have $1.46 billion in revenue, a record .

"In a State of the Union address 50 years ago this month, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared ""unconditional war on poverty."" Over the next year and a half, anti-poverty warriors developed new health insurance programs for the elderly and the poor, increased Social Security benefits and introduced food stamps and nutritional supplements for low-income pregnant women and infants. They established Head Start programs for young children, Upward Bound and Job Corps programs for teenagers, and work-study opportunities for college students. It is often forgotten that this was a bipartisan campaign. A Republican president, Richard Nixon, and legislators from both sides of the aisle expanded the War on Poverty in the early 1970s. Nixon extended the reach of the food stamp program, added an automatic cost-of-living increase to Social Security and instituted the Supplemental Security Income system to benefit disabled adults and children. He even proposed a guaranteed national income though that died in the Senate after passing in the House. Yet in 1988, President Ronald Reagan declared that the war was over, and that ""poverty won."" His claim that ""government is not a solution to our problem; government is the problem"" still serves as the mantra for politicians seeking to dismantle America's social safety net. The truth is that the war on poverty produced some stunning successes, many of which are still felt today. And it likely could have produced more if politicians hadn't abandoned it in the 1980s, at the very moment that America's working families were facing heightened assaults on their living standards. In 1963, despite more than 15 years of prior economic expansion, the child poverty rate was almost 25%. By the early 1970s it had been lowered to 15%. Between 1967 and 1975, poverty among elders was cut in half. As of 1963, 20% of Americans living below the poverty line had never been examined by a physician; by 1970 this was true of only 8%. Between 1965 and 1980, infant mortality was halved, thanks to Medicaid and other government-subsidized health programs. The nutritional level of poor Americans improved substantially between the mid-1960s and the late 1970s, thanks to food stamp and school lunch programs. Children who received food stamps in the 1970s were less likely than children from similarly low-income families to develop diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure -- or to rely on welfare programs -- as adults. But since the late 1970s, economic insecurity has risen again, except during the brief economic boom of the late 1990s. The resurgence of poverty is not because government programs have ""gotten in the way"" but because they have not done enough to get in the way of market forces going in the wrong direction. Historically, it has required a combination of favorable employment trends and active government intervention to lower the percentage of people in poverty and raise living standards for the working middle class. During the 1960s, rising real wages for low-income and high-income workers, due in part to rapid economic growth and the spread of unionization, worked in tandem with expanding government support systems to improve Americans' well-being. After the mid-1970s, however, the free market moved in the opposite direction. Between 1973 and 1986, the real median income of families headed by a person under 30 dropped by about 27%. The rise of single-parent families contributed to this decline, but the poverty rate for young married couples with children also doubled between 1973 and 1988. Unemployment spells became more common and lengthier. Between 1979 and 1987, the real wages of high school graduates fell by 18%, while those of high school dropouts plummeted by 42%. By the 1980s, income inequality had begun its long rise to the record-setting levels we have seen in recent years. Yet during this period of falling real wages, politicians began winding down the war on poverty. In the 1980s, they shifted the tax burden from income taxes to more regressive payroll taxes, slashed investments in urban renewal, housing and transportation, and cut back on services to the poor.  Between 1970 and 1991, the purchasing power of the typical welfare benefit decreased by more than 40%. For three decades, aside from a brief respite in the 1990s, the market forces heightening financial insecurity and poverty have become even stronger, but our political leaders have failed to strengthen the social safety net enough to counteract their ill effects. In 1968, the minimum wage was 55% of the median full-time wage. Today, a minimum-wage worker earns just 37% of the median wage.  The median benefit for a family of three under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs amounts to only about one-third the poverty level, and many families are now reaching the lifetime limits imposed on eligibility. Still, as sociologist Philip Cohen shows in a study released Monday by the Council on Contemporary Families, government anti-poverty programs are all that stand in the way of an even worse scenario for American families. Tax credits for low-wage jobs and dependent children -- which bring cash refunds to many poor families -- reduce child poverty by almost 7%. Food stamps (now threatened with substantial cuts) decrease poverty by an additional 3%. As of 2011, the major means-tested aid programs in the United States were rescuing almost 2.4 million children from extreme poverty every month, even though they were leaving behind more than 1 million more. Without government programs, Cohen reports, about 15 million more people would have fallen into poverty between 2007 and 2012. It is a myth that government is the problem rather than part of the solution. In 1999, Great Britain had an even higher child poverty rate than we do today. The British government responded with an ambitious anti-poverty campaign, raising the minimum wage, increasing subsidized maternity leaves and providing free preschool for all 3- and 4-year olds. Within a decade, Britain reduced child poverty by somewhere between one-quarter and one half. Surely America can do as well.","Stephanie Coontz: Aid programs changed lives since LBJ declared ""war on poverty""

"(CNN)""So what does it feel like?"" ""Hmmm ...cool I suppose."" I didn't know what to say, I hadn't been back to Sydney for 14 years and now, here I was standing by the Opera House, looking at where I had leaped onto the top of the podium. I was the girl from Scotland, with the biggest smile, winning what was to be her first Olympic gold medal. I'm not sure, hand on heart, that I genuinely thought it would happen. So much had to come together at the right time and Sydney was my third Olympic campaign. I knew how easy it was to get it wrong, how narrow the margin is between hero and zero. But standing here 14 years on, waiting for a reaction, tears even, felt hollow, it didn't feel like ""my place."" Perhaps too much time had passed -- children, work, another gold medal. My colleague rolled his eyes in disbelief, hoping for some sort of ""moment."" How could I not feel ""it?"" Wasn't it the greatest memory of my life? Wasn't it right here that my everything changed forever? What was wrong with me? The next day we were out on the Harbor filming for MainSail, onboard the mighty Comanche, the favorite for the prestigious Rolex Sydney to Hobart race. Motoring out under that iconic bridge, the harbor coming into view, I was instantly struck by how busy it was, everywhere I looked the Harbor filled with sails. Didn't anyone here have a job to go to? So much activity. It was alive. The bustling harbor is stunningly varied in its beauty. From the harsh inhospitality of the Heads, waves crashing onto bare rock, to the sheltered bays and lush vegetation. It's no easy place to sail competitively. You really need to use all your senses to do well out here. If the wind shifts, you can really smell the warmth of the city, another slight shift and you can smell the rich pine of the park -- or if the sea breeze is on its way, that all changes again, to the fresh aromas of the ocean. Even the color of the water can help give clues to the shifting tides, the nuances in shade suggesting depth and movement, all potential aids in beating the fleet. On shore, the bustling of humanity can fill your senses. The sounds of the city, normality, regular people going about their daily business, lunching at Doyles in Watson's Bay... while you're out on the water, head down, mind on the job at hand. With Olympic success in the balance it's too easy to keep that head in the boat, to miss the stunning beaches, the rugged beauty of the Heads, but the Harbor here in Sydney really is something else. You can almost feel the history, the stories and legacy of a fully working city harbor -- for over two hundred years thousands have made a living on the waters of this iconic sheltered inlet, it's far more than just a place to race. I began to open my eyes, to breathe it all in, to remember -- every bay, every beach, each and every rock even, the buildings, the parks, those complex winds and current, the changing colors of the water.  The waves, those smells and noises drifting across from the city. It was a lifetime ago, but I'd known it all so well. It had all meant something. All those signs back then had helped me ""read"" this venue. It was so hard to race well here, it was complicated. Sure, I'd always loved it, felt energized by the challenge, but I was also fearful -- with so many variables, this harbor could easily trip you up. Now the memories flooded back -- how I'd caught the wake of the Manly ferry on a downwind leg and surfed past eight of my closest competitors. When training we used to stop on the naturalist's beach by South Head for lunch, just because we could. Sailing past Bradley's head, beautiful, sandy and empty now, but back then, bursting with spectators, and as I raced past, within touching distance of the crowd, they'd cheer me on. I'd feel a wave of support from the beaches, ""come on the Pom!"" From the start of that week I had the lead. I was relaxed. Never confused or panicked, I trusted in my knowledge of the course. I'd learned to read all those signs and now, I was making the calls, and they were paying off. While others fell apart, I grew in confidence with each and every day. I led until the penultimate race, when it all began to fall apart. I was at 16th place -- I had finally choked. I'd always wondered -- would I be one of those athletes? Within sight of glory, one hand on the gold medal and it all slips away? I came alongside my coach, Mark Littlejohn. I was in floods of tears, I'd blown it. I had let him down, I'd let myself down. He held me, he smiled, and he congratulated me. He told me how proud he was, that still with one race to go, I was on the Olympic podium, I had secured a medal for sure. The final race would decide the color. ""Trust yourself Shirls, you know this crazy Harbor better than all of them."" And I did. I knew I did. Back on Comanche, we had work to do. I had to focus on the now, with lots of filming to get through. But motoring back in, the work all done, in the shadow of the Opera House, the ""moment"" came. It had been right here, the battle for gold, I had been calm, composed, confident even. Despite the helicopter noise and spectator boats, it had been oddly silent. I had an eye on my opposition for sure, but to win here my focus couldn't be them -- it was this harbor. Sydney harbor could bite, you had to understand it, expect the unexpected -- and I did. By the last lap, gold was mine to lose. I held my nerve and crossed that finish line one last time. My life had changed, forever.","How ""the girl from Scotland"" won her first Olympic gold medal .

"A former top appointee of Chris Christie says there is evidence contradicting what the New Jersey governor has said publicly about the notorious George Washington Bridge traffic lane closures that have roiled the Republican's administration, according to the man's lawyer. David Wildstein resigned his position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December amid allegations that Christie appointees had ordered access lanes to the nation's biggest river crossing in Fort Lee closed last year to punish that town's mayor politically for not endorsing Christie for reelection. Wildstein's attorney, Alan Zegas, wrote on Friday that ""evidence exists"" contradicting Christie's recollection about the lane closures at a news conference earlier this month. ""Evidence exists ... tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two-hour press conference (on January 9),"" Zegas said in a letter to the general counsel of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge and where Wildstein had worked for the governor. Days of lane closures . The letter references the closures over a work week in September, but does not suggest that ""evidence"" contradicts anything Christie has said so far about his advisers at the time or any role they might have played in alleged political shenanigans. The letter also does not suggest that Christie had any advance knowledge of the closings. Zegas also didn't disclose the evidence. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Zegas' letter is just that. ""It's not sworn testimony. It's not proof,"" he said. Read letter from Wildstein's lawyer . Christie said at the January news conference in Trenton about the traffic mess that he ""had no knowledge of this -- of the planning, the execution or anything about it -- and that I first found out about it after it was over."" He also said he had fired a close aide, Bridget Anne Kelly, who e-mails suggest was linked to the closures. In addition to Wildstein, two other top Christie advisers left their jobs, including the man who ran his two gubernatorial campaigns. All have been subpoenaed by a state legislative committee investigating the matter that has called into question Christie's swaggering governing style, which has resonated with Garden State voters and has him as a leading potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. The U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey is also investigating the bridge scandal as well as allegations from the mayor of Hoboken that Christie administration officials last year conditioned Superstorm Sandy relief funds on her support for a redevelopment project backed by the governor. The officials, including Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, deny the assertion. Governor's office statement . A statement released by the Christie administration said the letter written by Zegas ""confirms what the governor has said all along - he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein's motivations were for closing them to begin with."" But the statement doesn't say whether or not he knew during the week of the lane closures from September 9-13 that they had been shut down. And a source in Christie's office told CNN's Jake Tapper that his advisers hadn't yet pinpointed when exactly he learned about the closures -- but stressed that it was after press reports surfaced and it was not before they occurred. For his part, Christie has given different accounts of when he first learned specifically about the traffic jams, but consistently has said that it was after the lanes were reopened and only after media reports appeared. ""I think that was the first I heard of it,"" Christie said at a December news conference about an October 1 Wall Street Journal article. ""But it was certainly well after the whole thing was over before I heard about it."" The Christie administration initially said the lane closures were part of a traffic study, which has since been called into question by e-mails suggesting key advisers carried them out. Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich told CNN he would love to know ""what they mean"" specifically about the lane closures, which ended when Port Authority's Executive Director Patrick Foye fired off an e-mail on September 13 ordered the lanes reopened. ""If it's Monday, that's one thing. If it's Friday late morning, that's another,"" Sokolich told CNN on Friday. Panel chair not seen documents . New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who chairs the legislative panel leading the investigation of the bridge scandal, told CNN that it has not yet received any documents supporting Wildstein's claim about the timing of when the governor knew about the lane closures. ""I am concerned as committee co-chair that Mr. [Alan] Zegas is now identifying documents that he has not provided to us,"" Wisniewski said. ""I'd like an explanation as to why they weren't provided before he wrote this letter (that first appeared in) the New York Times,"" Wisniewski said. Wildstein invoked his Constitutional right to not testify before the state legislators on the matter earlier this month. Wisniewski, a Democrat, said what he read in the Wildstein letter ""validates the skepticism that many people have had about the governor's statements on (January 9th). A source with knowledge of the investigation said Zegas is a well-respected attorney in New Jersey who would not likely risk his own credibility on a client like Wildstein if he didn't have documents to back up his carefully worded suggestion. Zegas' letter also challenged the Port Authority's decision to not pay Wildstein's legal expenses related to the legislative investigation. ""I would request that you kindly reconsider the Port Authority's decision,"" he asked.","Lawyer for key figure in bridge scandal releases letter with new assertion .

"(CNN) -- At a time when gas prices are at an all-time high, Americans have curtailed their driving at a historic rate. Americans are not driving as much as they did a year ago as gas prices skyrocket. The Department of Transportation said figures from March show the steepest decrease in driving ever recorded. Compared with March a year earlier, Americans drove an estimated 4.3 percent less -- that's 11 billion fewer miles, the DOT's Federal Highway Administration said Monday, calling it ""the sharpest yearly drop for any month in FHWA history."" Records have been kept since 1942. According to AAA, for the first time since 2002, Americans said they were planning to drive less over the Memorial Day weekend than they did the year before. Tracy and Adam Crews posted on iReport that their annual Memorial Day weekend has traditionally involved camping and fishing. ""Well, due to the continual rise in gas, we felt our only recourse was to nix the idea this year and stay home"" in Jacksonville, Florida, they wrote. Instead, the couple said they ""decided to camp out in the backyard. We set the tent up, just finished installing our above ground pool, and cleaned up the grill. ... We have ourselves a campsite! It's been a blast!"" Nakeisha Easterwood of Smyrna, Georgia, said with gas prices on the rise, she sometimes catches rides with friends, and doesn't drive into town more than once a day. ""It's crazy,"" she said. According to AAA, the national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose to a record $3.936. That compares with an average price per gallon of $3.23 last Memorial Day. ""With it being near $4 a gallon, you definitely have to drive slower and pick and choose when you're going to do it,"" said Steve Kahn of Roswell, Georgia, at a Memorial Day festival in Atlanta. Some Americans have turned to public transportation. Ridership increased by 2.1 percent in 2007, in part because of rising gas prices, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Americans took 10.3 billion trips on public transportation in 2007, the highest level in 50 years, the group said. The Energy Information Administration says gas consumption for the first three months of 2008 is estimated to be down about 0.6 percent from the same time period in 2007. For the summer season, gas consumption is expected to be down 0.4 percent from last year.","March figures show steepest decline in driving since 1942 .

Prosecutors argued that Willingham deliberately set the 1991 blaze -- but three reviews of the evidence by outside experts have found the fire should not have been ruled arson.

Rick Perry has kept that panel from reviewing the report, and the commission's new chairman has ordered a review of its operating rules. Critics say that may kill the probe. ""They are attempting permanently to keep the investigation from continuing and moving on, and I do believe it's because they don't like the direction the evidence is leading,"" Willingham's cousin, Pat Cox, said Thursday. The Forensic Science Commission's chairman is now John Bradley, an Austin-area district attorney with a reputation as a staunch supporter of the death penalty. Bradley has pledged to state lawmakers that the Willingham investigation ""absolutely"" will continue -- but said the panel needs better rules to guide its work, and could not say when the Willingham issue would move forward. Thursday, he told CNN that concerns of Willingham's supporters were based on ""a lot of misinformation."" ""I think that's being used very much as a side issue to politicize, through some New York lawyers, the work of the commission,"" Bradley said. ""The commission has been very clear that the commission is going to address the merits of the Willingham case."" The panel meets again Friday in Houston, and one of the items on its agenda is a legal opinion arguing that the panel has ""relatively narrow investigative jurisdiction."" The unsigned memorandum argues that the commission's mandate covers only cases on which a state-accredited forensic laboratory worked. But because Texas started accrediting crime labs in 2003, Cox and others who have backed the family say that would mean cases such as Willingham's and that of another inmate, Ernest Willis, would be dropped. State Sen. Rodney Ellis, who pushed for the commission's creation, calls the opinion flawed. The Forensic Sciences Commission ""was operating within the language and intent of the law when it determined that it had jurisdiction to investigate the case the first time in August 2008,"" Ellis said in a written statement to CNN. ""Frankly, I am surprised that the commission is even questioning whether or not it has jurisdiction, since it unanimously decided -- with the attorney general's representative in the room -- to review the cases over two years ago."" Ellis, a Houston Democrat, serves as the chairman of the board of The Innocence Project -- the ""New York lawyers"" that have supported efforts by Willingham's stepmother and cousins to clear his name. The group advocates for prisoners it says are wrongly convicted, and Ellis said the commission's work ""is too important to be bogged down in political bickering."" ""Texans need the FSC to perform its work in a timely manner, so the public can once again have confidence in forensic evidence and confidence that the truly guilty are behind bars and the innocent are free,"" he said. But Bradley said the commission has never decided to apply the logic of the legal opinion to the case on Friday's agenda. Bradley was named the panel's chairman two days before the Forensic Sciences Commission was to hear from Craig Beyler, a Maryland-based fire science expert. Beyler concluded the arson finding at the heart of the Willingham case ""could not be sustained,"" either by current standards or those in place at the time. The Innocence Project requested the investigation after a report it commissioned reached the same conclusion. Death-penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham's case could lead to the unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man. Perry, who signed off on Willingham's execution, is up for re-election in November, and his critics have accused him of trying to short-circuit that review. Perry has said he remains confident of the condemned man's guilt, and police in the town of Corsicana, where the fire occurred, say other evidence beyond the arson testimony Beyler criticized supports the prosecution. Cox, a retired nurse in Ardmore, Oklahoma, told CNN that spiking the commission's investigation would be a ""blatant miscarriage of justice."" ""The reasonable people of this country and the state of Texas can see through what this is,"" she said.","NEW: ""A lot of misinformation"" is fueling concerns, the chairman says .

"New York (CNN) -- Ten Russians allegedly involved in intelligence gathering will be expelled from the United States in short order, in exchange for Russia's release of four Russian prisoners accused of spying for the United States, officials from both countries said Thursday. The elaborately choreographed announcements emanating from both nation's capitals described a case evocative of the Cold War. In Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder said none of the 10 had passed classified information and therefore none were charged with espionage. ""They were acting as agents to a foreign power,"" he told CBS News, referring to the Russians who had been under observation by federal authorities for more than a decade. All of their children have been repatriated, he said. But White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel told PBS ""NewsHour"" that, although they didn't plead guilty to being spies, they ""were clearly caught in the business of spying."" Carlos Moreno, a lawyer representing two of the Russians, told CNN Thursday night that all 10 were in a detention center in New York City. They were to be taken to an airport in the city later Thursday or Friday, put on a plane provided by the Russian government, and flown directly to Moscow, he said. In a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said the 10 Russians agreed never to return to the United States without permission from the U.S. government. Holding them would have conferred no security benefit to the nation, they said. This ""clearly serves the interests of the United States,"" one official said. A second official said the four prisoners in Russia were in failing health, a consideration that prompted quick completion of the deal. Under the plea agreements, the defendants disclosed their true identities in court and forfeited assets attributable to the criminal offenses, the Justice Department said in a news release. ""The defendants known as 'Richard Murphy' and 'Cynthia Murphy' admitted they are Russian citizens named Vladimir Guryev and Lydia Guryev and are agents of the Russian Federation,"" it said. ""Defendants 'Michael Zottoli' and 'Patrica Mills' admitted they are Russian citizens named Mikhail Kutsik and Natalia Pereverzeva, and are agents of the Russian Federation; . ""Defendants 'Donald Howard Heathfield' and 'Tracey Lee Ann Foley' admitted they are Russian citizens named Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova, and are agents of the Russian Federation; . ""'Juan Lazaro' admitted that he is a Russian citizen named Mikhail Anatonoljevich Vasenkov and is an agent of the Russian Federation; . Defendants Vicky Pelaez, Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko, who operated in the United States under their true names, admitted that they are agents of the Russian Federation; and Chapman and Semenko admitted they are Russian citizens,"" the Justice Department said. Authorities have lost track of an 11th suspect, who was detained in Cyprus, released on bail and then failed to check in with authorities as he had promised to do. In Moscow, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree Friday pardoning the four individuals imprisoned for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies, the Kremlin press service said, according to state-run RIA Novosti. Though the four Russians were released to the custody of the United States, that does not necessarily mean they would go to the United States, an embassy spokesman said. ""Three of the Russian prisoners were convicted of treason in the form of espionage on behalf of a foreign power and are serving lengthy prison terms,"" the Justice Department said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood. ""The Russian prisoners have all served a number of years in prison and some are in poor health. The Russian government has agreed to release the Russian prisoners and their family members for resettlement."" It added, ""Some of the Russian prisoners worked for the Russian military, and/or for various Russian intelligence agencies. Three of the Russian prisoners have been accused by Russia of contacting Western intelligence agencies while they were working for the Russian (or Soviet) government."" The individuals pardoned by Russia are Alexander Zaporozhsky, Gennady Vasilenko, Sergei Skripal and Igor Sutyagin. All four appealed to the Russian president to free them after admitting their crimes against the Russian state, press secretary Natalia Timakova said. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the move was made ""in the general context of improving Russian-American relations, and the new dynamic they have been given, in the spirit of basic agreements at the highest level between Moscow and Washington on the strategic character of Russian-American partnership."" Meanwhile, a lawyer for Sutyagin, who was convicted in Russia in 2004 for spying for U.S. intelligence services, said her client arrived Thursday in Vienna, RIA-Novosti reported. Sutyagin was convicted in 2004 of passing secret data to members of U.S. intelligence services acting as employees of a British company called Alternative Futures, in exchange for monetary rewards in 1998-1999. But in Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner denied Thursday that Sutyagin had been a spy. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Elise Labott, Jill Dougherty, Eden Pontz, Deb Feyerick and Raelyn Johnson contributed to this report.","NEW: Holder: none passed classified info .

"(CNN) -- The man behind a controversial book considered a ""how-to"" guide for pedophiles was arrested in Colorado, officials in Florida said Monday. ""You cannot engage or depict children in a harmful relationship,"" said Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd as he described the Florida obscenity statute that officials used to charge Phillip Greaves with distribution of obscene material depicting minors engaged in harmful conduct. The self-published author was arrested in Pueblo, Colorado, on a Florida felony warrant after undercover detectives in Polk County purchased and received a copy of the book through the mail. He will have to be extradited to Florida to face charges. Judd said the book was Greaves' last copy, which he autographed before sending out. Greaves and his book, ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct,"" gained national attention earlier this year after Amazon.com defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of users. Amazon pulled the book from its site in early November. ""He actually provided a how-to guide to commit sexual battery against children,"" according to Judd, who said he was shocked and mortified by specific examples and illustrations using 9- and 13-year-old boys. Judd said he was frustrated that Greaves' book was protected under freedom of speech laws, even though it was created ""specifically to teach people how to sexually molest and rape children."" ""There may be nothing that the other 49 states can do, but there is something that the state of Florida can do ... to make sure we prosecute Philip Greaves for his manifesto,"" Judd said. Officials said the book talked about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex, and teaching children how to lie to their parents. Judd said Greaves' book outlined a ""code of ethics"" that showed pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children. ""The message is very clear: If you write a book, if you sell that book, if you transmit that book to anyone in our jurisdiction, then we will investigate you and arrest, because our goal is protect the children,"" the sheriff said.","Phillip Greaves arrested in Colorado on Florida warrant .

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old Kentucky woman who has been missing for more than a week is believed to be with a registered sex offender who has a history of kidnapping and unlawful confinement, authorities said Tuesday. Brittney Kustes was last seen July 17 at her grandparents' home in Brooks, just south of Louisville, according to Detective Scott McGaha of the Bullitt County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses told police that sex offender Roy Vernon Elwell, 34, was seen driving up and down the street where Kustes' grandparents live on the day she disappeared. ""Shortly after, she was gone,"" McGaha told CNN. Since her disappearance, multiple people, including friends of Elwell's, have reported seeing the pair in Louisville and the surrounding areas. ""We think they're staying close because Elwell has contacts here"" and a built-in support system, McGaha said. Kustes' mother says her daughter has a history with Elwell. ""This guy came into my daughter's life with drugs,"" Laurie Kustes told CNN affiliate WHAS. She said the last time Elwell was with her daughter, Brittney returned home addicted to methamphetamine, a drug habit she had recently kicked. McGaha, who knows Kustes personally, said he ran into the teen shortly before her disappearance, and she told him that she cleaned up her life. ""She looked really good,"" he said. Her mother echoed those words, telling WHAS, ""She was doing great. We talked every day. There was no problems for her to take off and leave. She hated this guy, actually."" McGaha indicated that Kustes appears to be in Elwell's custody against her will. ""What I believe from the information that we're getting is that drugs are being given to her,"" he said. Laurie Kustes told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" Tuesday night that ""it's a very sick, sick situation."" ""There is no way she left with him intending not to come back,"" she said. Kustes told ""Issues"" that people who have apparently seen the pair have told police that her daughter ""has tried to get away from him (Elwell)."" ""She's tried to use her cell phone and he's in control of everything,"" Kustes said. McGaha said that Elwell knows police want to speak with him about Kustes. Friends of Elwell's have told police that he laughs off requests to come in to the sheriff's office, according to McGaha. However, McGaha told ""Issues"" that ""the tips are getting stronger ... and hopefully we're going to find them soon."" Meanwhile, Elwell has been found to be noncompliant with the laws of the state's sex offender registry as he continues to evade police. The Class D felony carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, McGaha said. CNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","Brittney Kustes, 19, was last seen July 17 .

"Oklahoma lost another round in its effort to restrict abortions when the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday declined to hear an appeal in a case that would force women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound first. The justices, without comment, refused to accept the state's appeal over HB 2780, which would require healthcare providers to perform an ultrasound  scan before terminating a woman's pregnancy. Lower state courts found the law unconstitutional. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said those judges did not give proper legal weight to previous high court rulings allowing some regulation and restriction on abortions. The new law mandated that pregnant women seeking an abortion be given the chance to view the ultrasound image and be given a medical description, including ""the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, if present and viewable, and the presence of external members and internal organs, if present and viewable."" Neither the woman nor her doctor would be punished or penalized if she refused to look at those images, but the procedure,  performed either vaginally or abdominally, and the explanation would be required. State lawmakers supporting the legislation said the ultrasound requirement was designed to allow women to make an ""informed decision"" before undergoing an abortion. Abortion rights groups objected to the Oklahoma statute. ""Oklahoma's unusual law imposes serious burdens on a woman's decision whether to terminate a pregnancy,"" said the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to stay out of the case. ""It is difficult to imagine a requirement more physically invasive than the state-mandated insertion of a medical device into one's body even when the patient and the doctor think it unnecessary."" The U.S. high court last week dismissed an Oklahoma appeal on a separate state law limiting abortions performed with medicine instead of surgery. That law would have regulated the ability of doctors to prescribe a medication regime -- using RU-486 pills -- to terminate early pregnancies, and make it a crime to deviate from the federal government-approved dosage and time limits on the drugs. But many physicians, backed by abortion rights supporters, say they routinely induce medical abortions through a combination of drugs they determine is simpler, safer, and less expensive than the current federal protocols on the use of abortion drugs. This was the first of several restrictive abortion laws nationwide to get a recent review by the Supreme Court. A federal appeals court last month allowed a similar law from Texas on medical abortions to go into effect. But a coalition of abortion rights groups immediately asked the Supreme Court for an emergency injunction to block that law's enforcement. The justices could rule on that request as soon as Tuesday. The Oklahoma ultrasound case is Pruitt v. Nova Health Systems (12-1170). The pending Texas case is Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott, Texas Attorney General (12A452).","This is the second abortion law Oklahoma has had shot down recently .

"Blame it on the baby bump and our pop cultural infatuation with celebrity, but today, regular women have yet another reason to feel inadequate: motherhood. In the past decade, for the celebrity set, babies have become as fashionable as Birkin bags. The media has fueled the fertility frenzy by outing every pregnant, or potentially pregnant, Hollywood starlet. But then there's more -- with every aspect of a celeb mom's glamorized pregnancy reported, from excessive weight gain to dramatic post-partum weight loss, regular women are fed a distorted depiction of pregnancy. But perhaps nothing does a tragic disservice to women more than the media's coverage of those over-35 celebrities who seem to easily get pregnant whenever they choose, writes Tanya Selvaratnam in her new book, ""The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism and the Reality of the Biological Clock."" We've all seen the US Weekly and People magazine images. There's Halle Berry having a baby at 47 years old, and Kelly Preston doing the same. Uma Thurman had her third child at 42. Julianne Moore, Tina Fey and Salma Hayek each had daughters at 41 years old. Jane Seymour had twins at 45 and Mariah Carey birthed hers at 42. Not only do these women look ageless, they defy biology. ""One of the reasons I wrote the book was because I was frustrated by the conflicting messages and information out there,"" Selvaratnam said. ""We see celebrities having kids seemingly without any problems and we have no idea what they went through. We see the end result, but not the struggle."" Ironically, motherhood has never been so chic at a time when so many women are struggling to get pregnant. The number of women between age 40 and 44 who remain childless has doubled in a generation; in 1976 it was one out of  10, by 2006 it was one in five, according to the U.S. Census. In Selvaratnam's deeply personal and provocative book, she shares her own journey of three miscarriages, multiple IVF treatments, cancer and the ultimate toll it took on her marriage. She explores the impact of delayed motherhood and the bad information that women receive, not only from aspirational celebrity images, but also from their own doctors. Selvaratnam writes that after her first miscarriage at 37 years old, her OB-GYN told her that she still ""had time"" to get pregnant. So instead of rushing to a fertility center, she waited, and that was a serious mistake. The ""Big Lie,"" she writes is that women can do what they want on their own timetables. They can delay motherhood until they are emotionally and financially ready, secure in their careers and have found that perfect partner and if they have trouble getting pregnant, modern medicine will miraculously give them a child. Forty may be the new 30, but our ovaries have not gotten the same makeover. Even with all the advances in reproductive technology, our eggs have a finite shelf life and the odds of having a child over 40 years old are shockingly slim. According to the Southern California Center for Reproductive Medicine, a woman in her 20s has a 20-25% chance of conceiving naturally per menstrual cycle. In her early 30s, the chance of pregnancy is 15% per cycle. After 35, the odds of pregnancy without medical intervention are at 10%. After 40, that number falls to 5%, and women over 45 have a 1% chance of conception. The number of childless women in the United States today is growing. According to a Pew study conducted in 2008, about 18% of women in the United States don't have children by the end of their childbearing years. In 2008, there were 1.9 million childless women between 40 and 44, compared with 580,000 in 1976. From the Pew report: ""Among older women, ages 40-44, there are equal numbers of women who are childless by choice and those who would like children but cannot have them, according to an analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth."" Perhaps one of the greatest myths today is the ability of science to step in and make babies for women at virtually any age. Selvaratnam says that we see the success stories, but rarely hear about the huge numbers of failed attempts. A 2009 report on Assisted Reproductive Technologies, or ARTs, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the single most important factor affecting the chances of a successful pregnancy through ARTs is a woman's age. Selvaratnam reports that at age 40, the chance is 18.7%; at 42, it's 10%; at 44, it's only 2.9%. ""We are the guinea pig generation for testing the limits of our fertility, or our chances of having a child. The shock and the lack of preparation when you're not prepared and the pressure women feel in general about our reproductive selves adds to the shame women feel when they can't get pregnant,"" Selvaratnam said. She also argues that feminism may have misled Gen X women by avoiding the topic of motherhood and biology. The trend of delaying motherhood was meant to empower women, but ironically it may have boomeranged, leaving scores of women infertile and desperate to have a baby. Selvaratnam believes that we need to reset the conversation and reconcile motherhood with also being an educated, independent, successful woman. Like birth control, Selvaratnam suggests that information be promoted about fertility and the realities of delaying motherhood. She suggests that every young woman be shown a chart of her overall fertility so she understands when her eggs are best and when the number will start declining. She thinks that with the information, women can be more strategic about trying to get pregnant or at least not be blindsided if they have difficulties because they waited. The attrition rate of our eggs is startling. Selvaratnam reports that the number of eggs at a girl's first menstrual cycle is 300,000 to 400,000. By age 30, we're down to between 39,000 to 52,000, which is about 13% of the eggs we had at puberty. By age 40, we have only 3% of our initial cache of eggs -- about 9,000 to 12,000 eggs -- and many of these eggs will not be viable. Ironically, in our uber-sharing age, infertility still remains shrouded in silence. Selvaratnam wants to de-stigmatize miscarriage and infertility and get people connected and talking. ""When women have miscarriages or infertility we feel like failures. I want people to realize how common these issues are. When you see the statistics, it becomes clear you are not alone,"" Selvaratnam said. ""You look at celebs and think 'What's wrong with me?' when it seems to work out for all of these other people. But the truth is, for most people, it doesn't work out."" Selvaratnam is also hoping that her book will be a policy changer. She's advocating for better health insurance to cover infertility treatments as well as better public education for women. Changing the paradigm for women in the workplace, increasing work-life flexibility and creating more affordable child care, she believes, is also intricately linked with supporting women so they can become mothers. Taking some time off from your career, or easily coming back to your job is a fundamental issue for easing the path for women to have a baby in their late 20s or early 30s -- the optimal time for fertility, but often a terrible time to interrupt careers. ""We place so much pressure on women in regard to ... their reproductive selves and on their careers. So many women are suffering,"" Selvaratnam said. ""We need to find ways to advocate, small and big. Instead of judging each other,we should be supporting each other. I want people to look at my story and see and see how they can prevent it from happening to them.""","Tanya Selvaratnam wrote the book ""The Big Lie"" about the ""reality of the biological clock""

"Technology is everywhere. It's in our homes, cars, workplaces -- it's in your pocket right now.  This is nothing new. We have been conditioned to believe, despite the occasional dystopic summer blockbuster, that technology is making our lives easier.  We are told constantly that all these tiny computers we carry around with us are improving, keeping pace as we grow as a society and allowing us to lead more efficient, happier lives. Technology is a good thing.  I believe that to be true.   But, the more I witness its evolution, the more I think we're building it wrong much of the time.  The way technology interacts with us is ready for a serious overhaul. It is true that technology has the potential to dramatically help society.  But technology on its own doesn't accomplish those things.  It is in the transition from idea to tangible product where the fate of technology is determined. Douglas Adams once said, ""Technology is a word that describes something that doesn't work yet.""  Technologies often fail not because they don't function; they fail us because we know they're there. Technology, at its absolute best, is not a whiz-bang gadget we show off to our friends.  It is, instead, something more like the seemingly mundane anti-lock brake systems on the cars we drive. When you press your ABS brakes, you are not braking.  You are giving a robot a request.  The robot then processes the request, and brakes on your behalf.  You just push the brake in a totally natural way, expressing your intent (i.e., how fast you'd like to stop).  You offer guidance with your foot on the pedal, which allows the robot to do its work by interpreting that guidance and making sure you don't skid.  This is the processing of a high-level desire by letting the technology take care of all the low-level details. When a technology reaches this point of invisibility, it has reached its ultimate goal: becoming part of our routine, with no compromise between us and the technology.  The technology meets us 100% of the way, right where we want it and need it, right at the point where it improves our lives and takes nothing away.   It doesn't take our attention, it doesn't slow us down, and it doesn't make us change the way we live our lives. What inspired Google Glass was partly the realization that consumer technology products often don't live up to those standards.  So, we began to look more closely at the people around us and how they interact with technology.  We found they were living in a world divided between their digital lives and their in-the-moment physical lives. I know that some people worry wearable connected technologies will become just the next step down the path of draining our attention and further widening the schism between our physical lives and digital lives -- just another techno-distraction. We agree.  So, we're developing the Glass design to make it easier to bring people the technology they depend on without drawing them out of the moment.  We're building it to make digital life more elegantly and seamlessly integrated into physical life, or even to remove those barriers entirely. We aspire for Glass to help its wearers be naturally in the moment without having to ""operate"" anything. The most successful wearable technology in human history is something people don't even view as technology anymore:  eyeglasses. Invented 700 years ago, they caught on because, more than anything else, they made the world clear and visible for those whose eyes saw just a blur. And they made the world richer than if you didn't have them on. Society has embraced eyeglasses to such a large degree because they offer us the best kind of technology -- there is no owner's manual, we don't have to fight with the user interface, and we forget they are there and become aware of them only in their absence. Google Glass, if we evolve it the right way, should become a 10X improvement on that kind of experience. People wearing Glass would forget they're wearing it, just like you don't remember during the day that you are wearing regular eyeglasses -- until you aren't. The goal of Glass is to take your base sensory experience of the world and deliver it to you in a better, more livable, more enjoyable, more beautiful way -- without having to compromise on anything on your end.  It is our job to make sure, in Adams' formulation, Glass just works.","Astro Teller: The way technology interacts with us is ready for a serious overhaul .

"Stressful questioning by lawyers about ""Partridge Family"" profits apparently drove David Cassidy to drink, leading to his third drunken driving arrest in three years, his manager said Monday. ""David just completed a stint in rehab and was doing very well in sobriety,"" manager Jo-Ann Geffen said. The former teen idol will return to an undisclosed facility to resume his alcohol rehab in the wake of Friday night's arrest, Geffen said. ""He was in Los Angeles to attend depositions by Sony Pictures Television, respondents in a lawsuit filed by Cassidy in 2011 over what he claims are monies long due him from 'Partridge Family' merchandise, home video, etc.,"" she said. ""After attending his and his manager's depositions, it appears as if the pressure led to a brief relapse."" Cassidy, 63, was on his way to the Los Angeles airport  ""to return to his home in Florida and to transitional rehabilitation"" when he was stopped by a California Highway Patrol officer, she said. The singer-actor blew .19 -- twice the legal level -- on an alcohol test administered by the officer who stopped his rented Chevrolet Impala, according to a California Highway Patrol statement on Saturday. The former star of the TV series ""The Partridge Family"" was booked in a Los Angeles jail on a driving under the influence of alcohol charge early Saturday, the statement said. Jail records show he was freed on $15,000 bond several hours later. ""Cassidy was observed making a right turn on a red light, in violation of a black and white regulatory sign indicating 'No Right Turn On Red,'"" the California Highway Patrol said. The traffic stop happened off the 405 Freeway, near the Los Angeles International Airport. The officer noticed ""the odor of an alcoholic beverage was emitting from the vehicle"" when he approached Cassidy, who was alone in the car, the release said. Cassidy was arrested on a drunken driving charge in Schodack, New York, in August after he failed to dim his car's headlights at a police checkpoint, according to the police report. He blew a .10 in the Breathalyzer device, the report said. The legal blood alcohol limit is .08 in New York.  That case is still pending. Cassidy, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, entered a no contest plea as a first-time offender in February 2011 to a drunken driving charge that followed a November 2010 arrest in Florida. He was sentenced to a year's probation and his driver's license was suspended for six months for that conviction. He also attended a DUI school, paid a $500 fine and served 50 hours of community service. On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was then Cassidy's real-life stepmother). The family, all musicians, traveled to gigs in a repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as ""I Think I Love You.""","""David just completed a stint in rehab and was doing very well in sobriety,"" rep says .

"The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday threw its weight and pocketbook behind the federal investigation of a California slaughterhouse where CNN exposed issues surrounding one of the biggest meat recalls in years. The latest congressional action authorizes $1 million in additional funding to ""provide for a swift completion"" of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's probe into the Rancho Feeding Corporation. Federal investigators have said they believe the Petaluma, California-based company bought diseased dairy cows and processed them when government inspectors weren't there. After the cows were killed, employees would hide the warning signs of cancer by trimming off diseased parts, using a fake stamp of approval or even replacing the heads of sick cows with ones from healthy animals. That all contributed to the February recall of nearly 9 million pounds of meat as well as a criminal investigation, according to sources familiar with the probe. A federal law enforcement source has told CNN that charges against Rancho's former owners -- the plant has since been sold -- have been decided. But that decision has yet to become public. And in the plant where it all went down, a government inspector and a Rancho foreman were involved in an inappropriate romance, according to documents obtained by CNN. A USDA spokesman said last month that the department ""is conducting a thorough investigation into personnel issues related to this case."" Yet Reps. Jared Huffman and Mike Thompson, two Democrats from California who spearheaded Wednesday's action in the House, criticized what they characterized as the limited information federal investigators have so far provided in the case. The extra $1 million funding ""will help ensure that the inspector general, the office tasked with ensuring the integrity of USDA operations, has the support it needs from Congress to do its job and ensure that the food supply is safe,"" according to a news release. ""Many of my ranching constituents are facing serious financial losses and they can't get any information from (the) USDA about what happened,"" Huffman said on the House floor. ""We have more information from CNN than we have gotten from (the) USDA -- this is completely unacceptable,"" said Huffman, whose district includes the now-defunct Rancho plant.

"The number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30% in the past two years, according to a Pentagon report released Tuesday. The Defense Department estimated that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of ""unwanted sexual contact,"" a huge jump from the 19,300 figure in the 2010 report. ""Sexual assault is a despicable crime and one of the most serious challenges facing this department,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters at a briefing on the survey.  ""It's a threat to the safety and the welfare of our people and to the health, reputation and trust of this institution."" The actual number of sexual crimes reported in the fiscal year 2012 was 3,374, a 6% increase over the previous year, the report said. Military officials worry that many victims don't come forward because they are frightened of retaliation. But the numbers might indicate that more victims are willing to report crimes than in the past. After officer charged in sex assault, military faces questions . Hagel said victims need to be made confident they can rely on the military's justice system and that commanders will be held responsible. On Tuesday, lawmakers reiterated that it's crucial that service members feel they can come forward when they've been violated. The Defense Department has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, establishing a special victims unit to handle cases, working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit. But President Obama stressed that there must be a harder push in the military to reduce sexual assaults involving service members. ""I don't want just more speeches or awareness programs or training but ... if we find out somebody is engaging in this stuff, they are going to be held accountable,"" Obama said. ""Prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period. It is not acceptable."" Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, the head of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office for the military, said that while the prevalence rate was ""unacceptably high,"" the report did indicate one positive trend. The percentage of people who initially filed restricted reports (That remain confidential) but changed to unrestricted had risen. After sex assault case, Hagel seeks changes to military legal process . ""We see that as a sign of victim confidence, willingness to ... take their case into the law enforcement realm,"" he said. The Defense Department data from 2010 to 2012 found that the prevalence of unwanted sexual contact increased for active duty women and remained unchanged for active duty men, and men and women in the reserves. Meanwhile on Tuesday, top Air Force officials faced questions at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about an Air Force officer accused of sexual assault. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 41, served as a branch chief for the service's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program. He was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend and had been removed from current duty, an Air Force official said Monday. The official declined to be named because it is an ongoing law enforcement matter. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley what qualified Krusinski for the job in the sex assault prevention program. Krusinski is a personnel officer by training and has spent the last two-and-a-half years working on Air Force staff in policy, Welsh replied. ""He was a force support squadron commander before coming to the Pentagon."" Force support squadron addresses issues such as sexual assault coordination councils in active Air Force units, Welsh said. ""He's been around the business his entire career as a personnel officer."" Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York had strong words. ""If the man in charge for the Air Force in preventing sexual assault is being alleged to have committed a sexual assault this weekend obviously there's a failing in training and understanding of what sexual assault is and how corrosive and damaging it is to good order and discipline and how it is undermining the credibility of the greatest military force in the world,"" she said. ""This is not good enough."" McCaskill pressed Donley and Welsh. ""Did you look at his file for any kind of problems related -- I mean, clearly, the accusation is that he was drunk and sexually attacked a complete stranger in a parking lot,"" McCaskill said. ""It is hard for me to believe that someone would be accused of that behavior by a complete stranger and not have anything in their file that would indicate a problem in that regard. ""Have you looked at his file and determined that his file was absolutely pristine?"" the senator asked. Military rape victims: Stop blaming us . ""Senator, I looked at his officer record of performance which is all I could access last night. I talked to his current supervisor,"" Welsh said. ""I haven't talked to people who knew him or supervised him in the past. There is no indication in his professional record of performance or his current work place that there's any type of a problem like this."" Earlier Tuesday, Welsh said sexual assault response efforts are critically important to the Air Force and the branch ""would not quit working this problem."" In March, members of the military who were sexually assaulted gave dramatic and anguished testimony to congressional lawmakers. A former Army specialist described being raped in two different instances while she was in the service and how she felt that the military's chain of command was failing at consistently prosecuting and convicting offenders. At that hearing, high-ranking members of each branch assured lawmakers that they were working hard to end sexual assault in the armed forces. Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, an Air Force judge advocate general, told lawmakers that the branch started a program in January that provides airmen who report being victimized with an attorney to represent them. The attorneys operate independently of the prosecution's chain of command, he said. Read the entire testimony from March .","Study sought to survey 108,000 troops, only 24% responded .

"Fighters with the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria reached the triangle border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey, it said in a message posted on Twitter on Sunday. ISIS took control of Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam on Iraq's Tigris River, which provides power to the city of Mosul about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to the south, the commander of the Peshmerga Kurdish fighters who had been defending the facility said Sunday. The dam workers remained inside the facility, which fell after a 24-hour battle, Lt. Col. Herash said. A ""horrendous prospect"" ISIS -- known for killing dozens of people at a time, while carrying out public executions, crucifixions and other acts -- has taken over several cities as it seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses parts of Iraq and Syria. Daniel Pipes, the president of the Middle East Forum, said seizing dams is a tactic the group uses to gain control of a town and its people. No dam, however, is as formidable or as important to Iraq as the one in Mosul. ""If you control the Mosul Dam, you can threaten just about everybody,"" Pipes told CNN's Jonathan Mann. Pipes said the militant group now has the potential to create a flood so massive and catastrophic that it would not only cause death, destruction and chaos locally in the city of Mosul, but more than 450 kilometers (280 miles) away in Baghdad as well. ""It's a horrendous prospect,"" he said.

"(CNN)Lighting up a freshly packed pipe is just the kind of afternoon delight iReporter robcat20 likes after dealing with a stressful day at work as an insurance agent. Usually he'll put on a movie from Netflix while enjoying a good smoke from Stella, his pipe. There's just one problem: Smoking marijuana is illegal in his state of Ohio. Robcat20, who asked not to be identified by name because he fears being ""labeled as a bad person"" in his small town, says it's time that changed. ""I like weed, and I'm a good person,"" he wrote on CNN iReport. ""I am a successful businessman, a loving father, devoted husband, registered Republican, active in my community with charities, church and I give piano lessons in the evenings to children with disabilities."" The 33-year-old is not the only one who wants pot prohibition laws amended. A recent CNN/ORC International survey indicated a growing appetite for cannabis, with more than 55% of people across the United States saying marijuana should be legalized. More than half the respondents said they have tried it themselves. Ever since Colorado started selling pot legally at the start of this year, the lines to marijuana dispensaries haven't slowed down. Pot sales are blooming in Colorado now. Soon the state of Washington will be following suit, selling retail marijuana for recreational use. And on Wednesday, the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed a preliminary vote to legalize up to one ounce of marijuana for recreational use by anyone 21 or older. 10 things to know about Colorado's marijuana shops . CNN iReport asked readers if they would consider buying retail pot if it were available in their area. Setting aside arguments around the medical efficacy of marijuana, these iReporters shared their opinions on the recreational benefits of the herb -- some citing increased relaxation, creativity and a viable alternative to alcohol. No current marijuana users wanted their names used;  recreational weed is still illegal in most of the country at the state and federal levels. From college students to seasoned computer engineers, meet some of the people who want their cannabis hobby legalized: . People are 'missing out' Twenty-year-old iReporter carcar1 started smoking pot to help her fall asleep at night. But marijuana is more than just a sleep remedy for her nowadays. The university student from Allentown, Pennsylvania, works as a security dispatcher at her school and uses marijuana recreationally. To say she enjoys smoking marijuana is an understatement. ""I LOVE POT!"" she enthusiastically wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""I like to smoke with a couple people after all my work is done and the day is over to unwind and relax. I recommend everyone does that."" Since she started smoking regularly in college, she said she feels well rested. ""It definitely does not affect my grades,"" she said. ""This semester I got straight As and I am also on the Dean's List."" Even her parents and grandmother know she smokes pot, and they don't mind it. But she says they do worry about her getting caught. She can't understand why other states are not going toward legalization. ""I am very pro pot,"" she said. ""Many people have no idea what they are missing out on."" Marijuana 'makes me a better person' Computer engineer farmer808 has been smoking since middle school, when he says he saw his parents doing it. Now he's in his forties and still turns to marijuana after work to relax. Toking up is a family activity -- his wife and college-age children partake in it, too. ""My day gets better and my emotional health improves the moment I spark up. For me, it is a beautiful thing that allows me to be more of a positive person,"" he said. ""I can't speak for anyone else, but for me, marijuana is a boon to my life and helps me treat my fellow humans with the patience and kindness they deserve."" Regular marijuana use on the rise . He'd like to see his state of Hawaii take the next steps toward legalizing retail sales of marijuana. He asked not to be identified because ""there are many people who still despise marijuana users"" and he worried about it affecting his career at a multinational company. ""I am a high performing, innovative, overachiever who uses marijuana to relax after a hard day's work,"" he said. ""I have two college degrees and over a dozen patents in computer science. Like any habit, abuse leads to problems, but properly used in moderation I feel that marijuana is a boon to society."" Just want to enjoy the 'blessed herb' CELESTIAL96 says he grew up in the ""Flower Child Revolution."" The magazine writer, author and journalist first started smoking marijuana recreationally in the 1970s while living in Los Angeles. ""It made a person feel mellow and creative, it gave you a high without a hangover, and it even had a spiritual touch to it,"" he wrote in his iReport. But it wasn't until he relocated to the Caribbean to become an editor at a weekly paper that he started smoking marijuana regularly, about once a month. ""I cut down on my drinking and my quality of life as well as my creativity as a writer took off,"" he said. ""It just gives a very warm, mellow creative high that can't be explained. It has to be experienced. ""My relationship to the 'blessed herb,' as the islanders call it, is one of respect and awe,"" he said. He says ganja, another Caribbean colloquialism for marijuana, awakens his mind and spirit when it is smoked properly.  ""I have never had a bad experience with cannabis,"" he said. Now in his seventies and back in the states, he wants to be able to enjoy smoking recreationally again. ""I think marijuana should be decriminalized and made legal in every state,"" he said. ""I divide my time between Pennsylvania and Missouri, and wish both states would change the law on recreational use of marijuana."" Pot lets me 'be a productive citizen' If recreational marijuana were legal, security guard and father Tokahontas (yes, we chuckled at the username too) says he would never drink alcohol again. It's a bold statement, but he's been a firm Mary Jane fan for the past 30 years, smoking occasionally whenever he can get his hands on marijuana. He says it allows him ""to get up the next day, hangover free, and be a productive citizen."" It sounds like his wife prefers him that way, too. ""She says that when my friends and I get together and drink alcohol ... we act childish and stupid and sometimes even furniture gets broken. Plus she usually has to fight with one of us not to get behind the wheel,"" he wrote in his iReport. ""But when we gather to smoke a little bit, she says we are all easygoing and hassle free. Our biggest concern on pot night is whether or not we gave the Domino's guy the right address."" Even Lady Gaga knows pot isn't harmless . If pot were legalized in North Carolina, the ""sweet leaf"" would be ""my wine at the end of the day,"" he said. ""If pot is the gateway drug, the only drug it has led me to is more pot."" Benefits 'far outweigh' the downsides . David Harper, 65, says if pot sales were legalized where he lives he would absolutely buy -- although he's skeptical it will ever happen in his home state of Texas. The veteran and retired electrical engineer took his first hit when he was 24. ""Back in the early '70s you took what you could get,"" he said. Whether the marijuana was called ""Mexican"" or ""Jamaican"" or ""Maui Wowi"" he tried it.  His college was lax about marijuana use, so he and his roommates smoked whenever they wanted in school. ""For me, the best part was the relaxation of both mind and body,"" he said.  The former engineering major used to use it as a study aid because his mind would wander while reading his textbooks at night. ""After taking a couple of tokes -- enough to get a nice buzz -- I found that it was much easier to concentrate."" He smoked pot throughout college, but stopped after graduating out of fear he'd get arrested. ""This was unfortunate as, looking back, I would definitely say that some of my best [electrical] work was done during the early years of my career when I was using pot,"" he said. Although he no longer uses marijuana, he is thrilled to see that states like Colorado and Washington are taking progressive steps toward legalizing the retail sale of marijuana.

"As controversies over lethal injection drugs surge, Tennessee has found a way around the issue: It is bringing back the electric chair. Eight states authorize electrocution as a method of execution but only at the inmate's discretion. Now Tennessee is the first state to make use of the electric chair mandatory when lethal injection drugs are unavailable. Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam signed the measure into law Thursday. ""This is unusual and might be both cruel and unusual punishment,"" said Richard Dieter, president of the Death Penalty Information Center. Related story: No more complex lethal cocktails, say experts . ""No state says what Tennessee says. This is forcing the inmate to use electrocution,"" according to Dieter, who believes ""the inmate would have an automatic Eighth Amendment challenge."" The amendment protects against cruel and unusual punishment. ""The electric chair is clearly a brutal alternative,"" Dieter said. Related story: Botched injection stirs debate . Controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after European manufacturers, including the Denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital, banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. In April, a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma catapulted the issue back into the international spotlight. It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution. Execution witnesses said convicted murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett convulsed and writhed on the execution gurney and struggled to speak, before officials blocked the witnesses' view. Lockett died 43 minutes after being administered the first drug, CNN affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City reported. Earlier this year, a convicted murderer and rapist in Ohio, Dennis McGuire, appeared to gasp and convulse for at least 10 minutes before dying from the drug cocktail used in his execution. In 2009, the U.S.-based manufacturer of sodium thiopental, a drug also commonly used in executions, stopped making the painkiller. Many states have scrambled to find products from overseas or have used American-based compounding pharmacies to create substitutes. This month, a group of criminal justice experts recommended that federal and state governments move to a single lethal drug for executions instead of complex cocktails that can be botched. The controversy over legal injection drugs raises the question of when a case will arise to test the new law. The last death penalty by electrocution in Tennessee was that of Daryl Holton in 2007. Holton -- a convicted murderer who killed his three young sons and his ex-wife's daughter -- elected to be killed by the electric chair. Before Holton's execution, Tennessee had not used the electric chair in 47 years.","Tennessee death row inmates will be electrocuted if lethal injection drugs are unavailable .

"Check your Facebook mail lately? Didn't think so. Apparently not many others did, either. So after three-plus years, the world's largest social media outlet is pulling the plug on its little-used e-mail service, the company confirmed Tuesday. ""We're making this change because most people haven't been using their Facebook e-mail address, and we can focus on improving our mobile messaging experience for everyone,"" Facebook said in a statement. For those who do have a Facebook mail account, messages will be forwarded to the primary e-mail address listed in a user's account, the company said. The changes are planned to roll out in March, and users can turn off that forwarding option if they prefer not to have their personal inboxes flooded with these messages. ""It's a little bit of bowing to the inevitable,"" said Justin Lafferty, editor of the trade site Inside Facebook. The e-mail addresses, which showed up as messages for Facebook users, never took off, and when Facebook tried to make them the default e-mail accounts for all users in mid-2012, ""a lot of people were unhappy with that,"" he said. ""It was kind of rolled out to everyone regardless of what they wanted,"" Lafferty said. With last week's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, the fast-growing messaging service, Facebook  is focusing more on mobile messaging than e-mail these days. Facebook ventured into the e-mail field in November 2010, adding the service to the messaging system already used heavily by its 1.2 billion users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the system would complement, not compete, with entrenched e-mail giants such as Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. ""We don't expect anyone to wake up tomorrow and say, 'I'm going to shut down my Yahoo account or my Gmail account and switch exclusively to Facebook.' But we do expect a shift to more real-time  communication,"" he said. Lafferty said the reversal is unlikely to be remembered in the company's annals -- much like the service itself. ""Many people probably weren't even aware of the change,"" he said.","""It's a little bit of bowing to the inevitable,"" analyst says .

"(CNN) -- A statutory rape charge against an 18-year-old Michigan man who had sex with a 14-year-old girl has been dropped after the girl committed suicide, according to the Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor's office. ""Our witness was the evidence and her testimony was going to be our evidence in the case,"" said Maria Miller, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office. ""Our heart goes out to the family in what is just a tragic case."" The mother of Samantha Kelly made a tearful plea for justice on Wednesday after watching former defendant Joseph Tarnopolski go free. ""My daughter did not get any justice before this, and she is not getting justice now,"" Kelly's mother, June Justice, told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. Samantha Kelly's death removed evidence and testimony that might have led to a conviction, and made it impossible for the defendant to face his accuser under oath in open court, Miller said. The girl's body was discovered by her 12-year-old brother after she hanged herself in her bedroom on Monday, according to Huron Township Detective Scott Carey. Tarnopolski, who faced the specific charge of criminal sexual conduct of the third degree, acknowledged having sex with Kelly but disputed claims that it was not consensual. ""It was a mutual thing and I have text messages proving that,"" Tarnopolski told WDIV. ""It's her parents that pushed it as hard they did,"" he said. ""They said I threw her down and all that stuff. It never happened."" A police investigation indicated the sexual encounter was consensual but the alleged victim was under the age of consent, according to a written statement by Huron Township police. Despite Tarnopolski's admission of a sexual encounter, Michigan state law precludes using only the defendant's statement in proving a case. Choking back tears in front of reporters, the girl's mother said court authorities took her into a separate room where prosecutors explained the ruling before the case was dismissed. ""This is our justice system,"" she said disparagingly. News of Samantha Kelly's death rippled through the small Detroit suburb in Wayne County. ""It's torn all of us up,"" said neighbor Amy Tyree.

"(CNN) -- Authorities say the remains of a missing 911 dispatcher have been found nearly 3 1/2  years after her disappearance. Theresa Parker was last seen leaving her sister's house on March 21, 2007, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. Parker, who was 41 at the time, worked as an emergency dispatcher for Walker County in northwest Georgia. Her disappearance was widely covered in the media as hundreds of people searched for her. Sheriff John Everett of neighboring Chattooga County in Georgia said a farmer there discovered a jaw bone on Monday. He reported his discovery to authorities, who found more remains. The bones were in a wooded area near a river close to the Alabama border -- about 25 miles from the Walker County line. Dental records confirmed the remains were Theresa Parker, Everett said. Sam Parker, Theresa's husband and a former police sergeant, is in jail for her murder. He was convicted last year, even though her body had not been found. Jerry Scott of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Wednesday at a news conference that the jury that convicted Parker should feel justified in its decision. ""There have been a lot of rumors going around that Theresa had left the country, but now those 12 people will realize they did the right thing."" Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson informed Theresa Parker's family that her remains had been found. ""It's been a long 3 1/2 years,"" he said. ""They are glad to finally be able to bring her home."" Leigh Patterson who prosecuted the murder case said the family needed that closure. ""Even now, even when they were told today, I think they had still held out hope that she might come back. "" Everett says investigators are continuing to examine the remains. So far, no official cause of death has been determined.","Theresa Parker was last seen leaving her sister's house .

"After living in the city for nearly 25 years, Cesar Vargas says he will finally feel like a true New Yorker. That is, he will if Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposal to issue municipal identification cards for undocumented residents is approved in the coming weeks. The ID program would serve a half-million residents, regardless of their immigration status -- making it easier for them to report a crime, lease an apartment, open a bank account and even borrow a library book. ""Even if it's just a temporary solution for undocumented immigrants, it would great to have this,"" Vargas said, ""So if I ever get pulled over by cops again, we would be discussing why I was being pulled over instead of being questioned if my ID was valid or not."" At a time of national debate about the status of millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, some municipalities have taken steps aimed at improving their lives. ""To all of my fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented, I say: New York City is your home, too, and we will not force any of our residents to live their lives in the shadows,"" de Blasio said during his first State of the City speech February 10. The ID cards would serve undocumented immigrants as well as the homeless, low-income elderly people, former prisoners and members of the LGBTQ community who may have difficulty obtaining other government-issued IDs. Vargas, 30, said even his 70-year-old mother looked forward to getting a library card with her municipal ID, which would ""give her some sense of belonging."" Before being eligible for federal deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) status, Vargas said, he used his Mexican passport as identification, which caused some awkward encounters. ""I have a driver's license now thanks to DACA, but it says 'Temporary Visitor' in bold and it always confuses people and raises a lot of questions,"" said Vargas, who is an undocumented immigrant and law school graduate fighting for admission into the New York State Bar. DACA is a federal program enacted in 2012. It granted some undocumented young people temporary work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation. New York City's ID program would be similar programs in 11 other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles; Trenton, New Jersey; Washington; and New Haven, Connecticut. But opponents of de Blasio's proposal say the measure encourages illegal immigration and could be misused by terrorists. ""One of the reasons the 9/11 terrorists were so successful was because they had access to official identification, but since advocates of illegal immigrants carry a lot of political clout, local government will play up to that,"" Ira Mehlman, media director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told CNN. The ID program has its limitations: The cards will not be accepted by federal agencies as a form of identification, serve as a driver's license, or be valid to purchase alcohol or tobacco. Applicants would have to appear in person and present other identification, such as a passport, and proof of residency, such a utility bill or lease. Angelo Falcón, co-founder of the National Institute for Latino Policy, said the program was a step in the right direction. ""It makes a lot of sense for New York City and, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, it does bring people out of the shadows,"" Falcón said. ""Undocumented immigrants who participate economically and socially should have these IDs. Immigration is a very powerful economic motor."" For the cards to be effective, they need to be broadly accessible, linked up with private and public services, and be widely used by people who are not undocumented immigrants, Brittny Saunders, supervising attorney at the New York-based Center for Popular Democracy, told CNN. As for Cesar Vargas, he believes there's a chance undocumented immigrants could be singled out when using New York City IDs, but he believes the benefits outweigh the costs. ""It's just going to take some work from the city to educate banks and city agencies to recognize these IDs,"" Vargas said. San Francisco's example could be a template. That city has issued nearly 20,000 cards since its program was launched in 2009, an average of 4,000 a year. Public safety concerns, in part, motivated the San Francisco program. ""Residents without access to bank accounts often carry large amounts of money on them or store it in their homes, making them targets for crime. And, those who can't produce proof of identity are often reluctant to report crimes to the police,"" said Megan A. Caygill-Wallach of the San Francisco city administrator's budget and planning office. Although immigrants are victimized by crime at rates similar to or greater than the general population, they report crime at lower rates, according to studies. The underreporting of crime poses a serious public safety problem and erodes the ability of law enforcement to function effectively in the city. Immigrant advocates hope that the municipal IDs will bridge the gap between police and undocumented immigrants, as was the case in New Haven, Connecticut. New Haven was the first city to start an ID program. It has issued more than 12,000 municipal IDs in seven years. ""Over the years, it's helped residents feel like New Haven is home and they're a part of the community. For immigrants, it begins the process of assimilation and puts them on the road to full community participation,"" said Laurence Grotheer, New Haven's director of communications. Dave Hartman, public information officer for the New Haven Police Department, said he saw the need for the cards during his 19 years as an officer. ""We used to get calls from third-party complaints, like a church calling and acting as an intermediary,"" he said. ""The undocumented folks would shy away from us.

"It is one of life's biggest questions:  Are we born knowing the difference between good and evil?  Or are we taught our moral beliefs by parents and society? Philosophers and psychologists have long believed that babies are born  ""blank slates,"" and that it is the role of parents and society to teach babies the difference between right and wrong;  good and bad;  mean and nice. But a growing number of researchers now believe differently.  They believe babies are in fact born with an innate sense of morality, and while parents and society can help develop a belief system in babies, they don't create one.  A team of researchers at Yale University's Infant Cognition Center, known as The Baby Lab, showed us just how they came to that conclusion. Dr. Karen Wynn runs the Baby Lab, and she and her team have been studying the minds and behaviors of babies for decades.  About eight years ago they began running a series of studies on babies under 24 months to see how much these babies understand about good and bad behavior. The first test is the simplest.  Show a baby an example of good behavior, and then an example of bad behavior, then let the baby decide what she likes. Opinion: Do babies know right from wrong? They begin with a puppet show.  In this show, a gray cat is seen trying to open a big plastic box.  The cat tries repeatedly, but he just can't open the lid all the way.  A bunny in a green T-shirt comes along and helps open the box.  Then the scenario is repeated, but this time a bunny in an orange T-shirt comes along and slams the box shut before running away. The green bunny is nice and helpful. The orange bunny is mean and unhelpful. The baby is then presented with the two bunnies from the show.  A staff member who doesn't know which bunny was mean and which bunny was nice will offer both bunnies at the same time to the baby.  The baby's mother, who is usually present during the study, closes her eyes so as not to influence the baby in any way. Which bunny do the babies choose?  More than 80% of the babies in the study showed their preference for the good bunny, either by reaching for the good bunny or staring at it.   And with 3-month-olds, that number goes higher, to 87%. So what does this tell us? Paul Bloom, author of ""Just Babies:  The Origins of Good and Evil"" and a professor of psychology at Yale, says these studies show that even before babies can speak or walk, they judge good and bad in the actions of others because they are born with a rudimentary sense of justice. But Bloom, who is married to Wynn, says this sense of justice is ""tragically limited."" Although babies are born with an innate sense of morality, they are also born with flaws. What's your baby really thinking? He writes: ""We are by nature indifferent, even hostile to strangers; we are prone towards parochialism and bigotry.  Some of our instinctive emotional responses, most notably disgust, spur us to do terrible things, including acts of genocide."" And the role of parents and society is to overcome these limitations and further develop the innate moral beliefs that already exist in those baby minds. Skeptics of the studies say babies are not capable of making intelligent choices, and perhaps babies are drawn to a certain color, or they choose according to where the puppets are placed. The team at the Baby Lab has been very careful in their studies to change the puppets, shirt colors and placement of the animals before presenting them to various babies, and they feel confident their published research is sound. The Baby Lab has developed a series of studies based on the simple premise that babies have this simple understanding of good and bad.  The other studies explore reward and punishment, compromise and the roots of bias.","Yale University researchers say babies are born with knowledge of right and wrong .

"(Mental Floss) -- Which late night TV personality co-wrote ""It's Raining Men""? Who came up with the State Farm jingle before hitting the big time? And who was the kid lit superstar who penned Johnny Cash's ""A Boy Named Sue""? Here are the surprising names behind 10 famous creations. 1. ""Respect"" (Otis Redding) You have to respect Aretha Franklin's pipes, but she didn't pen her signature song. Crooner Otis Redding wrote the tune as a bluesy plea to a woman for his third record, 1965's soulful Otis Blue. Redding released the song as a single, and it even reached the top five on Billboard's R&B chart and number 35 on the Pop Singles Chart. While Redding's version is pretty great, the song didn't achieve immortality until Franklin recorded her chart-topping 1967 cover. The first time Redding heard Franklin's cover, he simply said, ""She done took my song."" Mental Floss: 10 unexpected Secret Service duties . 2. ""Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there!"" (Barry Manilow) Before Barry Manilow became a star, he put his Juilliard education to use by writing advertising jingles. In addition to the enduring State Farm jingle, he also cranked out ""I'm stuck on Band-Aid, 'cuz Band-Aid's stuck on me!"" Mental Floss: How to tweet yourself out of a job . 3. ""A Boy Named Sue"" (Shel Silverstein) Johnny Cash's beloved tune came from a surprising source: poet Shel Silverstein. Although Silverstein is best remembered for his children's poetry, he also penned songs for stars like Loretta Lynn, wrote plays and was a mainstay at the Playboy Mansion. Mental Floss: Silverstein's unlikely rise to kid lit superstardom . 4. Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (Peter Sagal) Did you watch ""Dirty Dancing's"" futile attempts at putting Baby in a corner and think, ""This film feels incomplete. What we need is a prequel. Not just any prequel, though. One set in Havana!""? Apparently someone did. When producers decided to film a sequel for a 2004 release, they didn't just crank out a fresh story, though. Instead, they reworked a screenplay that NPR's Peter Sagal, the host of ""Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me!"" had written in the early 1990s. Sagal's original screenplay dealt with the true story of a young American girl who witnessed the Cuban revolution, but the version that made it to the screen sucked out all of the politics and replaced them with dancing. As you might have guessed, the film was a flop, but even though not a single line of Sagal's dialogue made it to the screen, he got a story credit. 5. ""It's Raining Men"" (Paul Shaffer) Believe it or not, the Weather Girls didn't write all their own material. Stalwart songwriter Paul Jabara and David Letterman's bandleader, Paul Shaffer, actually co-wrote the number-one dance hit. In a 2009 interview with USA Today, Shaffer quipped, ""You've got to be a really straight man to write a song like 'It's Raining Men.'"" Mental Floss: Nancy Reagan and Mr. T (as Santa!) 6. The Monroe Doctrine (John Quincy Adams) John Quincy Adams wrote the Monroe Doctrine while working as Secretary of State under James Monroe in 1823. The concept that any further acts of colonization or meddling by European powers in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as acts of aggression against the U.S. helped shape American foreign policy through the Cold War, but few people remember Adams' contribution. Since Monroe introduced the doctrine during one of his State of the Union addresses, it bears his name. Amazing Found Photos of Life During Wartime . 7. ""Gettin' Jiggy wit It"" (Nas) It's a good thing Nas has hip-hop street cred to burn, because he co-wrote Will Smith's 1998 dance single ""Gettin' Jiggy wit It."" Smith's track may not make anyone forget Nas' Illmatic album, but it did spend two weeks atop the Billboard charts. 8. ""Never Learn Not to Love"" (Charles Manson) This Beach Boys track, a cut from their 1969 album 20/20, would probably have been doomed to obscurity if not for its backstory. In 1968 Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson was pals with an eccentric struggling singer-songwriter named Charles Manson. Yep, that Charles Manson. Manson gave Wilson a song called ""Cease to Exist,"" and Wilson retooled the lyrics and the melody to create ""Never Learn Not to Love."" 9. ""Me and Bobby McGee"" (Kris Kristofferson) Janis Joplin's signature song was actually the result of another great songwriter's struggles. In the mid-1960s, Kris Kristofferson was desperately trying to make it as a songwriter, but he was stuck working as a helicopter pilot for oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. He banged out a tune about how liberating it felt to have nothing left to lose, and his star began to rise. Country singer Roger Miller and folk rocker Gordon Lightfoot both scored minor hits with the song, but it didn't become a smash until Joplin recorded her own cover, which was part of her posthumously released Pearl (1971). Mental Floss: 13 bizarre stipulations in wills . 10. ""Islands in the Stream"" (The Bee Gees) This chart-topping duet for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton came from the minds of disco icons. The Bee Gees originally wrote the song as an R&B track -- various rumors postulate that it was written with either Marvin Gaye or Diana Ross in mind -- but handed it over to Rogers instead. Smart move: the song topped the country and pop charts, went double platinum, and was the best-selling single of 1983. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- My dad died when I was 2, so my mother raised us [Smith and his sister] and exposed us to different things. We took music lessons, art appreciation lessons, and we even went to finishing school. Mrs. Howard's School of Charm. My sister and I hated it at the time. We just wanted to be normal kids and eat our Frosted Flakes on Saturday mornings in front of the television, watching our Looney Tunes. My mom was a very good cook. In fact, she was a private cook for an attorney for years. She exposed my sister and I to the same types of food that she was cooking at work. We were basically the only kids on our block that had eaten lobster with drawn butter. On holidays, we would go to work with her. We'd always sit in the kitchen. I was just amazed with all the cooking ingredients and implements. I was one of those guys that was never picked to be on someone's baseball team or basketball team, so I started cooking. My mother had always had a lot of cookbooks. I just started playing around. I started baking. We always had butter; we always had flour and sugar and vanilla and eggs. I might have looked at other recipes and didn't think we had the ingredients, and I certainly didn't have money to go buy them. The first thing I baked was a cake. I was 9 or 10. It was a plain yellow cake. I can remember the icing being a little runny, but it was good. We went to Catholic school. We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays. God has always been with me. Read more about faith and religion on CNN's Belief Blog . I've certainly called on God when I'm in the kitchen, when things are going wrong, when I'm irritated or very upset about something. I've called on God walking up here to unlock the doors and come into work -- to help me at not being quick-tempered or losing my cool. Help me be the person I need to be. It [becoming a priest] is something that I thought about as a child. It was something I was going to do out of high school, and I put it off. I'm glad now that I didn't go through with it, because I was very immature. I wasn't ready. But now I feel very strongly, and I know in my heart that I'm ready to do it. I didn't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say, ""Well, I think I'll try the priesthood."" There's a lot of prayer involved. This prayer process, that's neverending. I have a spiritual director I work with, and I started out with that at first. But this process of thinking about it, it's been all my life. I developed a very close relationship with the archbishop [Archbishop Gregory Aymond of the Archdiocese of New Orleans]. He was here, at the restaurant, one night about two or three months ago, and I said, ""There's something on my mind, and I'd love to talk to you about it."" I met with him, and I wasn't home 10 minutes and the vocation director called. I set up another appointment to meet with him, and the rest is history. There are parts of it [the restaurant kitchen] that I'll miss and parts of it that I will not miss. I will miss the people. I will miss the guests. The cooking aspects, I definitely will miss. I will not miss the rushiness of it, the overwhelming feeling you get when you're working the line, and it looks like everyone is ordering at the same time. I'm hoping I can still do things [in a kitchen], but I'm hoping I can do it on a small scale, for fun. I would love to do something for the needy or poor, during the holidays when people really feel their lowest. Not just your typical out-of-the-can, warmed-up meal; I'd like to do it [serve them] just like you'd get here. Top quality. I'll move into the seminary. I am looking forward to embracing the simple life. That gives me great pleasure to think about. I want to give all of myself, and I don't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage. I have this massive cookbook collection -- close to 3,000 books -- that I'm not just going to leave or just throw away. I have thought about, if I passed away, where would it go. I want to donate it to a school. With baking, you have to follow the rules. I try to be a very good rule player. Play by the rules and work by the rules. The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me. And being able to help people and minister to people. Yesterday at Mass, one of the readings was about the widow who gave all of what she had. I want to emulate her, and I think this is the best way that I can see for me.","In his own words, an executive chef shares his spiritual journey toward the priesthood .

"Kenneth Bae's sister told CNN on Saturday that her family is ""deeply concerned"" after learning that the imprisoned  American citizen has been moved from a North Korean hospital to a labor camp. ""It's just devastating,"" Terri Chung said. ""... We're really discouraged and concerned."" Chung spoke to CNN's Don Lemon with sports agent David Sugarman, who is pushing a new social media campaign -- using #BringBaeBack -- to raise attention about Bae, 45, and increase pressure on officials in Pyongyang to release him. ""We need to get the world and the American people behind us,"" said Sugarman, who represents retired NBA player Kenny Anderson. Anderson joined another retired player, Dennis Rodman, in his recent controversial visit to North Korea. Sugarman also made a personal appeal to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""Human to human, I'm asking you to release Kenneth Bae. I'm going to take it a step further: If the North Korea government actually needs somebody in North Korea, take David Sugarman,"" Sugarman said. ""Allow me to go there. I'm younger. I'm healthier. ""You have released prisoners before, and I'm asking you to release Kenneth Bae,"" Sugarman continued. U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, said the public pressure could work on North Korea. ""People like David should be all over the country,"" Rangel said. ""Churches and synagogues should be pleading to this government that this has nothing to do with communism and the United States of America. It's a brother and a father and a son, and they should be responding to this effort."" Chung described her family's quest to free Bae as ""all consuming."" ""This is our whole life,"" Chung said. ""We will not rest easy until his feet touch U.S. soil."" Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. The North Koreans say he was picked up for a crime against the state. A devout Christian and father of three, Bae operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website that friends set up to promote his release. The North Korean government accused Bae of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. Last month, he told reporters that he had committed a ""serious crime"" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime. On Friday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki that Washington is ""deeply concerned"" about Bae's recent move to a North Korean labor camp. Choson Sinbo -- a pro-North Korean publication with offices in Tokyo and Pyongyang that has claimed to have interviewed Bae in the past -- indicated in a report on its website Saturday that it had talked to him again. According to the site, Bae said he'd been at a labor camp for about three weeks, during which time he works and also has some time to watch television and read books. Choson Sinbo claims that Bae has been told to expect a visit from Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, as early as this coming Monday. Psaki said late last month that the United States is ""prepared to send Ambassador King"" to North Korea to discuss Bae. ""There isn't a plan right now for Ambassador King to travel there,"" she said on January 29.","Sports agent makes plea to North Korea, offering himself in place of Bae .

"Washington (CNN) -- In 2002, a male killer whale, or orca, who had been on public display in concrete tanks for 19 years, swam off on his own into the Atlantic Ocean. Keiko, the star of the movie ""Free Willy,"" had been rescued from a tiny tank, sent to recover his health in a larger tank, and then finally returned to his native waters of Iceland. He spent two years adjusting to life in the habitat of his infancy, gaining more independence as the days and months went by, until he was finally allowed out of his pen without a tether, to swim freely in the ocean for the first time since 1979. After interacting with the wild orcas now and again and spending hours exploring the coast of the Westmann Islands, Keiko decided to head off toward the horizon with a pod of wild whales. For his entire five-week journey across hundreds of miles of open sea, researchers tracked Keiko with a satellite tag. He went more or less in a straight line, ending up in Norway. He had lost little or no weight, suggesting he had been feeding himself, at least a bit. Somewhere along the way Keiko had parted ways with the wild whales and had been alone for more time than he apparently liked; he arrived in Norway's Taknes fjord eager for company. He found companionship in the form of boats and even intrepid Norwegian children who got into the frigid north Atlantic waters to welcome him. After a bit too much attention, Keiko's caretakers from the Keiko Project, which my organization managed at that time, arrived to once again take up their duties. Keiko had shown he could adjust again to his natural habitat, but he wasn't ready to be independent. He wanted human companionship and he had it, coming and going as he pleased but always returning to the project team, who took up residence in a house in the fjord. He died more than a year later, probably from pneumonia. Now there is Tilikum. Tilikum, the longtime captive orca who drowned veteran Sea World trainer Dawn Brancheau on February 24, is at a crossroads. He has been involved in three fatal interactions now. He is the largest orca in captivity and is often kept in a small side pool that is barely large enough for him to turn around. He is 30 or 31 years old, as old as any captive male orca before him has ever lived. Most captive male orcas die in their teens or early 20s at best, with only a handful reaching their late 20s and only three making it past 30, although this is only middle-aged for a wild male. He has fathered more than a dozen calves, but SeaWorld has perfected artificial insemination, so his physical presence isn't even needed for breeding. So what should SeaWorld do with him after this latest incident? How can it ensure his well-being and the safety of its employees? SeaWorld should try thinking outside the swimming pool when it considers its options for Tilikum's future. Tilikum needs something he isn't getting in a concrete enclosure. The idea of keeping captive such a large, complex, intelligent predator for our entertainment may no longer be acceptable in the 21st century. Trainer safety with Tilikum is a serious concern. If he stays in a SeaWorld tank, putting distance between him and his trainers will only further isolate him, which is completely unnatural and stressful for a social species like orcas. Keeping him out of the shows will only increase his inactivity and boredom. However, Keiko actually had only limited physical contact with his trainers, in an effort to increase his independence, but he was never bored or inactive -- he had so much to hold his interest in his natural environment. If Tilikum were moved to a sea pen (ideally in Iceland, where he too was captured, in 1983), he would be stimulated enough even without direct contact with his caretakers. This would maximize both his welfare and his caretakers' safety. It would be stressful to move him. A transport of an adult orca is no small matter and significant risk would be involved. The whale has to be placed in a specially designed sling, hoisted into a box half-filled with water, and trucked to a plane like a 747 or a troop transport that requires an experienced pilot to avoid unbalancing the load. But significant risk is involved in leaving him where he is, as he is -- leaving him in the same circumstances that have, over his 27 years in a box, led to the deaths of three people. It's time to change the playbook. It's time to try something new. It's time to follow Keiko's fin strokes and try again to give a captive orca a better life, a more natural life, a more respectful life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Naomi A. Rose.","Keiko, the star of ""Free Willy,"" was released into the Atlantic after 19 years of captivity .

"The United States is advising airlines with direct flights serving Russia to be aware of the possibility that explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said Wednesday night. Rep. Michael McCaul said the Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin to airlines flying into Russia  warning of the potential threat. The bulletin, the Texas Republican said, indicated that officials believed the explosives might be used during flights or smuggled into the city of Sochi, where competition at the Winter Olympics begins Thursday. The opening ceremony is Friday. A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that the cause for the Homeland Security alert was specific to the imminent start of the games. According to the source, authorities have increasing confidence about the safety of Sochi and the Olympic venues. Still, U.S. intelligence is picking up increasing chatter that causes worry about targets outside  the Sochi area, including regional transportation links. The biggest ongoing worry outside this new concern -- as expected -- is groups based in southern Russia's Caucasus region, in particular the restive Dagestan republic. However, U.S. officials also are worried that al Qaeda-linked groups from elsewhere could take advantage of the attention being focused on Russian militant groups. The concern about the use of toothpaste tubes is mostly focused on flights from Europe and neighboring Asian countries -- in part because the United States has less intelligence-sharing with those nations. A separate U.S. official with knowledge of the current situation, who would not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the U.S. intelligence community is still assessing the credibility and scope of the threat. The official said the Russians brought some information to the United States. Two senior administration officials told CNN that U.S. authorities had intelligence that they shared with the Russians. Assessing the credibility includes looking at the latest intelligence about the location and capabilities of known terrorist bomb makers and which groups may have the ability to build a bomb in a container such as a toothpaste tube. Such a device would likely require hard-to-detect explosives and little or no metal content in other critical parts, such as the detonator. Observers ask: Is Sochi ready? No known threat to the United States . Earlier Wednesday, a different law enforcement source emphasized  there was no known threat to the United States, but the notice to U.S. and international air carriers is based on new intelligence information. ""It's real. It's real and we got very good information,"" a government source, who did not want to speak for full attribution, told CNN. ""It's based on a credible source. We're taking it seriously. So are other countries. ..."" Homeland Security said that ""out of an abundance of caution"" it routinely shares ""relevant information"" with domestic and international entities, ""including those associated with international events"" like the Sochi Olympics. A large majority of direct flights into Russia will come from Europe or neighboring Asian countries. Only a few will originate in the United States. Russian transportation officials have banned liquids in airline carry-on luggage ahead of the games, according to a report from the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. A former airline security chief anticipated that the threat will prompt authorities in the United States and Europe to clamp down on toothpaste and cosmetics. ""My prediction is that they will give a direct order that they'll be removing toothpaste from passengers' hand-carried items"" and possibly from checked luggage as well, said Glen Winn, a former security director at United and Continental airlines. CNN poll: 57% of Americans think terror attack likely at Sochi Games . How far-reaching is 'ring of steel'? Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration officials declined to say what, if any, security actions they are contemplating in light of the threat. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's subcommittee on terrorism and Intelligence, said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that Americans, the airlines and those at the Olympics should take the threat ""very seriously."" King, a New York Republican, said he believes the athletes and American spectators are ""reasonably safe,"" but noted that he would not go himself. ""Just as a spectator, I don't think it's worth the risk.  I mean, odds are nothing is going to happen, but the odds are higher than for any other Olympics, I believe, that something could happen,"" he said. King said he has some confidence in how the Russians are handling security, but ""really not enough because they are not sharing enough intelligence"" about what's happening inside the country. ""We are getting some information about what's happening outside of Russia, some external threats, that type thing, or potential threats. I don't want to overstate that,"" he said. He noted a ""ring of steel right around the Olympics itself"" but said ""there's a real cause for concern"" about getting to Sochi and surrounding areas. 'Anybody who wants to go ...  should go' The Obama administration has not indicated it is not safe to travel to the Olympics. Secretary of State John Kerry, in an exclusive interview with CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" before the toothpaste alert broke, said that ""anybody who wants to go to the Olympics, which are just a great event, should go. And we're not telling people not to go."" Kerry added that people should be alert and take precautions, advice he says has been requisite since the 9/11 attacks. ""We've got a new consciousness about this,"" he said. A senior administration official said it would make any information public through the State Department should it receive information that ""changes our assessment of whether people should travel to Sochi."" Matthew Olsen, a top U.S. counterterrorism official, highlighted concern in testimony to Congress on Tuesday about whether Muslim fundamentalists in disputed regions of Russia -- or other groups -- could launch attacks on selected targets. ""There are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we're tracking,"" he said. ""And we're working very closely with the Russians and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those."" CNN has learned this threat is the one Olsen was referring to in his testimony. Terrorism experts say that airlines continue to be a target of terrorists wishing to make a spectacular impact with an attack. The focus since 2001 has shifted from hijackings to bombs, especially those that might be hidden in luggage. U.S. authorities are also mindful of creative packaging or other novel ways to conceal explosives. For instance, a failed attempt to blow up an overseas flight heading to Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 involved a bomb concealed in a passenger's underwear. Shortly after 9/11 a man was convicted of trying to blow up a transatlantic flight with explosives hidden in his shoes.

"In stark contrast to the bellicose gesturing that has haunted relations in the recent past, North and South Korea took conciliatory steps in each other's direction Friday. Both sides will halt the harsh rhetoric, they agreed at a bilateral meeting on the heavily militarized border that divides them. They hope that this and other agreements will serve to build trust between Pyongyang and Seoul, Kim Kyou-Hyun, a high South Korean security official, said after the meeting wrapped up. Pyongyang has been particularly irked by joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, and would like them to cease. The next ones are scheduled for later this month, and the North views them as a prelude to an invasion. Last year, Pyongyang's threatening rhetoric reached alarming levels during the exercises, heightening tensions in the region. Last week, the North threatened that if February's maneuvers went forward, it would back out of planned visits between members of Korean families separated from one another since the civil war in the 1950s. But, on Friday, they agreed to let them go forward. The reunions of about 200 people -- 100 from each country -- are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25 at a resort on the North's side of the border. They coincide with the planned military exercises. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the countries to build on the momentum that will be generated by their agreement to hold family reunions. ""Tension between the two Koreas has been high and inter-Korean relations have remained strained for far too long. As such, this important development is a step in the right direction,"" Ban said in a statement Friday. He encouraged both sides to continue high-level engagement and take further steps to build confidence and trust. Trust us . So far, South Korea and the United States have rejected the North's calls for this year's joint drills to be called off. In September, North Korea canceled a previous round of family reunions with only a few days' notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries. Officials from the North told the delegation from the South on Friday that it feels the military exercises and the humanitarian issue are connected, Kim said. The South rejected that connection in principle but asked the North for its trust in working out tensions over the joint military exercises. The North agreed to this. Both sides also decided to hold another meeting at a future date, Kim said. The current talks at the Panmunjom Peace House came at the suggestion of the North and took place Wednesday and Friday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Seoul on Thursday, where he met with South Korea's President  Park Geun-hye. He reiterated Washington's stance that the United States will not accept a nuclear armed North Korea and criticized a lack of progress by Pyongyang on this issue. Kerry visited Beijing on Friday, in part to talk with Chinese leaders about their influence over Pyongyang.","U.N. leader urges countries to advance high-level engagement .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A drug charge against Paris Hilton, who was detained Friday in South Africa on suspicion of marijuana possession, has been dropped, police said. Hilton and another woman, Jennifer Rovero, were taken into custody at the Nelson Mandela Bay stadium on possession charges, police said in a statement. The single count against the heiress was dropped after Rovero pleaded guilty to the same charge, police said. She faces a fine. Hilton appeared calm when she appeared before a magistrate judge in Port Elizabeth, a reporter for affiliate ETV told CNN. Rovero works as a freelance photographer for Hilton, reporter Lance Witten said. Hilton's publicist, in a statement to CNN, said the incident ""was a complete misunderstanding, and it was actually another person in the group who did it."" Dawn Miller, the publicist, said Hilton was accused of smoking marijuana and said ""no charges will be made"" against her. ""The authorities have apologized for wrongfully accusing her since she had nothing to do with the incident,"" Miller said. Miller said Hilton was in South Africa for the World Cup. Police said they approached the two women after smelling marijuana outside the stadium where a match had been played. Hilton and Rovero were ushered into the stadium after a marijuana cigarette was tossed on the floor, police said. They were spotted again inside the stadium, and a bodyguard handed over a second cigarette to authorities, police said.","Hilton, photographer taken into custody at stadium .

"(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush defended his administration's handling of the war in Afghanistan on Sunday, telling CNN that some NATO allies who contributed troops to the conflict ""turned out not to be willing to fight."" In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush strongly refuted criticism that his administration took its ""eye off the ball"" in Afghanistan when he ordered troops to invade Iraq. He said he ordered American forces to overthrow Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein with the assumption that allied forces would help make up the difference in Afghanistan. ""What happened in Afghanistan was that our NATO allies, some of them, turned out not to be willing to fight,"" Bush said. ""Therefore, our assumption that we had ample troops -- U.S. and NATO troops -- turned out to be a not-true assumption. So we adjusted."" The former president didn't name any countries specifically from NATO, which includes 28 nations in Europe and North America. Some 785 military personnel from NATO countries besides the United States have been killed in Afghanistan since hostilities began in October 2001, with the United Kingdom, Canada and France having the most fatalities. The comments by the 43rd U.S. president, along with those of his brother and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, aired during a CNN special, ""Bush: Two Years Later."" The former president addressed a host of matters in the interview, which came days after the release of his 481-page memoir, ""Decision Points,"" and two days ahead of the groundbreaking for his presidential library and museum on Southern Methodist University's campus in Dallas, Texas. Bush said he ""felt terrible"" that weapons of mass destruction were never found in Iraq, despite the administration's persistent and insistent case that Saddam Hussein had them before the invasion. But while he took responsibility for the big push on and subsequent lack of WMDs, the former president said he still thought the Iraq war was justified. ""If (Saddam Hussein) was in power today, the world would be a lot worse off,"" he said. ""I believe that a free Iraq will be transformative in the Middle East."" Bush said he had no regrets, too, about his decision near the end of his second term to push the 2008 federal bailout that loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to companies including AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America and General Motors. President Barack Obama later successfully pressed to use billions more in federal funds to buttress the U.S. economy, as it struggled through what's been called ""The Great Recession"" marked by high unemployment and rounds of foreclosures in a percolating real estate crisis. ""I set aside my free market principles and made a very difficult decision,"" Bush said. ""I believe that those decisions ... did prevent the economy from heading into a depression."" Bush said he was dismayed when his administration's efforts to efforts to change the Social Security system -- an effort to control its costs -- failed to bear fruit. In late 2004 and early 2005, his administration laid out proposals to overhaul Social Security, in part by creating individual investment accounts that would act more like a traditional 401k and replace the current collective Social Security pool. But the plan floundered under pressure from Democrats and special interest groups such as the AARP, and Congress never even saw any formal legislation, much less voted on it. ""Not reforming Social Security was a huge disappointment,"" Bush said. Jeb Bush joined his brother for part of the CNN interview, saying he never publicly disagreed with George W. Bush when he was president and is ""not going to start now."" Alluding to the hyperpartisanship in Washington, the former Florida governor said there's still room for civility in politics. ""I don't think you can be against everything, just because someone has a D (for Democrat) by their name and you have an R (for Republican) by your name,"" Jeb Bush said. George W. Bush said that he was mindful not to get involved in ""name calling"" as president, adding that he wasn't bothered when he was targeted. Bush said, too, that he didn't support Republicans challenging Democrats' patriotism just because they disagreed with them. ""I don't remember doing that personally, and that was uncalled for if that was the case,"" he said. ""Patriotic people disagreed with my decisions."" One Democrat he has no qualms with is his Oval Office predecessor, Bill Clinton. Bush said he ""genuinely liked"" Clinton, whom he called one of his ""buddies,"" in part because he's been so ""gracious"" to his father, George H.W. Bush. iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush . The Bush brothers both said Republicans' setbacks in recent election among Latinos -- which voted Democrat by a 2-to-1 margin -- should be a top concern for the party, with George W. Bush calling the situation ""un problemo."" ""Part of it relates to tone,"" said Jeb Bush, saying some Latinos turned away from the Republican party when some of its members spoke strongly on illegal immigration. ""If they don't feel welcome, they're not going to listen to the message."" Jeb Bush reiterated that he would not run for president -- like his brother and father -- in 2012. The former governor also said he did not want to head the national Republican party because he wanted to achieve ""some financial independence"" for himself and his family. The current GOP party chief, Michael Steele, has faced persistent criticism from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, and others in recent months, even though Republicans scored big wins in the recent mid-term elections. As to speculation about Steele's future as the party's head, Jeb Bush opted not to wade into the party leadership debate, saying he was ""Switzerland in relation to national Republican politics."" ""If I'm trying to achieve financial security for my family and I'm not running for office,"" Jeb Bush said. ""I certainly wouldn't run for RNC chairman."" Jeb Bush said that he could see either or both of his sons, Jeb and George, following their father, their uncle, their grandfather and their great-grandfather (former Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut) by running for political office. But George W. Bush said he didn't see his daughters, twins Jenna and Barbara, who turn 29 this month, going into politics. ""They will be involved in helping improve people's lives,"" Bush said. ""But I doubt they'll ever run for public office."" As to his own future, and legacy, Bush said he was content to let his memoir and his decisions speak for themselves. ""I'm not trying to shape my legacy,"" he said. ""I'm trying to provide data points for future historians.""","George W. Bush denies his administration took its ""eye off the ball"" in Afghanistan .

"The race of Florida teen Trayvon Martin had less to do with his death than the fact that the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed him was carrying a gun, comedian Bill Cosby told CNN in an interview that aired Sunday. Martin, 17, was shot dead in February while walking back from a convenience store to his father's Sanford home. The man who admitted shooting him, George Zimmerman, told authorities that he did so in self-defense. Martin's family contends Zimmerman racially profiled the teen. Zimmerman was detained last week and charged with second-degree murder. Known for his stand-up routines, movies and as the man behind the breakthrough 1980s sit-com ""The Cosby Show,"" Cosby regularly weighs in on social and racial issues. ""It doesn't make any difference if he's racist or not racist,"" Cosby said on ""State of the Union."" ""If he's scared to death and not a racist, it's still a confrontational provoking of something"" when a person has a gun on them. Opinion: Is Trayvon Martin's death the catalyst of a new movement? Gun violence is personal to Cosby, one of the most successful African-American comedians and entertainers of his generation. His and wife Camille's only son, Ennis, was shot and killed while changing a tire off a Southern California freeway in 1997. Michael Markhasev, a Ukrainian-born immigrant, was convicted the next year of killing Ennis Cosby during an attempted robbery. Cosby said that he ""used to have a gun,"" which he bought to ""protect my family."" He insists he has nothing against people having firearms in their homes to protect against intruders, but said he believes that being on the streets with a gun changes some people, making them bolder and more dangerous. ""When a person has a gun, sometimes their mind clicks that this thing ... will win arguments and straighten people out,"" he said. iReport: Debating the Zimmerman arrest and race in America . Cosby did not mention Zimmerman by name during his CNN interview. But he did allude to key facts of the case, like how Zimmerman called 911 to report what he called a ""suspicious"" person in his neighborhood. The dispatcher told him police were on their way and not to follow the person, who ended up being Martin. But Zimmerman apparently did pursue him. The pair got into a confrontation and Zimmerman ended up shooting Martin. ""When you tell me that you're going to protect the neighborhood that I live in, I don't want you to have a gun,"" Cosby said. ""I want you to be able to see something, report it and get out of the way.""","Bill Cosby says Trayvon Martin's race doesn't make any difference .

"Turkey's Prime Minister made a full-throated denial Tuesday, denouncing telephone audio recordings that have exploded across Turkish social media and political circles like a bombshell. The leader of one of the country's main opposition parties, meanwhile, leaped onto the controversial recordings, playing them at an appearance before lawmakers. The recordings appear to be wiretaps of a series of conversations allegedly between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his son, Bilal. The two men in the recordings discuss in detail how to hide vast amounts of money. The recordings were allegedly made the day after a wide-reaching corruption investigation ensnared the sons of three Cabinet members. Bilal was questioned but never detained in the investigation. ""This is not an attack on Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the AK Party, but an attack on the Turkish Republic,"" the Prime Minister thundered Tuesday in a weekly speech to parliament members from his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP. Erdogan labeled the audio recordings ""immoral edited material."" ""They are listening to the government's encrypted phones; that's how low they have sunk,"" Erdogan continued, denouncing a series of lobby groups that he has long accused of plotting to overthrow his government. Erdogan has pledged to investigate corruption within his government. But the Prime Minister has also denounced implications that his family is involved in the scandal. On Tuesday, protesters took to the streets in the wake of the scandal. Police in Istanbul used tear gas and water cannon to try to push protesters back. Money matters discussed . In the phone conversations, the two men discuss in detail how to hide money and whom to give it to. At one point, one warns the other man to be cautious about talking on the phone. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, played the recordings at a speech before an assembly of CHP lawmakers. ""Either you take a helicopter and flee abroad or you resign,"" Kilicdaroglu said. Most mainstream Turkish television channels interrupted their live broadcast of Kilicdaroglu's speech when he began playing audio of the alleged conversation between Erdogan and his son. They then resumed the broadcast after the audio recordings stopped playing. Tensions with police and judiciary . Embarrassing recordings of private phone conversations have been emerging on the Internet on an almost weekly basis in Turkey, ever since police detained the Cabinet minsters' sons and dozens of other businessmen and officials closely linked to Erdogan's government on December 17. The government denounced the investigations, saying they were part of a coup attempt by what Erdogan officials described as a ""parallel state"" established within the police force and the judiciary. Thousands of police officers were removed from their posts after the corruption investigation that caught Erdogan's administration by surprise. The top prosecutors who led the investigation have also been stripped of their positions. Meanwhile, the government has passed a highly controversial law that gives it direct control over the judiciary. Erdogan's administration has also tried to push through another piece of legislation that would give the government the power to shut down Internet sites without first obtaining a court order. ""We passed this new Internet law to get ahead of this blackmailing, these threats,"" the Prime Minister said in his speech Tuesday. Evidence of a power struggle . The turmoil that has rocked Turkey for the past two months is widely seen as a power struggle between Erdogan and a Muslim cleric who had long been one of his most powerful allies. For years, a septuagenarian preacher living in self-imposed exile in  the United States was seen as a strong supporter of Erdogan's. But Fethullah Gulen and his supporters have been engaged in an open political war with Erdogan's Justice and Development Party since the  corruption investigation. The Prime Minister has lashed out against the Gulen group, likening its members to assassins. Turks are expected to go to the polls in March in nationwide municipal elections.

"(CNN) -- A retrial in the case of two people accused in the Bahamas of attempting to extort millions from John Travolta over the death of the actor's son was halted Monday just as it was about to get under way, according to the Bahamian attorney general's office. The prosecutor in the case filed a motion for ""nolle prosequi,"" asking for the trial not to proceed, the attorney general's office said. A mistrial was declared last year after a not-guilty verdict was announced at a political rally while the jury was still deliberating. Travolta issued a statement Monday saying he had requested the retrial not to proceed due to the emotional distress caused by the ordeal. ""The long pending status of this matter continued to take a heavy emotional toll on my family causing us to conclude that it was finally time to put this matter behind us,"" Travolta's statement said. ""Therefore, after much reflection I concluded that it was in my family's best interest for me not to voluntarily return to The Bahamas to testify a second time at trial."" Paramedic Tarino Lightbourn and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater were charged with trying to extort money from Travolta after his son died from a seizure on January 2, 2009. The money allegedly was to be paid in return for not making public a document Travolta had signed, declining to have his 16-year-old son, Jett, transported to a nearby hospital. Travolta refused a demand for money. The actor, who also is a pilot, said he signed the document because he initially wanted to fly his son to a Florida hospital instead. Lightbourn and Bridgewater pleaded not guilty. In the first trial, Travolta had testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday. Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked. Travolta said he planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport. The actor testified that while he and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to take the teen to the hospital, instead of flying to Florida. At the hospital, Travolta was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said. During the ambulance ride, Lightbourn asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document. I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence,"" Travolta testified. Travolta testified that he later learned about a demand for $25 million. If he didn't pay, ""stories connected to that document would be sold to the press,"" the actor said. ""The stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow,"" he said.","John Travolta cites ""emotional toll"" in asking for retrial to be halted .

"(CNN) -- Two people died Wednesday when a car crashed into the front entrance of a Laughlin, Nevada, casino, police said. The silver car crashed into the Edgewater Casino about 9:30 a.m., said Barbara Morgan, spokeswoman for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. Clark County Fire Department spokesman Scott Allison said the driver, an elderly man, was not one of the fatalities. Both victims were patrons sitting at a large bank of slot machines at the front of the casino, he said. Five people, including the driver, were taken to hospitals, Allison said. He described one as ""a major injury"" with multiple fractures. Five others were treated on the scene and released, he said. Allison said authorities suspect that the driver may have had ""a medical episode"" that caused the crash. Witnesses said the car was traveling at a high speed when it hit the building, Morgan said. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were at the scene, she said, because the department has a substation in Laughlin, about 70 miles southeast of the city. The casino is on a highway known as ""the second strip,"" in reference to the Las Vegas Strip.

"(Mashable) -- After initially dismissing the reports about the iPhone 4 antenna reception issue, Apple has officially admitted it exists, promising a software fix in a couple of weeks. There's a catch, though. Apple's promised fix may not be good news for users experiencing the problem. Apple claims it has erroneously calculated the formula which displays signal bars on the iPhone, and therefore the iPhone has been showing too many bars in areas with weak signal strength. Here's how Apple explains it: . ""Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place."" Unfortunately, this seems like Apple is only acknowledging one part of the problem. Anandtech's in-depth analysis showed that the signal drop when you grip the iPhone 4 by its lower-right side is very real. Therefore, Apple's fix probably won't fix that part -- arguably the biggest part -- of the problem, and will merely make the iPhone 4 display fewer bars in weak signal areas. Interestingly enough, Apple claims the miscalculation was present ""since the original iPhone,"" so the fix will apply to older generation iPhones as well. Here's Apple's official announcement: . Dear iPhone 4 Users, . The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in Apple's history. It has been judged by reviewers around the world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them. Here is what we have learned. To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by one or more bars. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop four or five bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design. At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our own experience and testing. What can explain all of this? We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising. Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display four bars when we should be displaying as few as two bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying four or five bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place. To fix this, we are adopting AT&T's recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the iPhone's bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a given area. We are also making bars one, two and three a bit taller so they will be easier to see. We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been present since the original iPhone, this software update will also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G. We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same- the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused. As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund. We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do. Thank you for your patience and support. Apple . © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"At the former concentration camp Auschwitz, Poland  (CNN)Menachem Bodner has been to Auschwitz three times: . First as a child prisoner of just 4 years old. He has only fragments of memories from his time here: Staring out at barbed wire, running down concrete stairs, hiding in a corner.  And one especially vivid memory that still haunts his dreams, the bloodied face of an elderly man. Last year, he visited the German Nazi-run concentration camp as a survivor.  He came for closure and says he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. During the 70-year memorial for the liberation of Auschwitz on Tuesday, he visited the camp in search for his identical twin brother, separated shortly after liberation. ""Sometimes I stare at people in the street, and I look for someone who looks like me,"" he said. ""My biggest hope is my brother will be here. Maybe from another country.  Or maybe another survivor can tell me something, recognize me or remember us both. Anything."" But as he stands in the snow, next to the barbed wire and the brick buildings, his heart pounds.  He turns away to hide his tears. Seventy years ago, Menachem Bodner was known as Elias Gottesman, Auschwitz ID A-7733. Auschwitz records show he had a twin, Jeno Gottesman A-7734. Both were subjected to the medical experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  And both survived Auschwitz to be taken into a care home for children after liberation. But Elias was adopted by a man searching for his own wife and children in the chaos and eventually taken to Israel. He was given the new name of Menachem Bodner. What happened to Jeno Gottesman is unknown. For decades, Menachem didn't even know he had a twin.  His only memory came to him in the form of dreams of another boy, blond like him, sleeping in bed beside him. It took nearly 70 years and the help of his genealogist, Ayana KimRon, poring over documents for him to prove his instinct was real. In one sense, she says, his lack of memory is a blessing: . ""I'm really happy for him that he lost his memory."" She told CNN, ""It's so much easier to establish a normal life. But even then, he had nightmares. Just imagine if he remembered."" But it means she must rely on the memories of other survivors to try and track down his twin. ""It's all about the awareness of friends and neighbors. And courage. If he's there and he knows about the search, he'll need some courage to come forward, and then he'll find he has a wonderful family."" Menachem has launched a Facebook Page titled A-7734 in the hope that social media will spread word of his search. There has been progress: A DNA match found Menachem's first cousins in the United States -- the only relatives from his birth family.  They had no idea that Menachem was alive and had assumed that he and his entirely family had perished in Auschwitz.  It was an emotional reunion, and his cousins gave him a gift: the only photo of his birth parents. ""They told me so much about my mother,"" he says, smiling.  ""The most important thing:  Now I know my mother's face.  Before I had remembered only her blond hair. Now I can see her."" But he still searches for Jeno. And he comes to Auschwitz in the hope he will remember some clue, another survivor will recognize him.  Maybe even his own brother. He says he has new dream now: He sees himself walking in a forest with his brother, wearing identical clothes -- black trousers -- and a short sleeve blue shirt. Is it a dream or does he believe it will become a reality? ""Maybe, I don't know.""  He says. But standing in the snow, outside the very building he was held as a prisoner as a young boy, Menachem insists he has not given up.  ""No, not at all."" He says, ""It only makes me want to search for him even more."" In Auschwitz, the place of his nightmares, Menachem still finds hope to dream.","Menachem Bodner, then called  Elias Gottesman, was separated from his twin, Jeno, after liberation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Search-and-rescue teams have found ""conclusive evidence"" that the pilot of an F-22 aircraft that crashed while on a routine training mission in Alaska did not survive, the military said Friday. Air Force Capt. Jeffrey Haney, who was assigned to the 525th Fighter Squadron, 3rd Wing, has been missing since the crash Tuesday night. Crews have found the wreckage of the plane. Haney ""did not eject from the aircraft prior to impact,"" said Air Force Col. Jack McMullen, 3rd Wing commander. McMullen made the remarks Friday in written and video statements. A recovery team found part of the ejection seat and several life support items that Haney wore during the flight. ""If a pilot was able to eject, the seat would go with him and it would not be anywhere at or near the site,"" McMullen said. ""Sadly, we can no longer consider this a search-and-rescue operation, but must now focus on recovery operations,"" McMullen said. ""This is a huge loss for the 3rd Wing and for the Air Force, but it's even a greater loss ... and a very emotional time for the entire Haney family,"" McMullen said. ""We are doing everything we can to support them right now."" Officials are looking into the cause of the crash and the recovery operation is expected to last several weeks. The wreckage was discovered Wednesday, a day after the aircraft lost contact with air traffic control, according to officials from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson at Anchorage, Alaska. The plane was found near a creek bed between two mountains, about 100 miles north of Anchorage, near Denali National Park. The Clarklake, Michigan, native was commissioned in the Air Force in August 2003 and had been stationed at the base in Alaska since June 2006.","Evidence shows Air Force Capt.

"(CNN) -- A runaway who said her father threatened to kill her for converting to Christianity from Islam has been granted permanent residency in the United States, her lawyer told CNN on Tuesday. Rifqa Bary, 18, who was an undocumented immigrant until recently, left her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July 2009 and took refuge in the home of a minister in Orlando, Florida. The girl was later moved into foster care after she said in an affidavit that her Muslim father had threatened her after finding out about her conversion. Her father denies the allegation. Bary had said in court that she could not reunite with her parents and needed permission to live in the United States. ""I can confirm that she got her legal permanent residency status, and in five years she can actually become a citizen,"" said Kort Gatterdam, Bary's attorney. ""She is still making plans about her future with those who care about her most. With the case being over only a couple of weeks ago, she hasn't had a chance to sit back and decide what she wants to do with her future yet."" Gatterdam said that Bary has not been in contact with any family members and that she is still afraid of them. Bary was returned to Ohio from Florida late last year, and as a 17-year-old, she was placed in the custody of Franklin County Children Services while other issues in the case were being settled. In an earlier court filing, Bary had alleged that her father had said, ""If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me!"" She says her father then added, ""I will kill you!"" Mohamed Bary, her father, denies the allegation. ""We wouldn't do her harm,"" he has said, adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations. ""I have no problem with her practicing any faith,"" Bary added, but acknowledged he would prefer that she practice Islam.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's interior minister, citing police evidence gathered after a deadly house bombing Friday, said people at the dwelling had been planning to attack him during a court appearance in Karachi. Rehman Malik, who appeared in a Karachi court regarding an outstanding corruption case against him, said intelligence officers warned him against going to pre-announced events such as Friday's court appearance, which was well-publicized a few weeks ago. The house blast occurred in the Baldia section of Karachi and killed seven people. When police came to the scene, they interrogated three survivors, two men and an elderly woman. They then determined the people were intent on launching an attack on the court, according to Waseed Ahmed, Karachi's police chief. Ahmed said officers also discovered two suicide vests, 25 hand grenades, three AK-47s and 17 magazines of ammunitions. Police also found tins of food, which led them to believe the attackers might have been planning to take hostages and set up a siege of the court. Police were investigating the cause of the blast, and Malik said people in the house were members of a family from the Swat Valley in North West Frontier Province. The Pakistani army has conducted intense operations in that province and the tribal region to rout militants from their safe havens. Malik had been among thousands of bureaucrats and politicians who had been granted amnesty by Pakistan's National Reconciliation Ordinance. The ordinance shielded them from having to face corruption charges. But the ordinance has been nullified, and Malik was no longer protected by it. Also Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed five people in northwestern Pakistan, two intelligence sources said. The suspected drone launched two missiles at a car in the village of Palali, in North Waziristan, a rugged area near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan that is rife with Islamic extremists, the sources said. Two of the dead were from countries other than Pakistan; three were locals, the sources told CNN. The attack, at about 7:45 p.m. also injured two people, the two intelligence sources said. Additional details were not immediately available. CNN's Pierre Bairin, Arwa Damon and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","House blast in Karachi kills seven people .

"Elbow Beach, Bermuda (CNN) -- Just hours after the island took a beating from Hurricane Igor, blue skies returned to Bermuda Monday as the storm moved out into the Atlantic and toward Newfoundland, Canada. ""It's a different world, so to speak,"" CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said, reporting from Bermuda. The island was cleaning up and drying out after Igor's visit, but there were no reports of serious damage, injuries or deaths resulting from the Category 1 hurricane. ""Compared to Fabian, this is a good outcome,"" said Frank Stocek, property manager at the Elbow Beach resort. Hurricane Fabian caused extensive damage on Bermuda when it struck in 2003. As of 8 p.m. ET, Igor was about 650 miles (1,045 kilometers) southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was moving northeast, away from Bermuda, at about 29 mph (46 kph). Igor was barely a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). Some strengthening is possible, the hurricane center said. Igor is expected to become an intense extratropical cyclone in a day or so, it added. A tropical storm warning for Bermuda was discontinued Monday afternoon. Winds were forecast to diminish as Igor pulled away from the island. The storm is projected to stay off the U.S. coast but is forecast to near the tip of Newfoundland, Canada, as early as Tuesday. A tropical storm warning was issued for the region. France also issued a tropical storm warning for its area islands, Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The center of Igor reached its closest point to Bermuda -- about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of the island -- late Sunday night. As it neared Bermuda, its eyewall collapsed, weakening it slightly, Wolf said. Winds gusted to 93 mph (149 kph) on the tiny Atlantic island as Igor raged. Because Bermuda -- which is actually a collection of islands -- is so small, ""they don't get direct hits very often,"" said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano, ""and they got hit pretty hard."" As day dawned, however, many on Bermuda felt they had dodged a bullet, despite widespread power outages -- at one point, it was estimated that two-thirds of the island's 67,000 residents were without electricity -- some flooding in low-lying areas, downed trees and branches and closed roads. Some lacking power may not have it restored for weeks, Wolf said. The storm's northeast quadrant, typically where the highest winds and rain are experienced, took aim at the southern part of the island, where several resorts are located. ""On the forecast track, Igor will continue moving away from Bermuda and pass offshore of the southeastern tip of Newfoundland on Tuesday,"" forecasters at the hurricane center said. Igor is a large storm, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 85 miles (140 kilometers) from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward up to 380 miles (610 kilometers) outward. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the coast of Newfoundland from Stone's Cove to Charlottetown, forecasters said. The warning, in this case, means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the area within 24 hours. Large swells are expected to continue affecting the East Coast of the United States through Tuesday and could cause ""life-threatening surf and rip currents,"" the hurricane center said. Swells associated with Igor are expected to subside over the next couple of days in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hispaniola and portions of the Bahamas. Out in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Julia had lost its tropical characteristics by mid-morning Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center's last advisory issued on the storm. As of 11 a.m. ET, the remnants of Julia were located about 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) west of the Azores. Its maximum sustained winds were at 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving east at about 8 mph (13 kph). The storm was forecast to dissipate over the next day or two.","NEW: France issues a tropical storm warning for the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon .

"(CNN) -- Some 24 million Chinese men of marrying age will find themselves lacking wives in 2020, partly because of the country's one-child policy, which has led to the abortion of female fetuses, state media said Monday. Sex-specific abortions have led to a large male population born since the 1980s, the China Daily newspaper said, citing a study conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The gender imbalance means that the next decade will see many intergenerational marriages: young men married to women much older than them, the study said. China's Communist Party implemented the one-child rule three decades ago, amid fears that the country would not be able to feed a skyrocketing population. The policy has prevented about 400 million births, China Daily said. Couples living in cities are barred from having more than one child, unless neither parent has siblings. In rural areas, the law allows for a second child under certain circumstances. And the guidelines are looser for ethnic minorities with small populations. Enforcement varies, but usually takes the form of fines to discourage extra births. The policy has curbed population growth, and has led to forced sterilization in some parts of the country, the U.S. State Department said. Because of a traditional preference for male heirs, many Chinese also have aborted female fetuses, according to human rights groups. Even within the country, calls to overhaul the law have increased in recent years, China Daily said. But China has said it will maintain its one-child policy for at least another decade. Nearly 200 million Chinese will enter child-bearing age in the next 10 years, Minister Zhang Weiqing told China Daily two years ago. He said abandoning the policy during this period would cause ""serious problems and add extra pressure on social and economic development."" ""After the new birth peak ends, we may adjust the policy if there is a need,"" he said. China's population, which stands at about 1.3 billion, is growing at the rate of 0.6 percent. It is expected to peak around 1.6 billion by 2050, the U.S. State Department said.","China's Communist Party implemented the one-child rule three decades ago .

"This could be the last story you read about Lindsay Lohan for the next three months if all goes well during her 90-day stay at the Betty Ford Clinic. Just days before checking into court-ordered rehab last week, the actress spoke extensively to Piers Morgan in an article for London's Daily Mail newspaper, which published it in this Sunday's edition. Lohan, who turns 27 in two months, told Morgan, host of CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" she's never been ""a huge drinker"" and despite rumors, failed drug tests and a drug possession arrest, she's only used cocaine ""maybe four or five times in my life."" She's spent more than 250 days in rehab and another trip ""is pointless,"" she said in the Daily Mail story.  Instead, she should be allowed to ""go abroad to different countries and work with children."" Lohan's life off the rails . Lohan's life and career ran off the rails starting in her disastrous year of 2007 when she was twice convicted of drunken driving, once for cocaine use, made three trips to rehab and served an 84-minute jail stay.  Her arrests were ""totally irresponsible -- a stupid mistake,"" she said. ""And from then on, the press were on me all the time,"" Lohan said.  ""It was the first time I'd taken drugs.  I was out in a club with people I shouldn't have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. It was so stupid."" Her first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie, she told Morgan. She voluntary checked into the Wonderland Center in Los Angeles while she was shooting ""I Know Who Killed Me"" in January 2007. Lohan's legal woes: A timeline . ""I was having really bad nightmares, and the movie was pretty traumatizing,"" Lohan said.  ""So I stayed in a facility so I could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day, because it was overwhelming. But I would leave every day and just sleep there at night. I liked that. It was kind of like having my own live-in therapist, because I was having crazy nightmares and I was having AA meetings on set and stuff. It really helped."" Lohan: The good teenager . She had been drinking for less than a year at that point, Lohan said.  She stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at 17, when her mother made her ""sleep with vomit still on me so I'd understand how it felt,"" she said.  ""I was too scared!"" She was a good teenager, she said.  ""My friends and I would actually pretend to be drunk,"" she said. ""And it was more fun. I never rebelled against my parents -- I worked hard, I was responsible and I didn't go to high-school parties."" She doesn't consider herself to be an alcoholic -- ""I've never woken up in the morning and had a drink"" -- but ""when I was younger, I was definitely going out too much and I was drinking too much."" Lohan: A rehab expert . Lohan considers herself an expert on rehab facilities. ""I've been court-ordered to do it six times,"" she said.  ""I could write the book on rehab. Constantly sending me to rehab is pointless. The first few times I was court-ordered to rehab, it was like a joke, like killing time."" Morgan interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter.  After arriving at one -- which California officials said was unlicensed -- she left for the Betty Ford Clinic, where she spent her last and longest rehab stay. ""I look at it as a good thing,"" she said about this rehab visit.  ""I can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work. But I think there are other things I could do instead of going to a rehab center that would benefit me more. The best thing they could do for me would be to make me go abroad to different countries and work with children."" Lohan: Clean and sober . If she is not a drug user -- she tells Morgan she smoked ""some pot"" a year ago -- or an alcoholic, then why would she need rehab, Morgan asked. ""This is where it gets hard for me to explain,"" she said. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves. I think people want to see me do that. They will keep saying the same things about me if I don't. I don't think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months."" Although now confessing to Morgan that she used drugs a year ago, she told Matt Lauer on NBC's ""Today"" show a year ago that that she was ""clean and sober"" then for ""a long time."" Although she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug, Lohan said she rarely used it since ""I don't like it."" Cocaine: Not her favorite drug . ""It reminds me of my dad,"" she said. ""I took it four times in a period from about the age of 20 to 23, and I got caught twice."" Cocaine made her feel ""a little too buzzed -- it made me feel uncomfortable,"" she told Morgan. She's not ""a junkie,"" she said.  ""It's the truth. I've never taken heroin either, never injected myself with anything, never done LSD. Those things all scare me."" Her drugs of choice are ""pot, obviously, and Ecstasy,"" she said.  ""I liked that (Ecstasy) better than the others.""  Morgan reports Lohan then giggled. Lohan: Not a junkie . Lohan has previously acknowledged having a drug problem, though.  She posted this Twitter message in September 2010 just before entering the Betty Ford Clinic for three months:  ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night.  I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."" Lohan claimed to Morgan that she's just misunderstood.  The constant online tabloid reports of late-night partying, which sometimes results in legal issues, don't show the real person. ""I've never been a junkie, and never will be,"" she said. ""I just like going out late to clubs with friends and listening to music. Always have done. It's not that unusual for girls of 26!"" Heath Ledger's advice . She slowed down on her drinking on the advice of an actor, Lohan said. ""Heath Ledger told me to give it up for a year because he'd just done that, and so I did, and it wasn't a problem for me,"" she said.  Ledger was 28 when he died from a prescription drug overdose in January 2008, a year after Lohan's first rehab visit. Lindsay prefers men . Lohan also talked to Morgan about her sexuality -- she's straight despite a past relationship with a woman.  ""I like boys,"" she said. ""I know I'm straight,"" she said. ""I have made out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. But I think I needed to experience that and I think I was looking for something different."" She said she was in love with Samantha Ronson during their relationship, and ""I still love her as a person."" ""I like being in a relationship with a guy,"" Lohan said.  ""But there's something just different about it with a woman. When I was with Samantha, I didn't want to leave, because I didn't want to be alone. It was very toxic."" Dad 'creates chaos' About her father, Michael Lohan:  ""He won't change,"" she said.  ""I just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is. ""Whenever I do try to bring him back into my life, he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage. He's been really good and then really crazy my whole life."" Hollywood friends . While she blames the Los Angeles lifestyle for steering her off course, she does point to two Hollywood women who have helped her. ""Meryl Streep was nice,"" Lohan said. ""She just advised me on my acting and what I needed to do differently, and she told me I needed to go back to live with my mum for a while."" She couldn't move back to New York because at the time, her probation requirements, which including regular drug testing, restricted her to California -- ""the worst possible place I could be,"" she said. ""Jamie Lee Curtis was very kind to me, too,"" she said. ""She also told me to listen to good advice and to get rid of the hangers-on."" Stay tuned . Will you see another story about Lindsay Lohan's substance abuse and legal troubles before she's scheduled to get out of rehab in early August?  What could happen in the Betty Ford Clinic, a well-respected refuge for those needing to get their lives back on track? Lohan was accused of assaulting a Ford staff member during her last stay in December 2010, although the investigation was suspended on December 24 after the staffer drops charges against Lohan. Just weeks after her release from there, she was again involved in controversy for stealing a necklace from a jewelry store.  It was that shoplifting conviction that put her on the road to her current rehab visit. Video: Charlie Sheen's love for Lohan . Lohan's 'Scary Movie 5' co-stars have her back .

"Troy Davis may be dead, but his execution Thursday in the American state of Georgia has made him the poster boy for the global movement to end the death penalty. World figures, including Pope Benedict XVI and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, human rights groups and commentators urged the execution to be halted -- but to no avail. On Wednesday Davis was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of off-duty police officer Mark MacPhail despite doubts being raised over the conviction. The execution sparked angry reactions and protests in European capitals -- as well as outrage on social media. ""We strongly deplore that the numerous appeals for clemency were not heeded,"" the French foreign ministry said. ""There are still serious doubts about his guilt,"" said Germany's junior minister for human rights Markus Loening. ""An execution is irreversible -- a judicial error can never be repaired."" The European Union expressed ""deep regret"" over the execution and repeated its call for a universal moratorium on capital punishment. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the bloc had learnt ""with deep regret that Mr Troy Davis was executed,"" her spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told Agence-France Presse. '""The EU opposes the use of capital punishment in all circumstances and calls for a universal moratorium,"" she said. ""The abolition of that penalty is essential to protect human dignity."" Amnesty International condemned the execution in a statement. ""The U.S. justice system was shaken to its core as Georgia executed a person who may well be innocent. Killing a man under this enormous cloud of doubt is horrific and amounts to a catastrophic failure of the justice system,"" Amnesty said. In Britain's Guardian newspaper, Ed Pilkington, reporting from Jackson, Georgia, before the execution took place, gave 10 reasons why he believed the death sentence for ""a man who is very possibly innocent"" should be commuted. Most of his argument concerned doubts about the conviction -- seven of the nine key witnesses to the murder of MacPhail later recanted their evidence -- but his final reason concerned the manner in which Davis was put to death. ""Even if you set aside the issue of Davis's innocence or guilt, the manner of his execution tonight is cruel and unnatural,"" Jackson wrote. ""If the execution goes ahead as expected, it would be the fourth scheduled execution date for this prisoner. In 2008 he was given a stay just 90 minutes before he was set to die. Experts in death row say such multiple experiences with imminent death is tantamount to torture."" In the right-of-center Daily Telegraph, Tom Chivers said the death penalty was ""barbaric"" and far more likely to be used against black people than white. But the main thrust of his argument was that there were serious doubts over the conviction. ""If you are pro-death penalty, you should be shouting twice as loud as the rest of us about the imminent murder of Troy Davis,"" Chivers wrote. ""Otherwise, you can't claim to be supporting a stark but necessary act of justice. You're just a fan of killing people in general. There are words for people like that. None of them are nice."" On social media, many users predicted the execution would encourage a new civil rights movement to spring up. American novelist Hari Kunzru  commented that on the issue of capital punishment the U.S. was isolated from much of the rest of the world  ""So I wake up to hear they executed Troy Davis. Wonder if most Americans realize how far out of step they are with international norms."" And entertainer Vincent Tucker remarked that campaigners should continue their campaign despite Davis's death. ""It's one thing to fight for Troy Davis when he was alive but the key question now is will you STILL fight for his cause after his death?""","Execution of Troy Davis in U.S. sparks protests around world .

"(CNN) -- New York's Staten Island was broiling under a life-threatening heat wave and borough President James Molinaro was seriously concerned about the area's Little League baseball players.   It was last July's Eastern heat wave and Consolidated Edison was responding to scattered power outages as electricity usage neared record highs. So, authorities followed Molinaro's suggestion to cancel that night's Little League games, which were to be played under electricity-sucking stadium lights. ""Number one, it was a danger to the children that were playing out there in that heat, and secondly it would save electricity that people would need for air conditioning in their homes,"" said Molinaro, who'd been forced to sleep at his office that night because of a blackout in his own neighborhood. Throughout New York City, about 52,000 of ConEd's 3.2 million customers lost power during the heat wave. Triple-digit temperatures forced residents like 77 year-old Rui Zhi Chen, to seek shelter at one of the city's 400 emergency cooling centers. ""It felt like an oven in my home and on the street,"" Chen said. Should Americans view these kinds of scenarios as extraordinary circumstances -- or a warning sign of a darker future? Experts on the nation's electricity system point to a frighteningly steep increase in non-disaster-related outages affecting at least 50,000 consumers. During the past two decades, such blackouts have increased 124 percent -- up from 41 blackouts between 1991 and 1995, to 92 between 2001 and 2005, according to research at the University of Minnesota.  In the most recently analyzed data available, utilities reported 36 such outages in 2006 alone. ""It's hard to imagine how anyone could believe that -- in the United States -- we should learn to cope with blackouts,"" said University of Minnesota Professor Massoud Amin, a leading expert on the U.S. electricity grid. Amin supports construction of a nationwide ""smart grid"" that would avert blackouts and save billions of dollars in wasted electricity. In a nutshell, a smart grid is an automated electricity system that improves the reliability, security and efficiency of electric power. It more easily connects with new energy sources, such as wind and solar, and is designed to charge electric vehicles and control home appliances via a so-called ""smart"" devices.  Summer of '77 . You might say Amin's connection with electricity began in New York City with a bolt of lightning.  In July 1977, Amin was a 16-year-old high school student visiting from his native Iran when lightning triggered a 24-hour blackout that cut power to nine million. As he and his father walked near their Midtown Manhattan hotel, they were shocked to see looters smash their way into an electronics store less than 20 yards down the street. Amin recalls feeling violated by the ugly scene -- and wondering if the nation's infrastructure was in danger of collapse. ""... not just the electric grid that underpins our lives,"" he said, ""but also the human condition."" More than 30 years later, the United States is still ""operating the most advanced economy in the world with 1960s and 70s technology,"" said Amin. Failing to modernize the grid, he said, will threaten the U.S. position as an economic super power. Millions remember the historic August 2003 blackout, when overgrown trees on powerlines triggered an outage that cascaded across an overloaded regional grid. An estimated 50 million people lost power in Canada and eight northeastern states. Smart grid technology, experts say, would have immediately detected the potential crisis, diverted power and likely saved $6 billion in estimated business losses. By April of 2013 ConEd hopes to install a ""smart"" automated self-healing system aimed at preventing the burnout of large feeder cables during peak demand periods -- such as heat waves.   The new technology would anticipate possible equipment failure in specific neighborhoods and reroute electricity to compensate. For example, a project to help Queens' Flushing neighborhood will ""give us the capability to remotely control up to 26 underground switches,"" said Con Ed smart grid manager Thomas Magee. Had systems like this been in place, said ConEd's Aseem Kapur, it might have prevented or reduced New York's scattered outages last July. Who's got the juice?  Some of the most reliable utilities are in the heartland states of Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas.   In those states, the power is out an average of only 92 minutes per year, according to a 2008 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. On the other end of the spectrum, utilities in New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey averaged 214 minutes of total interruptions each year. These figures don't include power outages blamed on tornadoes or other disasters. Map: How often do the lights go out where you live? But compare the U.S. data to Japan which averages only four minutes of total interrupted service each year. ""As you can see, we have a long way to go,"" said Andres Carvallo, who played a key role in planning the smart grid in Austin, Texas.  Experts point to the northeastern and southeastern U.S. as regions where outages pose the most threat -- mainly due to aging wires, pole transformers and other lagging infrastructure. ""They know where they have tight spots,"" said Mark Lauby, of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which enforces reliability standards. Without mentioning specific regions, Lauby said utilities are ""making sure the generation and the transmission are available to help support those consumers."" Building a national smart grid ""won't be cheap and it wont be easy,"" acknowledged Amin. Much of it could be completed as soon as 2030 at a cost of up to $1.5 trillion, according to the Department of Energy. It's unclear who would foot the entire bill, but the Obama administration has committed about $4 billion in investment grants. The 'Easy Button'  Carvallo jokes about the so-called ""Easy Button"" at Austin Energy. It's not really a big red button on the wall, but it is a mechanism that allows an operator to control tens of thousands of home thermostats.    ""Austin is two to three years ahead of everybody else,"" said Carvallo, now chief strategy officer for the smart grid software firm Grid Net. He points to a volunteer program that offers free thermostats to customers who allow the utility to remotely control their air conditioners during specific months and hours. This way, thousands of power-gulping air conditioners can be cycled off for a short time when electricity was needed elsewhere.   By summer's end, Austin expects to begin enabling its 700,000 streetlights to be turned ""on and off with a flip of a switch,"" saving $340,000 in electricity each year, and eliminating 200 tons of carbon dioxide air pollution.  Replacing old-style electric meters with ""smart meters"" is often described as the first step in creating a smart grid. All 400,000 of Austin's meters are smart meters.   Nationwide, 26 utilities in 15 states have installed some 16 million smart meters in homes and businesses. Soon, when power goes out in a neighborhood with smart meters, utilities won't have to wait for customers to report outages -- the smart meters will alert utilities automatically. Utilities will then e-mail or text message each affected customer information about when the lights will be back on. Critics question smart meter accuracy and whether the devices will really save energy in the long run.   ""It feels a bit like the utilities are jumping the gun and they're trying to put these meters in before the rest of the pieces of the so-called smart grid are in place and before we even know that the smart meters are going to have advantages commensurate with the cost,"" said electricity consumer advocate Mindy Spatt of The Utility Reform Network. One advantage of smart grid technology may be jobs.  High-tech manufacturers want to locate their factories in places where electricity is most reliable, said Carvallo. ""That's where the manufacturing facilities move to. That's where you get your high-paying jobs.""","Non-disaster U.S. power outages up 124 percent since early '90s .

"(CNN) -- Three members of a jihadist group who left Hamburg, Germany, last year to train in the tribal areas of Pakistan are now back in Germany and living freely, European and German intelligence officials tell CNN. Western intelligence agencies suspect that other members of the group still thought to be in the Afghan/Pakistan border area are involved in an al Qaeda plot to attack European countries, a plot that prompted a U.S. State Department advisory Sunday for U.S. citizens traveling in Europe. German officials stressed that none of those who have returned is suspected of playing a role in the al Qaeda plot. But they believe some are still committed to al Qaeda's goal of global jihad. Early in 2009, nine men and two women set off from Hamburg for the tribal areas of Pakistan, officials told CNN. The men had been recruited in the city's Taiba mosque, which lead 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta once attended. A European counterterrorism official told CNN that before departing, the group talked about an upcoming trip to Spain to mislead those monitoring their communications. The group planned to take different routes to Pakistan -- some taking flights connecting through the Gulf states, and some traveling over land through Iran, German investigators told CNN. Once there, they intended to join the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda. But only eight of the group, including two wives, made it to the Pakistan-Afghan border region, the officials said. German police detained one member of the group -- 25-year-old Mohammad Mohammadi, a German of Iranian descent -- before he left the country, German intelligence officials told CNN. They said Mohammadi was arrested as he boarded a flight at Frankfurt airport. Mohammadi has not faced any charges. Two others -- Alexander Janzen, 30, and Michael Wallinger, 25, German converts to Islam from the former Soviet Union -- were arrested soon after arriving in Pakistan, German intelligence officials said. When the duo boarded a flight in Vienna, Austria, security officials discovered jihadist literature in their bags, according to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, quoting German officials. According to the report, the duo were allowed to board flights to Doha, Qatar, and then on to Karachi, where they were arrested and deported to Germany. Neither was charged with any crime on their return, but security services continue to keep them under close watch, officials told CNN. Mohammadi, Janzen and Wallinger rejoined the Taiba mosque after their failed attempts to reach the tribal areas of Pakistan, the officials told CNN. Police closed the mosque in August 2010 because of its alleged links to radical Islamist extremists. CNN has made several attempts to speak with Janzen and Wallinger. Janzen's family said he had been visited by police and did not want to take questions from reporters. Wallinger refused to answer the doorbell when CNN called at his apartment building. But he later e-mailed CNN to say that he was willing to tell his story for 500,000 euros (about $695,000). CNN declined. Both men were radicalized after they started attending the Taiba mosque, German intelligence officials told CNN. Janzen was born in the Chechnya area of Russia and converted to Islam in a German prison after being convicted of drug possession charges, the officials told CNN. Wallinger, originally from Kazakhstan, converted to Islam at high school in Germany, according to a report in Der Spiegel. CNN was unable to locate Mohammadi, who has no address in Hamburg. Details about the group's intentions and its part in an alleged al Qaeda conspiracy to launch Mumbai-style attacks in Europe are said to have come from Ahmed Sidiqi, an Afghan German member of the Hamburg group who is being held by U.S. authorities at Bagram air base in Afghanistan, according to European counterterrorism officials. He was detained in Kabul in July, his family says. German officials recently visited Sidiqi and are evaluating his claims, the officials told CNN. While Sidiqi was in the Afghan/Pakistan border area, he had several phone conversations with Wallinger in Hamburg, German officials say. Sidiqi's claims are being cross-checked against the testimony of Rami Makanesi, 25, a German-Syrian member of the Hamburg group, a European counterterrorism official told CNN. According to a report in Der Spiegel quoting German officials, Pakistani security services arrested Makanesi in Bannu near the tribal areas of Pakistan as he was on his way to the German Embassy in Islamabad to get the documents necessary to travel back to Germany. According to Pakistani officials quoted in the report, Makanesi had been trained in how to make suicide vests and had participated in attacks on NATO troops in Afghanistan. Makanesi was deported to Germany in August and is in custody in southern Germany while German authorities investigate his alleged terrorist group membership. He has not been formally indicted. Two members of the Hamburg group are believed to be still at large in the tribal areas, according to European intelligence officials. They are Naamen Meziche, the French-Algerian ringleader of the group, and his deputy, Asadullah M., a German of Afghan descent. German intelligence officials say Meziche, a onetime close friend of Atta, was the chief recruiter of the group in the Taiba mosque in Germany. Last weekend, Meziche's wife, who lives in Hamburg, confirmed to CNN that her husband was overseas, but she declined to answer any other questions about him. German intelligence officials believe that around 40 jihadists from Germany are in the ranks of jihadist groups in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region. Since the 1990s, more than 200 people are presumed to have traveled from Germany to the area for paramilitary training, with around 100 now back in Germany, the officials said.

"(CNN) -- Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held in Iran for more than a year, will be released Saturday, Iranian officials said Thursday. An official at Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said earlier Thursday that one of the three would be freed this weekend, after the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, without specifying which one. But Bak Sahraei, a representative for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, told CNN that Shourd was designated for release ""very soon."" The Culture Ministry official said one of Iran's vice presidents will be present when the hiker is released at 9 a.m. Saturday. Shourd, along with Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. Masoud Shafii, the Iranian lawyer who represents the hikers, said he has put in a formal request for the trio's release within the past two weeks. Shafii said he told prosecutors that a year had passed since their arrests and the government had not shown any just cause for their imprisonment, and that Shourd has a medical condition that requires proper care. After the news first broke Thursday, the mothers of all three said they had seen the reports and were ""urgently seeking further information."" ""We hope and pray that the reports are true and that this signals the end of all three of our children's long and difficult detention,"" Cindy Hickey, Nora Shourd and Laura Fattal said in a joint statement. ""Shane, Sarah and Josh are all innocent and we continue to call for their immediate release, so that they can return home together and be reunited with our families."" Upon release, Shourd would be leaving her fiance behind in prison. The families  announced in spring that Shourd and Bauer got engaged in prison and plan to be married when they're both released. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters, ""We don't know, frankly, what Iran is contemplating at this point."" He said the United States was making inquiries through the Swiss government, which represents U.S. interests in Tehran. ""Obviously, if this turns out to be true, this is terrific news,"" Toner said. ""The hikers' release is long overdue, and I would just stress that we hope that it's all three hikers.""

"(CNN) -- No evidence has surfaced of an explosion aboard a UPS cargo plane that crashed in Dubai last September, officials in the United Arab Emirates said Saturday. But UAE authorities are seriously looking into a claim by a militant group that it was responsible for bringing the plane down. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based arm of the al Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility on Friday for the September 3 crash, which killed two pilots aboard, and last week's foiled plot to send parcel bombs to U.S. synagogues. ""The investigators did not report any explosion, only a fire in the cabin,"" Dahi Khalfan Tamim, Dubai's police chief, told CNN on Saturday. ""Dubai police investigations revealed that an explosive parcel would have blown up the plane into pieces."" WAM, the United Arab Emirates News Agency, quotes the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority on Saturday as saying that probe did not uncover evidence of a blast on board. However, the authority said, officials are taking the claim seriously and it is under investigation. Investigators said earlier this month they had failed to turn up any evidence that terrorism was involved in that crash, which killed the two pilots aboard, according to a U.S. government official. About 45 minutes after UPS Flight 6 departed Dubai International Airport for Cologne, Germany, the crew declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit. They asked to return to Dubai, but shortly before the plane could get to the airport, it crashed. Officials in the United Arab Emirates have said -- and a U.S. official confirmed -- that the plane's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion. Explosions have distinctive sound signatures, and that would have been recorded on the device, the official said. The UAE said it has ""eliminated the possibility of an onboard explosion, following a detailed onsite investigation of the wreckage."" White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan said Sunday that the United States is ""looking very carefully"" at the September crash to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft. A U.S. counterterrorism official said Friday that while ""there are very strong indications that AQAP was responsible for plotting last week's disrupted cargo plane plot ... we can't confirm at this point their claims about the early September incident."" The latest threat was revealed October 29 when authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two explosives-laden packages sent from Yemen that were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The statement by AQAP said that since Western media did not link the September UPS plane crash to the group, ""we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation."" ""We did that this time using two devices, one of which was sent via the American UPS company and the other via the American FedEx company,"" the statement said. The statement said its ""developed bombs will allow us the opportunity to detonate them in the air or after their arrival to their ultimate destination and they are designed to pass through all detectors.""

"Just hours after delivery, a baby born with HIV in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs. Two and half years later, doctors say the little girl still has no evidence of the life-threatening disease in her blood, despite being taken off medication. It's a potential game changer in the fight against the virus that causes AIDS, and it happened almost by accident. The unidentified girl was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV positive herself until just before delivery, according to a case report published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers: Toddler cured of HIV . ""We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby,"" said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Doctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus. Within a couple of days, Gay confirmed the child was HIV positive. She said the baby had probably been infected in the womb. The child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 15 months. Her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason, Gay said. The child has not received any antiretroviral drugs since that time, according to the report. In March, researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV. A ""functional cure"" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood. Timeline: AIDS moments to remember . Gay told CNN the timing of intervention -- before the baby's HIV diagnosis -- may deserve ""more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used."" ""We are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently,"" she said. High-risk exposure . In March, Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay, called the developments fascinating, including the fact that the toddler was found to have no virus in her blood even after her mother stopped giving her treatment. ""This is the very first case in which we've conclusively been able to document that the baby was infected and then after a period of treatment has been able to go off treatment without viral rebound,"" Luzuriaga told CNN. Read more: Why youths aren't getting tested for HIV . Researchers have long known that treating HIV-positive mothers early on is important, because they pass antibodies on to their babies. ""One hundred percent of (HIV-positive) moms will pass those antibodies, but in the absence of treatment, only 30% of moms will transmit the actual virus,"" Luzuriaga told CNN. HIV-positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases, Luzuriaga said. ""So all babies are born antibody positive, but only a fraction of babies born to HIV-positive women will actually get the virus, and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis (preventative treatment) or not,"" Luzuriaga said. Newborns are considered high-risk if their mothers' HIV infections are not under control or if they are found to be HIV positive when they're close to delivering. Patients HIV-free for now after transplant . Moving quickly to suppress the virus . Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start therapy if HIV is diagnosed. Investigators said the Mississippi case may change that practice because it highlights the potential for cure with early standard antiretroviral therapy, or ART. ART is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease. But they do not kill the virus. Tests showed the virus in the Mississippi baby's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment. Dr. Deborah Persaud, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center, was lead author on an early report about this case that was presented at a conference. The early treatment likely led to the infant's cure, she said. 'Like pulling teeth' to get doctors to test for HIV . ""Prompt antiviral therapy in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,"" Persaud said. Persaud and Luzuriaga are part of a group of researchers working to explore and document possible pediatric HIV cure cases. The group was funded by a grant from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, and the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Rowena Johnston, amfAR vice president and director of research, said it is ""imperative that we learn more about a newborn's immune system, how it differs from an adult's and what factors made it possible for the child to be cured."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said in March that he was enthusiastic about the findings. ""The best way to either eliminate the virus or allow the immune system to suppress residual virus is to treat someone as early as possible after infection so as not to allow a substantial reservoir of the virus to take hold,"" Fauci told CNN. ""At the same time, you prevent the immune system from being severely damaged by the continual replication of (the) virus for an extended period of time,"" he said. ""The situation with a child born of an infected mother where most of the infections are transmitted to the newborn at or around the time of delivery provides an excellent opportunity to cure an infected baby, and this approach deserves further study."" HIV may be 'functionally cured' in some . 'Berlin patient' Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the ""Berlin patient."" In 2007, Brown, an HIV-positive American living in Germany, was battling both leukemia and HIV when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his HIV. In an interview last year, Brown told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, he was still HIV-free. ""I've been tested everywhere possible,"" said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco. ""My blood's been tested by many, many agencies. I've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find HIV in my colon, and they haven't been able to find any."" But Brown's case is rare. And the procedure, which is extremely dangerous, won't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus. Researchers tell CNN only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have this particular mutation. In June, five years after he was ""cured,"" reports surfaced that ""traces"" of the virus had been found in Brown's blood. Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured. In fact, many AIDS experts said they believe Brown has experienced what's called a ""sterilizing"" cure, meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely. Routine clinical testing on the Mississippi toddler continues. ""We have formed a hypothesis,"" Luzuriaga said, ""and that is already driving the design of new studies and clinical trials that will help us to answer the question of whether by coming in very early we will be able to treat children for a while and then remove them from therapy.""

"Five Republican presidential candidates are boycotting a proposed Univision debate because of what they say were unethical reporting practices by the Spanish-language network in how it handled a story concerning Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Univision Tuesday denied allegations that it told Rubio it might not broadcast a story about his brother-in-law's 24-year-old drug conviction if the freshman senator appeared on ""Al Punto,"" one of the network's news programs. Univision has called the allegations ""absurd"" and says its July story of the drug bust was reported fairly and accurately. ""With respect to Sen. Rubio, Univision covered the issue in the same objective and impartial manner in which we cover all important news,"" Isaac Lee, president of Univision news, said in a written statement. ""Univision did not offer to soften or ignore the report about an anti-drug raid that involved the family of Sen. Rubio. We would never make such an offer with any protagonist in a news report and we did not make an offer in this case."" Rubio, the former Florida House speaker, is a freshman senator and a star among Republicans, who talk about him as a possible running mate on the GOP ticket next year. Univision has tried for quite some time to have him as a guest on its network news programs, where he would likely face tough questions about his stance on immigration reform. The Miami Herald was the first news organization to report the story. It said it obtained its information from various sources, including some from within Univision. A spokesman from Rubio's office said that  ""The Miami Herald's article is accurate. Univision employees themselves were the first to come forward with this account, and we confirmed it."" Rep. David Rivera, a close friend of Rubio, told CNN Wednesday that he had talked with Rubio and his family members ""minute by minute as the incident was occurring."" ""I don't think the staffers of Marco Rubio's office were ... inventing those details. They were very, very clear details. ... It was a clear exchange of having the exclusive interview with the senator and that way, not airing the report about the relative of Marco Rubio,"" the Republican congressman said. The allegations against Univision prompted three Hispanic GOP leaders in Florida to call for the GOP presidential candidates to boycott Univision's proposed debate in late January in the Sunshine state, just before Florida holds its presidential primary. The candidates who have agreed to boycott the debate are former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, businessman and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain, and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Univision was proposing to hold a debate on January 29, two days before Florida Republicans' presidential primary. CNN and the Republican Party of Florida are hosting a presidential debate in the days before the primary, and NBC and Telemundo, another Spanish-language network, also are planning to host on a debate in Florida around the same time.","A congressman says he heard about the situation from Rubio as it occurred .

"President Barack Obama took his economic relief plan on the road to Colorado Wednesday, highlighting new measures designed to help college graduates manage student loan debt. One of the president's measures will push up the start date for more favorable terms on a special loan repayment program based on income.   Another measure is designed to encourage graduates with two or more kinds of federal loans to consolidate them and get a small break on interest rates. Obama discussed the two initiatives -- part of a White House strategy to bypass a polarized, seemingly ineffectual Congress -- during an appearance in Denver.  The stop came at the end of a three-day presidential trip that also included stops in Nevada and California. ""These changes will make a difference for millions of Americans,"" Obama told a college crowd.  ""We should be doing everything we can to put a college education within the reach of every American."" The president also blasted Congress for failing to pass his larger $447 billion jobs bill, once again accusing Republicans of blocking his agenda for short-term partisan gain. ""It's time to put country ahead of party,"" he declared.  ""It's time to put the next generation ahead of the next election."" College education costs have continued to spike in recent years.  The price of attending the average public university rose 5.4% for in-state students to $21,447 this fall, according to a report released Wednesday by the College Board.  The cost for one year at a typical private college rose 4.3% to $42,224. The average student loan debt for the graduating class of 2009 at four-year nonprofit colleges was $24,000, according to the Institute for College Access & Success. While college costs are rising, employment prospects for new college graduates are dimming.  In 2010, the unemployment rate for college graduates age 24 and younger rose to 9.4%, the highest since the Labor Department began keeping records in 1985. One of Obama's proposals would advance the start date for a special loan repayment program based on income that aims to help struggling graduates. The way the Income-Based Repayment Plan works now is that graduates who enroll get charged 15% of their monthly discretionary income to pay off loans, with debt forgiven after 25 years. Congress passed a law set to go into effect in 2014 that would drop the monthly payment for loans originated that year to 10% of discretionary income and would forgive all debt after 20 years. The administration would improve on the law by fast-forwarding the new terms to take effect in 2012 on loans originated that year,  White House domestic policy adviser Melody Barnes noted Tuesday. So far, about 450,000 students are enrolled in the income-based repayment plan, but hundreds of thousands more are eligible. The other proposal would encourage graduates with two or more kinds of federal loans to consolidate their loans, giving them a small interest rate break of 0.5%, according to Barnes. Obama's student loan relief event in Colorado followed an appearance in Nevada on Monday in which the president unveiled new measures meant to help struggling homeowners refinance their mortgages.  Most economists cite the depressed housing market as one of the primary reasons for country's continued economic weakness. Political analysts also cite electoral reasons for the president's current trip, which has included a number of fundraisers for his upcoming re-election campaign.  Obama carried Colorado and Nevada in 2008, but both states are expected to be hotly contested in 2012. The president's focus on college loan assistance could also help him with younger voters -- generally a core Democratic constituency.  In 2008, Obama carried two-thirds of all voters ages 18 to 24, according to national exit polls.","Obama says his changes will help ""millions of Americans""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The barricaded suspect in the slaying of an Athens, Georgia, police officer released four of eight hostages Friday night, said Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Keenan said the GBI is in contact with the suspect, who authorities have identified as Jamie Donnell Hood. Hoping to get a message to Hood via local newscasts, Keenan said, ""I want to commit to you, if you come out without a weapon, you will not be harmed."" ""We have a good rapport with him,"" Keenan said of Hood, who was in an apartment. Hood is wanted in connection to Tuesday's slaying of Senior Police Officer Elmer ""Buddy"" Christian, 34, and the wounding of Senior Police Officer Tony Howard, 43. ""It is our objective to have the safe release of the persons that are in the apartment with him, and then to have the safe surrender of Mr. Hood,"" Keenan told reporters earlier. John Bankhead, a GBI spokesman, said Hood has asked negotiators to bring his mother to the scene. He and Keenan both said that children are among the hostages. Keenan would not say how long the hostages had been held and declined to provide any further details. ""There's too much at stake here,"" he said. The incident began Tuesday afternoon on the east side of the city when a vehicle was carjacked, said Hilda Sorrow, a police spokeswoman. Hood, who was believed to be involved, was later seen as a passenger in another vehicle, a red SUV, she said. When Howard stopped that SUV near Sycamore Drive and Atlanta Highway, the man believed to be Hood got out and began shooting, police said. As the gunman ran off, he came across Christian's patrol car, Sorrow said, and fired into the vehicle. On foot, the gunman eventually reached a highway and carjacked a Chevrolet Prizm, police said. It was later found abandoned, Sorrow said. According to police, Hood is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs about 175 pounds. He has several tattoos, including ""Robert/Dad"" on his right arm and ""Mom/Azale"" and a heart on his left arm. He was last seen wearing a white shirt with a yellow design and blue jean shorts. Athens, about 70 miles northeast of Atlanta, is home to the University of Georgia.

"Nostalgia wins again! Disney's ""The Lion King 3D,"" a technologically enhanced re-release of the 1994 animated classic, tore up the competition at the box office this weekend, earning an estimated $29.3 million -- more than the other three newcomers combined. In ""The Lion King's"" original theatrical run, it roared up a stunning $312.9 million total, becoming the highest-grossing animated film in box office history at that time. The film earned another $15.7 million during a 2002 IMAX re-release, and now another $29.3 million during the first weekend of its two-week run. All told, Simba and company have grossed $357.8 million in theaters domestically over the last two decades. And then there's the home market, where Disney is hoping buyers will seek out ""The Lion King"" on Blu-ray 3D when it debuts on Oct. 4. According to The-Numbers, ""The Lion King"" has amassed $1.5 billion in home market revenue from video sales and rentals, and after the profitable publicity of this weekend, that number should be moving up shortly. ""The Mouse House"" converted ""The Lion King"" into 3-D for a very low cost (a rep for the studio said ""the low single digits""), so even if the film completely bombs on DVD -- which it won't -- it's already proving to be a big success. An impressive 92 percent of ""The Lion King 3D's"" gross came from 3-D screens, and it earned a terrific $12,575 per theater average by playing to a very wide range of moviegoers. People under the age of 25 made up 59 percent of the audience, as families (who made up 74 percent of the audience) took their kids to see the film. Still, many couples and young people without children saw the film simply for nostalgic reasons. Women slightly edged out men in rewatching the popular musical -- females made up 56 percent of the crowd. But enough about lions -- let's get to the rest of the chart! Last weekend's champ, ""Contagion,"" came in second place, declining just 35 percent to $14.5 million and lifting its total to $44.2 million. The well-reviewed illness thriller remained a top choice for adult audiences on a weekend when ""Straw Dogs,"" ""Drive,"" and ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" were all targeting them as well. If the Warner Brothers picture can maintain soft week-to-week drops, it will have no trouble earning back its $60 million budget. Ryan Gosling's artsy thriller ""Drive"" raced into third place with $11 million. The R-rated FilmDistrict production, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, played mostly to an older crowd, as 75 percent of the audience was 25 or older. Unfortunately,  not everyone who saw the film liked it — despite strong critical reviews, audiences issued ""Drive"" a harsh ""C--"" CinemaScore grade, which does not bode well for its box-office longevity. Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come to Gosling/Refn collaborations. The film earned a fair $3,818 per theater average. In fourth place was Disney's stalwart August release ""The Help,"" which continued to work up solid numbers in its sixth weekend. The Kathryn Stockett adaptation fell by 28 percent to $6.4 million, and it has now earned $147.4 million against its $25 million budget. If only the films in fifth and sixth place were so lucky... ""Straw Dogs"" debuted in fifth place with a very weak $5 million. The Sony remake (of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 film with Dustin Hoffman), which played mostly to males (60 percent) and older audiences (61 percent at least 25 years-old) has already exhibited major frontloadedness, earning $2 million on Friday but only 2.5 times that over the full frame. With a ""C"" CinemaScore grade, ""Straw Dogs"" will be lucky to break $10 million total. Next up was Sarah Jessica Parker's rom-com ""I Don't Know How She Does It,"" which I can only imagine is a two-hour clip of Parker wondering how she (obviously, Nala), actually does it (makes money at the box office). The Weinstein production, produced for about $20-25 million, earned just $4.5 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period, failing even to live up to Parker's 2009 box-office bomb ""Did You Hear About The Morgans?,"" which debuted to $6.6 million. The film was viewed by 74 percent females, and it received a ""B--"" CinemaScore grade. Other notable box-office happenings this weekend: ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" crossed the $170 million plateau, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" surpassed $80 million total, and ""Kevin Hart: Laugh At My Pain"" earned another $1.2 million out of only 230 theaters, lifting its 10-day total to a remarkable $3.6 million. 1.

He said officers had to unscrew the system's cover before reaching the body. ""It would appear that she was killed very quickly,"" Miller told reporters. He did not provide further details. Summer Inman's abduction and the arrests connected to her case have made national news recently. The mother of three was working as part of a cleaning crew at a local bank on March 22, police said. When she stepped outside, she was grabbed and forced into a white vehicle. Miller said that the evidence suggests all three suspects played a role in the kidnapping, but he would not discuss whether they were involved in the apparent murder. Summer Inman and William Inman Jr. were married in 2004 but the couple was separated, CNN affiliate WBNS reported. Summer Inman had also filed for divorce and claimed in court documents that her husband had threatened to kill her if she took his children away, the affiliate reported.","NEW: The mother-in-law provided details where the corpse was located, police say .

"A jury in Georgia convicted a former peanut company owner Friday of conspiracy, fraud and other federal charges in a groundbreaking case stemming from a deadly salmonella outbreak almost six years ago. The guilty verdict marks the first federal felony conviction for a company executive in a food safety case. Prosecutor Michael Moore said he hopes the trial will send a strong message to the food industry that its officials are now on notice that they'll be held accountable for foodborne illnesses. The jury's verdict came after a seven-week trial for Stewart Parnell and his brother and food broker, Michael Parnell, both charged with 76 federal counts linked to intentionally shipping out salmonella-laced peanut products. Michael Parnell was also found guilty on multiple counts. A third defendant, former plant quality control manager Mary Wilkerson, was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice. The Parnell brothers, Moore said, ""could easily spend the rest of their lives in prison."" Both men were taken into custody pending sentencing. Bond was set at $150,000 for Stewart Parnell and $100,000 for his brother, Moore said. A sentencing date has not been set. Stewart Parnell's lawyer, Thomas Bondurant, said he will appeal the verdict. ""We think it was the wrong decision and we will continue to fight on behalf of Stewart Parnell,"" he said. Jeff Almer, whose mother, Shirley Almer, died after she ate peanut butter that came from Parnell's processing plant, Peanut Corp. of America, said he felt relief as the clerk began to read the verdict. He had prepared to hear the worst -- that the Parnells would be acquitted. Instead, he heard the word ""guilty"" over and over again. ""It was validation,"" said Almer, who traveled from Minnesota to Georgia for the trial. ""It was emotional."" After about the 14th ""guilty,"" the words began to fade and Almer thought of his mother, who died four days before Christmas in 2008. ""I don't think these people are devils,"" he said, ""but they let greed take over their morals."" Food safety lawyers also applauded the jury's decision. ""If anybody deserved it, he did,"" Minnesota-based trial lawyer Fred Pritzker said of Stewart Parnell. ""I am not at all surprised he was found guilty given the evidence against him,"" said Pritzker, who represented some of the victims of the outbreak. Federal prosecutors presented more than 1,000 documents and called 45 witnesses to the stand to make their case that Parnell, his brother and Wilkerson cut corners on safety in order to make a bigger profit for Peanut Corp. They were accused of covering up lab results that tested positive for salmonella in their peanut products. The prosecution's blistering opening statement contained three now-infamous words Stewart Parnell penned in a March 2007 email to a plant manager about tainted products: ""Just ship it."" Defense statements and witnesses, which took all of 104 minutes, portrayed Parnell as a small business owner who was scapegoated by the government. At one point, the jury was shown a photograph of peanut butter made at Peanut Corp. sitting on Parnell's dining table at home. Defense attorneys said Parnell would not have had the peanut butter in his own home had he known it to be compromised. The trial opened August 1 in Albany, Georgia, less than an hour's drive from the Peanut Corp. plant in the small town of Blakely, raided and shuttered in 2009 by federal food inspectors. The 2008-2009 salmonella outbreak killed nine people, sickened at least 714 others nationwide and resulted in a huge food recall that cast a pall over one of America's favorite foods: peanut butter. Food safety advocates said the trial was groundbreaking because it's so rare corporate executives are held accountable in court for bacteria in food. Never before had a jury heard a criminal case in which a corporate chief faced federal felony charges for knowingly shipping out food containing salmonella. Pritzker praised public health officials whose sleuth work eventually traced the outbreak's origins back to the Peanut Corp. plant in Blakely. ""I don't view (Parnell's) conduct as any different than poisoning people or drunk driving,"" Pritzker said. ""My strong suspicion is that this happens much more often than is known."" However, Parnell and his co-defendants were not on trial for poisoning people or causing any deaths stemming from the outbreak, and prosecutors did not mention the deaths to the jury. Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who also represented several victims of the outbreak, said the government would have had the added burden of proving the deaths were linked to Parnell had they mentioned them. Those facts were not necessary, Marler said, to prove the charges at hand. Marler said he hopes Friday's verdict will send a message to corporations that they cannot get away with this kind of behavior. The prosecution was unprecedented, Marler said, because the Department of Justice charged the Parnell brothers with felonies. Prior cases involved misdemeanors. ""Prosecutors took a risk and fortunately, the jury believed them,"" Marler said. ""The jury saw this for what it was. The emails and documents told a story of a company that was more interested in shipping out products than products that were safe."" Salmonella is America's most common cause of foodborne illness and sickens up to 1.4 million people every year. Former employees of Peanut Corp. described filthy conditions at the Georgia plant. Federal inspectors found roaches, rats, mold, dirt, accumulated grease and bird droppings during their raid. They also found a leaky roof. Salmonella is often associated with meat, poultry, eggs and raw milk -- products from animals that are carriers of the bacteria. It also thrives in the intestines of birds and can be found in fruits and vegetables and in ingredients made from them. The presence of water in what is supposed to be a dry processing facility for peanuts is like adding gasoline to fire for salmonella, food safety experts say. Health officials discovered similar poor conditions at Peanut Corp.'s other processing plant in Plainview, Texas. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy shortly after it was shut down. Two former plant managers worked out deals with the government in exchange for their testimonies against Parnell.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors dismissed a charge Monday against a community activist who was arrested while filming a police encounter with her iPod camera because she was concerned it was initiated by racial profiling. ""I'm feeling vindicated, I'm feeling energetic"" Emily Good, 28, of Rochester, New York, said of the decision to have the charge dropped. Good had been charged with obstruction of governmental administration when she began videotaping the interrogation of a black man by three white officers in front of her house on May 12, she said. ""Based upon the evidence, we could not make out the elements of the crime charged,"" Monroe County First Assistant District Attorney Sandra Doorley said. Good said she intends to file a civil suit. In a joint statement, Rochester Mayor Thomas S. Richards, City Council President Lovely A. Warren and Police Chief James Sheppard commended the decision to drop the charges against Good and said an internal review is being conducted into the incident. ""Police officers must be able to cope with a high degree of stress while performing oftentimes dangerous duties, relying on their training and experience to guide their behavior,"" the statement said. ""We want to make clear that it is not the policy or practice of the Rochester Police Department to prevent citizens from observing its activities -- including photographing or videotaping -- as long as it does not interfere with the safe conduct of those activities,"" the statement said. Additionally, the statement said an internal review would be conducted into a separate incident in which tickets were given ""for parking violations of vehicles belonging to members of an organization associated with Ms. Good."" According to Good, the statement refers to an episode on June 23, when police carrying rulers showed up outside a meeting at a community center supporting her and began issuing tickets to cars parked more than 12 inches from the curb. Both incidents ""raise issues with respect to the conduct of Rochester police officers that require an internal review,"" the statement said. In the May 12 video, provided to CNN, Good can be heard telling officers ""this is my front yard. I'm just recording what you're doing, it's my right."" One of the three officers responds by telling Good, ""I don't feel safe with you standing behind me, so I'm going to ask you to go into your house."" Though the officer repeatedly orders Good to return to her house, she refuses. ""It's my right to be in my yard and I'm sorry you don't feel safe. All I have is a camera. ... I have no weapons,"" Good says on the recording. About two minutes into the video, a police officer can be heard saying, ""You know what, you're going to go to jail,"" and then proceeds to arrest Good.","Charge dropped against Emily Good, who was arrested for videotaping a police encounter .

"(CNN) -- The former director of a Chicago-area cemetery where hundreds of graves were dug up and resold has pleaded guilty to several charges involving the desecration of human remains. Carolyn Towns, 51, who ran the Burr Oak Cemetery when the allegations surfaced in 2009, was sentenced to 12 years in prison Friday after she pleaded guilty to all charges against her, including dismembering a human body and theft from a place of worship, according to state prosecutors in Cook County, Illinois. Three grave diggers face charges. As part of the scheme, prosecutors said, the grave diggers would exhume bodies, crushing vaults and caskets before dumping human remains at the cemetery's trash site. The workers would ""double stack"" graves, meaning they would bury existing remains deeper into the ground before placing new remains in the same location, authorities said. Towns ""is very remorseful, not only for the pain she caused her family, but the families of people who have loved ones at Burr Oak,"" defense attorney Susana Ortiz said, according to CNN affiliate WLS. ""She accepted responsibility for the allegations in this case, and she would just like to put this behind her and move on with her life."" Weeks after the investigation began, the White House issued a statement clarifying that first lady Michelle Obama's late father, Fraser Robinson III, was not buried in Burr Oak, but in a graveyard a few miles away. The first lady's communications director had mistakenly reported he was buried in Burr Oak. The Cook County Sheriff's Department received more than 5,000 telephone inquiries and 1,700 e-mails regarding missing relatives, throughout their investigation. At the time, Sheriff Thomas J. Dart said the scene at the cemetery was disturbing. ""I found bones out there,"" he said. ""I found individuals wandering aimlessly looking for their loved ones who can't find them."" The investigation also extended into ""Babyland,"" a section of the cemetery intended for children. Dart said he talked to countless women who could not find their children. Authorities also discovered the original glass-faced casket belonging to 14-year-old Emmett Till, piled in a garage filled with lawn care equipment. Thousands rallied behind Till's family after he was violently murdered in August 1955 for reportedly whistling at a white woman. His body was exhumed in 2005 following a renewed investigation into his death. He was reburied in a new casket. Groundskeepers told investigators Till's body was not disturbed, but the Rev. Jesse Jackson told reporters the desecration of his original casket was very painful.","The allegations against Burr Oak Cemetery surfaced in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- A group of media companies on Wednesday asked a North Carolina judge to unseal court documents in a lawsuit involving the John Edwards sex-tape case. The motion by the media companies, which include CNN, does not seek public release of the sex tape or any intimate photos that might exist. Instead, it argues that most details in the case already have been made public by the parties themselves, and therefore the motions and depositions so far should be public records as called for under North Carolina law. Edwards, a former U.S. senator and Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2004, has given a deposition in the lawsuit of his former mistress, Rielle Hunter, against former Edwards aide Andrew Young. Hunter, who bore a child of Edwards, is suing Young to reclaim materials that she says belong to her, including the alleged sex tape that involves Edwards. Superior Court Judge Carl Fox previously ordered the motion compelling Edwards to give his deposition, as well as the deposition itself, to be sealed from public disclosure. ""The public interest in Senator Edwards' deposition and the other depositions in this case is significant, while the privacy interests of Senator Edwards and the parties -- who voluntarily participated in events of significant public importance and have widely and openly discussed all of the events underlying this litigation -- are negligible,"" said the motion by the media companies. Young was a senior aide to Edwards who originally claimed that Hunter's child was his own in an effort to shield Edwards from having to make the disclosure. Edwards eventually did acknowledge his paternity. His last public appearance was at the funeral for his wife, Elizabeth Edwards, who passed away last December after a six-year battle with cancer. Edwards also is under investigation about whether or not he illegally used campaign funds to cover up his affair with Hunter, a campaign videographer.","A motion is filed by media companies including CNN .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced on Thursday -- St. Patrick's Day -- that he will stop in Ireland in May as a side trip from his state visit to the United Kingdom, and that he hopes to visit the birthplace there of his great-great-great-great-great grandfather. He made the announcement as he met with the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny in the Oval Office. The birthplace is in Moneygall, he said, adding that he also plans to visit ""famous sites"" in the country. Obama -- clad in a light green tie and sporting shamrocks emerging from his suit pocket -- stressed the ""incredible bond"" between the two countries. Beyond the customary comments on his guest's leadership, the president thanked Ireland for its assistance with the U.S. effort in Afghanistan and on issues such as food security, and hailed progress and stability in Northern Ireland. For his part, Kenny, who wore an even greener tie, said his country will be honored to host Obama in May, and he is even looking forward to a possible round of golf with the president. Obama said he heard the prime minister's game was pretty good so he may need to practice a bit before hitting the links with Kenny. After the Oval Office meeting, Kenny, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were scheduled to attend a St. Patrick's Day lunch at the Capitol featuring roast angus beef with wild onion chanterelle compote, followed by an evening reception in the East Room of the White House. Kenny began the day with a trip to Biden's residence at the Naval Observatory for a breakfast with guests that included U.S. senators, Supreme Court justices, and Cabinet secretaries. Kenny, who was elected to his post earlier this year, is facing problems at home with high unemployment and a tough economic environment in the wake of the country's near miss with bankruptcy last year. This is his first visit to Washington as prime minister and his first meeting with Obama.","Obama meets with Irish Prime Minister Kenny in the Oval Office .

"The gridlock and partisanship that threatens to ruin Christmas in Washington could be an election year gift for President Barack Obama's campaign. A growing number of voters , 50% compared to 44% in March, trust Obama to solve the nation's problems while the percentage of those with faith in congressional Republicans is slipping, according to a CNN/ORC International Poll. CNN Poll: President's approval nearing 50% . For the Obama team, the poll numbers seem to validate the president's fall and winter strategy: Intone the jobs message like a mantra while squaring off against a do-nothing Congress and congressional Republicans in particular. ""We can't wait for an increasingly dysfunctional Congress to do its job. Where they won't act, I will,"" the president told a Las Vegas audience in October. Congress has accomplished a few things, passing trade bills and a tax credit for unemployed veterans. But thanks to repeated failed votes on elements of the jobs bill and  leaving town for the holidays with a payroll tax extension unresolved, the lasting image is one of inaction. McCain: Payroll tax cut showdown 'harming' the GOP . Call it a self-inflicted wound. When the president began the jobs push with his speech to Congress on September 8, his approval rating was at 43%. The new CNN/ORC Poll shows it now at 49%. That's the highest it has been since Osama Bin Laden was killed and up 5 points since November. What's happened in a month? On December 6, the president doubled down on his jobs message with a speech in Kansas in which he promised  to work toward an economy that promotes fairness and opportunity for all Americans. ""I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share and when everyone plays by the same rules. ... They're American values, and we have to reclaim them,"" he said. Meanwhile, Congress has failed to pass an extension of a payroll tax cut, which could cost $1,000 a year for an average family and affects about 160 million Americans. The president's campaign aides also see the poll numbers as a reaction to a contentious Republican primary. ""These numbers will go up and down. But the debates over the last few months have clearly had an impact,"" said Stephanie Cutter, Obama 2012 deputy campaign manager. ""On one side they've seen a president fighting to reclaim the security of the middle class and on the other side a group of people sort of paying lip service to the middle class, then actively working against them. That doesn't go unnoticed and the data is beginning to show that. ""There's a difference between putting middle class in your talking points and actually doing something about what they're going through."" Republicans are quick to point out that the president is starting from historic lows for an incumbent. ""These numbers are better than they were in November but it's nothing to be jumping up and down about. Instead of being really, really bad, it's just really bad for the president,"" said Republican pollster Ed Goeas. The CNN/ORC Poll also shows that the Republican brand has suffered. Only 43% of voters have a favorable view of the Republican Party, down 6 points since June, while the numbers for the Democratic Party have held steady at 55%. The view of the GOP has slipped since the debt-ceiling debacle and top Democratic operatives are convinced the Republican Party has taken more of the blame for the gridlock in Washington. They believe the GOP is likely to take a further hit if the payroll tax cuts aren't extended. However, it's unclear how the payroll tax cuts standoff will play in the end, because Obama's re-election hopes are tied to the overall health of the economy. If Congress fails to act, recession would be a ""significant threat,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. And few fates are worse for an incumbent president than running against a recession.","When Obama began his jobs push, his approval rating was  43%, new poll has it  at 49% .

"Yemen's president became the fourth Arab leader forced from power this year when he signed a deal Wednesday aimed at ending his country's months-long political crisis. The deal, brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council and signed in Saudi Arabia, allows Ali Abdullah Saleh to retain the title of president for three months but requires him to hand over executive powers to Yemen's vice president. The agreement cleared a key roadblock in the transition to a new era for Yemen, which has been the scene of violent protests for months as Saleh's opponents demanded that he leave power after 33 years in office. ""This monumental agreement will hopefully bring an end to the 10-month long turmoil in the homeland,"" Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for Yemen's Embassy in Washington, said in a statement. After signing the deal, Saleh said that his country will ""need decades to rebuild what the crisis left"" and that the transfer of power should be ""peaceful and democratic."" Analysts said many uncertainties remain in Yemen's political future, including when the country will hold elections and how Saleh's family members and other supporters in the military will act now. It was also unclear how protesters, who have demanded that Saleh be held accountable, would react to the agreement, which provided him with immunity from prosecution. The Gulf Cooperation Council accord, which is backed by the United States and the European Union, allows Saleh to retain his title as Yemen's president for 90 days, until elections are held, according to a Western diplomat in Yemen. Before the deal's signing, a presidential source said Saleh would remain permanently in Saudi Arabia after he signed it. Another Yemeni government official said it was unclear what Saleh would do. ""Everything's unpredictable with Saleh. He's due for some health checkups,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. ""At least for the period now, it makes sense he would stay in Saudi for some time."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday that Saleh told him he planned to come to New York for medical treatment after the deal was signed. Last week, Saleh told France 24 television that he would leave office ""within 90 days"" of an agreement with the council. Saleh had previously appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to hand over power several times, only to change course. He insisted in the interview with France 24 that he had no desire to ""hang on to power."" ""I know the difficulties, the negatives, the positives; I will not hang on to power. Whoever hangs on to power I think is crazy,"" he said. Clashes erupted in Yemen's capital of Sanaa on Wednesday, just hours after Saleh and opposition leaders headed to Saudi Arabia for the signing ceremony. The fighting between government forces and tribal fighters began after government forces attacked opposition posts, several witnesses in the area said. During months of violent uprisings, government troops have responded with live fire on protesters, killing many, according to medics and opposition sources. On Saturday, 400 troops defected from the Yemeni military, saying they would no longer attack unarmed protesters. Saleh was wounded in an attack on his compound this year and spent three months in Saudi Arabia being treated for burns. International powers, including the United States, have urged him to step down. United Nations envoy to Yemen Jamal Benomar said Wednesday that more work needs to be done after the power transfer agreement is signed. ""The transitional government will be responsible for rebuilding the economy and will undergo dialogue with the youth movements to ensure their support and participation in the political arena,"" he said. Saleh's signing of the deal is the latest in a string of power shifts spurred by popular uprisings that have swept through a number of Arab countries since January. Former Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who had ruled Tunisia since taking power in a coup in 1987, fled to Saudi Arabia in January. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was the next to lose his grip on power, stepping down on February 11 after tens of thousands of Egyptians set up a protest camp in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Last month, former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed in his hometown of Sirte, where he had fled after rebel fighters took control of the country's capital. In October 2010, all four leaders were smiling as they appeared in a photograph at a summit of African and Arab leaders in Libya.","Ali Abdullah Saleh says his country ""will need decades to rebuild what the crisis left""

"(CNN) -- Once again, there are rumblings that the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers may merge to form a larger combined No. 3. But would this be enough to keep the U.S. wireless market competitive for consumers? Last week Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Telekom AG, the parent company of T-Mobile, is negotiating a possible sale of T-Mobile to Sprint Nextel Corp. According to The Hill and The Washington Post, some industry analysts believe the U.S. government would approve this merger. Rumors of this merger have been around since 2009, when DT was eyeing a purchase of Sprint. And last weekend, TMOnews reported on an ambiguous non-confirmation/non-denial memo sent to T-Mobile employees by CEO Philip Humm. Given the nature of wireless networks and the current business landscape, T-Mobile probably needs to make some kind of major move if it hopes to survive in some form. In the big picture, it takes a lot of capital to build out high-speed wireless broadband networks that can support an ever-growing number of data-hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets -- especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular, and if the Obama administration is serious about its national wireless initiative to make wireless broadband available to 98% of the U.S. population. Carriers with the largest customer base -- especially the most customers locked in to pricey two-year contracts -- are in the best financial position to build out their 4G networks. Having those networks, in turn, makes the largest carriers even more likely to attract even more customers. And this is the economic dynamic that could turn the U.S. wireless market into a Verizon/AT&T duopoly, with only some discount carriers surviving on the fringes. For U.S. mobile users, further wireless market consolidation is a good news/bad news situation. It offers the promise of ubiquitous high-speed wireless broadband networks available in markets outside major metro areas, which would lessen the geographic aspect of the mobile digital divide. But just because wireless broadband is available in a region doesn't mean everyone there can afford to use it. A less competitive wireless market could mean wireless broadband won't get much cheaper. And it could even get more costly, especially if tiered data plans become the norm -- which would make more sense for the carriers in a less competitive environment. That would be bad news on the income/class front of the mobile digital divide. Lately, T-Mobile has been taking a bit of a beating in the U.S. market. Bloomberg noted: ""T-Mobile ... has lost customers at an accelerated rate as it trailed rivals in building out a third-generation mobile network and missed out on being able to sell Apple's iPhone. About 56,000 customers abandoned T-Mobile USA last year, while Sprint, AT&T and Verizon Wireless all boosted their counts."" Consequently, DT may not be pleased with what Sprint may be willing to offer for T-Mobile -- so who knows if this merger will happen. Furthermore, a T-Mobile/Sprint merger might be difficult for technical reasons. Wireless Week noted: ""T-Mobile currently markets its HSPA+ network as 4G but lacks the bandwidth to deploy LTE or WiMAX. Sprint and T-Mobile use different network technology and operate on different spectrum bands, which would complicate a possible merger of the companies' wireless services."" If T-Mobile hopes to survive intact, it'll need access to much more bandwidth in more U.S. locations. So if the Sprint merger doesn't happen, T-Mobile does have options -- mainly leasing additional spectrum or access to other providers' networks, such as LightSquared, a wholesale-only wireless LTE network. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Deutsche Telekom AG is negotiating a possible sale of T-Mobile to Sprint Nextel Corp .

"(CNN) -- The infamous meat dress Lady Gaga was grilled for wearing at the MTV Video Music Awards last year will be unveiled Thursday as the main course in a sizzling new display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It will join the ""Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power"" exhibit at the hall in Cleveland, Ohio. The dress, once made of juicy cuts of raw Argentinean beef, was treated and preserved by a taxidermist over a number of weeks. ""The dress was kept in a meat locker until the treatment was ready to begin,"" said a statement from the hall. ""It was then placed in a vat of chemicals and, while still pliable, was put on a body form and allowed to dry."" To keep the dress from looking like a large collection of beef jerky, it was painted to look like fresh meat. Lady Gaga wore the dress when she accepted the award for Best Video of the Year for ""Bad Romance"" at the MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010. It was a collaboration by designers Franc Fernandez and Nichola Formichetti.

"(CNN) -- If you access Facebook via the Web browser on a ""feature phone"" -- a simpler, less powerful cousin to the smartphone -- your experience might improve significantly over the next few weeks. On Friday, Facebook announced an upgrade to its ""lean"" mobile site m.facebook.com. This upgrade integrates the full range of features found in Facebook's mobile site for smartphones and other phones with touchscreen browsers: touch.facebook.com. This update is being rolled out gradually to Facebook users. Facebook product designer Lee Byron explained: ""With the new m.facebook.com, users with high-end touch devices will see a rich touch-friendly interface; for users with feature phones, the site will look and work great. ...There will no longer be a difference between m.facebook.com and touch.facebook.com, we'll automatically serve you the best version of the site for your device."" Here's why this is a smart move -- one that I wish more online sites and services would emulate. Too often, as popular sites and services upgrade their mobile offerings, they cater primarily to smartphone users -- which means they end up leaving the vast majority of mobile users further behind. According to new numbers from ComScore, currently only 29% of handsets in use in the U.S. are smartphones. A brief definition: While the lines between the two types of devices are becoming blurred, smartphones are defined as having operating systems capable of running ""native"" apps with a wide range of sophisticated functions, and fully featured web browsers (usually based on the Webkit browser). Feature phones tend to be cheaper, simpler, and more limited. Often feature phones lack touchscreens, and they usually run simple apps based on Java. While smartphones are getting more popular, and many feature phones are getting smarter -- well, at least getting better Web browsers -- most mobile users aren't yet willing to handle the costs and complexity associated with smartphones. Consequently, feature phones will likely continue to be a huge part of the mobile market for at least a few more years. MSNBC reports that Facebook currently has about 600 million users worldwide, and about 250 million of them already access Facebook from their cell phones. With an enhanced experience for simpler cell phones, I'd expect that Facebook might quickly grow its mobile user base -- and probably also pick up a lot of new website users. That's the point: Facebook's business model hinges on getting as many people as possible engaged as much as possible. This means finding a way to efficiently serve the mobile devices they're using today -- not just targeting the mobile devices they might be using a few years from now. The move to upgrade and unify Facebook's mobile Web experience also will streamline Web development for Facebook. As if it isn't complicated enough to maintain native apps for each major smartphone operating system (iOS, Android, BlackBerry, etc.), maintaining multiple mobile website versions consumes considerable time and resources. ""Every time we launched a new feature, we had to build it multiple times across different code bases,"" wrote Byron. ""Once for facebook.com, then again for m.facebook.com, touch.facebook.com, and in native applications as well. Honestly, we weren't very good at doing this, so certain features were missing on different devices."" Coupled with Facebook's recent acquisition of Snaptu -- a popular platform for Java-based apps that runs on most feature phones -- this consolidation of the company's mobile Web efforts indicates an unusually inclusive mobile strategy.

"The president of Florida A&M University moved Wednesday to dismiss the school's longtime band director in the wake of last weekend's hazing-linked death of a drum major in the school's famed marching band. ""The reason for this intended employment action is based upon your alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the 'Marching 100,'"" President James H. Ammons said in a letter to Julian E. White. The letter, which was marked ""confidential,"" notified White that he was being dismissed effective December 22 and placed on administrative leave with pay effective immediately. The letter, which gave White 10 days to respond to Ammons, was provided to CNN by the university. White, who had led the 420-member band since 1998, did not return a call from CNN. ""Wow,"" said Felicia Fabre, the mother of another band member who, she said, had also been hazed. She said she had mixed emotions about the dismissal. ""I believe that he did the best that he could,"" she told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that White had appeared sincere about trying to stop the hazing. ""I think that it goes further than just him. He had people working under him that need to be held just as responsible."" But Berlinda Johnson, whose 18-year-old son is a band member whom she did not want to identify by name for fear of retribution, praised White. ""Any time I alerted him to an issue, Dr. White was always responsive,"" she told CNN. She blamed section directors for setting the tone that allowed hazing to occur, despite White's efforts to halt it. ""I do not think he had the support that he needed,"" she said. Johnson accused a section leader of having hit her son in the back when practices first began last summer, and said that was just the beginning. ""I reported maybe four to five incidents,"" she told CNN. ""They need to interview each member of the band, no matter how long it takes. This is not a witch hunt, this is about getting things under control."" Her son loves band, she said. ""but this year, freshman year, was not a fun year for him,"" she said. Wednesday's dismissal comes four days after band members returned to their Orlando hotel following Saturday's game. There, Robert Champion, 26, ""reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe,"" the sheriff's office said in a release. Champion was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. ""The investigation indicates that hazing was involved in the events that occurred prior to the 911 call for assistance,"" Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday. His death was not the first incident linked to hazing within the marching band, and school officials were well aware of the abuse, Fabre said. ""Oh my God, I warned them,"" she said, adding that she had met with band officials at the Tallahassee school after her son told her he too had been hazed. ""I went to them and told them, 'God has blessed you with so much prestige and so much honor, and if you don't do anything, it will take just one incident to bring your world down.' "" Fabre's 20-year-old son, Marcus, plays alto saxophone in the band and was among a number of musicians who were being maltreated, she said. ""My son told me he was mentally and verbally hazed; he was not physically beat, but that's because he doesn't allow that kind of thing. ""My son always stood up for himself -- he would say, last year when he was a freshman, they were picking on another freshman's sister and he had to stick up for her. These students are very disrespectful towards one another."" For some, the abuse went beyond verbal and psychological to include paddling, she said. Fabre said she met with and e-mailed band staffers about her concerns over what she saw as pervasive hazing. ""I addressed them to the leadership and they act like they don't know -- they say if students don't address it, then there's nothing they can do. If students aren't willing to stand up and say there's something going on, there's no one they can prosecute."" Marcus Fabre declined to speak to CNN, his mother said. ""He's just not ready to talk,"" she said. ""He's just not ready to go to that next level yet."" She forwarded to CNN a copy of an e-mail she sent in August to Ralph Turner, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and band director White, in which she described an incident one of her son's classmates said he had seen. ""He ... witnessed the same section leader ... choke the same student and held his neck up in this choking manner. This was done in a remote corner where he thought that he could not be seen by others. I could go on with horror stories, but I won't. Students do not report these acts because they are in fear of being ostracized."" ""I have spoken to Dr. White on many occasions -- he listened and said it would be addressed,"" Fabre wrote. Though band members must sign an anti-hazing agreement, the practice continues, Fabre said. ""It's not the band staff that does it, it's the section leaders, upperclassmen, the students that they've chosen to be in leadership,"" she said. Calls to the school's spokeswoman, Sharon Saunders and to Turner were not immediately returned. On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott sent a letter to Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey asking the department to join the investigation ""to assure that the circumstances leading to Mr. Champion's death become fully known, and that if there are individuals directly or indirectly responsible for this death, they are appropriately brought to justice and held accountable."" Authorities have not said what happened to Champion. A spokeswoman for the Orange County Medical Examiner's Office said Wednesday that the autopsy had not been completed and that no cause of death was available. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. After the incident, President Ammons suspended band performances and said he will convoke a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100."" ""The purpose of this review is not to establish culpability of individual band members in this particular case, but rather to determine whether there are patterns of behavior by the band -- or members of it -- that should be addressed at the institutional level,"" he said. Ammons acknowledged that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing. But that wasn't enough, according to Fabre. ""My prayer is there will be no cover-up,"" she said. ""They need to get the mess out of their band and start new."" She likened the hazing incidents to gang initiations and said they were carried out in secret. ""Not like street thugs, but here, if you want to be accepted, then you got to go through it."" Fabre said the incidents were ""like a generational curse that needs to be broken"" and held out hope that Champion's death would result in the end of hazing. ""Someone has got to break the cycle,"" she said. The Marching 100's motto lays out ""qualities to live by,"" including ""highest quality of character"" and ""dedication to service."" In 2009, the band represented Florida in the parade for President Barack Obama's inauguration.","""Oh my God, I warned them,"" mother of band member says .

"American architect Michael Graves has little patience for bad design. He also dislikes the ugly things he sees in hospitals. When he stayed at a rehabilitation center recovering from a rare, life-threatening infection, Graves eyed the magenta-and-green floral sheets on his bed. ""It's far too ugly for me to die here,"" he quipped in October at TEDMED, a conference about great ideas in health care. It got worse as he stayed at eight different hospitals and three rehabilitation centers adjusting to life in a wheelchair. ""They didn't make big mistakes,"" Graves said about various designs he observed in hospitals and rehab centers. ""They just made the most frustrating mistakes you could ever imagine and made your cure more difficult. Your room should make it easier for the doctors and the aides and the patient. But instead it does just the opposite."" Graves is one of the most revered living architects and has won numerous prizes in his field. Critics have hailed him as one of the original American voices in architecture as he has designed hundreds of buildings for corporations, governments, foundations and universities such as the Team Disney building in Burbank, California. He has been praised for making buildings functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. For many Americans, Graves might be best known as the designer of affordable household items sold at Target. The Graves line includes practical items from tea kettles and drying racks to whimsical kitchen equipment like avocado scoopers and large bamboo salad tongs. His Target line came with a simple, idealistic premise: ""Good design should be affordable to all."" Now Graves wants to extend his philosophy to hospitals. He became familiar with healthcare facilities eight years ago after a freak infection left him paralyzed. Doctors still cannot identify what caused the illness. In 2003, Graves, in high demand, kept a hectic schedule.  While in Europe on a business trip, he developed a cold he couldn't shake. ""My immune system was pretty low because of stress,"" he said.  ""I was standing on a site in Geneva, where it was below 0 [degrees], all day long, with a terrible cold."" The symptoms spread to his lower back.  Graves returned to the states and went to work the next morning, but the crippling pain only got worse. He went to the hospital, ""and by the next morning, I was paralyzed from the chest down,"" he said. Doctors couldn't identify the infection.  They have ruled out meningitis. Graves has been told about four other people in the United States have the same mystery illness.  The condition is so rare that there isn't a name for it. The sinus infection travels to the brain, then to the spine, causing paralysis. ""My spinal cord isn't cut,"" he explained.  ""It looks like the bottom of a sunken ship."" This meant Graves, an avid golfer and traveler, could no longer enjoy long walks on the green and strolls on Italy's cobblestone streets . Throughout his recovery, Graves became frustrated with his hospitals and facilities. At a rehabilitation center, he wheeled himself into the bathroom one morning.  When Graves reached for the sink faucet for hot water, the handle was out of reach. Toothpaste?  Also out of reach.  Toothbrush?  Out of reach. So he looked for an outlet for his electric razor.  The outlet was near the base of the wall near the floor -- also out of his reach from the wheelchair. The biggest aggravation, he said, was that the rehabilitation center was built for people in wheelchairs. ""When I went through some of the struggles that were caused by my room, I lost the self empowerment that I was supposedly gaining during the day in rehabilitation,"" said Graves.  ""I was no longer self-reliant, but dependent. This makes you feel terrible as a patient... as a paraplegic. You're feeling at the will of others."" He stayed at one glossy, new hospital with a four-story glass atrium and expansive lobbies.  But that hospital's patient rooms were so small that those in wheelchairs and hospital employees had a hard time maneuvering. ""All the money had been spent on the public spaces,"" he said.  ""The public spaces were glorious. I got to the patient room, these were the smallest patient rooms ever known to man."" Channeling all his frustration, Graves continued to sketch. ""Whether I was paralyzed or not, I would draw, because drawing for me is like playing the piano,"" he said.  ""You've got to keep practicing, got to keep doing it. It's not that you lose it, but you don't draw as well if you don't draw every day."" He started sketching better ways to design the hospital --  furniture, rooms, buildings. These sketches are becoming a reality as Graves' company has teamed up with a hospital furnishing company called Stryker. The products became available in 2009. Graves designed chairs with larger handles, so it's easier for a person to hoist themselves to stand.  A bedside cabinet has a rounded edge and two-way drawer to access items from both sides. Graves has employees of his company spend a week in wheelchairs to understand patients' needs. ""I'm impatient with getting it wrong, because if you spend the time and you use your intellect, you can get it. And there is no excuse for getting those patient rooms wrong time after time,"" he said. Graves' interest in architecture now extends to building better hospitals, facilities and home care environments. ""This is my life now,"" he said. ""I had to give up golf, give up walking. I had to give up a lot of things, give up driving. It isn't so bad. ""I take on health care. That's pretty good. I wouldn't have been a health care nut if it hadn't been for my paralysis, so something good came from this.""","Award-winning architect Michael Graves stayed at 8 hospitals .

"(CNN) -- In a written statement provided to police just after her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, was reported missing, Casey Anthony told authorities she had looked for the little girl every day for a month, and ""after 31 days, I know that the only thing that matters is getting my daughter back,"" according to testimony in her murder trial Wednesday. ""I have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever I could, by any means, to find my daughter,"" Anthony said in a written statement to the Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. ""I avoided calling the police or notifying my family out of fear. I have been, and still am, afraid of what has, or may happen to Caylee."" Caylee was last seen June 16, 2008, according to testimony. She was not reported missing until July 15, 2008. Casey Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty and denied harming her daughter or having anything to do with the little girl's disappearance or death. Defense attorney Jose Baez has said that once all the facts are known, it will become clear his client is innocent. Yuri Melich, who was the lead investigator assigned to the case from the sheriff's office, testified Wednesday that he reviewed the written statement and interviewed Anthony in the early morning hours of July 16. A recording of that interview was played for jurors Wednesday. Anthony told him that Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, Caylee's nanny for the past year and a half to two years, had kidnapped the child. She told Melich she had met Gonzalez through a friend, Jeffrey Hopkins, and that Gonzalez had also watched Hopkins' son. Asked who she had told about the kidnapping, Anthony said she had told no one besides Hopkins and a co-worker at Universal Studios, Juliette Lewis. Testimony in her trial has shown that Hopkins and Lewis apparently do not exist and that Anthony apparently did not return to her job at Universal Studios after giving birth to Caylee in 2005, although she led her family and friends to think she still worked there. Asked for phone numbers of Hopkins and Lewis, Anthony told Melich she didn't have them at present but could find them. Authorities were never able to find the nanny. They did find a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez, who claimed she had never met Caylee or Casey Anthony and later sued for defamation. Asked by Melich during the interview why she hadn't notified authorities for the 31 days Caylee had been missing, Anthony said, ""I think part of me was naive enough to think that I could handle this myself, which obviously I couldn't. And I was scared that something would happen to her if I did notify the authorities or got the media involved, or my parents, which I know would have done the same thing. Just the fear of the unknown. Fear of the potential of Caylee getting hurt, of not seeing my daughter again."" She denied injuring Caylee or leaving her anywhere, and raised her right hand at the end of the interview to swear she was telling the truth. ""Every day I have gone to malls, parks, any place I could remember Zenaida taking Caylee,"" she said in the written statement. ""I have gone out and tried to find out any information about Caylee, or Zenaida ... going to a popular bar, or restaurant."" Prosecutors allege Anthony was not looking for her daughter during the month she was missing. Instead, she was staying with her boyfriend, spending time in Orlando with numerous friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs, including participating in a ""hot body"" contest, according to testimony. Her former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor. Anthony told police she had received a call from her daughter July 15 but does not say in her statement what conversation the two had. Earlier Wednesday, her brother, Lee Anthony, testified she had told him about the phone call when she admitted Caylee was missing and that she said she had told Caylee to put an adult on the phone. Following the interview, Melich testified that Anthony directed him to several residences in Orlando where she said Gonzalez lived or had previously lived. He testified he learned later that one of the residences was across the street from where Anthony's former boyfriend, Ricardo Morales, lived, but she did not mention that at the time. On cross-examination, Baez tried to get Melich to say that he considered Anthony a suspect and her story untrue from the outset, but Melich denied that. After arguing the issue outside the presence of the jury, Baez agreed not to question Melich at this time on whether he was a blogger, ""Dick Tracy Orlando,"" who had written about the Anthony case after Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. appeared disinclined to allow it. Earlier Wednesday, the first police officer to arrive at the Anthony home on July 15 after Caylee was reported missing testified that Casey Anthony was initially reluctant to provide him with information regarding the little girl's whereabouts. Orange County, Florida, sheriff's Cpl. Rendon Fletcher told jurors that he asked Anthony about her daughter, but ""she really didn't say much. ... She wasn't very forthcoming with anything, any type of information, initially."" But, he said, eventually Anthony told him that ""her daughter had been missing for a period of time,"" about a month, and that the last time she had seen Caylee was in the custody of the nanny, Gonzalez. She agreed to show the deputies where Gonzalez's apartment was, rode with them to the Sawgrass Apartments and pointed out a second-floor apartment, Fletcher testified. When he approached the apartment, he said, he could see the blinds were open but saw no furniture inside, and ""it appeared to be vacant."" He knocked, he said, but got no answer. Amanda Macklin, community manager for the Sawgrass Apartments, testified Wednesday afternoon that the apartment in question, number 210, was vacant at the time Anthony led deputies there. She said she researched the last occupant of the apartment, but that person was not named Zenaida Gonzalez -- and, in fact, a Zenaida Gonzalez had never lived in any apartment at the complex. Caylee's skeletal remains were found in December 2008 in a wooded field not far from the home of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony. Prosecutors allege that Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and then suffocated her by putting duct tape over her nose and mouth. Anthony's defense has claimed that the little girl drowned in her grandparents' pool on June 16, the day she was last seen, and that Casey Anthony and her father panicked and kept the death a secret. George Anthony has denied that claim in testimony. Casey Anthony's defense attorney explains her behavior in June and July 2008 by saying she had been sexually abused as a child by her father -- and, to a lesser extent, her brother -- and was taught from a young age to hide her pain. George Anthony has also denied abusing his daughter in previous testimony. Neither side asked Casey Anthony's brother about sexual abuse allegations during his testimony on Wednesday. Cross-examining the officers who were at the Anthony home the night of July 15, 2008, Casey Anthony's defense attorneys managed to establish that George Anthony appeared calm, compared to his upset wife. Lee Anthony did testify Wednesday about a confrontation between his mother and sister on the night of July 15, just before Cindy Anthony called police. The two were arguing about Caylee's whereabouts, he said. At that point, according to Cindy Anthony's previous testimony, she had not seen her daughter or granddaughter for weeks. Casey Anthony kept insisting the little girl was with her nanny, Lee Anthony said, and could be picked up the next day. She maintained Caylee was already asleep by that point and she didn't want to disturb her or disrupt her routine. Lee Anthony told jurors he offered to go get Caylee or have his roommate do it. He said he was becoming frustrated with his sister, as ""nothing was making sense to me. Why couldn't we or anybody just go get Caylee and bring her home? There's no reason to fight with Mom at this point."" He said his sister told him that their mother had told her she was an unfit mother, adding, ""Maybe I am."" When he asked her why she wasn't allowing her family to see Caylee, however, Casey Anthony said something to the effect of, ""Because maybe I'm a spiteful bitch,"" he recalled. But Lee Anthony said as he questioned her, a crying Casey Anthony eventually told him the little girl was missing and that the nanny had kidnapped her, he testified. On Tuesday, a former friend of Casey Anthony's testified that Anthony was growing more frustrated with her parents around the time Caylee was last seen. Amy Huizenga said Anthony complained frequently about her parents, particularly her mother. ""I remember she told me her mom had told her she was an unfit mother. She was extremely upset about that,"" she said. Huizenga said Anthony had to cancel plans ""fairly frequently"" because she had no one to watch her daughter. It was happening more frequently during the spring of 2008, Huizenga said, and the ""frustration was greater."" Lee Anthony and Huizenga also referenced a bad odor regarding Casey Anthony's Pontiac Sunfire. The odor has been the subject of testimony by several witnesses. Prosecutors allege it could have stemmed from human decomposition. During cross-examination, Fletcher, the deputy, told Baez the garage door was open when he arrived and he walked through the garage, but did not notice a foul odor coming from the car. Other officers said they did notice the odor.","NEW: Detective denies he considered Casey Anthony a suspect from the outset .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Fighting flared in Yemen's volatile south Saturday, as security forces -- backed by armed tribesmen -- battled Islamic militants in the region, eyewitnesses said. Hundreds of tribesmen joined the fight in the town of Zinjibar, vowing to stand strong until Islamic militants leave Abyan province. ""We will not stop until the terrorists leave the province. We will fight and have nothing to lose,"" said Masood Mansoor, one of the fighters. ""This land is ours and we will not allow it to be a safe haven from outlaws."" Government troops have been battling both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A senior security official in Zinjibar said the clashes began Saturday night and were the fiercest yet in the weeks-long fight against the militants. The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said several militants were killed our wounded, but couldn't give exact numbers. ""The clashes are nonstop and the forces are surrounding the militants from all directions,"" the official said. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. Widespread tumult has engulfed Yemen for months, with thousands of demonstrators who oppose the rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh urging the president's departure. Saleh went to Saudi Arabia for treatment after injuries suffered in an attack on his compound. Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi said Saturday that all Yemenis should put their differences aside and focus on one enemy, referring to the suspected al Qaeda militants. ""Before we enter political dialogue with the opposition, all factions should first work in ensuring a safe and secure arena for dialogue. Only then would political dialogue be fruitful,"" said Ganadi. Ganadi said that the government will do all it can to fight terror in the country and called on the international community to support Yemen against the militants.","Battle against militants in southern Yemen rages .

"States that have legalized marijuana for managing chronic pain have significantly fewer deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses each year, according to a new study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers looked at medical marijuana laws and death certificate data in all 50 states between 1999 and 2010. During that time, just 13 states had medical marijuana laws in place. ""We found there was about a 25% lower rate of prescription painkiller overdose deaths on average after implementation of a medical marijuana law,"" lead study author Dr. Marcus Bachhuber said. In 2010 alone, he said, states with medical marijuana laws had approximately 1,700 fewer overdose deaths than would have been expected based on the numbers before such laws were passed. Bachhuber, a primary care doctor at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, has treated many chronic pain patients. ""It can be challenging for people to control chronic pain, so I think the more options we have the better,"" he said. ""But I think it's important, of course, to weigh the risks and benefits of medical marijuana."" Opioid analgesics are a class of drug that includes painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and methadone. According to the study, the number of patients in the United States with chronic pain who get prescriptions for one of these drugs has nearly doubled over the last 10 years, and overdose rates have risen dramatically. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tell the story of a problem they say is now an epidemic: Deaths from drug overdose have been rising steadily over the past two decades and have become the leading cause of injury death in the United States. In 2011, 55% of drug overdose deaths were related to prescription medications; 75% of those involved opioid analgesics. ""Prescription drug abuse and deaths due to overdose have emerged as national public health crises,"" said Colleen Barry, a senior author on the study and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""As our awareness of the addiction and overdose risks ... grows, individuals with chronic pain and their medical providers may be opting to treat pain entirely or in part with medical marijuana."" Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have medical marijuana laws on the books. They address a gamut of conditions -- from cancer, HIV, multiple sclerosis to glaucoma -- where cannabis provides relief. In most states, chronic or severe pain is the primary reason. According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, more than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, including 100 million Americans. The academy's website describes chronic pain this way: ""Chronic pain persists. Pain signals keep firing in the nervous system for weeks, months, even years. There may have been an initial mishap -- sprained back, serious infection, or there may be an ongoing cause of pain -- arthritis, cancer, ear infection, but some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage."" Dr. Lynn Webster, a past president of the academy, said he's not surprised by the study results or that marijuana might be a safer alternative to opioids for some people. ""AAPM believes that we need to do research on cannabinoids to determine its safety and efficacy,"" he said.  ""The problem with medical marijuana is that we never know using marijuana what chemicals are being ingested.  That makes it really unpredictable, but the use of cannabinoids may well have a place in the treatment of pain and other diseases. The AAPM believes that the DEA should reschedule cannabinoids from Schedule I to Schedule II so that it will make it easier for research to be conducted."" Kevin Sabet, director of the University of Florida's Drug Policy Institute, called the study flawed. He says although the study controlled for other possible explanations for the lower opiate death rate in medical marijuana states, it left out some of the most critical possible alternative explanations. ""The study failed to examine the influence of expanded methadone and buprenorphine programs in states, or the possible influence of major law enforcement interventions (e.g. pill mill shut downs and major operations by DEA in states like Florida), or even Naltrexone utilization,"" Sabet wrote in an e-mail to CNN.  ""The study also did not take into account prevention campaigns or strategies."" The researchers say the link between medical marijuana laws and overdose deaths is not completely clear, and admit there were some limitations to the study. For example, death certificates may not classify overdose deaths correctly and opioid analgesics reporting on these certificates may differ state-to-state. Bachhuber said more research is needed before any recommendations can be made. ""We can't know directly the underlying mechanism of our findings, but based on what we know, we think it could be due to safer treatment of chronic pain,"" Bachhuber said. ""We found that medical marijuana laws might provide unexpected benefits to public health. As more states pass these laws, it will be important to continue collecting information to see if what we found may be happening in other states as well.""

"(CNN) -- To control costs and increase flexibility, more and more U.S. mobile users are choosing no-contract plans (month-to-month or prepaid) for cell phone service. How happy are consumers with no-contract phones and service? J.D. Power and Associates recently released the results of its 2011 U.S. Wireless Non-Contract Customer Satisfaction Index Study. The no-contract carriers studied were: AT&T Gophone, Boost Mobile, Cricket, MetroPCS, Net10, T-Mobile, Tracfone, Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile. This year, the overall winner was Boost Mobile, which scored top marks for its cost of service, account management practices, initial activation process and offers/promotions. However, Boost scored only a middling grade on performance and reliability, the characteristic that survey participants rated as most important. Net10, Tracfone, and Verizon Wireless received consumers' highest ratings for performance and reliability; while AT&T Gophone, Cricket and MetroPCS fared worst on this front. AT&T Gophone received the overall worst customer satisfaction rating this year, with poor to middling marks in all categories. According to Valassis, a media and marketing services company, as of October of last year, 28% of all U.S. cell phone service plans did not have contracts (up from 21% in 2008). Meanwhile, J.D. Powers reports that this year, about half of of all no-contract customers have month-to-month plans, rather than prepaid ones. In 2008, only 30% of no-contract plans were monthly. The increase in attractive monthly no-contract offers might start stealing customers away from contracts. J.D. Powers notes: ""Among customers currently under [a regular carrier contract of a year or more] and who say they are likely to switch their carrier during the next year, nearly 40 percent are likely to choose non-contract service."" Monthly contracts are generally cheaper. According to J.D. Powers: ""Monthly non-contract customers spend an average of $32 less per month than do customers with contracts. Monthly non-contract customers spend $60 per month, compared with an average monthly service cost of $92 for customers with service contracts."" Some smartphones are now available on no-contract plans. Most no-contract carriers offer some smartphone deals -- usually for BlackBerry phones, but increasingly for Android and some Windows Phone models, too. These smartphones still cost substantially more to buy up front than the simpler, cheaper ""feature phones"" these carriers mostly offer, and they generally don't have the latest or most robust technology or operating system versions. Whether these offerings will entice many first-time smartphone buyers remains to be seen. For example, MetroPCS currently offers a no-contract Huawei Ascend touchscreen phone running Android 2.1 for $129 after a $50 instant discount and $30 mail-in rebate; the month-to-month plan cost is $50. Similarly, Virgin Mobile is currently offering the LG Optimus (running Android 2.2) and Samsung Intercept (running Android 2.1) for $199.99, with month-to-month plans starting at $25. Right now, the major U.S. wireless carriers are making considerable revenue off of smartphone customers under two-year contracts. And so far, it's pretty hard to get a higher-end smartphone without a two-year contract in the U.S. But lower-end smartphones might suffice for many mobile users. That's why offers such as these could alter the U.S. wireless competitive landscape over the next few years.

"(CNN) -- Only a fraction of the oil that normally courses through the Trans Alaska pipeline was flowing early Sunday after operators discovered a leak near Prudhoe Bay, a company spokeswoman said. Crews making a routine inspection ""found oil in the basement of a booster pump building"" around 9 a.m. Saturday, according to Aleyeska Pipeline Service Company spokeswoman Michelle Egan, who said flow has been reduced by 95%. On a typical day, 642,261 barrels of oil would pass through the pipeline. ""Crews are currently onsite to assess the situation and isolate the source of the leak,"" a company statement said. CNN's Tom Laabs contributed to this report.","Flow in the Trans Alaska pipeline is reduced to 5% of normal .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- It looked like two two-by-fours nailed together. But it had nails sticking out of it, and Gary Wright, standing in the parking lot of his Salt Lake City computer company, thought he should move it. When he picked it up, it exploded. It was February 20, 1987, when Wright, then 25, became a member of a dubious club: victims of the so-called ""Unabomber."" Wright's secretary helped police put together a composite sketch of the suspect -- a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator sunglasses -- that was distributed nationwide. But it was nine more years before the Unabomber's 18-year reign of terror came to an end. Ted Kaczynski, now 68, killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995. He was arrested in 1996, pleaded guilty in 1998 and is now serving a life term in the federal ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado. On Wednesday, a hooded sweatshirt very like the one pictured in the composite drawing, along with several pairs of sunglasses, were among some 60 items belonging to Kaczynski offered for online auction by the federal government, with proceeds to benefit some of Kaczynski's victims. ""His whole life is basically here,"" said Albert Najera, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of California. Items offered on the website, gsaauctions.gov, include Kaczynski's birth certificate; school records; his diplomas from Harvard University -- where he was accepted at 16 -- along with his diplomas for his master's and doctorate degrees from the University of Michigan; letters to and from him; and original handwritten and typewritten copies of Kaczynski's manifesto, which ultimately led to his capture. The manifesto is among about 20,000 pages of documents up for sale. The auction runs through June 2. In the first few hours after bidding began Wednesday, the top bid for a handwritten copy of the manifesto was up to more than $6,000. Wright retains almost crystalline recall of the bombing. ""The only thing I don't remember is flying through the air,"" he said. He suffered some 200 shrapnel wounds, including nails through his chin and lips. An ulnar nerve in his left arm was severed, leaving him permanently without feeling in some of his fingers. He recalled spending ""a lot of time getting put back together."" His insurance did not cover his medical costs, since they resulted from an act of terrorism. Although he received some discounted rates from doctors and hospitals and some help from Utah's crime victim reparations law, he estimates he has spent more than $100,000 on medical care and counseling. Wright is one of four victims seeking restitution; the others opted not to. The four were awarded $15 million. ""It was very, very difficult to have some of the conversations that needed to be had over this auction,"" he said Wednesday. But he plans to take the money and ""do something good with it ... if you're assigned restitution, pay it."" Not everyone agrees, however. Mark Olshaker, who co-authored a book on the Unabomber with an FBI profiler, said he thinks the auction is a ""misguided idea."" ""All it can do is help create this cult of notoriety around somebody like Ted Kaczynski, who really doesn't deserve it,"" he said. Olshaker compared the items to Nazi memorabilia, and said the auction ""can only help but glorify (Kaczynski) and takes the emphasis away from the victims, which is where it belongs."" Najera disagreed, saying the auction is a way to provide Kaczynski's victims with ""more justice"" in a world where victims rarely receive support from the justice system. ""The glory, if you will, is already there,"" he said. ""... That's part of our societal fabric. Everybody wants to watch the train crash."" ""I can see where people claim that it's going to revictimize and stuff, but I don't believe that,"" said Wright, now 50, who lives in Folsom, California. ""The thing that is funny to me, you're always going to have a piece of the population who has a very strong opinion and they've never been affected by it."" The auction is the culmination of a court battle. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved the auction plan in 2009, Steve Hirsch, a San Francisco attorney who represented the four victims in the court proceedings regarding the auctions, said last week. The nearly two-year delay is due to two factors, Hirsch said. First, ""the auction plan tries to protect the privacy of not only the named victims, but the other victims,"" and Kaczynski's writings had to be redacted to delete the victims' names and the details of their injuries, he said. In addition, Kaczynski was furnished with copies of the writings, and filed motions in both the 9th Circuit and a lower court about them with objections including that he didn't have time to ""quality check"" the copies, Hirsch said. ""We pretty much designed the auction around his objections,"" to prevent him from raising any potential First Amendment claims in court, he said. Kaczynski has been ""cycling through lawyers"" throughout the court fight, he said, sometimes firing his appointed attorneys and opting to represent himself. Overseeing the items Wednesday, retired FBI agent Terry Turchie said, ""It does bring back a lot of memories."" Turchie led the FBI task force that arrested Kaczynski. He vividly recalls approaching the 10-by-12 cabin, which lacked running water or indoor plumbing, with a search warrant. It took agents two weeks to remove all of Kaczynski's possessions -- a search interrupted when a live bomb, ready for mailing, was found under his bed. The cabin has since been rebuilt and is in the Newseum in Washington. Turchie remembered how the cabin smelled -- a mixture of dirt and smoke. ""He wasn't exactly the greatest housekeeper,"" he said of Kaczynski. And he recalled the emotional moment when he and other agents realized that after a search spanning nearly two decades, the hunt for the Unabomber might be over. ""We just literally walked in on the mind of a serial bomber,"" he said.  The FBI gave the suspect the moniker ""Unabomber"" because of his early targets -- universities and airlines. By all accounts brilliant, Kaczynski used creative techniques to avoid detection, Turchie said, even picking up hair samples from the floor of a bus station bathroom to place in his bombs, so DNA testing would lead authorities elsewhere. He began his bombing campaign, authorities said, because he was angered that the wilderness surrounding his cabin was being destroyed by development. But items offered in the auction also show another side of Kaczynski. ""Thank you for your letter offering condolences,"" says one letter to him, dated November 1990. ""I was very touched by it. It was easy to be nice to you as you were a delightful, lovable little boy."" Personal photographs are also for sale, along with other items of clothing, books with titles like ""Violence in America"" and ""Sense and Nonsense in Psychology"" -- and even a record of Kaczynski's attempt to seek help. ""I am writing you in regard to your request for services,"" says a May 1988 letter from a Montana mental health center. ""At this point in time we do not have any female therapists available."" If Kaczynski wanted a male therapist, the letter says, the next available appointment would be ""some time in July"" -- more than a month away. The 35,000-word manifesto itself led to a break in the investigation, according to the FBI. The essay claimed to explain the bomber's motives and railed against modern society. The task force recommended it be published, in hopes it would lead to the bomber's identity. After it appeared in The Washington Post and The New York Times, authorities were contacted by David Kaczynski, the FBI said, who provided letters and documents written by his brother. ""Our linguistic analysis determined that the author of those papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same,"" authorities said. The documents provided the basis for the search warrant for Kaczynski's cabin. The irony of using the very technology Kaczynski railed against to sell his possessions is not lost on authorities. ""My first thought was, 'Mr. Kaczynski's going to be livid,'"" Najera said. The only items not included in the auction are bomb-making materials and any diagrams of bombs, officials said. Wright said he doesn't agree with the sale of letters to and from relatives, believing they should be returned to Kaczynski's family. ""To me, that's crossing a line,"" he said. ""The family member was not involved in the crime at all."" One of Kaczynski's victims, medical geneticist Dr. Charles Epstein, died in February. Epstein was injured in 1993 when a bomb exploded in a piece of mail he opened at his home. The blast destroyed his eardrums and he lost parts of three fingers. Epstein told CNN in 2009 he regarded Kaczynski as ""the essence of evil."" Wright doesn't share that view. He struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, he said, and spent years wondering who could have done such a thing. Eventually, he said, he decided ""I've got to forgive this guy. He may never be caught. I'm dealing with a ghost."" ""There's no such thing as closure,"" he said. ""There's just a different way of living life.""

"(CNN) -- An ExxonMobil pipeline leaked an undetermined amount of crude oil into the Yellowstone River near Billings, Montana, prompting a burgeoning cleanup effort, officials said Saturday. ""It's significant. People are concerned,"" said Duane Winslow, director of disaster and emergency services in Yellowstone County. But he expressed confidence Saturday afternoon that ExxonMobil would clean the river. ""They seem to be committed to it,"" Winslow said. ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, a subsidiary that operates the line, established a claims phone number for those affected by the rupture. ""We deeply regret this incident has happened,"" said ExxonMobil spokesman Kevin Allexon. ""The magnitude of this response will reflect that."" The pipeline runs under the river. About 80 people from a regional response team were on site Saturday and 70 additional trained individuals were en route, Allexon said. Crews placed absorbent pads and booms into the flooded river. Winslow was hopeful the high stage of the flooded river would mean more of the oil and contaminants would be washed ashore. Heavy rains and a melting snowpack have caused the river to run high. The Yellowstone River was at 13.51 feet Saturday evening; flood stage is 13 feet. The oil was carried by a pipeline from fields at and near the Wyoming-Montana border to Billings. The cause was under investigation. Allexon said no information was available Saturday on the pipeline's age, depth under the river and its maintenance record. The spokesman said he could not speculate on whether river conditions had anything to do with the incident. The affected pipeline segment was shut down. ""Any spill is significant in our eyes,"" Allexon said. Between 200 and 300 residents near Laurel, where the spill was reported, were evacuated for a time late Friday and early Saturday, Winslow told CNN, because of the leak's odor. They were allowed to return home Saturday. Laurel is about 15 miles west of Billings. The leak was noticed around 11:30 p.m. Friday and the 12-inch pipeline was shut down within a half hour, Winslow said. It was not clear Saturday evening how far the leak had stretched along the Yellowstone; Winslow said it affected about 70 miles in the county. Allexon had no estimate on the total length. ""The parties responsible will restore the Yellowstone River,"" Gov. Brian Schweitzer said, adding state agencies were helping to monitor the containment and cleanup. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent a team to the site. ExxonMobil, which is leading the incident command, is getting assistance from Clean Harbors, a provider of environmental services. Laurel resident Jim Swanson, looking at oil near his home, told CNN Billings affiliate KULR, ""I am just kind of reeling right now.""","Crude oil spills into the Yellowstone River in Montana .

"Like millions of Americans this winter, my toddler has the flu. The good news is that, unlike most of our nation's restaurant workers, my baby doesn't have to go to work sick. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting widespread flu in 47 states. During the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the Obama administration told people to stay home when they were sick. That's why it's important we understand that, according to research conducted by my organization, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, almost 90% of restaurant workers say they do not have access to paid sick leave. Plus, given that the federal minimum wage for tipped workers has been stuck at just $2.13 an hour since 1991, two-thirds of our nation's cooks and servers and bussers report they cannot afford to stay home when they're sick, because they won't get paid and might even lose their jobs. A 2011 study by the CDC found that 12% of almost 500 food service workers surveyed had experienced vomiting and diarrhea on two or more shifts in the previous year.  What's more disgusting than that?  That restaurant owners essentially force employees to come to work sick because they don't have paid sick days. This month, 1.2 million people in England suffered from norovirus, also known as the ""winter vomiting bug.""  Norovirus is commonly contracted through contaminated food. In 2009, a bartender with swine flu worked for several days at a Washington hot spot because, he told me, he couldn't afford to not go to work. If we don't pay food industry workers decent wages and ensure they receive paid sick days, then no matter how much the FDA regulates the boiling temperature for processing cheese, restaurant workers will keep sneezing on our dinner and food-borne contamination and illness will continue to be a problem. The health of our nation's 10 million food service workers is intimately tied to the health of millions of Americans who routinely eat food prepared by someone else.  One in six  Americans gets sick from a food-borne illness every year, and when those instances can be traced to a single cause, in more than half of cases it's a restaurant.  Specifically, research shows that somewhere between 48% to 93% of all food-borne norovirus outbreaks may be tracked back to sick food service workers. The federal Healthy Families Act, expected to be re-introduced this year, would require all businesses with 15 or more employees to provide up to seven days of paid sick leave each year.  San Francisco, Seattle, the District of Columbia and the state of Connecticut have already approved such legislation locally. If we pay restaurant workers a living wage and ensure they can stay home when they're sick, that means fewer taxpayer dollars on public health emergencies and fewer stomach aches for diners as well. When we get the flu, we just want to stay in bed and have someone care for us.  We should allow restaurant workers the ability to do that, too. America would be a healthier place for it.","Saru Jayaraman: Restaurant workers, who rarely have paid sick leave, can spread flu .

"New York (CNN) -- Six picture frames hang inside a firehouse in Manhattan, each displaying a photograph of a man who died in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history. ""We always say never forget,"" said one firefighter from New York's Engine 23. The grizzled middle-aged man, who did not want to share his name, said President Barack Obama's visit to New York was an acknowledgement of ""what we're going through."" After nearly a decade of war prompted by the horrific events of September 11, 2001, the president traveled to Manhattan Thursday to meet with 9/11 survivors and lay a wreath at ground zero, four days after the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ""I wanted to just come up here to thank you,"" Obama said in prepared remarks, after eating lunch with firefighters and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. ""This is a symbolic site of the extraordinary sacrifice that was made on that terrible day almost 10 years ago."" The president visited with members of Fire Engine 54, Battalion Nine, which lost 15 men after hijackers flew two fully-fueled commercial airliners into the World Trade Center's twin towers. ""Obviously we can't bring back your friends that were lost,"" the president said. ""I know that each and every one of you not only grieve for them, but have also over the last 10 years dealt with their family."" The men of Engine 54 left behind 28 children. Meetings with firefighters were private exchanges, White House officials said, during which the president sought to mark a clear end to a near decade-long hunt for the Qaeda leader. ""It was a wonderful gesture, based on the news that we got of Osama bin Laden's death,"" New York Fire Chief Edward Kilduff told reporters. ""For him to come here to see the faces of those killed in 9/11,"" Kilduff said, referring to photographs that hung inside the firehouse of the men who died, ""I think it really meant something to him."" In a pre-dawn raid in Pakistan Monday, a U.S. Navy SEAL team fired two bullets that killed bin Laden, the al Qaeda leader behind the attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, which left nearly 3,000 people dead. ""When those guys took those extraordinary risks going into Pakistan ... they were doing it in the name of your brothers that were lost,"" the president told the firefighters. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday's visit to ground zero -- the former site of the World Trade Center -- was intended to ""help New Yorkers and Americans everywhere achieve a sense of closure."" It included a moment of silence and a wreath-laying ceremony at the foot of the Survivor Tree, badly damaged during the attacks and replanted after it was discovered beneath piles of smoldering rubble. The solemn ceremony evoked memories of previous presidents reaching out to the American public at emotional times -- Ronald Reagan after the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, and George W. Bush at the same spot in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. ""He is trying to bring the country together. He is trying to rally spirits and show that when we do come together, we can do anything,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, adding that Obama was ""doing this with a quiet dignity"" that ""fits well with him"" and ""fits well with the moment."" In addition to Giuliani, the president was accompanied by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Port Authority Chairman David Samson. Gergen noted that the presence of Giuliani helped ""bring it back full circle, because he became the face of 9/11 of a defiant America, of an America that was courageous in the face of adversity."" In a separate moment Thursday, Obama walked over and hugged Payton Wall, a 14-year-old girl who wrote the president a letter explaining how she was handling the loss of her father, Glen James, who was killed in the attacks. Behind the president's security detail -- a small army of secret service members clad in dark suits and sunglasses -- camera-wielding tourists and news crews snapped images of the motorcade as it rumbled through Manhattan, and later of Obama's meeting with the friends and family members of those killed during the attacks. Onlookers meanwhile posed for photographs with firefighters in what appeared to be a day of mixed emotions -- satisfaction at bin Laden's death, but renewed grief for what was lost on 9/11. Across the city, New Yorkers and visitors thought of where they were on that fateful Tuesday in September. Others more quietly remembered friends and family who died. ""My husband's here in spirit,"" said Monica Iken, whose husband, Michael Patrick, was a bond trader who worked in the World Trade Center. ""We'll never forget what happened here."" ""I'm proud today,"" she said. Former President George W. Bush, who was in office at the time of the 9/11 attacks, did not appear alongside his successor during Thursday's visit to New York. A spokesman for Bush said he turned down an invitation to attend, citing his desire to remain out of the public spotlight. The image of the former president beside firefighters at ground zero once became an emblem of America's resolve in the war on terror, a term the Obama administration has since tried to distance itself from. Meanwhile, Obama's visit to the hallowed site nearly 10 years later left many New Yorkers eager to witness the closing chapter of a man once considered the world's most wanted terrorist.","NEW: Obama follows tradition of other presidents with a personal appearance .

"Cherice Moralez wasn't the type to wait for the storm to pass. She preferred to dance in the downpour. ""When a big rain would come, she'd always get out and dance in the rain,"" the teen's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said. ""She taught me how to dance in the rain."" Hanlon was used to her daughter's eccentricities. This was a teen who once painted herself green ""for sport"" and ""set booby traps,"" sticking wads of gum on the bathroom door handle as a child, her mother said. ""If the world wasn't entertaining enough, she would entertain herself with the world. She used to do all sorts of crazy stuff for sport,"" her mother fondly recalled. It was when that playful nature waned that Hanlon suspected something was wrong. Cherice's teachers saw it, too, as her grades suffered and her gregarious personality dimmed. ""She just didn't laugh as much, you know? And she had the most beautiful laugh,"" Hanlon said. One of Cherice's peers at a church counseling group broke the news to Hanlon in 2008: Cherice, then 14, had been raped by Stacey Rambold, a business teacher at Billings Senior High School. He was 35 years older than Cherice. Hanlon set aside her disappointment that Cherice hadn't confided in her and called the police. As news of the sexual assault disseminated through their hometown of Billings, Montana, Cherice was ostracized and bullied. Her mood grew darker. As Rambold's case traversed the court system -- during which the teacher confessed to repeatedly raping the girl in his home, car and office in 2007 -- Hanlon came home one day to find Cherice in Hanlon's bed, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. It was February 6, 2010 --2½ weeks shy of Cherice's 17th birthday. This week, hundreds of protesters converged on a park adjacent to Yellowstone County Courthouse, armed with a petition thousands of signatures strong, demanding that the judge who handed Rambold a 30-day jail sentence after Cherice's suicide step down. He would recant and apologize later, but Judge G. Todd Baugh defended the sentence at the time by saying that Cherice looked older than her age and that the 14-year-old was as much in control of the situation as Rambold. Cherice was tough, determined and certainly strong-willed, her mother said. Her raw honesty often offended people, and she rarely shied away from telling someone how she felt. But how could she be in control? Especially being two years younger than Montana's age of consent? Her mother wonders. Hanlon has done numerous interviews in her quest to unseat Baugh from the bench he's held since 1984 and prompt a judicial review of the case. On Friday, she took a break from rehashing the rape, suicide and sentencing to look back on her daughter -- not the victim, but the older sister to John, Buck and Aulyicia who believed in unicorns and loved strawberry cheesecake, camping and making sandwiches. ""She could probably out-cook Subway -- vegetables on everything,"" her mother said. In many ways Cherice was a typical kid. Her mother called her ""Dada,"" a play on ""daughter,"" while everyone else called her Cherry, the name her aunt gave her the day she was born. She enjoyed walking the family's pit bulls, Demon and Kitty, one named for a character in ""Snow Dogs,"" the other named for fun. A 15-year-old Cherice banged up a car and the backyard fence trying to take the canines for a ride, Hanlon said. Mother and daughter were always introducing each other to new things. Cherice gave her mom the ""Cirque du Freak"" vampire series, and Hanlon reciprocated by acquainting Cherice with Stephen Donaldson's ""The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant."" Hanlon's fondness for the supernatural went only so far, though. Cherice would have to go elsewhere to watch her scary movies. ""I don't do horror flicks,"" Hanlon said. The two shared plenty of other interests, though -- namely music. Hanlon enjoyed listening to Puddle of Mudd, Will Smith and Cherice's favorite band, Nickelback, while her daughter grew to love Pink Floyd and Melissa Etheridge. ""We'd be down in the living room -- crank it up, open the windows, open the doors and she danced,"" Hanlon said, recalling how she and Cherice listened to their favorite tunes. ""She was a pretty good headbanger, and she had the hair for it."" Cherice also loved the outdoors. She'd climb ""the Rimrocks,"" the scenic sandstone bluffs overlooking Billings from where Hanlon, as a kid, would try to throw rocks at airplanes leaving the nearby airport. When the family went to Delmo Lake or Red Lodge -- two of Cherice's favorite camping spots -- she'd refuse to take shelter in the motor home. She and her close friend, Tiffany, would stay outside in Cherice's battered tent, which leaked. The pair got soaked several times, Hanlon said. In school, Cherice often excelled. Her teachers described her as gifted -- both academically and artistically -- and an energetic hard worker. She was insatiably curious, and if she didn't know the answer to something, ""she was the type who was going to look it up,"" her mother said. Yet despite her intelligence, her grades would occasionally flag, not because she couldn't grasp the subject matter but because it didn't interest her, her mother said. The arts, thankfully, always intrigued her, whether it manifested itself in dance or her abstract doodles. She also enjoyed poetry, and Hanlon described her daughter's style as ""darker,"" reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe. But that wasn't always the case. Hanlon recalls Cherice's last gift to her. Her daughter asked what she wanted for Christmas, and Hanlon replied that she'd like a poem. Cherice scribed an ode to her and her mother's relationship. Asked to describe the sonnet, Hanlon hesitated before finding the words. ""We scrap. But in the end, we love, no matter what -- that sort of thing.""","Mother looks back fondly on daughter's eccentricities after 2010 suicide .

"New York (CNN) -- Despite reports that seven state government workers held the winning $319 million ticket in the Mega Millions lottery, as of Sunday, no one had come forward to claim the prize, a New York Lottery spokeswoman said. The lottery drawing was held Friday night. Last-minute ticket sales increased the jackpot from $312 million to $319 million, the New York Lottery said.

"Mark O'Mara, the attorney who successfully defended George Zimmerman in his second-degree murder trial this year, will no longer represent his notorious client. ""I am not representing George Zimmerman in his recent domestic altercation case or his impending divorce case,"" O'Mara told CNN. Although Zimmerman's murder trial is over, his legal battles are far from over. On Monday, Zimmerman was briefly detained after a dispute involving his estranged wife, Shellie, and her father, David Bryant Dean. The two declined to press charges, and George Zimmerman was not charged or arrested in the dispute. Shellie Zimmerman filed for divorce last week. The run-in was just one in a number of incidents in a summer rife with ups and downs for the former neighborhood watchman. After his acquittal on July 13, George Zimmerman reportedly helped a family escape from an overturned SUV, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. Zimmerman has also been pulled over in traffic twice. The first time, he was given a verbal warning for a traffic violation in Texas. The second time was in Florida last week, when he was issued a $256 ticket for speeding. O'Mara, now a legal analyst for CNN, continues to be the attorney of record in the impending defamation lawsuit against NBC; Pennsylvania attorney Jim Beasley will be the lead attorney on the case.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Fukushima Daiichi disaster is focusing attention on a problem that has bedeviled Washington policymakers since the dawn of the nuclear age -- what to do with used nuclear fuel. Currently, spent fuel -- depleted to the extent it can no longer effectively sustain a chain reaction -- is stored in large pools of water, allowing the fuel to slowly cool and preventing the release of radiation. But events in Japan, where two of the six spent fuel pools at the Fukushima Daiichi facility were compromised, have raised questions about practices at the nation's 104 nuclear reactors, which rely on a combination of pools and dry casks to store used fuel. ""I truly believe we must re-think how we manage spent fuel,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said at a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday. In California, Feinstein said, fuel removed from reactors in 1984 is still held in spent-fuel pools, well beyond the minimum five to seven years required by federal regulators. ""It's hard to understand why the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not mandated a more rapid transfer of spent fuel to dry casks,"" Feinstein said. Currently, there is no maximum time fuel can remain in spent fuel pools, the NRC said Wednesday. As a result, critics say, nuclear plants have made fuel pools the de facto method of storing fuel, crowding pools with dangerous levels of fuel, industry critics say. As of January 2010, an estimated 63,000 metric tons of spent fuel was in storage at U.S. power plants or storage facilities, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""For the history of our nuclear power program, I would say, the storage of spent fuel... has been an afterthought,"" Ernest Moniz, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, testified. ""I believe we should really start thinking hard about consolidated storage, presumably in federal reservations, to solve a host of problems."" The NRC and industry critics differed on whether spent fuel pools are safe. ""Spent fuel pools are considered 'safety significant' systems, so they meet a lot of the same standards that the reactor itself would have to meet,"" said Greg Jaczko, chairman of the NRC. ""For example, the spent fuel pools themselves are required to withstand the natural phenomena like earthquakes and tsunamis that could impact the reactor itself."" David Lochbaum, a nuclear physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, disagreed. ""At many sites there is nearly 10 times as much irradiated fuel in spent fuel pools as in the reactor core,"" he said. ""The spent fuel pools are not housed in robust concrete containment structures designed to protect the public from the radioactivity they contain. Instead the pools are often housed in buildings with sheet metal siding like that in a Sears storage shed,"" Lochbaum said. ""I have nothing against the quality of Sears storage sheds but they are not suitable to nuclear waste storage,"" he said. A nuclear industry representative said the ""lack of a national strategy"" on waste storage is exacerbating the problem, since it does not know whether to place spent fuel in permanent, on-site containers, or containers suitable for transport. ""We want to limit the number of times we have to handle used fuel. We want to be able to take it out of the pool once, put it in a cask... Not all casks are designed for transportation for example,"" said William Levis, a power company president speaking for the Nuclear Energy Institute. Jaczko said spent fuel pools don't endanger the public. ""We don't have a maximum time (fuel can stay in the pools),"" he said. ""But we do analyze the fuel. (Fuel) goes through a very rigorous analysis to ensure that (it can be added to the pool) safely and securely."" A high-ranking energy department official, meanwhile, said a commission studying the issue of spent fuel will issue an interim report by July 29. The commission was formed after the Obama administration killed a plan to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.","Events in Japan have raised questions about spent-fuel storage in the United States .
The U.S. has 104 nuclear reactors, which rely on pools of water and dry casks for storage .

"The Navy was unaware until after the killings at the Washington Navy Yard that gunman Aaron Alexis had been arrested in 2004 for shooting out the tires on a vehicle and claiming he had blacked out in anger, a senior Navy official told reporters Monday. However, the government agency that carried out Alexis' background check in 2007 did know that he omitted information about that brush with the law but granted him security clearance anyway after Alexis explained it. The Navy said it didn't learn the details of the incident until after Alexis killed 12 people last week at the sizable naval installation in Washington. In 2007, contractor USIS conducted the security clearance assessment for Alexis, who had just joined the Navy. Flags in shooter's past apparently not red enough . A report for the Navy from the Office of Personnel Management, which processes and grants security clearances, didn't mention a gun, the Navy official said. It said only that Alexis had ""deflated the tires on a construction worker's vehicle"" in the 2004 incident, which occurred in Seattle. According to the Office of Personnel Management, the agency uncovered Alexis' arrest for malicious mischief through a check of FBI criminal history records. The Seattle Police Department would not make records available, and the agency tried to corroborate the arrest through court records. The Navy said Alexis answered ""No"" to questions on his security clearance form about whether he had ever been arrested or charged with a felony. Alexis told the security clearance personnel he did not disclose the malicious mischief charge because he was told it was going to be dismissed and removed from his record. The search of the court records corroborated Alexis' version, the Office of Personnel Management said, but these records did not mention that a weapon was used. During a follow-up interview, Alexis did not mention having shot the tires out. ""Had the Seattle Police Department permitted OPM to obtain the law enforcement records, it is possible that additional information may have been obtained,"" the agency said in a statement. Alexis, 34, was a subcontractor last week when he entered the Navy Yard and the shooting rampage began. In addition to the 12 deaths, Alexis wounded eight people before he was killed. A woman who was wounded in the shooting was released from a hospital Monday. Only one person remains hospitalized -- a police officer who is listed in good condition. USIS is the same contractor that processed NSA leaker Edward Snowden's clearance and is now under investigation.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai and Cambodian troops exchanged gunfire near a disputed temple Saturday despite a cease-fire agreement between the two nations. The brief rounds of fighting near the Ta Kwai temple involved small arms weapons, said Col. Prawit Hukaew, a regional Thai army spokesman. It started late Friday into early Saturday. Fighting may be a result of Cambodian soldiers not being aware of the cease-fire set Thursday, the spokesman said. It should cease once Cambodian soldiers in the conflict area learn about the truce, he said. Cambodia's government spokesman could not be reached for comment. Fighting along the turbulent border has raged since April 22 as the two sides accuse each other of trying to seize ancient temples. Thailand calls the temples Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. At least six Thai soldiers and one civilian have been killed in the clashes, authorities said. Cambodia has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting.","Thai and Cambodian troops exchange gunfire .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian authorities said Wednesday that a man with ties to al Qaeda plotted last week's car bombing at the United Nations' headquarters in the Nigerian capital that killed 23 people. The Nigerian State Security Service said Mamman Nur recently returned from Somalia and was ""working in concert"" with two other suspects who have been arrested. The militant Somali group Al-Shabaab has been linked to al Qaeda. The secret service described Nur as a ""notorious Boko Haram element."" Boko Haram, a militant Islamic group, aims to enforce a strict version of Islamic law in Nigeria. The militant group had claimed responsibility for the attack in which a Honda packed with explosives rammed into the U.N. building, shattering windows and setting the place afire. Abuja has suffered a spate of deadly bombings in recent months. In June, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. A month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. The attacks on the church and police station may have been the work of Boko Haram, officials said. Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north. ""Boko Haram"" translates loosely as ""Western education is forbidden/sinful."" The group holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a Sharia state in northern Nigeria.","Mamman Nur recently returned from Somalia, the Nigerian secret service says .

"(CNN) -- Most Pakistanis told pollsters they disapproved of the U.S. military operation that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the direction their country was headed, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. In all, nearly two-thirds (63%) expressed disapproval of the raid, while only 10% said they approved of it. In addition, about half of Pakistanis (51%) said they think the May 2 raid on bin Laden's home in Abbottabad will adversely affect their country's relations with the United States. Just 4% said they think relations will improve. Nevertheless, most Pakistanis said they would like to see a strong relationship between the countries. But a survey taken just after the raid found no material change in Pakistanis' views of the United States when compared with results from a survey taken before the raid. Only 12% of respondents said they had a positive view of the United States and 8% said they were confident that U.S. President Barack Obama would do the right thing in world affairs. Obama's approval numbers are no better than those of then-President George W. Bush in 2008. In a poll taken after bin Laden's death, more than two-thirds (69%) said they think of the United States as more of an enemy. But that figure is not significantly higher than the 68% who said the same thing in a poll before his death. China's government stirred warmer feelings, with just 1% of Pakistanis identifying it as an enemy. Those surveyed said they were confused about the role of the Pakistani government in the U.S. military operation in Abbottabad, which is located about 35 miles outside the capital city of Islamabad. Asked whether they believe the Pakistani government authorized the raid, 29% said it did, 23% said it did not and nearly half said they did not know. U.S. officials have said they did not consult with their Pakistani counterparts prior to the raid. Fewer than one in five Pakistanis (18%) said they think the government did know that bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad, 29% said they did not think so and more than half (53%) had no opinion. Meanwhile, Pakistani support for the government's anti-terrorism efforts has diminished over the past few years. Slightly more than a third (37%) said they support using the Pakistani army to fight extremists in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the Kyber Pakhtyunkhwa region, which used to be called the North-West Frontier Province. Two years ago, more than half (53%) said they backed using the army to battle Taliban-affiliated groups in the Swat Valley area. At the same time, fear of extremists taking over Pakistan has dropped from 69% two years ago to 55% today, according to the poll. Yet extremist groups are still unpopular, with just 12% of Pakistanis expressing a positive view of al Qaeda, down from 18% last year. And 12% rated the Taliban favorably. Approval of Lashkar-e-Taiba was higher, with 27% expressing support for the Kashmir-based group that has carried out attacks in neighboring India. The figures came from two in-person interview surveys carried out by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project. The first was carried out April 10-26 and included 1,970 Pakistanis who were part of a 23-nation poll. The second was conducted May 8-15 -- after bin Laden was killed -- solely in Pakistan among 1,251 Pakistanis. The pollsters said there were few differences between the first and second surveys, implying that bin Laden's killing had little impact on public opinion in Pakistan about the United States or other issues covered by the survey. Pakistanis showed little support for a number of U.S. foreign policy features, with just 20% saying they think the United States considers interests of countries like Pakistan in setting foreign policy and 69% saying they want U.S. and NATO troops out of Afghanistan. Nearly two-thirds (62%) said they oppose U.S.-led efforts to fight terrorism. But Pakistanis expressed deep unhappiness with their own country's leadership, with 92% saying they are dissatisfied with the country's direction and 85% saying the country's economic situation is bad. The long-term outlook is not much better -- 60% predicted the country's economy will get worse in the coming 12 months vs. 13% who predicted it will improve. The popularity of President Asif Ali Zardari has plummeted, from 20% last year to 11% during this survey. His prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, attracted a positive rating from 37% of those surveyed, down from 59% last year. Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League drew a positive rating from 63%, down from 71% last year. And former cricket star Imran Khan attracted the most favorable rating for a politician with 68% approval of those surveyed, up from 52% last year. Despite the criticism endured by the military over its absentee status during the U.S. raid on bin Laden's compound, 79% of Pakistanis described the military as a positive influence on the country. Perhaps that's because only about a third (37%) of Pakistanis said they followed closely reports about the raid that killed bin Laden. The prospect of violence against civilians appears to carry little cachet among Pakistanis, with 85% saying suicide bombing and other violent acts against civilians in defense of Islam are never justified vs. 38% who said the same thing in 2002. And terrorism was deemed to be either a very big problem or a moderately big problem by 97% of those questioned. But support for U.S. drone attacks remains minuscule, with 97% of those who had heard of them saying they are bad and 65% saying they are very bad. But just 27% said they had heard a lot about the attacks, up from 14% last year. More than half (61%) said they are unnecessary and 89% said they think they kill too many innocent people. The sampling error was plus-or-minus 3 points in the April survey and plus-or-minus 4 points in the May survey.","Nearly two-thirds (63%) expressed disapproval of the raid .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's decision to undertake military action in Libya to enforce a no-fly zone was the product of an administration debate with unlikely bedfellows. Initially, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was skeptical of the U.S. joining a military coalition. But senior U.S. officials said advances last weekend made by forces loyal to Gadhafi in retaking rebel strongholds in the east, which opened up the possibility of thousands more being killed, convinced her action was necessary. Additionally, a statement by the Arab League calling for the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone, Clinton told reporters Saturday, ""changed the diplomatic landscape."" As Britain and France pushed for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone, officials said Clinton teamed up with Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in creating the conditions for a resolution with the broadest possible authority and the largest international support. Clinton made the case that U.S. support for a no-fly zone was conditioned on Arab participation and leadership. In Paris, Clinton met with her counterparts in town for a meeting of the Group of 8 foreign ministers and with Abdullah bin Zayed, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates. Even as she criticized the UAE for its recent decision to send forces to quell a rebellion in Bahrain, Clinton pressed him to send planes to Libya. As Clinton traveled to Cairo and Tunisia seeking Arab buy-in for the resolution, officials said Rice built support in New York for the resolution. Samantha Power, an adviser to Obama on the National Security Council and a human rights activist, was also urging the president to intervene. Clinton's alliance with Rice and Power in pushing for intervention put her at odds with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who had publicly argued against a no-fly zone. Sources said Vice President Joe Biden was also more cautious, arguing for the smallest possible U.S. involvement in any military action. A senior administration official said that ""like the president, the vice president wanted any action taken with a broad international coalition."" The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning, said when the vice president ""saw that was achievable, he supported the policy to seek the military intervention."" After meeting with Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League, in Cairo Tuesday night, officials said Clinton called Obama, telling him the Arabs were willing to take part in the no-fly zone. That participation, officials said, was critical for the administration, which was concerned about the perception of invading a third Arab country. ""In order for us to go along, it was important for the Arabs to have some skin in the game,"" one senior official said. CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report.","Defense secretary, vice president opposed U.S. action .

"(CNN) -- A major Atlantic storm packing hurricane-force winds pummeled England, France, Belgium and the Netherlands early Monday, knocking out power to 220,000 homes in England and blocking roads and railways with fallen trees. At least nine people were killed. Wind gusts as strong as 99 mph battered the south coast of England, and authorities warned of travel disruptions across the region. At least two storm-releated deaths were confirmed in England, and a third person was reported missing. Police in Kent said a 17-year-old girl was killed Monday morning when a tree fell on the home where she was sleeping in Hever, south of London. A man in his 50s was killed when a tree fell on a vehicle Monday in Watford, northwest of London, according to Hertfordshire police. In Germany, five people were killed, four of them by fallen trees. A woman in the city of Heiligenhafen was killed when a wall supporting a terrace fell on her. A tourist was killed by a falling tree in Amsterdam, police said. And in France, the body of a woman was found on a beach near Belle-Ile. Witnesses said the woman was swept away by a wave. As the storm approached, rescuers had to suspend their search for a missing teenager believed to have been swept out to sea. The unidentified teenager disappeared from Newhaven, East Sussex, on the southern coast, according to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Authorities were checking whether two other deaths were related to the storm. A man and a woman died -- and a third person was hospitalized -- as a result of a gas explosion at a house in Hounslow in West London, London's Metropolitan Police said. Investigators were checking whether a tree that had fallen in the area damaged gas pipes and caused the blast. The storm also affected France, Belgium and the Netherlands. A woman was killed by a falling tree in Amsterdam, local media reported. Officials said 42,000 homes in northern France were without electricity. Overnight, the number of homes in France without power peaked at 75,000. The strongest wind gusts in England -- 99 mph -- were recorded on the Isle of Wight, which is off the southern coast, the Met Office said. The storm cut power to people across the southern part of England. The Energy Networks Association, which represents British and Irish power operators, said that 220,000 homes were without power in the southeast, southwest and midlands of England. Energy companies said they were working to restore power as quickly as possible. Authorities warned that the heavy rain from the storm could cause flooding in some areas. Eighteen flood warnings were in place in southwest England, the government said. In the southeast, Sussex Police said they had had reports of more than 125 trees down across the county. They warned drivers to be careful, especially on smaller roads. Network Rail, which manages Britain's rail infrastructure, said more than 100 trees were on rails in the network across the southeast. Heathrow Airport said it was reducing the number of flights Monday because of the severe weather. Weather forecasters had said before the storm arrived that it could be the region's worst in a decade. But they said they didn't expect the conditions to be as severe as those during the ""Great Storm"" of 1987, which was responsible for the deaths of 18 people in Britain and four in France. In 1990, the ""Burns Day Storm"" left a trail of destruction from the Isles of Scilly to Denmark, killing 100 people, including 47 in the British Isles, according to the Met Office. CNN's Joseph Netto, Dana Ford and Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Nine deaths reported across Western Europe .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A power company apologized Saturday and said the exposure of three workers at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant to highly radioactive water might have been avoided with better communication. The Thursday incident has spurred questions about the source of the radioactive contamination in water, its potential to taint seawater nearby and the prospect it might be evidence of a leak in at least one of the facility's six reactor cores. It also prompted further criticism of the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which runs the plant, and how well it is safeguarding the nearly 500 people working to prevent more emission of potentially cancerous radioactive materials about two weeks after a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami rocked the facility. On March 24, three workers laying electrical cable in the turbine building of the No. 3 reactor stepped in tainted water, exposing themselves to high levels of radiation. Two suffered direct exposure on their skin. Hideyuki Koyama, the company's associate director, said pooled water had been discovered in the basement of the No. 1 reactor six days earlier, but a sample wasn't taken for analysis until the 24th, after the workers were exposed. The company started draining the water from the No. 1 reactor that evening and has continued draining it ever since, he said. Plans are also in the works to drain water from the No. 2 and No. 3 reactors. Such incidents threatened to undermine the public's trust in Tokyo Electric, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. He added the Japanese government ""would like to give stronger instructions"" to the company that it fully disclose as much information as possible about conditions at the plant. ""Every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly"" to Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency, Edano said. ""Without this communication, it's very difficult for the government to (establish) proper safety measures."" As important, the chief secretary said, was the need for Tokyo Electric to be upfront with the Japanese -- millions of whom get power from the company and millions more of whom have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis. ""We need to be sure that (Tokyo Electric) isn't going to act in a way that will create distrust,"" Edano said. Koyama told reporters that radiation alarms went off while the three men were working, but they continued with their mission for 40 to 50 minutes after assuming it was a false alarm. Later, they were hospitalized after it was determined they had been exposed to 173 to 181 millisieverts of radiation -- two of them with direct exposure on their skin. By comparison, a person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year, though Japan's health ministry has said that those working directly to avert the nuclear crisis could be exposed to as much as 250 millisieverts before they must leave the site. Hours before the apology, a Tokyo Electric official told reporters that water samples from the turbine buildings for the No. 1 and 2 reactors had high levels of radiation, though not as high as in the basement of the No. 3 building. Later Saturday, Tokyo Electric amended its assessment of the level of radiation in water in the No. 1 building, saying it was not nearly as dangerous as first reported. The water radiation levels were 60 millisieverts per hour -- compared to 200, as had been stated earlier -- while atmospheric radiation was 25 millisieverts per hour. The issue of possible leakage of such material gained urgency Saturday after Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency reported the amount of radioactive iodine in seawater recorded 330 meters (361 yards) from the plant was 1,250 times above normal. A Tokyo Electric official speculated water runoff or leakage from the turbine buildings may have caused the sudden increase, though he said other factors might have contributed as well. Friday, Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the contaminated water suggests ""some sort of leakage"" from the No. 3 reactor's core -- signaling a possible breach of the containment vessel that houses the core. These developments come despite indications from the International Atomic Energy Agency that the level of airborne radiation around the plant, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, ""continues to decrease."" Tokyo Electric reported on its website that at 7 a.m. Saturday, radiation at the plant's main gate was 0.219 millisieverts per hour -- a fraction of the 400 millisieverts per hour measured between Units 3 and 4 on March 15. The measurements are a significant drop from readings taken at the same gate over the past week. The presence of highly radioactive water in buildings at reactors Nos. 1, 2 and 3 has halted some efforts to curb the release of further emissions. Still, others continued and there have been recent signs of progress. ""We can comfortably say that we are taking measures so that the situation has not deteriorated,"" Edano said. ""We've been able to take some steps forward. But still, vigilance is required."" Fresh water was being pumped Saturday at reactors 1, 2 and 3. That replaced the seawater that had previously been used, with the aim of fresh water being simultaneously to cool down nuclear fuel and also flush out accumulating salt that might hinder the reactors' existing cooling systems. The No. 3 reactor has been of particular concern, experts have said, because it is the only one to use a combination of uranium and plutonium fuel, called MOX, considered more dangerous than the pure uranium fuel used in other reactors. The Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry trade group that is tracking official accounts of the effort at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, said the pressure of the No. 3 reactor's containment vessel has been upgraded to ""stable."" Whereas the group had stated Friday that damage was suspected in the reactor, on Saturday its assessment changed to ""unknown"" -- a further acknowledgment of uncertainty as to whether the contaminated water was the result of a leak in the nuclear reactor core or had some other cause. Efforts also continue at the No. 4, 5 and 6 reactors -- each of which has less pronounced concerns because the units were on scheduled outages when the quake struck. None of these three units had nuclear fuel inside their reactors, though efforts are ongoing to control temperatures inside the spent fuel pools.

"(CNN) -- At least 121 people were killed and 45 injured in an explosion at an ammunition factory in southern Yemen on Monday, medical sources said. The death toll was expected to rise, said the sources, who asked that they not be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the news media. Two of them work at Republican Hospital in Abyan. Most of the dead and injured were locals who had been ransacking the factory after it was taken over Sunday by militants, security officials said. The explosion took place in Abyan Province, they said. It comes after months of demonstrations against Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and a weekend of violence between government forces and the local al Qaeda group. Fighting over the past two days between Yemeni security forces and members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula left people on both sides dead, Yemeni security forces said Sunday. Saleh has been fighting to hold onto power, arguing that he is best equipped to lead the fight against Islamists. Three ""al Qaeda terrorists were killed"" and six others were arrested in Lawdar district, Yemen's official news agency Saba reported Saturday. Also Sunday, seven Yemeni soldiers were killed and seven others were wounded when members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula attacked them in Marib, two security officials said. The attack took place at a military checkpoint a mile north of the government complex in Marib Province, east of the capital, Sanaa. The attackers used grenades and machine guns, and took two military vehicles from the checkpoint, the security forces said. After the fighting Saturday, the Yemeni government said it was a sign that strong measures are needed to combat instability within the country. Saba reported that Governor Saleh al-Zawari of Abyan Province affirmed ""the importance to enhance security performance to strictly confront any attempts to disturb security and stability in the governorate."" Yemen has been facing protests from people citing government corruption, a lack of political freedom and high unemployment. Calls for Saleh's ouster have increased in recent weeks following revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Saleh has ruled since 1978. Saleh said Sunday he will not offer any more concessions, and he described the opposition as an alliance against the country's majority, according to Saba. ""I derive my strength from the people, not from the tank,"" Saleh was quoted as telling a session of the General People's Congress Standing Committee. Opposition leaders rejected the president's comments. ""Saleh has not learned a lesson from the millions who are demanding he step down,"" said Yaseen Noman, president of the JMP, the country's largest opposition bloc. ""All the different initiatives and negotiations that take place are only there for Saleh to buy himself more time,"" he said. ""Saleh's lies show the world that he must leave power -- and people understand this,"" Noman added. ""Our demands are simple: He must leave office. This is not open for negotiation."" The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. Saleh has been a staunch U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked last week about how the United States sees cooperation with Yemen if Saleh were to step down. ""We have had a good working relationship with President Saleh,"" Gates told reporters during a trip to Cairo. ""He's been an important ally in the counterterrorism arena. But clearly, there's a lot of unhappiness inside Yemen. And I think we will basically just continue to watch the situation. We haven't done any post-Saleh planning, if you will."" Saleh has said he accepts opposition demands for constitutional reforms and holding parliamentary elections by the end of the year. Saleh has also promised not to run for president in the next round of elections. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 121 die and 45 are injured when an ammunition factory explodes, medical sources say .

"Her YouTube video started out innocently enough. The Canadian teen, her face obscured from the camera, held a stack of cards each filled with messages in black marker. ""I've decided to tell you about my never ending story,"" the card in Amanda Todd's hands read. At this point the viewer may have no idea that they are about to be led on the most agonizing journey, one that pushed the premier of British Columbia to issue a stern warning against bullying, a journey that has birthed a Facebook page with thousands of people commenting and many offering condolences. In the soundless, black and white video, the teen showed one card after another. Each card painfully sinking the viewer deeper into the anguish too many teens have experienced.

On Christmas break, the police came to her home to tell her that photos of her were sent to ""everyone."" She pushed the next card very close to the camera.

And then the same man appeared again with a Facebook page that displayed her topless as his profile picture. ""Cried every night, lost all my friends and respect people had for me ... again ..."" She was teased and felt as if she could never erase that photo. She started cutting, a form of self-injuring act that psychologists say is an impulse-control behavior that sometimes accompanies a variety of mental illnesses. At school, she ate lunch alone until she moved to another new school. ""Everything was better even though I sat still alone,"" the next card read. ""After a month later I started talking to an old guy friend."" LZ Granderson: Being bullied is hell, but life gets better . She thought the guy liked her even though she knew he had a girlfriend. One day he asked her to come over because his girlfriend was on vacation. ""So I did ... huge mistake ...

A week later the guy's girlfriend showed up at her school with a posse of 15 others. A crowd gathered. The girlfriend berated her screaming that nobody liked her. ""A guy than (sic) yelled just punch her already ..."" She was punched. Thrown on the ground. ""I felt like a joke in this world I thought nobody deserves this,"" the next card reads. ""Teachers ran over but I just went and layed in a ditch and my dad found me."" When she got home she drank bleach. ""It killed me inside and I thought I actually was going to die."" In a wired world, children unable to escape cyberbullying . She was rushed to a hospital to flush the chemical out of her. She put the next card almost flush with camera so that the viewer can no longer see her and only sees ""After I got home all I saw on Facebook- She deserved it and did you wash the mud out of your hair?

""6 months has gone by ... people are pasting pics of bleach, clorex (sic) and ditches ... Everyday I think why am I still here,"" Her struggles with anxiety and cutting had gotten worse and even despite counseling and antidepressants she still was rushed to hospital again after an overdose. The last cards say simply: ""I have nobody. I need someone. My name is Amanda Todd."" The video has garnered the attention of many including the premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark. ""No one deserves to be bullied. No one earns it. No one asks for it. It is not a rite of passage. Bullying has to stop. Every child has to feel safe at school,"" Clark said in a You Tube video posted Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Riot police clashed Friday in suburbs across Bahrain's capital of Manama with thousands of demonstrators enraged at the government's denial of responsibility in the death of a 14-year-old boy, a human rights advocate in the Arab nation said. Nabeel Rajab, president of Bahrain's Center for Human Rights, told CNN that people took to the streets Thursday night and remained into early Friday. There, they voiced anger to several government messages, including a press release that was issued earlier Thursday from Bahrain's interior ministry that -- citing a coroner's report -- denied the boy was killed by a tear-gas canister or rubber bullet, as activists have claimed. Riot police tossed tear gas canisters and shot rubber bullets in hopes of breaking up the protest, according to Rajab, who said he witnessed the clashes in one Manama suburb and also spoke to multiple eyewitnesses. Journalist Mazen Mahdi added that he witnessed a similar crackdown in Sanabis, another suburb of the capital, and saw security forces sealing off the area. In response, protesters set up make-shift barricades and threw stones at riot police in an attempt them to stop from going further into residential parts of the suburbs. ""Security forces raided homes and fired shots into Shiite suburbs as a form of collective punishment,"" said Rajab. ""It is a common tactic they use to stop youth from demonstrating against the regime."" The clashes resulted in several injuries and dozens or arrests, according to Rajab, adding that the Center for Human Rights had not been able to ascertain exact numbers in either case. There was no immediate response from the Bahraini government to the claims, nor was there a mention of such clashes in the state-run Bahrain News Agency. Yet such confrontations between demonstrators and authorities are not new in Bahrain, one of several countries embroiled in anti-government protests across the Middle East and North Africa this year. Bahrain is a close ally of the United States and houses the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet. Its rulers blame Shiite-ruled Iran for stirring up trouble among its Shiite majority, but opposition leaders and Iranian officials deny the allegation and many Western powers have dismissed it. The dispute over the circumstances surrounding the 14-year-old boy's death is the latest to stir distrust among activists towards the government. Clashes broke out overnight Wednesday into Thursday between Shiite Muslim protesters and police, after witnesses said they saw the boy -- Ali Jawad al-Sheikh -- collapse after riot police fired a tear-gas round at him and other protesters who were in Sitra, southwest of Manama. The interior ministry has said no clashes were taking place at the time the boy was injured, claiming that the last reported incident of unrest in the area was around 1:15 a.m. on Wednesday. And a police chief said Thursday that the hospital officials who informed the police they had received the boy's body did not give any details about the incident or where the body was found, the state news agency reported. Bahraini officials said Thursday that the doctor who carried out an autopsy on the body concluded that the cause of death was an injury sustained behind the neck, where there were fractures causing bleeding around the spinal cord. Blood tests by the forensic laboratory did not show any sign of tear-gas exposure, BNA cited public prosecution chief Osama Al Asfoor as saying. Unconvinced, thousands of people took to the streets earlier Thursday at the boy's funeral, according to witnesses. Rajab, who was at the funeral, said the procession remained calm, with no outbreaks of violence. He told CNN crowds of people gathered early that morning and police had pulled out from the entire area, using helicopters instead to monitor the situation. Meanwhile, government officials say they are investigating the death and the interior ministry has offered a 10,000 Bahraini dinar ($26,400) reward for information leading to the arrest of his killer, state news agency BNA reported Thursday. The press release Thursday from the interior ministry concluded the youth died ""as a result of a serious blow to the back of the neck ... that culminated in a blood clot in the brain, which eventually took his life."" The release urged ""calm in response to the tragic death of a 14-year-old boy"" and asked for the three unknown men who brought the boy's body to a hospital ""to make themselves known so that they can explain how they found Ali and offer an explanation of the events of the morning that (led) to his death."" Speaking ahead of the boy's burial, Bahraini pro-democracy activist Zainab Alkhawaja, in Sitra, told CNN there was a feeling of anger in the streets, with people chanting slogans calling for the fall of the regime and its leader, King Hamad. ""People are more upset and angry than I've seen at (a) funeral here before -- I think because he was so young,"" she said. Protests have lingered for months despite a crackdown by Bahrain's Sunni monarchy, backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. More than 30 people have been killed the crackdown, in which activists say Bahraini security forces have used live ammunition. Opposition groups say more than 1,000 people -- mainly Shiites -- have been detained and more than 2,000 have lost their jobs for allegedly taking part in the protests. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Thousands in Bahrain rip the government for denying a role in boy's death, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- Many women in Saudi Arabia remain defiant after they put keys to ignitions Friday to drive home a point: challenging the conservative Islamic kingdom's prohibition of female drivers. Among the dozens of women in the country who challenged the status was well-known female Saudi blogger Eman Al Nafjan. ""This is only the beginning,"" Al Nafjan said. Sitting on the passenger side for her 15-minute ride through Riyadh, Al Nafjan captured the journey on her cell phone while a female friend drove. ""The whole idea behind the campaign was that June 17 is the start date. It's not the only day. It's the date when women will start to drive,"" she said. Fueled by Women2Drive, a campaign demanding the right for women to drive and travel freely in Saudi Arabia, women commanded streets and roads normally reserved for men. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia. However, religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers. Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts, obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian. Authorities stopped Manal al Sharif, 32, for driving a car May 21 and detained her the next day. She said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail. Al Sharif has not been charged, but the case remains open, and she may be called back, according to human rights activist Waleed Abu Alkhair. Her name has become a rallying cry for women demanding their rights. The ""Women2Drive 17th June"" Facebook page includes a banner that reads ""We are all Manal Sharif"" and a quote from King Abdullah stating that ""the day will come when women will be able to drive."" Al Sharif said before her detention that she was determined to speak out. ""We have a saying,"" she said. ""The rain starts with a single drop. This is a symbolic thing."" The Women2Drive campaign was expected to be a test of wills between the government and half of the nation's citizenry. However, campaign organizers were explicit in laying out conditions for participants. Women were told to adhere to full Islamic dress. Wave the Saudi flag and plaster a picture of the king to show patriotism. It was best to have an international driving license if you planned to drive. And have a man with you. The campaign said it would not be responsible for any women who breached a list of 14 such principles. They were asked to show defiance but within societal confines. A Riyadh man who went out to document what would be an unusual scene in Saudi Arabia said that the streets were typically empty for a Friday morning but that there were many fewer police officers than in March, when online organizers had called for mass demonstrations. ""I'm thinking that the government is turning sideways,"" Ahmad Alafaliq said. ""They don't want to see it. They don't want to deal with it."" ""It's a disadvantage for us,"" said Sulafa Kurdi, who lived in the United States once and got her driver's license when she was 18. ""It's something that we want to do, and hopefully, it will happen,"" she said after driving to a Riyadh restaurant with her friends and cousin. A Saudi woman said her mother drove her and her sisters down Riyadh's main street Thursday. The woman, who asked not to be named because she was worried about harassment and possible reprisals, said no one bothered them. ""This is important for women here. This is one of our rights,"" she said . Nadya Khalife, a Human Rights Watch women's rights researcher for the Middle East and North Africa, said the freedom of movement is a basic right. Saudi Arabia, she said, is the only country that bans women from driving. Strict segregation by sex means women in Saudi Arabia can't travel without a male relative or take public transportation. Ironically, many women are forced to hire expensive private drivers or taxis to get around, forcing them to be in the company of unfamiliar men, which, said activists, does not make sense from a religious standpoint. Khalife said that what separates the latest campaign from other efforts to get women to drive is the degree to which it has relied on social media. Women who got behind the wheel were encouraged to shoot videos of themselves. But Saudi women face challenges, Khalife said. ""They're up against society as a whole,"" she said. ""Some women may even face harassment or pressure from their families. Some women have clearly been in support, but others are saying they don't want to 'shame.' "" Osamah Alluaidan, an opponent of female drivers, posted on Facebook, ""It is not a sin for women to drive but when women drive and disobey the Kingdom's guardians, that's the problem, this is unacceptable."" Khalife noted that some men have been supportive of their daughters, wives and sisters taking part in the driving campaign. Alkhair, speaking Thursday from London, said he encouraged his wife to drive in Jeddah on Friday. ""I think after what the police and the interior ministry did to Manal al Sharif, a lot of women became afraid,"" he said. ""The Interior Ministry has put a lot of police on the street. They want to send a message to all women."" But on Friday, Saudi women defied tradition, no matter how bumpy the road.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino said prior to Sunday's El Clasico that it was his team's last chance in the Spanish title race. His side came through against Real Madrid -- and it was a familiar face who led the way. Lionel Messi netted a hat-trick to become the leading scorer in El Clasico history as part of a 4-3 Barcelona victory that featured just about everything in Madrid. The estimated worldwide television audience of 400 million for arguably football's biggest club game couldn't have been disappointed. ""(Messi has) put in many performances like the one he put in today, but the impact is greater in a Clasico,"" Martino was quoted as saying on Barcelona's website. ""I really have run out of words for him."" The first half alone produced four goals but it could have been six or seven. The referee was in the spotlight for awarding three penalties, two to Barcelona, and what would an El Clasico be without a red card? It went to Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos midway in the second half with the home team leading 3-2 and predictably changed the complexion of the affair. Out went Real Madrid's 31-game unbeaten streak, a run that began following Barcelona's win in this season's first league meeting between the giants in October. But a part of Madrid won't be disappointed with the result, since Atletico Madrid assumed top spot in La Liga ahead of its city rival thanks to a better head-to-head record. Barcelona trails by a point. ""La Liga has started over, we're back in the fight for the title,"" added Martino. The early moments of Sunday's showdown suggested it would be an open contest and so it wasn't much of a surprise that it took a mere seven minutes to produce a goal. Messi's ball released Andres Iniesta, who shot into the top corner. Karim Benzema should have quickly leveled but his effort sailed over the bar and four-time world player of the year Messi was guilty of a rare bad miss himself, scuffing his shot when in alone. Angel di Maria outshone his fellow winger Gareth Bale, his first-half display scintillating. Messi's fellow Argentine set up Benzema's header in the 20th minute for 1-1 -- although keeper Victor Valdes' reaction suggested he knew he made a mistake. With Barcelona reeling, Benzema's close-range finish in the 24th minute handed Madrid the advantage and the French international was only denied a hat-trick when Gerard Pique cleared off the line. Messi tied proceedings in the 42nd minute to break Alfredo di Stefano's El Clasico record, with Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Real Madrid defender Pepe shown yellow cards in the aftermath when they touched heads -- and then theatrically fell to the ground. Bale -- the world's most expensive player who entered the game in his best form of the campaign -- ran at the Barcelona defense to set up Benzema, who was deprived by Valdes to begin the second half. Cue the controversy. Referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco awarded Real Madrid a penalty when Dani Alves clipped Ronaldo but contact appeared to be outside the box. Ronaldo, who like Bale was mostly quiet Sunday, took the spot kick and the reigning world player of the year converted in the 55th minute. Messi sent through Neymar and the Brazilian -- about to be substituted after struggling -- was ruled to have been fouled in the box by Ramos. Undiano Mallenco again pointed to the spot, Ramos as the last man received the 19th red card of his career and Messi leveled in the 65th to make yet more history. He became the second leading scorer in La Liga on 236 goals. With Real Madrid forced to sit back and defend, the breakneck pace predictably slowed. Alves hit the post but when Iniesta went down under a challenge from Xabi Alonso, Undiano Mallenco awarded the third penalty. Up stepped Messi in the 83rd minute. He showed no nerves, sending his kick into the roof of the net for a 26th career hat-trick and second in as many games. ""We had chances and we are not happy, but not to worry, the league is still open,"" Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. Atletico earlier Sunday downed last-place Real Betis 2-0. A dogged Betis frustrated Atletico for the opening 55 minutes but when Braian Rodriguez was sent off for a second yellow, the visitor pounced. Gabi -- with a long-range stunner -- and Diego Costa scored in the 58th and 64th minutes, respectively, to give Atletico the win and ultimately first place in Spain.","Lionel Messi's hat-trick lifts Barcelona to a 4-3 win over 10-man Real Madrid .

"Austrian-born actor Maximilian Schell, winner of an Academy Award for his portrayal of a defense lawyer in ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" has died, his agent, Patricia Baumbauer, said Saturday. He was 83. Schell died at an hospital in Innsbruck,  Austria, with his wife, Iva, at his side, Baumbauer told CNN. ""He was suffering from a long illness,"" Baumbauer said. ""My mother was Schell's agent for over 50 years, and when she died four years ago, he remained with the agency.  He was like a father to me and knew me my entire life."" Read more about his career . Schell, one of the most successful German-speaking actors in English-language films, made his Hollywood debut in 1958 in the World War II film ""The Young Lions,"" according to IMDb. In his second Hollywood role, as defense attorney Hans Rolfe in Stanley Kramer's classic ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" he won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Actor and beat out co-star Spencer Tracy for the Oscar, according to IMDb. He also earned a Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for the role, which brought him international acclaim. Schell's acting eventually won him two more Oscar nominations -- in 1976 for Best Actor for ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" and in 1978 for Best Supporting Actor for ""Julia,"" according to IMDb. As a director, Schell's 1984 documentary on Marlene Dietrich, ""Marlene"" was nominated for a best documentary Oscar and praised as a masterpiece of the nonfiction genre, according to IMDb. Dietrich allowed herself to be recorded but refused to be filmed, bringing out the most in Schell's talent to penetrate images and uncover reality. Schell was born in Vienna on December 8, 1930, and raised in Zurich, Switzerland. People we've lost in 2014 .","Maximilian Schell won Academy Award for role in ""Judgment at Nuremberg""

"That foods can soothe, reduce anxiety and boost your mood is well known to anyone who has kept a vise grip on a pint of Chunky Monkey at midnight or dived into the deep end of a party pack of chips at the end of a day gone awry. In a perverse way, ice cream and chips do represent a fast-track to happiness. A load of simple carbohydrates provides an instant lift because carbohydrates trigger the rapid release of serotonin, the mood-elevating ""happy hormone."" When the brain produces serotonin, we experience a calming effect. But the problem with a simple carb overload is that it sets off a physiological chain reaction that wreaks havoc on the body. It also taxes the adrenals, suppresses the immune system for hours after intake and generally leaves a person feeling sluggish and off-kilter. And then there's the sugar crash. Caffeine is no panacea either. ""People who are working a lot and not getting enough sleep often reach for that extra cup of coffee because they think it's going to help them. But in reality the caffeine makes things much worse,"" says Marjorie Nolan, a registered dietitian. ""When you're anxious and stressed out, your body is already stimulated. Add caffeine, which is a stimulant, on top of that, and you're setting yourself up to crash and burn a few hours later. Plus, you're dehydrating yourself, which makes you feel even more fatigued and stressed. You also end up depleting valuable hormones in the long run."" Manuel Villacorta, a Bay Area-based registered dietitian and specialist in sports nutrition, says, ""We used to have to run for our lives, literally, but we're not doing that anymore. Now most of us are sitting for our lives and livelihoods. People think all that sugar they eat is going to their cells -- and some of it does. But the extra sugar floating around is going straight to the fat cells. It usually builds up in your waistline. And that's how stress is related to gaining weight."" What's more, says Villacorta, another side effect of stress eating is that your brain becomes conditioned to want the cookies, bagels, chips and doughnuts. ""Over time, your brain creates these reward pathways. And come 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., you're craving those doughnuts. And that's when you become vulnerable, because once those reward pathways have been created, willpower alone is not going to work so well for you anymore."" I imagine my biggest vice, an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, happily rolling down its very own reward pathway in my brain. So what do you do then? ""You need to create a new pathway, a new happy memory,"" Villacorta says. ""I tell my clients that when afternoon comes and you have those cravings, maybe what you need to do is get up and take a two-minute walk. Or take 10 deep breaths, which will also help lower cortisol levels. Maybe you really are hungry, in which case you need to eat something both satisfying and nutritious. You have to find other ways of channeling the energy and coping."" Robin Kanarek, interim dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, speaks to the psychology of stress eating: ""Food is more than nutrition. It can have nutritional value, but it also has cultural and social value. Sometimes our beliefs about food may be influencing behavior as much as the nutrition."" She cites one study in which students were sent either a doughnut or banana, both with an equal of number of calories and sugar grams. The students who were given a doughnut reported feeling worse about themselves and their body image after they ate it. In a second study, subjects were provided with the same milkshake, except one group was told it was high in calories, while the other was told it was low. The people who thought they had a high-calorie shake were much more likely to indulge in Ring Dings (frosted cream-filled devil's food cakes) afterward. ""The thinking was, 'I've already messed up so I might as well keep eating.' "" Kanarek recommends having healthy snacks handy. ""Most people have a lull around 3 p.m. If you're stressed out and all you can find is junk food from the vending machine down the hall, you may start this cycle that can lead to even more stress,"" she says. ""Having some fruits and vegetables readily available lets you indulge in something sweet that tastes good and has nutritional value, without the snowball effect."" According to Villacorta, when it comes to eating to reduce stress, your general goal is twofold: boost the happy hormones (serotonin and dopamine) and reduce the stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline), which take a toll on the body over time. Nolan and Villacorta, both national representatives for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, offer nutrition-based recommendations for combating stress, including: . Indulging in complex carbs. All carbs prompt the brain to produce more serotonin. The trick is to stick to more complex carbohydrates because they digest more slowly and keep blood sugar levels stable. Nolan suggests a bowl of oatmeal, whole grain, high-fiber breads and pastas, beans and lentils, which are packed with B vitamins to help keep up energy levels. Villacorta also recommends quinoa, sweet potatoes and fruit. Crunching some veggies. According to Nolan, crunchy raw veggies such as baby carrots, celery and radishes are great stress reducers because the act of crunching releases tension in the jaw without adding many calories. Eating the right kind of fat. Foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids -- walnuts, almonds, flaxseeds, pine nuts, wild tuna and salmon -- help control unhealthy surges in stress hormones. They are also protective against mood disorders such as depression and are important for brain function. ""If you are able to think clearly, you will be better equipped to deal with stress,"" Nolan says. Increasing your C. Vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, do double duty because they can reduce stress hormone levels even as they boost the immune system, which is often compromised when we are under a lot of stress. Drinking tea. Studies show that theanine, an amino acid found primarily in green tea, can have a calming (but not drowsy) effect while helping to lower elevated blood pressure. Ultimately, the big picture that emerges is much less about short-term solutions and more about creating a diet filled with less processed, more wholesome foods that can provide greater health, well-being and energy -- foods that can also help shore up the immune system by counteracting the pervasive stress in most of our lives. ""You have people consuming these 'light,' 40- to 60-calorie snacks, with lots of additives and very little nutrition,"" Nolan says. ""With the sight and smell of food, and the chewing, our digestive enzymes are released. But lo and behold, 20 minutes later, there is no actual 'food' to be had. Our body isn't digesting anything remotely nutritious and thus isn't satiated. That can trigger a low-grade stress hormonal response, and when it's happening over and over again, it's really taking a toll on our bodies."" (If you're having trouble figuring out how to make better choices as you're wandering the supermarket aisles, check out Fooducate and ShopWell -- two smartphone apps and also websites that offer suggestions for healthier food alternatives.) ""Eat the right combinations of real food at the right time,"" Villacorta recommends. ""Your body will be less taxed, and it will also be better able to handle stress.""","Experts: Stick to more complex carbohydrates because they digest more slowly .

"Beijing (CNN)Chinese-style air rage is now served both hot and cold. Last month, a China-bound Thai AirAsia flight was forced to return to Bangkok after a female Chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service. On Saturday, passengers on a plane departing Kunming Changshui International Airport in southwestern China, angry with the crew for turning off the air-conditioning during the de-icing process, opened three emergency exits just as their plane was pushing back from the gate. The flight was canceled and 25 passengers onboard were detained. China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036, bound for Beijing, was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45 a.m. when crew began to de-ice the plane at the Kunming airport, which saw more than 100 flights delayed or canceled that night because of snowy weather. Frustrated by the lengthy delay, some of the 153 passengers -- who had been sitting on the plane for two hours -- exploded with rage when the air-conditioning stopped and an elderly passenger complained about discomfort due to the stuffy cabin, airport police told state media Saturday night. Dissatisfied with the pilot's explanation about the need for air-conditioning to be off during the 30-minute de-icing process, members of a tour group started quarreling with the crew, according to police. When the Boeing 737-800 jet finally pushed back from the gate, three of its four over-the-wing emergency exits suddenly popped open. Photos circulating on social media show two opened exits on the right side of the cabin with passengers still seated, as well as crews and police on board documenting evidence. Air rage and emergency exists: Stormy weeks in Chinese aviation . Anger common in delay-prone China . After detaining and questioning all 25 members of the tour group, the authorities announced that a male member of the group, prompted by a female tour guide, opened two exits on the right side. Both were sent to jail for 15 days, while police continued to look for the person who opened the exit on the left side. As news of the incident spread, some Chinese Internet users sympathized with the perpetrators because of the delay, but many considered their punishment too lenient and suggested airlines should blacklist them for life. Air rage is a common sight in delay-prone China and Saturday's episode was not the first dramatic incident involving irate passengers at Kunming airport. One of the country's busiest hubs, more than 32 million fliers passed through its terminal last year. In August 2012, 31 passengers from a long-delayed flight tried to stop other planes from leaving Kunming by forcing their way onto the tarmac and occupying a taxiway for half an hour, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The following February, some 50 passengers from a canceled flight stormed several gates at the airport in an attempt to prevent other travelers from boarding their flights. Police had to disperse the angry crowd with pepper spray, according to Xinhua. Exporting air rage . With the exponential growth of outbound tourism, Chinese travelers now seem to be exporting their air rage overseas as well, with several incidents resulting in flight delays or diversions recorded in recent years. In February 2012, a Chinese couple was kicked off their United flight from Guam to Shanghai, after they repeatedly yelled at a flight attendant and told her to ""shut up"" when she tried to move their luggage in the overhead bin to accommodate other passengers. In September that year, a Swiss flight bound for Beijing was forced to return to Zurich when a fight broke out between two Chinese men over a reclined seat. In February 2014, a fight erupted between two groups of Chinese passengers before their flight could take off from the Thai resort island of Phuket, resulting in 29 people being taken off the plane. Then, in April, a Thai Airways red-eye from Bangkok to Beijing turned bloody when a brawl involving three Chinese men broke out. During an official visit to the Maldives in September, President Xi Jinping personally asked Chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad. Last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning Chinese travelers into ""civilized tourists.""","A plane departing southwestern China was canceled after irate passengers opened three emergency exits .

"""We thought we were doing this the right way. It turns out, we made a mistake."" Dave Morin, the CEO and creator of social media app Path, tells me this as we sit in his 22nd-floor headquarters in downtown San Francisco. It's a mere 24 hours after an independent app developer exploded Morin's world with a simple blog post that led to a torrent of bad publicity. Arun Thampi of Singapore discovered that Path uploads users' address book information to Path's servers. This action isn't in Path's Terms of Use, and it's enraged a user community concerned about privacy rights. Some social media companies, including Path, subscribe to a philosophy that says access to your personal data — if used safely and in the right way — can only improve your experience. To this extent, address book data is the bread and butter of Path, an app that distinguishes itself as ""the first truly personal network."" ""We don't want to connect you with just anyone on Path,"" Morin says. ""Without the contact list information, some of these features just don't work."" The address book data, Morin says, is used in only three ways. ""We give you a list of suggested friends to connect with who are already on Path. We notify you when other friends of yours join Path."" And the third reason speaks to the very uniqueness of Path itself — its ""Friend Rank"" algorithm. FriendRank uses data on your phone to determine the most helpful friending suggestions. The feature looks at the interaction you have with friends across platforms, so, in theory, you'll get the most relevant friend suggestions possible without the chaff that Facebook, for one, may serve up. ""We used the data for the sake of simplicity,"" Morin tells me. ""Any time you build a network, you have to help users find their friends. And that entire experience is designed to suggest people who you're close to."" In other words, it's the whole point of the app itself. But that's not an easy sentiment to convey to users who feel their privacy has been violated. Morin told me he wants to take all measures possible — all explained in a blog post — to prove to users that Path is serious about privacy. ""We've deleted the entire collection of user contact information from our servers,"" Morin says. ""Unlike some other companies, we believe that users should have complete control over their data. This is just the right thing to do."" Following Tuesday's privacy kerfuffle, Morin's company is caught in an existential morass of data and privacy issues. Users are enraged, which is to be expected, but social media software development has blurred the lines between what users want from a social media app, and what users will tolerate in terms of data mining. To what degree can a technology company collect users personal data without facing backlash from the public at large? What is acceptable, and what is going over the line? With the rise of Facebook, Twitter and Google+, we're growing accustomed to handing over our data to social media services, all of which claim the best intentions. The goal, theses services say, is to improve applications, tailoring them to act and react to our personal preferences. Google has countless terabytes of data on its users, and is incorporating this trove of data more and more in the spirit of improving services. Last month, for example, Google rolled out Search plus Your World, a function that incorporates your Google+ social network information into simple Google search queries, an attempt to provide the most relevant search results possible. To some degree, companies such as Facebook, Google and Path are forced to push the envelope. The landscape for social applications is nearing full capacity, with little room for copycats that provide no added value outside of what others are doing. ""In social, you have to innovate in information,"" Morin says. ""If you have the same thing as everyone else, you're just not interesting."" Yet on the flip side, social media companies have faced serious privacy concern backlashes in the wake of any major changes. Google users have been chaffed by Search plus Your World — almost as if they just finally realized just how personal data is that Google has stored on its servers. Facebook, too, has encountered its share of user outrage: It happens nearly every time the company makes a major change in the service. In fact, Facebook was caught doing the exact same thing that Path is currently taking heat for, over two years ago. It's indicative of a larger issue in today's technology landscape — the tension between how much data we're comfortable giving, and how much data we expect to remain private. And this is where Path got in trouble. Its privacy policy never explicitly pointed out that it would access your contacts, nor does the iOS app prompt users for access to their address book in the first place. But some security researchers say this shouldn't come as a surprise. ""We've seen a great many examples of this type of thing in the press, but it's somewhat commonplace for applications to access user's personal information without users knowing,"" said independent security researcher Ashkan Soltani in an interview. ""Smartphones are small personal computers that people carry along with them. They contain a great amount of personal data including e-mails, contacts, and calendars, yet we blindly download apps from small third-party developers without any due diligence."" And to some degree, Path and other app developers are crippled by Apple's submission process. ""It's fundamentally a flaw in the way the platforms are set up,"" Soltani says. ""The only data that's restricted and requires notification as part of the platform is location. Apple is supposed to detect when apps send information to third parties, but it's still a very subjective thing. Path is a social app, so to some degree, it's to be expected."" Morin stresses that Path isn't the worst offender in that the data it's collected is used only for the features Morin outlined. Path has no advertising, so unlike Facebook and Google, no information is used to target and tailor ads to individuals, he says. What's more, he says, his company's servers are secured behind a firewall, and Morin and his team are meeting with TRUSTe, a privacy policy certification service, on Wednesday afternoon to discuss Path's measures in keeping user data safe. Ironically, Path had already been working on changing the way it notifies users of access to the address book. ""We had proactively rolled out an opt-in for this on our Android client a few weeks ago,"" Morin says, ""and were literally preparing to roll it out for iOS on Friday."" All of which makes this week's bad publicity a matter of seriously unfortunate timing. Morin says he hopes his company's situation will spark a larger conversation about privacy in the industry. ""We're probably going to have to innovate on how transparent we are,"" he says. But, ultimately, Path is in it for the long haul, and hopes to make good with its user base with a swift resolution. ""From the beginning, we've been working on building a 30-year company here,"" Morin tells me. ""And trust takes time.""","Users upset that Path uploads users' address book information to Path's servers .

"""Horsey!"" scream the children staring in awe at the glossy chestnut thoroughbred towering above them. Their tiny hands press against the glass encasing Australia's most beloved race horse -- Phar Lap. But despite their excited squealing and impatient jostling, the impressive 1.74-meter tall gelding will never lower his glassy stare in their direction. He'll never twitch his ears, flick his tail, or gallop down the race track with the remarkable speed which made him a national hero during the darkest days of the 1930s Depression. Phar Lap has been dead for 81 years. His body however, looks barely a day over six-years-old, frozen in time thanks to taxidermy -- the art of stuffing animal skins for display. The champion thoroughbred is one of many legendary taxidermy horses exhibited in museums around the world -- forever ready to run their next race, charge onto the battle field, or star on the big screen. ""Taxidermy is a way to immortalize their story, as well as their actions and deeds,"" said Michael Reason, curator of the Phar Lap exhibition at Australia's Melbourne Museum. ""Museums are all about experiencing `the real thing,' so presenting a preserved specimen is a way of doing that."" Equine legends live on . From Napoleon's horse, Le Vizir, on display at the Army Museum in Paris, to actor Roy Rogers' trusty sidekick, Trigger, exhibited at a U.S. TV network, the intriguing world of equine taxidermy is far from, well, dead. ""What makes preserved famous creatures so different from hunting trophies or natural history specimens, is that most taxidermy is about preserving the animal's form -- you're not really trying to capture the spirit of the animal,"" said Rachel Poliquin, author of The Breathless Zoo: Taxidermy and the Cultures of Longing. ""With famous creatures such as Phar Lap, you're preserving it because the animal has done something which is more than animal -- it has qualities such as courage, fortitude, endurance, which we like to think are in the human domain."" Enter Comanche . There is perhaps no horse which embodies those virtues quite like Comanche. The gelding gained legendary status as the sole survivor on the U.S. Cavalry side of the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn -- fought between General Custer's troops and native American Indians. Two days after the clash which killed hundreds of combatants, Comanche was discovered on the battlefield -- badly injured, but alive. When he died from colic 15 years later he was buried with full military honors, while his skin was preserved. Today, long after the soldiers who rode him have turned to dust, Comanche's taxidermy body remains standing to attention at Kansas University's Natural History Museum. ""Comanche stands for many more things than being the lone survivor on the Cavalry side -- he stands for the relentless march of the European settlers across the great plains and the war against the Indians,"" said Leonard Krishtalka, director of the Biodiversity Institute at Kansas University. ""Why do we taxidermy animals, or make wax models, or copy archaeological monuments, or hold historical re-enactments? I guess it's a way of understanding history better, of bringing it to life."" Strike a pose . But taxidermy, much like history, is never free from our own manipulation. When cowboy actor Roy Rogers had his sidekick, Trigger, stuffed in 1965, it was in a pose befitting a screen star. Rearing on his hind legs and wearing an elaborately studded saddle, the golden palomino who appeared alongside Rodgers in dozens of films, was auctioned for a whopping $266,500 to cable company RFD-TV in 2010. It appears that in death, Trigger had become larger than life. ""A taxidermy animal is just the skin of the animal, and of course the skin has no inherent shape or pose."" Poliquin said. ""And that's where the artistry and the human manipulation become involved."" ""Are you going to pose the lion sleeping or attacking an antelope? All those decisions come in manufacturing the ultimate spectacle."" Art imitating life . While taxidermy attempts to recreate animals, it actually uses very little of their original parts. Instead, the skin is usually stretched over an artificial skeleton and preserved with chemicals. Features such as glass eyes or synthetic tongues are also added. ""You have to have a solid knowledge of anatomy,"" said Krishtalka. ""One of the big problems with early taxidermy, was that the skin was susceptible to insect infestation. ""Virtually all the animals that have been stuffed before 1960 have great quantities of arsenic on them and still have to be handled with gloves."" Alluring animals . There is something both disconcerting and mesmerizing about coming face-to-face with animals who teeter in the realm between life and death. In the case of our hero horses, there is also a deep emotional turmoil at play -- we hold these animals in such high esteem that we feel compelled to stuff them for display. Perhaps Poliquin sums up the enduring allure of taxidermy best: ""There's a psychological twist that you can never fully get to the bottom of.""","From race horses to war horses, museums display taxidermy equines .

"Barcelona and Real Madrid are on course to meet in the Copa del Rey final for only the second time in 24 years after the great rivals cruised in the opening legs of their semifinals. Real will be the happier of the sides, having impressed against Atletico Madrid when winning 3-0 at home, so inflicting the La Liga leaders' first defeat in 25 matches. Barca were also at home but had to settle for a modest 2-0 win against Real Sociedad even though the visitors had to play an entire half with just ten men. After losing to Valencia on Saturday, as their first home league defeat in nearly two years knocked them off the top of La Liga, coach Gerardo Martino had stressed the need to 'cut short' any crisis. The hosts took the lead late in the first half through Sergio Busquets, with defender Inigo Martinez sent off immediately after, with the visitors furious that Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano had avoided both a potential red card and the concession of a penalty when hauling back Carlos Vela moments earlier. Barcelona's second came courtesy of a bizarre own goal as defender Gorka Elustondo's attempted clearance thumped into the chest of goalkeeper Enaut Zubikarai before crossing the line. However, Barcelona's former assistant coach Henk Ten Cate, who worked at the club under Frank Rijkaard between 2003-2006, was far from impressed. ""That was the worst Barcelona display I have seen in the last six years,"" the Dutchman told British television channel Sky Sports. ""Barcelona needs a new team, as this is not a Barca that can compete with the best in Europe."" Cate's comments come a fortnight before the four-time European champions take on English Premier League side Manchester City in the Last 16 of the Champions League. They also come in the wake of last month's resignation of president Sandro Rosell, who stepped down because of a legal wrangle over the transfer of Neymar last June. Barca fans also seemed to be voting with their feet, as the crowd of 38,000 was the club's second lowest this season. Meanwhile Real Madrid, who take on Germans Schalke in the Champions League later this month, won a hotly contested Madrid derby thanks to goals from Pepe, Jese and Angel Di Maria. ""My wish is to have a team like the one that played tonight,"" enthused Real's Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. A perfect scoreline was added to when Atletico striker Diego Costa, with 20 league goals this season, earned the booking that ruled him out of next week's return leg. The suspension compounded a miserable night for the 25-year-old who was victimized by Real defensive duo Pepe and Alvaro Arbeloa. ""We tried but we just couldn't find a way tonight,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said afterwards. Atletico won last season's Copa del Rey after beating Real 2-1 in a final which was also littered with cynical fouls and gamesmaship. After meeting in the 1990 final, Real and Barca have contested the Copa del Rey decider just once -- when Jose Mourinho's Madrid won 1-0 in 2011 thanks to an extra-time winner from Cristiano Ronaldo. The following year, it was Barcelona's turn to get their hands on the trophy as they beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0. This year's final is set to take place on April 19. In Italy, a double from Gervinho, including a winner just two minutes from time, gave Roma a 3-2 victory over Napoli in the first leg of their Italian Cup semifinal. The in-form Ivorian's goals gave Roma their sixth straight win and frustrated a Napoli side that had managed to level the scores despite trailing 2-0 after 32 minutes.","Real Madrid and Barcelona set to meet in Copa del Rey final .

"For the third straight year, Seoul has ranked fifth in the world for number of international conferences hosted. Its airport is the busiest in Asia. Hotels are bursting to capacity. An increasing number of business travelers is arriving each month to South Korea's capital, many not knowing what to expect. Despite the cutting-edge technology the city is known for these days, there remain challenges for a first-timer in Seoul. Here's help. 1. Traveling from the airport/around the city takes lots of time . Seoul is vast -- far greater than many expect. As the largest proper city in the developed world, it's approximately 10 times the size of Manhattan, and much more crowded. What this means for the time-sensitive business traveler is that a lot of buffer time should be factored in -- about 30 minutes, to be safe --  for getting to and from meetings, especially if they involve crossing the Han River. From Incheon International Airport, the express train (₩ 8,000 or $7) runs every 30 minutes and will drop you off at Seoul Station, north of the river, near the Myeongdong business hub. Not a lot of travelers seem to know about this for some reason, and trains are usually quite empty. Airport limousine buses (₩ 10,000-₩15,000 or $9-$14) are another convenient way to get to most any destination from the airport. Staffers at the airport's bus counter are helpful if you tell them where you need to go. Cabs cost around ₩50,000 or $48 to get into the heart of Gangnam (south of the river) or Gangbuk (north of the river). During morning and evening rush hours, it's best to take the train. 2. The language barrier can throw you . The language barrier is particularly frustrating when it comes to addresses and directions. Unlike the United States (or most other countries), Korea historically numbered buildings based on the date they were built in each district, not by location. This means buildings next to each other can have completely different address numbers. (An initiative to change addresses is ongoing.) The best way to get around is to have the address written or printed out in Korean to show to  taxi drivers who can then input the address in their GPS system. Stay strong while they grumble, and insist they put it in. When completely lost, call +82 2 120, the city's help center, which has various language assistance options including English, Japanese and Chinese. 3. Hotel bookings should be based on location . Due to transit times (up to 90 minutes to two hours to cross the city during rush hour) it's best to choose your hotel based on your meeting locations. Best hotels, by business hub: . Yeouido: Conrad Seoul, Marriott Executive Apartments, Sheraton D Cube City . Myeongdong: Westin Chosun, The Plaza, Ibis Ambassador Seoul Myeongdong, Fraser Place . Samseong (near COEX convention center):  Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas, InterContinental Seoul COEX, Park Hyatt, Oakwood Premier Coex Center . Best hotels if you're flexible with location: . Gangnam (south of river): JW Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Novotel Ambassador . Gangbuk (north of river): The Shilla, Grand Hyatt, Banyan Tree Club & Spa, W Seoul Walkerhill . 4. Bring business cards. As in, a whole box . In Korea, the standard business-related introduction involves reverently receiving and returning a business card, bowing and shaking hands, somehow all at the same time. When the exchange is done over a meal, it's common to lay out the business cards of everyone at the table on the table in front of you so that you can remember everyone's name and position as you talk to them. ""That's one of the things that people wish they had known before coming here -- how quickly they're going to run out of business cards,"" says Seoul Convention Bureau vice president Maureen O'Crowley. 5. Wear nice socks at all times . It's not just a matter of style -- it's protection against embarrassment. Many traditional Korean and Japanese restaurants (popular for business lunches and dinners) require patrons to leave shoes at the door. Few local humiliations match having a toe sticking out of an old, dirty sock in the midst of serious business talk. 6. Be prepared to drink and bow . ""Showing you can drink a lot, hold your alcohol, and still talk intelligently about a subject is important to showing that you are a mature, working business person that's worthy of trust,"" says John Li, an investment banker from Hong Kong who travels to Seoul once a month for work. ""Pay attention and you'll catch on quickly about the ritualism in business drinking. Also, there's a lot of only-Koreans-allowed entertaining that happens afterward."" It's considered rude to let someone pour his or her own drink. After toasting, it's considered polite for younger people at the table to turn their heads to the side when they drink.

"Two World War II-era cemeteries that were vandalized over the weekend by armed men in Benghazi will be restored, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said in a posting on its website. Hundreds of gravestones marking the bodies of Christian and Jewish soldiers were kicked from their locations, many of them broken, in the Benghazi War Cemetery and the Benghazi British Military Cemetery, the CWGC said. ""Both cemeteries will be restored to a standard befitting the sacrifice of those commemorated at Benghazi, but this could take some time because we will need to source replacement stones,"" the organization said. ""We will also need to be sure that it's safe for the detailed work to be carried out, but in the meantime we will ensure that temporary markers are erected over the graves. We have no reports of any maintenance staff being injured in the attack."" Britain urged Libya's new leadership Sunday to investigate the desecration of the more than 200 Commonwealth war graves that were vandalized, acts filmed and posted on YouTube. Libya's National Transitional Council said Sunday it regrets what happened, calling it ""unethical, irresponsible and criminal,"" and promised to prosecute those responsible. ""We strongly reject these acts that are rejected by the Islamic faith,"" the NTC said in a statement. ""Such practices do not represent at all the local public opinion and they contradict the Islamic principles that emphasize and urge the respect of religions and beliefs."" In the YouTube video, a group of men is seen walking around the graves, kicking down headstones and using sledgehammers to chip away at a cross at the front of the cemetery. A voice off camera says, ""Destroy the cross, these filthy dogs."" Other voices mock inscriptions on the gravestones, including one engraved with the Star of David. The description of the video says it is a response to the recent burnings of Qurans by U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but CNN cannot independently confirm that. Benghazi was the birthplace of last year's Libyan revolution. The 1,500 graves in the cemeteries hold the bodies of servicemen who died during and after World War II. There was no evidence of damage to the graves themselves, only the headstones, the British Foreign Office said.","""This could take some time,"" war graves commission says .

"We all know Tarzan, but Edgar Rice Burroughs' first literary creation, ""John Carter,"" not so much. In fact, Carter's only previous movie credit is 2009's ""A Princess of Mars,"" starring Traci Lords (Antonio Sabato Jr. was Carter). In this mega-budget Disney sci-fi romp he's played by ""Friday Night Lights"" discovery Taylor Kitsch as a kind of Buck Rogers prototype. This ""John Carter"" is a 19th century Virginian ex-Confederate captain who seems mildly perplexed to be transported from an Arizona cave to Mars, or Barsoom, as the locals call it. The geology -- and the atmosphere -- are not so different from where he came from, but Carter is bewildered to find he seems to have forgotten how to walk; the gravitational pull is so much weaker on Mars, he spends several minutes flopping about in the dirt. It's the kind of purely visual gag that is former Pixar director Andrew Stanton's forte, a reminder of the slapstick interstellar mayhem he brought to ""WALL-E"", and a welcome early signal that he's not going to let ""John Carter"" succumb to the stuffy allegorical earnestness of ""Avatar."" This is a movie comfortable with its own absurdity.  At the same time, Stanton's not going for camp, either -- there's not even the faintest trace of Freddie Mercury's ""Flash Gordon"" style mock rock operatics in Michael Giacchino's symphonic score (more's the pity). With its Victorian flying machines, Western fixtures and archaeological fascination with runes and ruin, ""John Carter"" is a curious mash-up of antique pulp and cutting edge CGI spectacle -- though that isn't such an unusual combination these days, when digital effects increasingly take us away from the realism that dominated movies for the latter part of the 20th century. It's not a trend that critics seem particularly happy about, but more and more our blockbusters are assuming the imaginative freedom that you find in animation. Filmmakers are bending the laws of physics just for the joy of it. When John Carter has finally found his feet he realizes he can leap great distances in a single bound -- there's literally a spring in his step. As superpowers go, this one smacks more of Looney Tunes than Marvel (even though it's enough to encourage Barsoom's three warring tribes to think he might tilt the balance one way or the other). ""John Carter"" cast talks to iReport . Elsewhere, Stanton's design seems under the spell of the enchanting anime movies of Studio Ghibli master Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away,"" ""Howl's Moving Castle""): There's an insatiable city that moves like a crab on legs that pump away like oil wells, a blue-tongued dino-dog scuttles after Carter at the speed of a cannonball and scheming mystical spirits shapeshift at will. Willem Dafoe and Samantha Morton are among the actors impersonating the film's most compelling creations, the Tharks: giant green vertebrates with boar-like tusks, four arms and a penchant for cruel and unusual punishment. Stanton and his co-writers Mark Andrews and novelist Michael Chabon create a reasonably coherent and absorbing alien anthropology for the Tharks, but the humanoid tribes are generally less interesting, with the partial exception of Lynn Collins' Helium princess, Dejah Thoris, who is permitted to be self-centered and deceitful as well as feisty and intelligent (and never once speaks in a high-pitched squeak). Mind you, it's not all good. The movie's plot construction is rickety; the opening is needlessly confusing, and the heavies' political machinations didn't make much sense that I could see. Yes, too, it's another movie pitched overwhelmingly at teenagers. Whether they're prepared to take innocent hokum at face value we will know soon enough, but for all its flaws this is an altogether more idiosyncratic and personable blockbuster than your typical corporate popcorn fodder.","Taylor Kitsch is a kind of Buck Rogers prototype in ""John Carter""

"The Obama administration will push for a $156 million increase in funding for Alzheimer's research over the next two years, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday. The National Institutes of Health will commit another $50 million in funding this year, and the White House will propose an additional $80 million as part of President Barack Obama's budget proposal for the next fiscal year.  The new research funding will help support both basic and clinical research designed in part to improve therapy and identify genes associated with a heightened risk of the disease. Another $26 million would be allocated starting next year for caregiver support,education, and public awareness, among other things. Currently, the NIH spends $450 million annually on research into Alzheimer's, which afflicts as many as 5.1 million Americans.  The total number of Americans with Alzheimer's could more than double by 2050, according to the federal government. Alzheimer's: Early detection, risk factors are crucial . Alzheimer's is ""a disease that takes a devastating toll on millions of Americans,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said.  ""Reducing the burden of Alzheimer's disease on patients and their families is an urgent national priority."" CNN Photos: The past and present of Alzheimer's patients . Tuesday's announcement was part of the administration's ""We Can't Wait"" initiative, a series of measures designed to highlight executive branch action in contrast to legislative gridlock. While researchers welcomed the proposed increase, they also noted that funding for Alzheimer's still lags significantly compared to funding for other major ailments.  Last year, the NIH spent $3 billion on research into AIDS, $4.3 billion on heart disease, and $5.8 billion for cancer, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Over the next four decades, Alzheimer's care is projected to cost the United States approximately $20 trillion, according to the association. Alzheimer's, an irreversible brain disorder that gradually erodes memory and cognitive function, is currently the sixth-leading cause of death in America, the association notes.","The Obama administration proposes a $156 million boost in Alzheimer's funding .

"When Susie Lopez, 43, was a little girl she would run outside her home in Angeles City, near the U.S. Clark Airbase in the Philippines, every time she heard a plane fly by. ""I would say 'bye bye, Dad' because the only thing I knew about my father was my dad was riding a plane,"" she recalls. The daughter of an American naval pilot and a Filipino mother, Lopez is one of an estimated 52,000 ""Amerasians"" fathered by American military servicemen during the decades the U.S. Navy and Air Force had bases in the Philippines. The majority of their mothers worked as bar girls in the area's thriving ""rest and recreation"" industry, where soldiers were their regular clients.  When the American military left the bases in the early 1990s, these children were left behind. On March 4, in honor of International Amerasian Day, a group of 60 Filipino Amerasians from the cities surrounding former bases will celebrate in a special way. Their ""100 Letters to our Fathers"" campaign will see  the group - whose members range from teenage to  those in their 50s - reach out with messages of love and hope to fathers almost all of them never knew. Many of the handwritten letters will be read aloud and will be accompanied by their photos and a short  video showing conditions Amerasians have faced. All will be available on a new website, with the goal of bringing the issues of Filipino Amerasians in the Philippines from the sidelines to the surface. Left without fathers, many of these Amerasians were also abandoned by their mothers, who were often unable to care for them. The majority of children were raised in extreme poverty by family members or guardians, with little access to social services, and suffered from a lack of identity and intense discrimination. They were stigmatized for being illegitimate and for being the children of prostitutes.  Amerasians fathered by African American soldiers say they suffered the most extreme prejudice. Brenda Moreno, 44, does not know the name of her African-American father or her mother. She does not know where she belongs. She remembers a childhood where she hid at home because she looked different. ""They see my color and my hair and they tease me 'negra'. I am always crying because I don't feel good. I tell them when I grow up I am going to change my blood so I am going to be white,"" she recalls. Anthony Dizon, 28, says living with constant discrimination taught him to fight. ""When I walk on the streets people look at you from head to toe and make a face... Or they say 'hey nigger, come here' and then they punch me,"" he says. Many are unable to finish school -- either due to financial problems, or out of frustration. Mark Gilbore, 24, only finished third grade. ""I was always bullied in school because of my color... And they accuse you of doing something just because you are different,"" he says. Moreno feels caught in a vicious cycle: ""I can't find a good job because I can't go to school. I am just always working as a housemaid,"" she says, ""How can I change my life? I am just trying my best."" This feeling of helplessness often extends to the workplace. Dizon says he was even refused a job at a supermarket: ""They told me they can't hire me because I am black...I feel so bad, so hurt. Why don't they give me an opportunity?"" Dondie Moore, 22, a second -generation Amerasian, feels the Philippines government has forgotten about them: ""We don't have any laws. We don't have any rights. They look at us as if we are aliens. ""I can't find a job to continue my life."" Alex Magno, Professor of Political Science at University of the Philippines, explains that this racial prejudice is deeply-rooted, but was strengthened by the country's colonial past. ""We long ago considered the Malayo-Polynesian tribes superior and the Negrito tribes inferior,"" he says. ""Hispanic culture merely reinforced that prejudice with its Eurocentric paradigm. Superimpose Hollywood. The standard of beauty is fair skin, tall nose, straight hair."" Growing up with such a lack of acceptance and economic hardship has taken an emotional and psychological toll on many. According to a three-year study conducted by Dr. Peter Kutschera, Director of the Philippine Amerasian Research Institute in Angeles City, ""we have a severely socioeconomically impaired population, especially among Africans, who contend with serious physical and mental stress issues, including homelessness, alcohol and drug abuse."" Having faced rejection on so many levels, many Amerasians consider themselves half American and long to be recognized, if not by their fathers, then by the U.S. government. But current legislation does not make it easy to become a citizen. Although the United States Congress passed the Amerasian Immigration Act of 1982, which gave preferential immigration status to Amerasian children born in Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos during the Vietnam War, it does not include those born in the Philippines. Filipino Amerasians can only become citizens if their father claims them. According to Kutschera's research, one reason for this exclusion is the belief that Amerasians in the Philippines suffered much less discrimination than in those countries. Some Amerasians are children of a ""steady bar fine"" relationship. ""This meant an American paid for you. You just took care of him during that time he was there,"" said  Alma Bulawan, President of Buklod, a group that works with former prostitutes and their families. ""He stays at your home, you cook and clean. Its like a steady live in partner."" Dizon is one of them.  He is part of a minority that knows their father's name, yet he has no paperwork to back up any claims. But he has not given up his search. ""I would tell him I love him and ask why he left me since birth,"" he says. ""I will ask him why he abandoned me. I am black American. Every day I am thinking I want to go to USA or Africa because I feel I belong there.  People have the same skin color."" But Shane Jackson, 19, considers herself lucky. As a ""white Amerasian"", she has faced much less discrimination, and after a five-year search, recently found her father by using the Internet. ""It's the feeling that you're complete,"" she says. ""The fact that he didn't deny me -- it is one great accomplishment. ""  But she explains that for those who may never find their fathers, having citizenship will at least make them feel they belong somewhere. Past attempts for the American government's help have had little success. In 1993, mothers of Amerasians and their children filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government, asking for $68 million to care for 8,600 Amerasian children living in the town next to a former naval base. ""We wanted the American government to support the Amerasian children,"" Bulawan said. ""We asked for money for food, shelter, education and health."" According to Father Shay Cullen, President of PREDA Foundation, the case was closed after the court decided most of the women were engaged in prostitution, which is an illegal activity and therefore could not be the basis for any legal claim. But the thousands of Amerasian children represented in that class action suit are now young adults. They have formed United Philippines Amerasians -- a loose network of formal and informal communities of Amerasians who plan to work on creating a national advocacy. They hope to reach out to Amerasians all over the Philippines, coordinate community-level projects, and develop support programs. Jackson says, ""I'm just hoping that my generation has the chance to go to school. I hope the treatment of the people will change. I hope they will accept us, that we are Amerasians. ""We deserve to work. We deserve to be in any government institutions. We deserve everything. We're all humans.""","Suzie Lopez is one of an estimated 52,000 ""Amerasians"" fathered by U.S. servicemen in Philippines .

"(CNN) -- ""You can be as racist as you want, as long as you keep your mouth shut,"" says John Barnes. The former Liverpool great should know. The Jamaican-born England international was subjected to racist abuse including an infamous incident 27 years ago when a fan threw a banana at him during a Merseyside derby between Liverpool and rivals Everton. Barnes kicked the piece of fruit away. Fast forward to 2014 and Barcelona's Dani Alves was similarly taunted, though the Brazilian picked up and ate the banana that had been hurled at him by a Villarreal supporter. According to Barnes, the fact that bananas are still been throwing at games shows football's approach to tackling discrimination is befuddled. ""The way we're trying to deal with it, in terms of getting rid of it, is wrong,"" Barnes, who played for England between 1983 and 1995, told CNN at a promotional event for YO! Sushi aimed at encouraging fans to back Japan at the 2014 World Cup. ""Only through education and making people know why it's wrong to do it. ""Just by saying to people 'You're not allowed to do it' without telling them why, explaining to them why... Or fining them when they do it, so they just keep their mouth shut is not getting rid of it. ""Do we want to get rid of racism? Or do we want just not to hear it? What football is saying, by fining and banning people, is 'You can be as racist as you want, but as long as you keep your mouth shut it's fine.' ""That's not what I'm interested in."" One week after Alves was abused, Levante's Senegalese player Papakouli Diop claimed he heard monkey chants from Atletico Madrid supporters. His response was to dance in front of his alleged abusers but, while he fully support Alves' actions, Barnes questioned Diop's reaction. ""I think Alves showed disdain, he showed disregard,"" he added. ""He showed that if you're being bullied and the bullies aren't effecting you, they will stop bullying you. ""If you react to it, they will continue to do it. From a playing perspective, I think that's the right way to respond."" While praising Villarreal for acting swiftly to ban the fan who threw the banana at Alves, Barnes warned that football might be fighting a losing battle in trying to eradicate racist abuse. ""These aren't football's problems. Until we get rid of it in society, we won't get rid of it in football,"" added Barnes, who memorably scored a remarkable solo goal in the Maracana stadium against Brazil in a 1-0 friendly win for England in June 1984. ""From an institutional perspective, yes you ban the fan, as the club did, if you've got to close stadiums, fine players or take points off clubs, that's what you do."" Football's world governing body FIFA introduced a series of punishments after a number of high-profile racism cases in 2013. The punishments for a first offense is a warning, fine or the club in question being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed ""serious,"" could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament.","John Barnes says football must change its approach to tackling racism .

"The same week that a report documented massive overspending at the General Services Administration, a video emerged Thursday showing an agency employee joking about the excess spending and saying he would never be investigated for it. The video also mentions an awards program for employees that gave out $200,000 worth of taxpayer-funded iPods, electronics and gift cards to entry-level government employees. ""I buy everything your field office can't afford,"" raps the employee in the video. ""I'll never be under OIG investigation."" OIG refers to the Office of the Inspector General, who originally looked into the GSA's spending on a 2010 training conference held in Las Vegas. His report found the federal agency spent $822,000 on the event, including $75,000 on team-building exercises, $6,000 on commemorative coins, and $6,000 on canteens, keychains, and T-shirts. The revelations prompted GSA Administrator Martha Johnson to resign this week. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa's office, which is investigating the excess spending, received the video from the inspector general and released it to the public on Thursday. The video was the winning entry in an employee video contest at the 2010 conference. In handing out the award for the video, the deputy commissioner of the Public Building Service appears to mock oversight of the GSA. The revelations about the GSA's overspending are prompting outrage among lawmakers who are furious about taxpayer money being wasted. The inspector general's staff briefed congressional investigators Wednesday, and a source familiar with the briefing told CNN they were ""pretty astonished at the blatant misuse of funds."" Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, plan to hold a hearing on the matter April 19. ""Over the course of the past few days, some of the outrageous spending habits of the GSA have surfaced, and it is unbelievable,"" Mica said in a statement Thursday. ""First, it was reported that the agency spent $800,000 on a lavish training conference in Las Vegas, and yesterday we learned of an equally over-the-top employee award program that handed out $200,000 worth of taxpayer funded iPods, electronics and gift cards for questionable reasons at best."" More damaging videos may soon emerge. A congressional source familiar with the investigation of the GSA told CNN on Thursday that the agency had an internal website with video clips and pictures from the Las Vegas conference. The site isn't online anymore, but Issa's committee is demanding more information about it. A GSA spokesman issued a statement saying, ""This video is another example of the complete lack of judgment exhibited during the 2010 Western Regions Conference. Our agency continues to be appalled by this indefensible behavior, and we are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again."" Mica's committee was already looking into the GSA's budget when this week's report came out. Earlier this year, committee members noticed that, at a time when other federal agencies' administrative budges were being cut and going down, the GSA's was dramatically increasing. The committee requested more details from the GSA about its budget and held hearings on the issue. The GSA witness at the hearings, Robert Peck, promised details but committee members did not receive them. A congressional panel said Tuesday that Peck was fired. Before she stepped down, GSA Administrator Johnson called the details in the report ""egregious"" and ""absolutely unacceptable."" She also announced measures including disciplinary action against several senior management officials. Among other items cited in the inspector general's report was a $12,000 finder's fee paid to an outside company to book the resort complex for the convention, even though the GSA has planners on staff for that very purpose. The report said the GSA portrayed certain events as awards ceremonies simply to justify the catering bill. It was a GSA deputy administrator who initially asked for the investigation, saying there was questionable spending for the 2010 event. The GSA employs nearly 13,000 people across the country and is the federal agency that buys and manages goods and services for the government, ranging from envelopes to real estate and office buildings.","Video shows a GSA employee joking about excess spending .

"A true revolution doesn't come every day.  The word ""revolution"" appears all around us, in commercial advertisements and political propaganda, until it seems to have lost all meaning. The most minor tumult, the smallest change, and immediately we pronounce the word.  And so when the real thing arrives, with tyranny and blood, with masses striving for freedom, with an ancient regime destroyed and a new one born, we might just fail to see its significance. The spark that began the revolution was something called Europe: a trade agreement with the European Union that many Ukrainians saw as a chance to enter a world of free trade rather than government syndicates, and the rule of law rather than overwhelming corruption.  When President Viktor Yanukovych, after months of promised, rejected the deal in November, Ukrainians protested. The students were the first to reach the ""Maidan,"" the main square of Kiev.  They are the ones who already considered themselves Europeans, and took a European future for granted.  After the riot police were sent to beat them, they were joined by the ""Afghans,"" the veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Then came the businessmen, the professionals, the people who had hoped to make an honest living, but found themselves thwarted by unpredictable taxes and corruption.  In December, hundreds of thousands of people, from all parts of the country and all walks of life, were on the streets. Then Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared with a proposal.  Why not take 15 billion euros from Russia instead of playing around with Europe? Although the Russian side promised that the loan was without conditions, Russian leaders then explained that disbursements could only follow when political stability had been established. In January, President Yanukovych formally did away with basic freedoms.  A package of legislation introduced by a pro-Russian legislator and rushed illegally through parliament introduced a number of laws that closely resembled Russian models. Ukrainians reacted as Americans would if the Bill of Rights one day disappeared. After weeks of peacefully tolerating beatings, torture and disappearances, some of the protesters took the fight to the police.  Once again Moscow made clear that the next tranche of the loan would depend upon political stability.  Last week a truce was declared, and a day of mourning announced for the protesters who died.  On the day of mourning, the Ukrainian government mounted snipers on rooftops.  They shot dozens more protesters dead. The Ukrainian protesters did not do what most of us would have done.  They did not run away.  Instead they came in ever greater numbers.  They did not react with a bloody counterattack, as well they might have.  They simply, and amazingly, built their barricades, stood their ground and said they would give their lives for their freedom.  At this point, the world began to react -- finally.  The Polish and German foreign ministers arrived to negotiate the transition that many people had wanted for weeks: a weakening of the Yanukovych's power and accelerated elections. 'We were trapped': Eyewitness to the massacre in Kiev . This was far more than protesters could have expected before the mass killing, but far less than they wanted afterward.  The compromise agreement specified that both sides would cease violence. Yanukovych's police seemed to understand what he did not: that this meant the end of his rule.  They disappeared from the fight, and ceased to protect him. Yanukovych disappeared.  Parliament convened, and in these last few days began a very thorough reform of the entire political system. On Saturday the protesters gathered again in the hundreds of thousands to mourn their dead and to celebrate what they had achieved.  Ukraine is now once again a parliamentary democracy, with presidential elections scheduled for May, and an alert population preserving the peace and watchful of its own newfound rights. What happened in Ukraine had little to do with the outside world.  Yet what happens next will. Ukraine's previous authorities were among the most corrupt imaginable.  Yanukovych's son, a dentist, earned at least $200 million in the last two years.  Yanukovych sat on a toilet of gold (or two, actually) in the extraordinary mansion he has had to abandon. The state, unsurprisingly, is close to bankruptcy.  Russia has exercised influence in Ukraine by promising cash: The promise of 15 billion euros preceded the dictatorship laws, the promise of the release of a 2 billion tranche preceded the mass shootings.  This sort of conditionality is what caused the revolution.  Something else is called for now. The Ukrainian revolution took place without outside help.  Indeed, the men and women of the Maidan, although they want their country inside the West, were extremely disappointed with Western inaction during their revolution. Now Western financial aid will be needed to transform that revolution into stability. The International Monetary Fund has promised loans, but this is not enough.  People who risked death for the values we all claim to treasure, people who have brought a major nation back from dictatorship and to democracy deserve more than loans that will require immediate economic austerity. They need very significant European and American financial support.  This could include loans, quick free trade negotiations, financial institutions that offer microcredits, and visa-free travel for normal Ukrainians -- not just the billionaires. Ukrainian oligarchs have parked hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in Western banks: some of it, just possibly, illegally.  Such accounts could be investigated promptly.  Direct financial assistance would have to be conditional upon further reforms that ensure the restoration and the preservation of the rule of law. This is not some idle choice.  The Ukrainian revolution, like any revolution, can fail.  There are plenty of Ukrainians who are confused by the revolution or oppose it, and are waiting to see what the new government will bring. Although the European Union, the United States, and China have recognized Ukraine's new authorities, Russia has not. Russian propaganda characterizes Ukrainian activists (depending on its purpose and intended audience) as fascists, terrorists, or gays. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has claimed, without any evidence, that Russian citizens in Ukraine are under threat.  That is the classical justification for intervention. Russian parliamentarians are now in Crimea, promising Russian citizenship to ethnic Russians there and suggesting that Russia will support a referendum on the detachment of Crimea from Ukraine and its attachment to Russia. On the other side, among the revolutionaries are radicals who may not be satisfied by the compromises that end any revolution.  Their main motivation was the end of Moscow's influence in Ukraine, and so they can be provoked.  Compromise will be possible in a state that is financially stable.  In one that is not, Russian policy might provoke nationalists, and conflict can begin again. The cause of the Ukrainian protesters was not to change the world, but only to change their world.  What they wanted was normality, predictability, the ability to live their lives the way they chose. They wanted, in other words, the things that most of us take for granted.  But now that their revolution has come, the world faces certain important choices.  If we don't understand the revolution in Ukraine, then we miss something special and unusual: a chance to support democracy.","Timothy Snyder: We're witnessing an extraordinary event, a revolution in Ukraine .

"Crowded by sign-wielding supporters, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich made what's expected to be his final speech before he heads to Colorado to start a 14-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction. ""This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do,"" he told the crowd. ""But this is the law and we follow the law."" Blagojevich was convicted of corruption in June 2011 after a jury returned 17 guilty verdicts against him. Among other allegations, he was accused of trying to profit as he considered whom to appoint to take Barack Obama's open Senate seat. Blagojevich called his impending prison stint a ""dark and hard journey,"" and said he should have been more humble. ""We are so grateful and will never ever forget your kindness to us,"" he told the crowd, which occasionally chanted slogans such as ""Free our Governor."" His wife, Patti, remained cinched under his arm, squeezing back tears as the former governor spoke outside his Chicago home. ""This, as bad as it is, is part of a long and hard journey that will only get worse before it gets better,"" Blagojevich said, telling his wife that he loved her. His prison stint begins Thursday. ""Governor Blagojevich has always stood up and stood tall. He hasn't hid. And he has truly enjoyed being out in public. He never considered 'sneaking' out of Chicago and miss an opportunity to say goodbye,"" his spokesman Glenn Selig said earlier. ""It's difficult to put into words the challenges he and his family now face. But he draws strength from the incredible support he continues to receive from the people of Illinois and beyond."" Blagojevich's past statements have been noteworthy for their bluster, such as a defiant news conference in April 2010 when he called his accusers ""liars"" and ""cowards"" and directly challenged a prosecutor. Blagojevich also accused U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald of hiding taped evidence that would prove his innocence during that news conference. ""I challenge Mr. Fitzgerald... Why don't you show up in court tomorrow and explain to everybody, explain to the whole world why you don't want the tapes that you made played in court?"" Blagojevich said to reporters at the time. ""I'll be in court tomorrow. I hope you're man enough to show up,"" he added, referring to Fitzgerald. Prosecutors said court-authorized wiretaps caught Blagojevich offering Obama's Senate seat in exchange for personal gain, including a job with a nonprofit or union organization, corporate board posts for his wife, campaign contributions or a post in Obama's administration. He expressed frustration, according to prosecutors, that Obama transition officials were ""not willing to give me anything except appreciation."" ""I've got this thing and it's (expletive) golden, and, uh, uh, I'm just not giving it up for (expletive) nothing. I'm not gonna do it,"" prosecutors quoted Blagojevich as saying. Blagojevich also considered appointing himself to the post, mulling whether he might be better off being indicted as a senator rather than governor, and saying contacts he would make in the federal job would benefit him later, according to prosecutors. Aside from the charges of trying to sell the Senate seat, prosecutors also accused Blagojevich of using his position to obtain financial benefits for himself, his family and his campaign in exchange for jobs, contracts and appointments to state boards to supporters. They accused Blagojevich of accelerating the scheme in 2008 to accumulate funds before a new state ethics law would have limited his ability to raise money from people and companies that were doing business with the state. Despite months of professing his innocence in impromptu news conferences, on Twitter and even on Donald Trump's show ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" the ousted Illinois governor did not take the stand in his own defense during his trial.","Former Illinois Gov.

"A decorated U.S. soldier who died while unsuccessfully trying to rescue his daughters from their burning North Carolina home was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. The funeral took place, as scheduled, in the early morning, said cemetery spokeswoman Jennifer Lynch. Chief Warrant Officer II Edward Duane Cantrell, 36, was a member of the 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg. The Green Beret had returned in August from his latest overseas deployment. His wife, Louise, told officials the family was upstairs when the fire broke out just before 2 a.m. March 5 in Hope Mills, a suburb of Fayetteville. She jumped from a second-floor window and ran next door to call for help while her husband went to get  6-year-old Isabella and 4-year-old Natalia, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said. ""They never made it out,"" said Debbie Tanna, spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office. Officials believe the family's century-old home had tinderbox conditions that led to ""a very intense fire."" Military officials said the Fort Bragg soldier had completed six deployments, including one to Iraq and five to Afghanistan. He had four Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart for his service, according to the Army Special Operations Command. Cantrell was honored with a military funeral at the cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. ""That was his wishes,"" said Lt. April Olsen of U.S. Army Special Forces Command.

"Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmarese opposition leader, said her country's present constitution ""does not conform"" with democratic norms and it should be changed where needed. Myanmar state television broadcast for the first time an election campaign speech by the pro-democracy leader, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who was under house arrest for years until she was freed more than a year ago. Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, will participate in by-elections on April 1 after boycotting previous elections. She has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies. In her speech, she decried restricting freedom of speech and choice and fostering fear and instability in people's lives. She called for respect of the rule of law. ""As long as freedom of movement and human rights are not fully achieved,"" democracy will not prevail, she said. She called for improvements in education, health care, agriculture and the lives of workers and younger people. Suu Kyi has said that she would change the configuration of the parliament in which 25% of seats help the military establishment. She cited the presence of those nonelected officials in Wednesday's speech. The country's election commission removed a passage from her speech because it didn't conform with current election law, Suu Kyi told a freelance reporter for CNN. Earlier, Nyan Win, a National League for Democracy spokesman, said the passage that was removed in advance criticized the previous situation in Myanmar concerning freedom of speech and access to information. The international community has applauded recent political reforms in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals have begun loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. The authorities released Suu Kyi from house arrest in November 2010. She registered last month to run for a parliamentary seat in Kawhmu after the regime agreed to negotiate with an ethnic rebel group and pardoned hundreds of political prisoners. Her televised speech Wednesday is a result of Myanmar's electoral law, which requires that each political party receive appropriate time to broadcast its manifesto. The National League for Democracy submitted candidates for all 47 seats up for grabs in the April by-elections.","Myanmar's opposition leader urges education and health care improvements .

"This week President Obama did a swing through some college campuses talking about student loan debt. The immediate issue is the 3.4% interest rate on federal student loans. It's set to double July 1 unless Congress acts. Keeping the rate low in this still weak economy is, as the president said, a no-brainer. Even his opponent Mitt Romney has endorsed it. But the larger problem -- mounting college costs and a cumulative $1 trillion in student loan debt — remains untouched. Some recent polls have shown that support for Obama among young voters, once Obama's enthusiastic fans, may be waning in this election compared with four years ago. Student loans are seen by some as the president's chosen key to regaining their hearts. But really, the issue has been raised for him by the Occupy movement, gearing up this May 1 with a new set of actions focusing on the cost of college and the depredations of the student loan industry. Additionally, almost 700,000 people have signed a petition  sponsored by MoveOn.org for student loan forgiveness, started by lawyer and student-loan debtor Robert Applebaum. And the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012, introduced by U.S. Rep. Hansen Clarke, D-Michigan, last month, is aimed at offering relief. What's at stake here is the basic equation of the American dream: Hard work plus merit equals opportunity. As usually happens, hard times have led to cuts in support to public education and attendant tuition hikes. Young people are graduating into a dismal job market with an average of more than $25,000 in debt. Loan default rates were up sharply last year, and many graduates are questioning the value of their education. In eight years of covering and advocating for student debtors, I've never seen such a level of public outcry. The president and his Department of Education deserve credit for keeping the heat on student loan and college cost issues, and not just at campaign time. Their most important move was probably the government takeover of the student loan market. As of July 1, 2010, all federally subsidized student loans — about 80% of the total — have been originated by the Department of Education. The deal ended billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies to lenders like Sallie Mae and, in theory at least, empowered the government to set repayment terms friendlier to student lenders. Unfortunately, the measures proposed so far -- freezing interest rates, income-based repayment and public service loan forgiveness -- haven't gone far enough to improve the lot of students and recent grads. There are indications that the specialized repayment programs, designed to make loans cheaper for low earners and those employed by the government or nonprofits, are undersubscribed because of red tape and a lack of publicity. There is a simpler way to cut the Gordian knot of rising debt and college costs, one that would help desperate graduates in the short term and lower the cost of college in the long term. The answer is bankruptcy relief for both federal and private student loans. Since 1998, federally subsidized student loans have been non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, except in rare cases involving permanent disability or death. Since 2005, even private, unsubsidized student loans -- the fastest-growing, highest-cost type of student loan, tantamount to putting college on your credit card -- have been immune to bankruptcy claims, as well. Without bankruptcy, lenders have little interest in negotiating. Falling behind on your loans can spiral into a hellish decades-long nightmare of interest rates and penalties soaring many times beyond the original sum. For federal borrowers, the government can garnish your wages without taking you to court, seize tax refunds and even Social Security. Allowing anyone who faces unreasonable student loan sums compared with their income to seek relief through the courts, as we do with every other kind of debt, would end the horror stories. It would also likely have several ripple effects. Private loans would decrease, and the federal government, facing a potential liability of $100 billion a year, would have a reason to get more serious about college costs and productivity. This could lead to, among other things, an expansion of the gainful employment rule, which sanctions schools that prepare very few of their students to be solvent. In the long run, we'd probably see more innovative low-cost learning alternatives, such as the free online courses being offered by Stanford, Princeton, and MIT professors through the new ventures Udacity, Coursera, and MITx. Bankruptcy relief on student loans isn't just fair, it's the first step to a more functional market in higher education.","The interest rate on student loans will soon double unless Congress acts .

"Women face shocking disparities when buying health insurance on the individual market: In the vast majority of states, nearly all the best-selling plans charge women more than men for the same coverage, a discriminatory practice known as ""gender rating."" New research by the National Women's Law Center released Monday shows that, in states that have not banned gender rating, 92% of the top plans charge women more -- despite the fact that the vast majority of them do not cover maternity services. This indefensible practice will not abate until the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented in 2014. The practice of gender rating costs women about $1 billion a year, based on average  advertised premiums and the most recent data on the number of women in the individual market. For a woman in Texas struggling to get by on a low-wage job, pay for child care, and make the rent, being forced to pay an extra $646 a year in premiums because she is a woman can be an insurmountable hurdle. In Florida, women pay as much as $1,141 extra per year in premiums. Even smaller disparities in premiums can take a toll on women year after year. On top of that, women may be required to pay extra for inadequate maternity coverage, or pay the full cost of maternity care itself, which averages $9,600 for an uncomplicated delivery. The discrimination is so pronounced and the practice so arbitrary that in most states, women who do not smoke are often charged more than men who do smoke. For example, the center found that 56% of best-selling plans charge a 40-year-old woman who does not smoke more than a 40-year-old man who does. Only nine states require insurers on the individual market to provide maternity coverage. In states where maternity coverage is not mandated, a shocking 94% of health plans available to a 30-year-old woman do not provide such coverage. And in 25 states, not a single insurance plan on the individual market covers maternity services. To add insult to injury, women who have been survivors of domestic violence or who have had Caesarian sections -- so-called ""pre-existing conditions"" -- can be denied coverage.  Peggy Robertson of Colorado, with whom I testified at a Senate hearing in 2009, told senators that because of her previous C-section, an insurer told her she could only obtain coverage if she were sterilized. My organization has been researching the disparities that women face in this insurance market for  years. In 2008, 93% of best-selling individual plans charged women higher premiums. Today, it's 92%. Clearly, it's not changing, and insurance companies will continue to dig in their heels and discriminate until the law forces them to change. Only 14 states have limited or banned gender rating on the individual market, including, most recently, California, Colorado, and New Mexico. But this problem is clearly not going away by itself. This national problem demands a national solution and, fortunately, we have one in the Affordable Care Act. That's one reason why the National Women's Law Center has launched a campaign to educate women about the benefits of the health care law, including the end of insurance discrimination. The center's new campaign, I Will Not Be Denied™, tells women about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and engages them to fight to protect the law. On Monday, the center released a video of intimate portraits of women on the campaign's website. More than 30 organizations have joined the campaign, from women's organizations to health care advocacy groups to those representing physicians and other health care providers. The  Affordable Care Act is so important to women's health. It bans pre-existing condition exclusions, prohibits gender rating and other forms of sex discrimination in health care, guarantees maternity coverage for all, and ensures that new plans cover recommended preventive care -- such as birth control, without co-payments or deductibles. As we've seen recently in the debate over access to birth control, the promise of expanded access to affordable health care for women only comes with the force of law behind it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated advances in contraception as one of the 10 most important developments in health care of the 20th century, reducing both maternal and infant mortality. Under the  Affordable Care Act, millions more women are already getting preventive services like mammograms, Pap smears and colonoscopies without a co-pay, and later this year, millions more will have access to well-woman exams, screening for domestic violence -- and birth control without a co-pay or deductible. The  Affordable Care Act  is under attack in Congress and is being challenged in the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments on Monday in the health care litigation.  The obstacles women face in gaining access to insurance and health care take an acute economic toll on them, as our report shows, and on the U.S. economy as a whole. Women have a tremendous stake in the outcome of these cases.  Women are more likely than men to forgo preventive care if it's too expensive, to be under-insured and to report problems paying medical bills.  For these reasons, the center submitted an amicus brief on behalf of 60 organizations to the Supreme Court, as we did in four previous Courts of Appeal cases, setting out what's at stake for women in the Affordable Care Act and the health care litigation. The Affordable Care Act is one of the most significant advances for women in our nation's history. This is no time to enable discrimination to continue and even turn back the clock on women's health.","Marcia Greenberg:  92% of the top health insurance plans charge women more than men .

"For the third time in less than 24 hours, F-16 fighter jets were scrambled Thursday to escort a hapless pilot out of a restricted area in place for President Obama's visit to Los Angeles. Fighter jets intercepted a single-engine Cherokee Piper around 9:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) minutes after intercepting a Cessna for the same violation. Hours earlier, fighter jets intercepted a single-engine airplane northwest of Los Angeles for breaching a temporary airspace restriction, according to a military news release. The Federal Aviation Administration investigates all violations of restricted airspace, and FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer told CNN the agency is investigating the three cases over Los Angeles. Pilots refer to the area off limits to general aviation as a ""temporary flight restriction"" or TFR. The FAA keeps an up-to-date list of restricted airspace on its website, something pilots are supposed to check prior to departure. The penalties for violating restricted airspace can be severe according to the FAA. Pilots face possible suspension or loss of their pilot's license. Not all aircraft are equal when it comes to restricted air space. Commercial flights are in contact with the FAA during their flights and have a flight plan, so they're allowed to fly into and out of the cordoned-off area, according to the FAA. Police helicopters and air ambulance aircraft are also permitted in the no-fly zone. Flight restriction orders are usually put in place surrounding stadiums during large sporting events, scenes of natural disasters and areas around the president's movements. Currently there are 49 TFRs over airspace in the U.S. according to the FAA's website, including one restriction that's been in place since 2008 over Mt. Kilauea in Hawaii, an active volcano.","The area off limits to general aviation is called a ""temporary flight restriction"" or TFR .

"New York (CNN) -- Walter Cronkite was not the best educated or the best dressed or even the best looking of the generation of World War II correspondents who dominated the early days of television news. His wife once told Parade magazine that he looked, in a way, like your family dentist, which was not all that surprising since his father and his grandfather were dentists. Yet Cronkite was picked in 1962 to anchor the ""CBS Evening News,"" and for two of the most tumultuous decades in American history, he was the authoritative voice of news in America, the man who told viewers that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated, that men had walked on the moon and that the Vietnam War couldn't be won. Douglas Brinkley, the historian whose new book ""Cronkite"" tells the newsman's life story, said in an interview with CNN last week that the Missouri-born reporter got picked for the CBS anchor job ""because of his work ethic [and] steady-Eddie appearance -- there was nothing dapper or elite about him. He spoke with a heartland cadence, and his timing was impeccable because he got most famous by doing John Glenn's three suborbits of the Earth -- that was early 1962 and by April of '62, he was a household name."" Cronkite got off to a somewhat rocky start on the ""CBS Evening News With Walter Cronkite"" when he closed the first broadcast, then only 15 minutes long, saying: ""That's the news. Be sure to check your local newspapers tomorrow to get all of the details on the headlines we're delivering to you."" Brinkley writes that CBS executives were angry that their anchorman was sending viewers to competitors for in-depth news. The next year, CBS was the first network to expand its nightly news to half an hour, a change that Brinkley says enabled Cronkite to get beyond the top headlines and start to set an agenda for news coverage of complex issues. In an era when television news was the province of the Big Three broadcast networks and cable news hadn't been invented yet, the anchor chair at CBS was an especially influential platform. 1968 provided a remarkable sign of that. ""1968 is one of the most talked about years in U.S. history because of all the upheaval, and Cronkite plays a central role in that year, right out of the gate,"" Brinkley said. ""He goes to Vietnam in January, early February of '68. By February 27, he calls the war a stalemate. He then goes and urges Robert Kennedy to run for president, then [President Lyndon] Johnson says he won't seek re-election. Then you have the assassinations of Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Bobby Kennedy, which Cronkite covers. And then you've got the conventions, and famously in Chicago, where Cronkite's calling Mayor Daley's police 'thugs' and then [Richard] Nixon winning in that strange three-way election with Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace. ""And then at the end of the year,"" Brinkley added, the world saw ""the first real great color photographs of planet Earth from space, and astronauts [were] named men of the year by Time magazine when Cronkite was the leading voice of space. Walter Cronkite was all over everything in that seminal year, 1968. From that point on, his persona just kept growing and growing."" Brinkley dedicates his book in part to the late David Halberstam, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author who he says suggested the idea of writing Cronkite's biography. His research was aided by the opening of the Cronkite papers at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas in Austin and interviews with members of the Cronkite generation of journalists, including the late Andy Rooney and Ed Bradley. ""Since the passing of Walter Cronkite in 2009, he's become a part of history, he's no longer an anchorman or a celebrity but somebody that we can reflect on and understand for his journalistic accomplishment,"" Brinkley said. In Brinkley's account, Cronkite didn't equal the investigative zeal of the pioneering radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow, with whom his relationship was at times strained. Yet if Cronkite didn't reach the emotional peaks of some of Murrow's reports, he still connected with the television viewer in a direct way. ""Everybody liked Walter Cronkite,"" Brinkley said. ""He had a voice that everybody recognized. It's like hearing Bob Dylan sing a song. ... In five seconds everybody in America knows who's talking. That's important for a broadcaster."" ""And then Cronkite slowed down his cadence, didn't rush his points. He also knew when to make the pregnant pause, when to be silent in special events. There was great anticipation: What will Walter Cronkite say when Neil Armstrong steps on the moon? And Cronkite simply says, 'By golly, I'm speechless,' and that was better than having a contrived line."" In 1968, after the Tet Offensive, Cronkite set the agenda for coverage of the Vietnam War. ""Cronkite got up from his anchor desk, and flew to Vietnam, and put on a helmet and flak jacket, and interviewed anybody and everybody he could,"" Brinkley said. ""I was able to read his notebooks, his reporter's notebooks, asking himself questions and talking to people, collecting facts. He came home with the very strong conclusion that war was unwinnable and that at best it would be a stalemate. And there were people on the left saying that and even great New York Times reporters saying it, but to be Walter Cronkite and be telling people that the war was at best a stalemate, it had a transformative effect on the country. People asked that old question, 'What, am I sending my son to die in a stalemate?' "" He played a similar role in helping power the environmental movement. Brinkley said that Cronkite ""was instrumental in the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency because he created a segment [which aired] night after night called 'Can we save the planet?' which would show rivers on fire and industrial pollution and clear cutting, in color on TV. ""Cronkite sent television crews to cover the first Earth Day, and treated it as a giant event, television-worthy of an Apollo mission. So when Cronkite started really banging the drum on the environment it had an impact."" As described in ""Cronkite,"" the anchorman comes across as a more complicated figure than many of his viewers could have seen. It was only after his retirement from the CBS anchor chair in 1981 that he gave full rein to his strongly liberal views: Brinkley refers to a 1988 speech that ""planted him firmly in liberal-left soil. The charade of being Mr. Center was over."" His journalistic ethics weren't always stellar -- in the early 1970s, Brinkley writes, ""Cronkite cut a deal with Pan Am airlines to fly the entire family to a series of international vacation spots."" His bosses objected, but as one network staffer noted, ""Walter was the eight-hundred-pound gorilla in the CBS room. You couldn't fire him."" The reason was his popularity with viewers. Brinkley noted that it's especially difficult to come across as relaxed and comfortable, as if you're in your living room, when you're really in a cavernous television studio, with equipment and wires everywhere. ""Cronkite was able to seem comfortable and real,"" Brinkley said. The author attributes Cronkite's success to spending much of the early days of television, in the 1950s, in a wide variety of roles on programs, including game shows. ""So when he caught his groove, it was as natural to him as breathing, being on the air. And he seldom said a wrong thing. He had very few retractions. And he never tried to break news first, he tried to break it right."" As an old wire service reporter, Cronkite wanted to get a story from United Press International or the Associated Press before he would report breaking news on the air. ""In that way, he was sort of playing like the tortoise for a long career. Because you could go up in flames. One really bad report, one presentation of bogus information, could destroy an on-air personality's career.""","Douglas Brinkley's new book is a full biography of Walter Cronkite .

"A controversial film about an African warlord and his army has spread to the far corners of the internet, racking up more than 70 million YouTube views and prompting a heated debate about the filmmakers and the effectiveness of their advocacy. While its supporters say ""KONY 2012"" has raised much-needed awareness about Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, critics say the film is inaccurate, oversimplified, and distracting from more effective charity work in Uganda. Questions have also been raised about the intentions and transparency of Invisible Children, the group behind the film, and its founders say they are releasing a new film to respond to the criticism. What is ""KONY 2012""? ""KONY 2012"" is a half-hour video campaign about Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, the leader of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army, and alleged atrocities his army has committed since the 1980s, including the killing and disfiguring of villagers, forcing children to become soldiers, and forcing girls into sexual slavery. The film features a former Ugandan child soldier and highlights the plight of children there, contrasting their lives with the director's own young child in America and pushing the notion that the Western world can stop Kony's reign of terror. Its makers say the film ""aims to make Joseph Kony famous, not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice."" Who made ""KONY 2012""? The film was produced by Invisible Children, a San Diego-based nonprofit activist group founded by three filmmakers whose goal is to raise awareness about Kony's LRA and stop what it calls the longest-running armed conflict in Africa. The group also made a film in 2005 about the LRA called ""Invisible Children: Rough Cut,"" and has put pressure on both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations to take a side in the fight between the LRA and the Ugandan government, according to a 2011 story in Foreign Affairs. The group says it has built schools in Uganda and operates a high-frequency radio station that broadcasts anti-LRA messages to fighters urging them to defect. Invisible Children has been criticized for everything from how the group made ""Kony 2012"" to how it spends its money. Is the film accurate? Critics say ""KONY 2012"" manipulates the facts and ignores the Ugandan military's own rights abuses in its war with the LRA. A 2011 Foreign Affairs story accused Invisible Children of ""exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders and emphasizing the LRA's use of innocent children as soldiers."" And in a Foreign Policy blog post, journalist Michael Wilkerson wrote: ""But let's get two things straight: 1) Joseph Kony is not in Uganda and hasn't been for 6 years; 2) the LRA now numbers at most in the hundreds."" CNN's Christiane Amanpour says the constant pursuit of Kony, long the International Criminal Court's most wanted man, means he is now largely a ""spent force"" in Uganda. ""His crimes against these children were committed largely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and because people have been going after him he's actually considered to be much more of a threat now in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" she said. The filmmakers have also drawn heavy fire for a 2008 photo showing the founders holding AK-47s and RPGs while posing with members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has itself been accused of widespread human rights abuses during its decades-long conflict with the government of Sudan. Is Invisible Children wasting donors' money? While critics say that far too little of Invisible Children's money actually makes it to the Ugandans who need it the most, the group claims its mission is misunderstood. Only 32% of the money Invisible Children spent last year went to direct services, according to the group's financial statement, with much of the rest going toward the production of film, travel costs and staff salaries. Co-founder and film narrator Jason Russell told CNN's Piers Morgan that the group is not a traditional on-the-ground development charity. ""We are not an organization that does amazing work on the ground -- if you want to fund a cow or help someone in a village ... that's only a third of what we do,"" said Russell. ""We work outside the traditional box of what you think about charity,"" he told CNN. ""We have three Ms: the movie, which is going viral ... the movement, which is actual volunteers around the world ... and the mission -- to stop Kony and rehab the war-affected children through education, reintegration and building jobs for the community."" Independent charity evaluator Charity Navigator gave Invisible Children an overall rating of three out of four stars, but just two stars for ""accountability and transparency"" -- a fact the group attributes to not having five independent voting members on its board of directors. In a statement, the group wrote: ""We are in the process of interviewing potential board members, and we will add an additional independent member this year in order to regain our 4-star rating by 2013."" Is the film doing more harm than good? Critics say ""KONY 2012"" will draw resources away from more effective charity organizations while reinforcing the idea that Africans are helpless and that Westerners must intervene to save them. ""Campaigns that focus on bracelets and social media absorb resources that could go toward more effective advocacy,"" write Amanda Taub and Kate Cronin-Furman in current affairs magazine, The Atlantic. ""Treating awareness as a goal in and of itself risks compassion fatigue -- most people only have so much time and energy to devote to far-away causes -- and ultimately squanders political momentum that could be used to push for effective solutions."" While some Ugandans appreciate the attention being put on Kony, CNN's David McKenzie says the group hasn't posed a real threat to Uganda for several years. ""Nice message .... 15 years too late,"" one Ugandan military official told McKenzie. Despite the negative attention heaped on Invisible Children, CNN's Amanpour says that any raised awareness of Kony and his crimes is a net positive. ""What's really important is that [the film] will not just sensitize people about war criminals like Kony, but try to get society onboard to pressure their government to do something about these atrocities.""","""KONY 2012"" racks up more than 70 million YouTube views .

"Twenty-five percent of 800 tested sunscreens are effective at protecting your skin without the use of potentially harmful ingredients, according to the 2012 Sunscreen Guide released Wednesday by the Environmental Working Group. ""The results are slightly better than previous years, but it continues to surprise us that we can recommend such few products,"" said Nneka Leiba, an Environmental Working Group senior analyst. To make the watchdog group's safe list, sunscreens must be free of oxybenzone, retinyl palmitate (a type of vitamin A), not have SPF above 50 and protect against UVA and UVB sunrays. Toxic ingredients? The Environmental Working Group says 56% of beach and sport sunscreens contain the chemical oxybenzone. The primary function of oxybenzone is to absorb ultraviolet light, but some research shows oxybenzone can be absorbed through the skin. The Environmental Working Group and other toxicology experts believe that oxybenzone is linked to hormone disruption and potentially to cell damage that may lead to skin cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology says oxybenzone is safe. ""Oxybenzone is one of the few FDA-approved ingredients that provides effective broad spectrum protection from UV radiation, and has been approved for use since 1978,"" said Dr. Daniel M. Siegel, president of the academy. The Food and Drug Administration has approved oxybenzone in sunscreen for use on children older than 6 months. ""We will continue to push for better options every year. We're trying to fill the gap where the FDA has failed,""  said Leiba. The Environmental Working Group also warns consumers to avoid retinyl palminate. Government-funded studies have found that this particular type of vitamin A may increase risk of skin cancer when used on sun-exposed skin. However, these reports have been in mice and evidence has been inconclusive for humans. ""Consumers get frustrated when there are no alternatives, but the point of this is that you don't have to be completely disheartened, because there are products on the market that don't contain these chemicals,"" said Leiba. The Environmental Working Group report found that fewer sunscreens - about 25% - contain retinyl palmitate, compared to 33% in last year's study. The Environmental Working Group says this ingredient does not make sunscreen more effective, and until definitive research is available, consumers should avoid sunscreen products containing retinyl palminate. Broad spectrum . Most dermatologists agree with the Environmental Working Group's recommendation that consumers use products labeled broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means the product protects against both UVB rays that cause sunburns and also UVA radiation that causes premature skin damage and aging. ""Evidence has shown the best sunscreens are the ones that block UVB and UVA,"" said Dr. Ariel Ostad, a clinical assistant professor in the department of dermatology at New York University Medical Center, and not affiliated with the Environmental Working Group report. ""The majority of these companies that market sunscreen products, they try to make people more aware of the SPF."" Last year, the FDA announced tighter regulations on how manufacturers label products. The changes, aimed to cut down on consumer confusion, require sunscreen labels to identify if they provide broad spectrum coverage on the front label.  Brands also won't be able to claim products as sweat-proof or waterproof. However, don't expect to see these changes on store shelves this summer. Last week the FDA announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements.  Look for the new labeling in December. Numbers game . The Environmental Working Group said consumers should not purchase sunscreens with SPF greater than 50.  SPF (sun protection factor) works by absorbing, reflecting or scattering the sun's rays on the skin. ""It is very misleading to put high SPF numbers on labels because it gives consumers a false sense of security and doesn't offer a lot more protection,""  Leiba said. They are right. While SPF 85 may sound like a lot more protection than SPF 30, the higher the number doesn't always give a high return. Studies show that sunscreen with SPF 15 can block about 93% of all incoming UVB rays. SPF 30 blocks 97%. SPF 50 blocks 98%. ""The protective factors plateau from there. A product with SPF 100+ blocks about 99.1 percent of the UVB rays,"" Ostad said.  ""You don't really need a high number. They end up being expensive and don't offer more protection than SPF 50."" Keep in mind, SPF protects only against UVB rays. Bottom Line . It's easy to get overwhelmed with the sunscreen options on store shelves. Here's a quick guide to find the best products to protect your family from the sun: . --Use a sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 15  and a maximum of SPF 50; . --Make sure labels list UVA and UVB (or broad spectrum protection); . --Avoid products containing oxybenzone and retinyl palminate if you're concerned about potentially toxic chemicals; . --Choose lotions versus spray sunscreens for a more evenly distributed protection. Remember to apply at least 2 ounces of lotion (about a shot glass full) and reapply often. The sun breaks down the ingredients in sunscreen that protect your skin. Experts recommend reapplying every two hours, or after swimming or heavy sweating.","Environmental Working Group tests hundreds of beach and sport sunscreens .
